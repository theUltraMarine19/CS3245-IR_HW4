Kan Ting Chiu J:
1          The accused, Nguyen Tuong Van, appeared before me charged that he:
[O]n the 12
th
 day of December 2002, at or about 3.06 pm, at Changi International Airport Terminal 2, Singapore, did import into Singapore, a controlled drug specified in Class “A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, 2 packets of powdery substance containing not less than 396.2 grams of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and [he has] thereby committed an offence under section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
2          He is an Australian national aged 23 years. On 12 December 2002 he arrived in Singapore from Phnom Penh. At about 7.45pm he was at Boarding Gate C22 of the airport waiting to board a flight to Melbourne. During a routine check, a police officer felt something bulky on his lower back. He was brought to a search room for a thorough search, taking his haversack and business bag with him.
3          In the search room he was asked to remove his jacket and shirt. When that was done, a plastic packet was seen strapped to his lower back with masking tape. At that stage he started crying and tried to hit his head against a wall.
4          Sergeant Teh Kim Leng (“Sgt Teh”), the officer in charge of the security screening unit, was notified. He went to the search room and saw the accused, who appeared to be in distress, holding his head with his hands. When Sgt Teh asked him what was on his back, the accused replied that it was heroin. With the help of Sgt Teh the accused removed the packet from his body. When Sgt Teh asked him if there was anything to declare in his luggage, the accused opened the haversack, took out another packet, and handed it to him.
5          The two packets were subsequently sent for analysis. The packet from the body was found to contain not less than 151.5g of diamorphine and the other packet not less than 244.7g. The analysis results were not disputed.
6          The Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) was then informed of the matter. At 9.10pm CNB officers arrived at the airport and took over the case from the airport police. At about 10.05pm Station Inspector Ng Beng Chin (“SI Ng”) spoke to the accused and recorded a statement from him. SI Ng and the accused appended their signatures to the statement after it was recorded and read back to the accused. The statement read:
Question:      What [is] this?
Answer:       I know it [is] heroin although different colour.
Question:      Number 3 or 4?
Answer:       I don’t know.
Question:      Who asked you to bring?
Answer:       I know him by “Sun”.
Question:      To bring where?
Answer:       Melbourne and someone [will] take from me or maybe Sydney.
Question:      Who will receive the drug at Australia?
Answer:       Someone will recognised [
sic
] me and [tell] me he likes basketball.
7          The CNB officers took the accused together with the two packets and other case exhibits back with them to the CNB Headquarters at Police Cantonment Complex at about 12.05am on 13 December.
8          At about 1.50am, the two packets were weighed. The packet recovered from the accused’s back weighed 381.66g and the packet from his haversack weighed 380.36g.
9          At 4.12am the investigating officer Assistant Superintendent of Police Toh Soon Teck (“ASP Toh”) recorded a cautioned statement from the accused. After the cautioned statement was recorded ASP Toh recorded further statements, which I shall refer to as investigation statements, from the accused. One was recorded on the same day, 13 December, and the others on 15, 16 and 19 December.
10        Defence counsel accepted that these statements were made voluntarily. Nevertheless, it was contended that they are not admissible in evidence.
Admissibility of the cautioned statement
11        This statement was recorded under s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). Sub-sections (6) and (8) thereof are of particular relevance:
(6)        Where any person is charged with an offence or officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it, he shall be served with a notice in writing, which shall be explained to him, to the following effect:
“You have been charged with/informed that you may be prosecuted for —
(set out the charge).
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be done.”
(8)        In subsection (6), “officially informed” means informed by a police officer or any other person charged with the duty of investigating offences or charging offenders.
12        Defence counsel’s argument centred on the admissibility of confessions. Section 17 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) defines “admission” and “confession” as follows:
(1)        An admission is a statement, oral or documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by any of the persons and under the circumstances hereinafter mentioned.
(2)        A confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.
and s 24 provides that:
A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if the making of the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding against him.
This has been construed to mean that confessions not so afflicted are relevant and admissible in evidence.
13        Counsel argued that when the accused said in his cautioned statement:
I wish to say that I am sincerely sorry for the inconvenience to both your country and mine. What I intend to say would be the truth. However knowing the information would have been fabricated by the people who have organised this.
he was not making a confession as defined by s 17 or by the test set out by Lord Guest in 
Anandagoda v The Queen
 
[1962] 1 WLR 817
 at 823–824 that:
The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts. ... The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context inferentially admit guilt?
14        In 
Abdul Rashid v PP
 
[1994] 1 SLR 119
 the Court of Criminal Appeal adopted Lord Guest’s test and added at 129, [29]:
We need only add that, for a statement to amount to a confession, it need not be of a plenary or unqualified nature and can also be of a non-plenary nature, so long as the statement connects the accused in some way with the offence.
15        Counsel went further, and argued that as ASP Toh is a CNB officer and not a police officer, the cautioned statement was not admissible under the CPC as s 122(5) of the CPC stipulates that:
Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person to or in the hearing of any 
police officer of or above the rank of sergeant
 shall be admissible at his trial in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit:
Provided that the court shall refuse to admit such statement or allow it to be used as aforesaid if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.
[emphasis added]
16        This argument overlooks the fact that the purpose of recording a cautioned statement is to get an accused person to respond to a charge after being advised that if there is any fact that he intends to rely on in his defence in court, he should mention it in his cautioned statement, and that if he holds it back till he goes to court, his evidence may be less likely to be believed.
17        A cautioned statement is not intended to be taken with a view to obtain a confession. It is to inform the accused person of the charge he is facing and to get his response to it. The purpose of a cautioned statement is to enable the Prosecution to confront the accused at his trial with questions such as “If this is your defence, why didn’t you disclose it in your cautioned statement?” or “Why did you not say this, but say that instead when you made your cautioned statement?” if the accused presents a defence different from or not disclosed in his cautioned statement. Conversely, the accused can rely on his cautioned statement to show that he has been consistent in his defence from the time he was first charged. It would be a departure from the purpose of recording cautioned statements if a cautioned statement is only admissible as a confession. If, however, the cautioned statement also happens to be a confession, it can be admitted and used as one.
18        The power to record cautioned statements is not limited to police officers. By sub-s (8), other officers charged with the duty of investigating offences or charging offenders also have the authority. Section 32(2)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) provides that where the offence is seizable, an officer of the CNB shall have all the powers of a police officer under the CPC in relation to an investigation into a seizable offence. ASP Toh comes within s 122(8) as a person charged with the duty of investigating offences and charging offenders.
19        Consequently, while I agree with counsel that the accused’s cautioned statement is not a confession, I held that it is admissible in evidence under s 122.
Admissibility of the investigation statements
20        The statements recorded on 13, 15, 16 and 19 December were not recorded under s 122(6) and (8), and as ASP Toh is not a police officer, the admissibility of the statements is not governed by s 122(5) of the CPC which governs the admission of statements made to police officers.
21        The Court of Criminal Appeal held in 
Tan Boon Tat v PP
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1
 at 9–10, [35], that a confession made to a narcotics officer is admissible if it complies with s 24 of the Evidence Act.
22        The recording of the statement of 13 December started at 4.05pm and ended two hours later. The statement reads:
[1]        I am known as “Van” to my friends and family members.
2          Sometime in October this year, I was in need of money. I had to pay a debt which I took to pay for my twin brother, Khoa Nguyen, lawyer fees. I owed about A$20,000 to A$25,000 in total to a friend. My friend is Jonathan Lim, Australia Chinese. He did not press me for payment but I knew he needed the money. There was also an A$12,000 loan which my twin brother took that I needed to repay on his behalf. He only had until the end of this year to pay up that loan. I did not intend to let my twin brother know that I am paying his debt. I had managed only to repay about A$4,000 for a period of 8 to 10 months already but that was just enough to cover for the interests incurred. The A$4,000 was my earnings from my job as a sales marketing executive. My brother’s lawyer’s fees were as a result of one drug case and one affray case he got into about 3 years ago. Since then my brother had been in debts. I had been helping him in the repayment of loans for the entire three years.
3          It was only until October 2002 that I was really desperate as I had been out of work for 4 months and I still have to repay those loans my twin brother incurred as well as paying for house rent and expenses. I rented a house at 66 Brandon Park drive Mulgrave 3150, Melbourne together with 5 other friends. However only “Sok” and I pay for the rent. I need to pay about A$580 a month.
4          As such I started looking around for help. I did not managed to obtain help from anyone. Sometime in the first week of November, a male Chinese known to me as “Tan” contacted me. He asked me whether I was sure I would do something. I told him yes. Then he told me to go to Sydney in one week’s time. He did not tell me what was the purpose for the trip. He just instructed me to go to a hotel called Pacific International when I arrived at Sydney and someone would contact me there. I had earlier asked him for help and told him that I needed quick money. His response to me at that time was he would see what he could do.
5          Sometime in mid November this year, I made a trip to Sydney following “Tan’s” instructions. When I arrived at Pacific International Hotel, one male Vietnamese “Sun” contacted me. He explained to me exactly what I am going to do and asked me if I am going to do it. He told me that I would be carrying a package from Cambodia to Singapore to Melbourne and possibly Sydney. He told me that the package contained “white”. I understood that as heroin. It could have been cocaine. But I do not know if it is heroin or cocaine. However I was quite certain that it contained drugs. I told “Sun” that I would do it. “Sun” then told me to return to the same hotel to look for him before 2 Dec 2002 for the job. “Sun” told me that the deal was confirmed and I would definitely be making the trip to carrying that package. After that I returned to Melbourne.
5          On the 1 Dec 2002, I made the second trip for Sydney to go to hotel Pacific International where I met up with “Sun”. He handed to me a return airfare from Melbourne to Singapore to Phnom Penh. He instructed me to go to Pacific Hotel when I reached Phnom Penh and to go to a restaurant across the road called “Lucky Burger” on the 4
th
 and 5
th
 of Dec 02. Someone was supposed to meet me there.
6          I stayed at Pacific International at Sydney until the 2 Dec 02 where I boarded a Qanta’s Airline during the evening. I arrived in Singapore for transit at about 3.30 am to 4 am on the 3 Dec 02 for about 3 hours. Then I boarded a Silkair airline and arrived at Phnom Penh at about midday.
7          After I alighted from the plane, I took a taxi and checked in at Pacific Hotel. In the afternoon I went travelling around places near my hotel.
8          On the 4
th
 Dec 2002, I went to the “Lucky Burger” restaurant at 3 pm as directed by “Sun” to wait for someone. I waited for about half an hour there and a male Cambodian approached me. He told me to follow him and I did so. He led me to his car and took me somewhere. A man who could speak Vietnamese showed up. He told me to smoke heroin. I refused. He yelled at me but I did not understand what he was shouting about. He then threatened me by saying, “smoke! Or else …”. I was under fear and so I had to smoke heroin.
23        The statement of 15 December reads:
The statement recorded on 13.12.2002 @ 4.05 pm. Paragraph 1 to Paragraph 8 was read back to me in English and I affirmed it to be true and correct.
9          I am now referred to paragraph 8 of my earlier statement. I was then inside a garage shed. There were altogether 3 people there including the man who brought me there. I had never seen them before. The man who spoke Vietnamese did not tell me his name nor did he identify himself in any way. They already had the equipment for consuming heroin prepared on a table. There were an aluminium foil and a rolled-up Cambodian note. The man who brought me there took out from his pocket a plastic containing heroin and a lighter and placed them on the table. He then offered the heroin to me to consume. I hesitated and refused. I got aggressive and told him no. That was when the man who spoke Vietnamese stood up and told me in partial Vietnamese and partial Cambodian language, “f— your mother, smoke or die”. That was when I realised he had a rod in his hand as he hit it hard on a bench. I then knew that I could be killed if I do not follow what they told me to do.
10         I asked the man who spoke Vietnamese how he wanted me to smoke. He then talked to the man who brought me there to prepare for me and he just told me to inhale the smoke using the roll-up note. The man who brought me there then poured the heroin onto the aluminium foil and by using a lighter, he heated the foil from below. When the heroin was heated, smoke was emitted and that was when he told me to inhale the smoke using the rolled-up note.
11         I inhaled the smoke for about 3 to 4 times and then I started to fall sick and vomited. After sometime, I vaguely remembered that I was brought back to the side street of my hotel and dropped off by these people. I went back to my room. I took a shower and fell asleep until the next day.
12         The next day, 5 Dec 2002, I woke up at around 6 am. I went around with a man who I had met on the day I arrived at Phnom Penh. I knew him as “Anh” and I cannot remember his contact number. We met him at the airport while I was walking out. I was then surrounded by illegal taxi drivers. I asked for a taxi driver and that was how I got to know “Anh” who was one of the illegal taxi-drivers. “Anh” had nothing to do with this case. During my stay at Phnom Penh he took good care of me.
13         At about 3 pm, I went back to “Lucky Burger” restaurant and the same thing happened again. The same Cambodia man came to pick me up and we went to the same garage and I was asked to smoke heroin again. This time I did not put up any resistant and I smoked the heroin as I was told. I only inhaled the heroin smoke three times. There was a lot of talking between the Cambodian man and the man who spoke some Vietnamese for some 30 minutes.
14         The Vietnamese speaking man told me to take off my shirt. I asked him why and he told me just take it off. I then took off my shirt. He then took out 2 blocks of substance wrapped in tapes. I did not know what they contained at that point in time. He then took the 2 blocks and placed them on my back. I asked him why he was doing that. He told me that someone would come to see me and prepare everything for me in that manner on the 10 Dec 02. He also told me that that was how the 2 blocks would be positioned and this is the way I was going to bring the package back to Melbourne. I was told to be at “Lucky Burger” at 4 pm on the 10 Dec 02. I then asked what were going to happen between then and the time that someone would meet me. He said, be quiet and keep out of trouble while you were in Phnom Penh. I was then escorted back to my hotel.
15         Back in my hotel room, I decided to go to Vietnam to get away from Phnom Penh. I was too stressed to remain at Phnom Penh. I then went on to make arrangements to travel to Ho Chi Ming City, Vietnam, on the 8 Dec 02. While waiting to leave for Ho Chi Ming, from 5 Dec 02 to 8 Dec 02. I travelled around the city, do some shopping. I also paid some prostitutes for their companionship. I did not have sex with them.
16         On the 7 Dec 02 in the afternoon around 2 pm, I hired a car and it took me to Vietnam. I arrived at the border at about 6 pm. I could not cross over to Vietnam because I was late and the border was already closed. I stayed there at a casino hotel overnight. At about 6.30 am on the 8 Dec 02, I woke up and got ready. At about 7 am, I arrived at the border gate and this time, I managed to cross the border.
17         At about 9 am on the same day, I reached Ho Chi Ming. I spent the rest of the day sightseeing around the city. I checked in a hotel, I cannot recall the name, and stayed there over night.
18         On the 9 Dec 02, I spent the whole day in Ho Chi Ming again. On the 10 Dec 02, I returned to Phnom Penh and arrived at Pacific Hotel in the evening. I was late for the 4 pm appointment at “Lucky Burger”. I decided not to go to “Lucky Burger” restaurant. I went back to my hotel room.
19         The next day, on the 11 Dec 02 at about 3 pm, I went to “Lucky Burger” restaurant. I went there hoping that they would be there. At about 4 pm, the same person who came to pick me up during the first 2 occasions appeared. Again, he asked me to follow him in his car. We arrived at the same garage.
20         At the garage, the man who spoke Vietnamese started scolding me. He asked me if I was a cop or a policeman. I was then stripped and searched. Again, they asked me to smoke heroin. I explained to them it was not a good idea to consume drug before travelling from countries to countries. They accepted that and did not force me any further. They then passed a bag containing a sealer, rolls of plastic, scissors, gloves, Velcro tapes, super glue, handy-knives and some other accessories. There was also an electric coffee blender.
21         The Vietnamese speaking man then instructed me to crush the 2 rocks of heroin using the coffee blender into fine powdery form. As he explained, the man who brought me there brought out 2 rocks of heroin. They are rectangular in shape and white in colour. Each rock was contained inside a plastic bag. The Vietnamese speaking man told me that the person who was supposed to help me strapped the package was gone somewhere else. I told him that he was supposed to solve that problem. That was when I was threatened not to mess things up. No more things were said. He then told me that I would have to strap the package on my own. He told me first to crush both the rock of heroin separately using the coffee blender. He also reminded me not to mix the 2 rocks of heroin at any time. Then I was to seal them inside 2 plastic bags using those things they gave me inside the bag. He then told me to strap the 2 plastic packets of powdered heroin onto my back. He then handed over the bag and warned me not to back out or chicken out again. I asked him if he were sure that the 2 plastic packets of heroin to be strapped to my back and he again warned me not to mess it up as someone would be watching over me.
22         After collecting the 2 rocks of heroin and the bag containing all the tools, I was sent back to my hotel room. When I reached my room, I went left everything inside my room and went to a shop nearby to buy a hammer and a power adapter. The hammer is for breaking the heroin rock into smaller bits so that they could be fitted into the coffee blender. The power adapter is to connect the sealer to a PowerPoint. Then I returned to my hotel room and started preparing the crushing of the rock heroin.
24        The statement of 16 December reads:
The statement recorded on 15.12.2002 @ 3.50 p.m. Paragraph 9 to Paragraph 22 was read back to me in English and I affirmed it to be true and correct.
23         At my hotel room, I took out everything from the bag. I planned in what process I would do to package the two rocks of heroin. I decided that some of the equipment could be used while some could not be used and I separate them apart. I took out one rock of heroin and placed it into a plastic bag and started to break it into smaller pieces using the hammer. It took about an hour or so. After that I placed all the smaller bits into the coffee blender portion by portion. That took about an hour also. Then I poured all the powderise heroin onto a plastic and sealed the plastic using the sealer. I repeated the same process for the second rock of heroin. At the end of that, I had 2 sealed plastic containing powderise heroin. I tried to packed the 2 plastic as slim as possible. But I did not really know how to go about doing that, so I just did what I thought would work. I also realized there were still some small rocks still not powderise. I did not bother to re-do as I was tired to repeat the process again.
24         I then rested and thought of how to strap the 2 plastic package onto my back. I realized that I needed sticky tapes to do it. There was no sticky tapes found inside the bag which the Vietnamese speaking man gave me. There was only a Velcro tape that I was not sure how they wanted me to do it. At about 10 am on the 12 Dec 02, I went to purchase sticky tapes from a shop around the corner near the hotel. I returned after buying 2 types of tapes. One roll is yellow in colour and the other roll is white in color. I am shown tapes seized from my back and I recognized them as the tapes which I bought from the shop near the hotel. (Recorder’s note: Accused was shown Exhibit A1, tapes removed from the plastic packet of heroin used to strap to the accused back)
25         Then I returned to my hotel room and started to strap the 2 plastic packets onto my back. However, I could only managed to strap one plastic packet around my lower back using the yellow tapes that I just bought. The second plastic packet I was unable to reach my upper back on my own. I decided to strap it around my abdomen. I then used the remaining yellow tapes and the white color tapes to secure the 2 plastic packets around my lower back and my abdomen as tight as I could. I then wore my under-garment and also put on my clothing.
26         On the same day, 12 Dec 2002, at about 11 am, I carried my luggage and went downstairs and checked out of the hotel. I reached the airport at about 11.45 am. At the airport twice the security officers there checked me. However they did not discover the 2 packets of heroin strapped on my body. I boarded Silkair flight, MI 622, heading for Singapore at 12.20 pm.
27         During my flight, I started to have difficulties in breathing. I then went to the toilet and removed the package that was strapped to my abdomen. I then placed it into my pants and tugged out my shirt so that it was not obvious to be seen.
28         I went back to my seat and secretly stuffed the package that I took off in the toilet into my back pack. I am now shown a “Haglogs” backpack and I confirmed that this was the backpack which I put the package of heroin into. (Recorder’s note: Accused was shown Exhibit B, a black “Haglogs” haversack).
29         On the same day at about 3.20 pm, I arrived at Changi International Airport Terminal 2 in Singapore. I went to the duty free shop at Terminal 2 and bought a carton of Marlboro Menthol Lights cigarettes. I then went to the smoking room and smoked a cigarette. Then I went took the skytrain to Terminal 1 as I was instructed by the information counter that my flight back to Melbourne was at Terminal 1.
30         At Terminal 1, I bought a $10/- international calling card from the money exchange counter. Then I went to a counter where I collected my boarding pass. I then went straight to the Qantas business class lounge and called my girlfriend, Ameara. I used the phone in the lounge to call my calling card which will connect me to Australia. I spoke to her for about 25 minutes. I merely chit-chatted with her and I did not mention anything about this case to her. She was not aware anything pertaining to this trip which I made to courier heroin back to Melbourne. In fact I did not inform any of my friends or relatives about the purpose of this trip.
31         After I hanged the phone, I then went to the shower room to have a look at my packages. I removed the tapes that were still stuck on the plastic packet that was hidden inside my backpack. I threw the tapes into a rubbish bin inside the shower room. I then place this plastic packet of heroin into the back compartment of the backpack. I did not do anything to the plastic packet of heroin that was strapped to my lower back.
32         After that I went back to the lounge and slept. I woke up at about 7.30 pm and my flight was at 7.40 pm. My flight number was QF 10. I thought that I was late and so I run to gate C22 from the lounge. I took about 5 minutes to run to Gate C22.
33         At the gate C22, I took a good glance to see if anyone was watching. I was looking for the drug syndicate people to see if anyone was really watching over me. However I was not able to tell if I was being watched. So I decided that it was too late to turn back. I was also worried about the safety of my family members as the people in Phnom Penh warned me that the syndicate knew where I lived and warned me not to messed up. I knew that they were implying should I messed it up, they will be looking for me at my house or my family members in Melbourne. I had no choice but to deliver the 2 packets of heroin to someone in Australia.
34         At the metal detector, I placed my backpack and my business bag onto the x-ray machine. Then I walked through the metal detector and as I was crossing, it beeped. At that point in time, I knew I was going to be caught. A police woman told me stand one side so as not to obstruct traffic. She then used a metal detector wand to search me by going up and down my body. The metal detector wand did not beep. She then touched my back, either using her hand or the metal detector wand, and when she reached my lower back, she must have discovered the packet of heroin strapped there. She asked me, “what is this?” I shook my head and said, “No”. She then asked a male colleague to bring me to a room to search me. I requested to bring the backpack and business bag to the room as well, which she allowed.
35         Inside the room, the male officer asked me to put my hands on the wall. I told him, “no need, I will get it for you.” I lifted up my shirt and pulled out the strapped packet on my lower back and gave it to the officer. He asked me what that was and I replied to him, “It’s heroin, sir”. He asked me if I was sure. I told him of course. I also told him that there was more and I went on to retrieve the packet of heroin which I had hidden inside my backpack.
36         I waited inside the room. I was lost in thought at that time. Later a few plain clothes officers came questioned me. They also brought me to another room inside the airport and asked me more questions. One of the officers asked me how much I was being paid and I replied I did not know. He also asked me who I was working for and I said the person I was working for was “sun” and I met him in Sydney. I could not remember the other questions that were posed to me. Later I was brought to another place where I was subjected to a urine test. I was informed that my urine was tested negative. I was surprised that the result was negative. I did not know how long the heroin would stay in my body. After that I was referred to the investigating officer.
37         There was a phone number which I could recall being used by the syndicate on the day that I left Sydney for Singapore. That was on the 3 Dec 02 while I was at Pacific International Hotel in Sydney. I called them at this number and they told me to listen to the message. Then I received a message on my handphone. I could not remember if it was the Nokia Handphone or the Siemens handphone. The message stated, “Checked out now.” The number is 04-14135379. It is a handphone number as it starts with 04. I do not know who was the owner of that mobile number of handphone. However it must be connected to “Sun”. Beside this number, all the other numbers stored inside the two handphones that were seized from me were my friends and they have nothing to do with this case.
38         The Sony laptop that was seized from me belonged to my good friend whom I knew as “Berri”. He is an Indonesian, aged about 20 years old. He is currently studying in Melbourne. I do not know his real name as it was too long to remember and too complicated to pronounce. Berri has no criminal records. I borrowed the laptop from him on the 1 Dec 02 just before I left for Sydney to keep myself entertained while I was on this trip. I also wanted to use it to write letters. I did not use it to record any event that was connected to this case.
39         There were a total of 9 watches found in my luggage. Only one is genuine and that is the black-colour man “Rado” watch which I bought it at A$2,500 back in Melbourne. I used my savings to purchase it on my 21 birthday about 1 year and 3 months ago. The other 8 fake watches were bought in Phnom Penh on 6 Dec 02. I intended to give them to my friends in Australia as Christmas gifts. The 10 belts found inside my luggage were for the same purpose. They cost about A$500/- and I used my own savings to buy them.
40         The amount of cash that were recovered from me comprised of Cambodia, Vietnam, Australia, Singapore and US currency. The total value would not exceed A$100/-. These were left over from the US$1000/- given to me by “Sun”. “Sun” gave me US$1000 for my hotel, food, transport and entertainment expenses for my trip. He handed the money together with the air tickets before I left Sydney for Singapore on the 2 Dec 2002.
41         I was born in Thailand, Sonkha, in a refugee camp in 1980. My mother was a Vietnamese refugee. I did not know who my father was until Nov this year. He came from America to look for my brother and I. I had a twin brother and no other sibling. Shortly after I was born, I followed my mother together with my twin brother and migrated to Australia. I cannot remember much about my childhood. My mother married in 1987 to a Vietnamese Australian. My step-father beat my brother and I quite often. I went to St Joseph Primary School in Springvale, Melbourne when I was about 6 years old. When I was 12 years old, I went to the Mt Waverly Secondary College. I completed secondary school education in 1998 when I was about 18 years old. Then I intended to proceed with my university education at Deakin University. However due to financial difficulties, I started working instead of studying. I worked as storeman, door to door salesman, computer sales and research marketing. Around end 1999, I also set up my own business in Melbourne dealing with computer sales. There was no need for any capital. Shortly after that my twin brother got into trouble with the law and I wind up my business to raise legal fees for him. So I found a sale, research and marketing job and I earned between A$1500 to A$2500 a month depending on how much commission I received. I took long leave since June this year as I was on medication for acne that required 4 months leave.
25        Finally, the statement of 19 December read:
The statement recorded on 16.12.2002 @ 2.22 pm. Paragraph 23 to Paragraph 41 was read back to me in English and I affirmed it to be true and correct.
42         I am now refer to paragraph 4 of my earlier statement. I wish to state that “Tan” were someone whom I often see him hanging around a café called “Puccini” located in the city of Melbourne. I had seen him around in that café since 2 years ago. However, we were mere acquaintance. I do not know his contact number or where he stayed. He knew I needed money urgently as I had spoken to him about. That was why he called me sometime in early November 2002. When “Tan” ask me if I am sure I would do something, he meant that if there was an opportunity would I go for it. At that time I was totally not aware of the nature of that opportunity. At hindsight, “Tan” is acquainted with “Sun”. I am not sure if he knew about the assignment that “Sun” had in store for me.
43         I am referred to my statement recorded on the 13 Dec 2002 at 4.27 am. I wish to clarify that I mean that I would be telling all that I knew about what happened but the information would not be the truth as these were being fabricated by the people who had organized this.
44         During transit in Singapore on the day I flew from Sydney, I met up a friend from Singapore at about 4 am on 3 Dec 2002. I only knew him as “Golgan”. I knew him in Australia where was studying in Melbourne. He can be contacted at 65-92388851. We met at Terminal Two at the exit of the arrival hall. We were together for about 2 hours until I had to check in again. I told him that I was on holidays around the world. I did not tell him anything about my assignment to courier heroin back to Australia. He had nothing to do with this case.
45         I am now referred to paragraph 33 of my earlier statement. I wish to add that I did not know what the syndicate would do to harm my family or myself. I knew for sure that they would be doing something nasty to my family member or myself. Under this circumstance, I really had no choice but to bring the heroin back to Australia to hand over to the syndicate people. If I did not do that, the syndicate people might think that I had chickened out or had cheated them of their goods. It is common that the syndicate would think that way.
46         That is all I had to say.
26        Counsel for the accused acknowledged that no inducement, threat or promise was employed or held out when the four statements were recorded. If the statements had been affected by inducement, threat or promise, they would be inadmissible whether or not they are confessions.
27        Moving on from there, the next issue is whether the statements should be read separately or together, to determine whether they are a confession. Where two statements, A and B, are recorded in the course of investigations, they may be taken to be one statement in two parts or two separate statements. They will be treated as one complete statement where statement B is a follow-up on statement A. Where they are not connected, and relate to different matters, 
eg
 where statement A relates to a charge of drug trafficking, and statement B relates to a charge of illegal entry into Singapore, they may be treated as separate statements.
28        Looking at the four investigation statements, it can be seen that they narrated the events from before the time the accused came to be in the possession of the two packets of heroin to the time of his arrest and each succeeding statement was recorded as a continuation of the preceding one, after the previous statement had been read back to him, with the paragraphs numbered serially.
29        The statements are to be treated as one whole statement for deciding whether it is a confession under s 17(2) of the Evidence Act. On that basis, it is quite clear that it has all the ingredients of a confession, and is admissible under s 24.
Vienna Convention on Consular Relations
30        Defence counsel objected to the admission of the statements on a further ground, that the statements were taken in breach of Art 36(1) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 (“VCCR”). It was submitted that the breach amounted to an illegality and operated unfairly against the accused as he was not advised of his rights and did not have the opportunity to consult with a consular officer until 3.30pm on 13 December, after the cautioned statement was recorded, but before any of the investigation statements were taken. Article 36(1) reads:
With a view to facilitating the exercise of consular functions relating to nationals of the sending State:
a.         consular officers shall be free to communicate with nationals of the sending State and to have access to them. Nationals of the sending State shall have the same freedom with respect to communication with and access to consular officers of the sending State;
b.         if he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if, within its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner. Any communication addressed to the consular post by the person arrested, in prison, custody or detention shall also be forwarded by the said authorities without delay. The said authorities shall inform the person concerned without delay of his rights under this sub-paragraph;
c.         consular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation. They shall also have the right to visit any national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention in their district in pursuance of a judgment. Nevertheless, consular officers shall refrain from taking action on behalf of a national who is in prison, custody or detention if he expressly opposes such action.
31        Although Singapore is not a signatory to the Convention, it was contended that the VCCR applies to Singapore because it is customary international law.
32        The Prosecution’s reply can be summarised as:
(a)        there was no breach of Art 36;
(b)        even if there was, the breach does not entitle the Defence to challenge the admissibility of the statements; and
(c)        Singapore is not a party to the VCCR.
It is silent on whether Art 36(1) is customary international law which applies to Singapore.
33        The VCCR is a key instrument in the regulation and conduct of consular activities. As at 1 January 2000, at least 167 countries were parties to the convention. Luke T Lee in his book 
Consular Law and Practice
 (2nd Ed, 1991) stated at 26:
[T]he conclusion of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in 1963 was undoubtedly the single most important event in the entire history of the consular institution. Indeed, after 1963, there can be no settlement of consular disputes or regulation of consular relations, whether by treaties or national legislation, without reference or recourse to the Vienna Convention.
34        There is an established practice for a state which has arrested a national of another state to notify the consular officers of the state of the accused person. Singapore subscribes to the practice. ASP Toh had notified the Australian High Commission of the arrest of the accused person in compliance with a directive.
35        The directive, which is a part of the standard operation procedures of the CNB, reads:
3          Where a foreign national (hereinafter referred to as the accused) is arrested for other drug offences, the following procedure should be followed:
a          The Investigation Officer (IO) is to verify the nationality of the accused and his current immigration status;
b          The IO is to carry out the preliminary investigation (ie, conducting instant urine test, statement taking, etc);
c          The Head Sector is to inform the resident or non-resident foreign mission concerned, (See sample at Annex B) giving details of the accused (full name, date of birth, passport number), date, place and time of arrest, charges preferred and trial date or place of remand (where applicable).
It is reasonable to infer that the other law enforcement agencies in Singapore would have similar directives.
36        Singapore holds herself out as a responsible member of the international community and conforms with the prevailing norms of the conduct between states. Specifically, the directive suggests the acceptance of the obligations set out in Art 36(1).
37        All this leads me to agree with the defence counsel that Art 36(1) applies in Singapore. The Prosecution, which is in a good position to have knowledge of Singapore’s position on this issue, did not assert the contrary.
38        Was there a breach of Art 36(1)? It was established that a member of the Australian High Commission saw the accused at about 3.30pm on 13 December. The CNB took charge of the investigations at 9.10pm on 12 December, 18hrs 40min before the member of the High Commission met the accused. If one takes the effective starting time as 7.45pm, when the accused was detained by the airport police, the elapsed time was 20hrs 5min. The High Commission must have been notified before 3.30pm, for an official to be instructed, and for him or her to go and see the accused, but no evidence was led to the time of notification. For the present purpose, I will round off the time between arrest and notification to 20 hours.
39        Article 36(1) does not set a time period for notification; it is to be done without delay. Is 20 hours a delay? Reference to state practice can be helpful. By an Agreement on Consular Relations between Australia and the People’s Republic of China which came into force on 15 September 2000, notification is to be made within three days. As Australia regards three days an appropriate period under the agreement, there is little basis to suppose that it would find the 20 hours in this case unacceptable. It was not the defence case that the Australian government considers the notification to have been delayed in this case.
40        The Defence referred to the case of 
LaGrand (Germany v USA)
 (27 June 2001) ICJ General List No 104. This is a decision by the International Court of Justice where two accused persons were not informed of the right to consular access for almost 17 years after their arrest. This decision does not offer any assistance to the accused. The acceptable time was not considered by the Court as the United States accepted that there was a breach of Art 36(1).
41        The Defence has therefore failed to make out a case that there was a breach of Art 36(1) because of the 20-hour interval. But I will go one stage further. Assuming that there was a breach, it does not necessarily follow that the accused’s statements are inadmissible in evidence. There must be some resultant prejudice that renders it wrong for the statements to be used, for example, that if he had timely consular advice, he would not have made the statements at all, or in the form or at the times he did.
42        No prejudice was disclosed. The issue relating to Art 36(1) was not raised when the admissibility of the statements was argued, but was only brought up in the closing submissions. The accused did not say anything about the making of the statements and the consular visit. There is no basis for excluding the statements as evidence.
Admissibility of the directive
43        Before concluding this part of my judgment, I should address an issue relating to the directive. ASP Toh’s evidence was that he acted pursuant to the directive. When defence counsel applied for it to be produced and admitted in evidence, the prosecutor objected.
44        He relied on s 126(1) of the Evidence Act that:
No public officer shall be compelled to disclose communications made to him in official confidence when he considers that the public interest would suffer by the disclosure.
and argued that the directive was restricted information given to ASP Toh and other CNB officers.
[1]
45        He had not given proper attention to the second element of the provision, that the public interest would suffer by the disclosure. ASP Toh had not said that the disclosure of the directive was inimical to the public interest, and I saw no reason to suppose that it would.
46        I therefore ruled that the directive be produced and admitted in evidence.
Chain of custody
47        Defence counsel raised an issue on the chain of custody of the two packets of heroin. This relates to the time when the packets came into ASP Toh’s custody at 12.50am on 13 December up to the time that he submitted them to Dr Lee Tong Kooi of the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis on 13 December at 11.40am.
48        ASP Toh’s evidence in his conditioned statement was that he marked the packet that was strapped to the accused’s back “A”, and the other packet recovered from the haversack “B1”. At 1.55am on 13 December he weighed the two packets and recorded their weights as 381.66g for packet A and 380.36g for packet B1, and at 5.30am he locked the two packets in his cabinet and left for home. On the following day, 13 December, at 11.00am he took out the two packets again and sealed them before delivering them to the HSA for analysis.
49        When he was cross-examined by defence counsel, he agreed with counsel that the established practice is for drug exhibits to be sealed at the earliest possible time. He explained that he did not do that immediately after weighing the packets because there was to be a press conference. That explanation was corrected in re-examination when he said that there was no press conference, only a press release.
50        He also said that on the morning of 13 December after he locked the packets in his cabinet, he took them out, and locked them again before he left for home, but he cannot remember why he took them out.
[2]
 
He had kept the packets in his cabinet that night because the CNB store for drug exhibits is only open during office hours, and does not receive drugs during the night.
51        His evidence was that the previous occasion he had kept drugs in the cabinet was in July 2002, and those drugs were no longer kept there in December. After December no drugs were kept there till May 2003.
[3]
52        ASP Toh was also asked about the discrepancy between the weights he recorded of the two packets (381.66g for packet A and 380.36g for packet B1) and that recorded by Dr Lee Tong Kooi (361.64g for packet A and 370.94g for packet B1). The significance was not only that different weights were recorded by ASP Toh and Dr Lee for the same packets, but that packet A was the heavier packet by ASP Toh’s weighing, while packet B1 was heavier than packet A when Dr Lee weighed them.
53        No explanation was offered by ASP Toh. One can only look at the circumstances of the two weighings. ASP Toh weighed the packets in his office to obtain a weight of the suspected drugs to prefer a holding charge against the accused, and to carry on with his investigations.
54        When Dr Lee weighed the exhibits he was doing that as an analyst. The weighing was done under laboratory conditions to establish the diamorphine content of the suspected drugs. The levels of expertise between ASP Toh and Dr Lee, and the equipment they used, were different. The difference in the results may have arisen for these reasons. There was no suggestion that when ASP Toh opened the packets, he added to or removed anything from them before sending them to Dr Lee.
55        The Defence also complained that ASP Toh did not seal the drugs promptly. The two packets came into ASP Toh’s possession at 12.50am on 13 December and he sealed them at 11.00am the same day. The lapse was 10hrs 10min. During that time ASP Toh was briefed by the officer who handed custody of the case exhibits to him, and he instructed the officer to list the exhibits, and he also weighed the packets and locked them in his cabinet.
56        The sealing could have been carried out earlier, perhaps immediately after the weighing at 1.55am, 9hrs 5min earlier than the actual time of weighing.
57        ASP Toh made reference to a press conference which did not take place. The Prosecution did not clarify with him whether he believed that there was going to be a press conference, and whether there is a practice that if there is a press conference, drug exhibits are not sealed until after that has taken place. There was no suggestion that anyone other than ASP Toh had possession of the packets during the 10hrs 10min.
58        Defence counsel submitted that:
The procedure to ensure the integrity of the exhibits submitted for analysis would be rendered useless if investigators are allowed to keep unsealed drugs in their private cabinets, remove them for no apparent reason and then affixing a seal just minutes before submitting the drugs for analysis. The evidence adduced showed not only a disregard of established practice but also an unexplained discrepancy in the weight of the exhibits. We submit the Honourable Court is entitled to reject the drug exhibits and the consequential evidence of the drug analyst.
[4]
59        I do not agree. For the reasons I have stated I find that the integrity of the exhibits was not compromised.
Finding on the accused’s guilt
60        There was undisputed evidence that the two packets were in the possession of the accused. The airport officers gave clear evidence on the recovery of those packets from his body and his haversack. He had also admitted in his statements that he had those packets in his possession. There was also undisputed evidence from other prosecution witnesses that he had flown in from Phnom Penh. In his statement he admitted that he brought the two packets with him when he entered Singapore.
61        At the close of the Prosecution’s case, defence counsel decided not to make any submissions. I found on the evidence before me that the Prosecution had proved a sufficient case for the accused to enter his defence.
62        When he was called to do that, he elected not to enter his defence. He did not give evidence himself, or call any one to give evidence as his witness.
63        I proceeded to hear closing submissions. I have reviewed the evidence and the submissions and my rulings and findings made during the trial since. I find that the Prosecution has proved its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore find the accused guilty on the charge he faces, and convict him thereon.
Sentence to be imposed
64        I will now deal with the issues raised by the Defence on the sentence to be imposed.
Whether the death sentence is mandatory
65        The Defence contended that the sentence of death is not a mandatory sentence and that it is the maximum sentence.
66        The punishments for offences are referred to in s 33 and the Second Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The first column of the schedule relates to “Section creating offence”, the second column relates to “General nature of offence” and the third to seventh columns relate to “Punishment”.
67        To ascertain the punishment for the offence committed by the accused one looks under the first column for s 7. Then one looks across the schedule for the specific offence or type and quantity of drug involved under the second column, and finally one looks for the punishment under columns three to seven.
68        When the second schedule is read in this way, the punishment for an offence under s 7 for the unauthorised import of more than 15g of diamorphine is stated in one word, “Death”.
69        It was submitted that this “as a matter of statutory interpretation, is open to be regarded as a maximum penalty not a death penalty”. Reliance is placed on ss 9A(1) and 41 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed):
9A.—(1) In the interpretation of a provision of a written law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.
41. Whenever in any written law a penalty is provided for an offence, such provision shall imply that such offence shall be punishable upon conviction by a penalty not exceeding (except as may be otherwise expressly mentioned in the written law) the penalty provided.
70        I do not see any merit in this argument. The schedule provides specifically and clearly that the punishment is death. It does not say that the maximum sentence is death. The schedule provides for the maximum sentence in clear terms. It is replete with references to maximum and minimum sentences for other offences, for example, for the offence of unauthorised import of not less than 10g and not more than 15g of diamorphine, the punishment is maximum 30 years’ imprisonment or imprisonment for life and 15 strokes, and minimum 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes.
71        When there is a range of punishment prescribed, there is a maximum and a minimum sentence. When a single punishment is prescribed, it is manifestly wrong to take it to be the maximum sentence.
Equal protection
72        A more substantial issue raised on behalf of the accused is that the mandatory death penalty is unconstitutional for contravening Art 12(1) of the Constitution (1999 Rev Ed) that “[a]ll persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law”.
73        Counsel submitted that:
Where persons require the equality of protection that is there referred to, it usually is from injustice at the hands of the State and usually within the criminal law. Any State has great resources which can be marshaled against an individual person. Every person is entitled to protection from the effect of those resources and in communities such as this, that protection comes from the criminal justice system. Justice in the criminal law in countries whose system derives from English law usually means fairness and equity. It may mean moral rightness. Justice is also usually required to conform to developing community standards. An entitlement to equal protection of the law is not concerned in comparative terms with the punishment which is imposed on a particular individual but rather an entitlement to be protected from injustice in the form of a disproportionate sentence.
…
A mandatory sentence of death, such as in this case, removes that protection. The person in the situation of the accused who falls into the 15 grams plus category loses the protection of a judicial sentence and the fact that everyone in that category is penalized with the death penalty is no answer to the absence of protection from a disproportionate sentence.
[5]
74        The constitutionality of the mandatory death sentence under the Misuse of Drugs Act was argued before and considered by the Privy Council two decades ago in 
Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 
[1980–1981] SLR 48
.
75        The argument made, as Lord Diplock put it in his judgment at 63, [32] was:
[T]he mandatory nature of the sentence, in the case of an offence so broadly drawn as that of trafficking created by … the [Misuse of] Drugs Act, rendered it arbitrary since it debarred the court in punishing offenders from discriminating between them according to their individual blameworthiness.
and that it:
… offends against the principle of equality before the law entrenched in the Constitution by art 12(1), since it compels the court to condemn to the highest penalty of death an addict who has gratuitously supplied an addict friend with 15g of heroin from his own private store, and to inflict a lesser punishment upon a professional dealer caught selling for distribution to many addicts a total of 14.99g.
76        That argument was rejected at 64, [35]–[37] on the ground that:
All criminal law involves the classification of individuals for the purposes of punishment, since it affects those individuals only in relation to whom there exists a defined set of circumstances – the conduct and, where relevant, the state of mind that constitute the ingredients of an offence. Equality before the law and equal protection of the law require that like should be compared with like. What Article 12(1) of the Constitution assures to the individual is the right to equal treatment with other individuals in similar circumstances. It prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated by way of punishment more harshly than others, it does not forbid discrimination in punitive treatment between one class of individuals and another class in relation to which there is some difference in the circumstances of the offence that has been committed.
The discrimination that the appellants challenge in the instant cases is discrimination between class and class: the imposition of a capital penalty upon that class of individuals who traffic in 15g of heroin or more and the imposition of a penalty, severe though it may be, which is not capital upon that class of individuals who traffic in less than 15g of heroin. The dissimilarity in circumstances between the two classes of individuals lies in the quantity of the drug that was involved in the offence.
The questions whether this dissimilarity in circumstances justifies any differentiation in the punishments imposed upon individuals who fall within one class and those who fall within the other, and, if so, what are the appropriate punishments for each class, are questions of social policy. Under the Constitution, which is based on the separation of powers, these are questions which it is the function of the legislature to decide, not that of the judiciary. 
Provided that the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the social object of the law, there is no inconsistency with art 12(1) of the Constitution
.
and Lord Diplock added at 65, [39]:
[A]rt 12(1) of the Constitution is not concerned with equal punitive treatment for equal moral blameworthiness; it is concerned with equal punitive treatment for similar legal guilt.
[emphasis added]
This decision is binding on me.
77        The Court of Appeal ruled in 
Jabar v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 617
 at 631, [53], in connection with the requirement in Art 9(1) that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law, that:
Any law which provides for the deprivation of a person’s life or personal liberty, is valid and binding so long as it is validly passed by Parliament. The court is not concerned with whether it is also fair, just and reasonable as well.
There is room for debate whether “so long as it is validly passed by Parliament” refers to the compliance with the processes for passing an Act or to its constitutional validity. I think it relates to both, as the court must be concerned that statutes be properly enacted and do not contravene the Constitution.
78        In 
Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v PP
 
[1997] 1 SLR 123
, Yong Pung How CJ adopted the test laid down by the Supreme Court of India in 
Budhan Choudhry v State of Bihar
 AIR (42) 1955 SC 191 at 193 for the equal protection of the law under Art 14 of the Constitution of India:
In order, however, to pass the test of permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (i) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and (ii) that that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question. The classification may be founded on different bases; namely, geographical, or according to objects or occupations or the like. What is necessary is that there must be a nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act under consideration.
79        In their closing submissions defence counsel referred to 
Ong Ah Chuan
 and conceded that:
There is no question that Lord Diplock is right when he says that the legislature can differentiate between offenders as to the punishment to be imposed. However in our submission what the legislature cannot do (under Article 12) is deprive any group of persons of the protection of the law by depriving them of the right to be heard on the question of sentence which is then decided by an independent judge.
[6]
80        Counsel argued:
It is instructive to deal with two hypothetical situations to illustrate our submissions. In the first case (similar to this) a young person is arrested in the transit section of Changi Airport in possession of 20 grams of heroin on his way home to New Zealand. The 20 grams of heroin are for his own consumption. He is without prior convictions, fully employed, of excellent character and supported in every way by his family. In the second case, a Singapore national is arrested at the same airport. His baggage is searched and a suitcase containing artefacts purchased in the Golden Triangle shows that a carefully planned scheme of importation of heroin had been devised. The artefacts have been carefully hollowed, filled with heroin and resealed, and in total he is in possession 1.5 kilograms of heroin. He is interviewed by the CNB and admits that the primary purpose for the importation is the sale of the heroin after being cut on the streets of Singapore. He has prior convictions for non-capital drug offences, offences of violence, and immigration offences including forgery of travel documents. It is clear that he is part of a sophisticated drug network dealing in large quantities of drugs within Singapore.
To suggest that no differentiation in punishment between those two offenders does not violate the principles behind the equal protection of the law in Article 12 or the accepted principle of sentencing is fanciful.
[7]
81        The argument is that the death sentence cannot be imposed without regard to the degree of moral blameworthiness of the convicted person, and that the court must treat an offender with little or no blameworthiness differently from a blameworthy offender when it imposes a sentence.
82        As Lord Diplock explained, equal protection does not require that everyone be dealt with equally. It requires that like be compared with like. Different bases of classification may be employed. In setting punishments for drug importation, for example, the criteria employed may be by the offence, the type of drugs, the quantity of the drugs, the value of the drugs, whether the offender is a willing or reluctant participant, a principal or an agent, or whether he is a first offender or a repeat offender. The power to determine the criteria for identifying and distinguishing one class from others is vested in the legislature. Provided that the distinguishing factor employed is not purely arbitrary, and it bears a reasonable relation to the object of the law, that is not discrimination even if arguments can be made that some other criteria could suit the purpose better.
83        Parliament has prescribed the offence, the type and quantity of drugs as the bases to determine the sentences to be meted out to offenders. By its preamble the Misuse of Drugs Act was enacted “for the control of dangerous drugs or otherwise harmful drugs and substances and for purposes connected therewith”. The differentiating factors employed for the death sentence are not arbitrary, and they bear a reasonable relation to the object of the Act.
84        The degree of moral blameworthiness of an offender and other mitigating and aggravating factors are taken into consideration for sentencing in the vast majority of the offences where the sentence is not fixed. The failure to do so could raise questions whether the sentencing power is properly exercised. But where the legislature has by the proper exercise of its powers prescribed that for offences involving large quantities of drugs the offenders shall be punished with death, the punishment will be imposed without hearing pleas in mitigation, and there is no denial of the equal protection of the law to the offenders.
85        The Defence also relied on the Privy Council’s decision in 
Reyes v The Queen
 
[2002] 2 AC 235
 that a mandatory death penalty is cruel and inhuman punishment.
[8]
 
This case originated in Belize. Reyes was convicted of murder by shooting, a class A murder under the laws of Belize, and the mandatory death sentence for class A murders was imposed. He challenged the constitutional validity of the sentence, and succeeded before the Privy Council.
86        Lord Bingham of Cornhill, in delivering the judgment of the Board, ruled at [29] that:
A law which denies a defendant the opportunity, after conviction, to seek to avoid imposition of the ultimate penalty, which he may not deserve, is incompatible with section 7 because it fails to respect his basic humanity.
87        The provision referred to is s 7 of the Constitution of Belize which provides that:
No person shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment.
88        To ascertain whether a punishment is inhuman or degrading a court is required to take into account the “evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society”.
89        Lord Bingham reviewed decisions from several jurisdictions and came to the conclusion at [43] that:
[T]he provision requiring sentence of death to be passed on the defendant on his conviction of murder by shooting subjected him to inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment incompatible with his right under section 7 of the Constitution in that it required sentence of death to be passed and precluded any judicial consideration of the humanity of condemning him to death. The use of firearms by dangerous and aggressive criminals is an undoubted social evil and, so long as the death penalty is retained, there may well be murders by shooting which justify the ultimate penalty. But there will also be murders of quite a different character (for instance, murders arising from sudden quarrels within a family, or between neighbours, involving the use of a firearm legitimately owned for no criminal or aggressive purpose) in which the death penalty would be plainly excessive and disproportionate. In a crime of this kind there may well be matters relating both to the offence and the offender which ought properly to be considered before sentence is passed. To deny the offender the opportunity, before sentence is passed, to seek to persuade the court that in all the circumstances to condemn him to death would be disproportionate and inappropriate is to treat him as no human being should be treated and thus to deny his basic humanity, the core of the right which section 7 exists to protect.
90        The case was argued and decided around s 7 of the Belize Constitution. 
Reyes
 would be relevant to the present case if there is an equivalent provision to s 7 in Singapore, but no such provision exists in the Constitution or any Act. The Defence was not deterred by that, and submitted after referring to the passage in the foregoing paragraph that “the mandatory death penalty offends the protection offered by Article 12 in the same manner”.
[9]
91        That brings the argument back to the question of proper and impermissible classification criteria, which has been dealt with.
Separation of powers
92        Article 93 of the Constitution declares that:
The judicial power of Singapore shall be vested in a Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided by any written law for the time being in force.
93        The distinction between the judicial power and the legislative power on the punishment of offenders is very well set out by the Supreme Court of Ireland in 
Deaton v The Attorney General and the Revenue Commissioners
 [1963] IR 170 at 182:
There is a clear distinction between the prescription of a fixed penalty and the selection of a penalty for a particular case. The prescription of a fixed penalty is the statement of a general rule, which is one of the characteristics of legislation; this is wholly different from the selection of a penalty to be imposed in a particular case. … The Legislature does not prescribe the penalty to be imposed in an individual citizen’s case; it states the general rule, and the application of that rule is for the Courts.
and at 183:
[T]he selection of punishment is an integral part of the administration of justice and, as such, cannot be committed to the hands of the Executive …
94        On that basis, there can be nothing objectionable in s 33 and the Second Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
95        Defence counsel also took issue with the post-sentencing provisions in the CPC relating to death sentences. The specific provisions counsel were concerned with are sub-ss (c) and (e) of s 220 which read:
(c)        in cases in which notice of appeal or notice of an application for leave to appeal is not given within the prescribed period, the Judge who presided at the trial shall, as soon as conveniently may be after that period has elapsed, forward to the Minister a copy of the notes of evidence taken at the trial, together with a report in writing signed by him stating whether, in his opinion, there are any reasons (and, if so, what reasons) why the sentence of death should or should not be carried out;
(e)        the President, acting in accordance with section 8 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act shall communicate to the High Court a copy under his hand and seal of any order which he makes, which order, if the sentence is to be carried out, shall state the time and place when and where the execution is to be held, and, if the sentence is commuted into any other punishment, shall so state and, if the person sentenced is pardoned, shall so state;
96        They submit that:
Section 220 requires the trial judge to prepare a report for the Minister or the Court of Appeal stating whether there are any reasons why the death penalty which he has had no choice but to pronounce should not be carried out. The trial judge hears the case, pronounces the sentence and then is called upon to express a view about the sentence ultimately to the executive without the accused person having any role in the process – indeed having no protection.
Section 220 of the Code may be treated as evidence of the breach of the doctrine of separation of powers. It is a legislative requirement on a judicial officer to take part in the administrative process of the executive. That requirement arises because of the earlier breach of the doctrine by the legislature mandating and fixing the sentence.
An issue which arises is whether it is compatible with the doctrine of the separation of powers to provide for the individualised consideration only after the imposition of the sentence and by the Executive with no accessible criteria and with no requirement to give reasons for the final outcome. It is submitted that the power to determine the severity of the punishment to be inflicted upon an individual member of a class of offenders should not be committed to the executive for, in both substance and reality, the decision as to which of those convicted of importing a controlled substance actually deserves to suffer death is a sentencing function. The individualised determination should be performed by the judiciary before the death sentence is pronounced, not afterwards. Otherwise, contrary to the separation of powers principle, the sentencing function is being trusted to the executive.
[10]
It was not made clear whether the submission is that the sentence of death or the power conferred by s 220 is invalid for being in breach of the doctrine of separation of powers embodied in the Constitution. The tenor of the submission suggested the latter.
97        Section 220 does not stand alone. It draws its authority from Art 22P of the Constitution which provides that:
22P.—(1) The President, as occasion shall arise, may, on the advice of the Cabinet —
(a)        grant a pardon to any accomplice in any offence who gives information which leads to the conviction of the principal offender or any one of the principal offenders, if more than one;
(b)        grant to any offender convicted of any offence in any court in Singapore, a pardon, free or subject to lawful conditions, or any reprieve or respite, either indefinite or for such period as the President may think fit, of the execution of any sentence pronounced on such offender; or
(c)        remit the whole or any part of such sentence or of any penalty or forfeiture imposed by law.
(2)        Where any offender has been condemned to death by the sentence of any court and in the event of an appeal such sentence has been confirmed by the appellate court, the President shall cause the reports which are made to him by the Judge who tried the case and the Chief Justice or other presiding Judge of the appellate court to be forwarded to the Attorney-General with instructions that, after the Attorney-General has given his opinion thereon, the reports shall be sent, together with the Attorney-General’s opinion, to the Cabinet so that the Cabinet may advise the President on the exercise of the power conferred on him by subsection (1).
98        Art 22P and Art 93 exist together. The judicial power of the courts is to be wielded alongside the President’s prerogative powers. A power conferred by the Constitution cannot be considered unconstitutional.
The Beijing Statement
99        The statement entitled “Beijing Statement of Principles of the Independence of the Judiciary in the LAWASIA Region” was signed by the participants at the 6th Conference of Chief Justices of Asia and the Pacific, including the Chief Justice of Singapore, on 19 August 1995.
100      Defence counsel submitted:
The Beijing Statement adds great force to our submission and underlines the importance of the judiciary in death penalty cases.
In the Statement, the Judiciary is described as an “institution of the highest value in every society”. The statement also declared that the Judiciary is indispensable to the implementation of rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. One of the stated objectives and functions of the Judiciary was to promote, within the proper limits of the judicial function, the observance and attainment of human rights. Importantly, it was also stated that the Judiciary must have jurisdiction over all issues of a justiciable nature and exclusive authority to decide whether an issue submitted for its decision is within its competence as defined by law.
It is submitted that the imposition of sentence is fundamentally justiciable in its nature and part of the criminal trial process and thus requires the sentence to be passed by an independent and impartial tribunal offering the accused “the equal protection of the law”.
[11]
101      I have to say that I read nothing in the Statement that relates to death sentences or mandatory death sentences. Counsel did not explain how the Statement, which does not have the force of a treaty or a convention, assists the accused’s argument that mandatory death sentences are illegal.
Hanging as a cruel and inhuman punishment
102      The defence asserted that the death penalty that the accused faces is not only unconstitutional for being a denial of equal protection, but is also unconstitutional because execution by hanging is cruel, inhuman and degrading and is not compatible with the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.
[12]
103      Counsel argued that although there is no constitutional provision against cruel and inhuman punishment, hanging contravenes Art 9(1) which provides that:
No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.
104      Section 216 of the CPC states that sentences of death are to be carried out by hanging. Nevertheless counsel argued that “law” should be read to include Art 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (“UDHR”) that:
No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
105      Counsel justified the position on the basis that:
[T]he articles of the UDHR … protect a person subject to the criminal law from a death penalty which is cruel and inhuman. A cruel, inhuman and degrading method of execution would not represent the deprivation of a life “according to law” under Article 9(1).
[A]n important question arises and that is the role of treaties and customary international law in domestic or municipal law. We submit that Singapore’s vital participation in the world of transnational trade and commerce necessarily connects it to the influence of international standards and that they in turn must affect Singapore’s domestic or municipal law.
[13]
106      The Declaration is not an international treaty or convention and there is no consensus that it is a statement or codification of customary international law, and it does not refer to hanging.
107      There are those who believe that hanging is a cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, but that is by no means a settled view. For example, when this issue was brought up before the United States Court of Appeals in 
Campbell v Wood
 18 F 3d 662 (1994), the majority decision was that hanging did not violate the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishments.
108      Even if there is such a customary rule, it would not apply if it is inconsistent with the domestic law. As Lord Atkin explained in 
Chung Chi Cheung v The King
 
[1939] AC 160
 at 167–168:
[S]o far, at any rate, as the Courts of this country are concerned, international law has no validity save in so far as its principles are accepted and adopted by our own domestic law. There is no external power that imposes its rules upon our own code of substantive law or procedure. The Courts acknowledge the existence of a body of rules which nations accept amongst themselves. On any judicial issue they seek to ascertain what the relevant rule is, and, having found it, they will treat it as incorporated into the domestic law, so far as it is not inconsistent with rules enacted by statutes or finally declared by their tribunals.
And in 
Collco Dealings Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners
 
[1962] AC 1
, the House of Lords affirmed the proposition that if a statute is unambiguous, its provisions must be followed even if they are contrary to international law.
Conclusion
109      The Defence has failed to establish that the mandatory death sentence is unlawful for contravening the Constitution or international law. That being the case, and having found the accused guilty and convicted him, the sentence I impose is that he shall suffer death.

Judith Prakash J:
Background
1          The plaintiff, Mr Ang Leng Hock, was riding his motorcycle on 29 January 1999 when it was involved in a collision with a taxi driven by the defendant, Mr Leo Ee Ah. Mr Ang was injured: his left shoulder was fractured, the second and third metatarsal heads of his left foot sustained crack fractures and his right wrist was sprained. At that time, Mr Ang was 41 years old.
2          This action was started in May 2000. Parties reached a settlement shortly before the trial and, on 18 August 2000, interlocutory judgment was entered for the plaintiff for damages to be assessed with costs and interest reserved to the registrar. The judgment further provided that the defendant was to be liable for 95% of the damages awarded to Mr Ang.
3          The assessment hearing took place before the assistant registrar over three days in August 2003 and her judgment was delivered on 9 October 2003. Mr Ang was awarded the following damages:
(a)        pain and suffering and loss of amenities             $ 20,000.00
(b)        Loss of future earnings                                    $244,062.00
(c)        Future medical expenses                                  $ 12,000.00
(d)        Pre-trial loss of earnings                                  $194,642.63
(e)        Costs of repairs                                                  $1,000.00
(f)         Loss of use of motorcycle                                      $120.00
(g)        Transport expenses                                                $130.00
Neither party was completely satisfied with the award. Both appealed.
4          Mr Ang’s appeal is:
(a)        against the assistant registrar’s decision that he was not entitled to his claim in respect of his alleged loss of earnings from his employment with Smith & Nephew Pte Ltd following the accident on 9 January 2000;
(b)        against the assistant registrar’s decision that the appropriate multiplier to be applied to his loss of future earnings is six years (Mr Ang thinks it should be between eight and ten years); and
(c)        against the assistant registrar’s decision not to make an award in his favour in respect of loss of earning capacity.
5          The defendant’s appeal is against the awards made in respect of Mr Ang’s pre-trial loss of earnings, his future loss of earnings and his medical expenses. The defendant’s position is that these awards are too high and must be reduced.
Summons-in-Chambers No 7063 of 2003
6          The two appeals were fixed for hearing on 18 November 2003. Some five days before that, the defendant filed a summons-in-chambers for leave to adduce further evidence at the hearing of the appeals. The further evidence that the defendant wished to adduce comprised the results of searches done at the Registry of Companies into the shareholders of a company called “Grand Court Vegetarian Restaurant Pte Ltd”. The grounds of the application were that:
(a)        the nature of the evidence was such that had it been adduced at the hearing before the assistant registrar, Mr Ang could not have rebutted it; and
(c)        the evidence would cast serious doubt on the credibility of Mr Ang and his witness, one Mr Gwee Tsu Sun.
This application was fixed for hearing on the same day as the appeals. Mr Gurdeep Singh, counsel for Mr Ang, objected to the admission of new evidence at this late stage. I dismissed the application and awarded costs to the plaintiff. I then went on to hear the appeals proper and at the end of the hearing I reserved my decision. Ms Lee Yuk Lan, counsel for the defendant, then wrote in for further arguments on the adduction of further evidence. I acquiesced to her request.
7          The main issue canvassed at the hearing of the further arguments was what was the appropriate test to be applied when a party to an assessment of damages that had taken place before the registrar wished to adduce further evidence at the hearing before the judge in chambers. When the issue was originally raised, I had taken the view, following 
Lassiter Ann Masters v To Keng Lam
 
[2003] 3 SLR 666
, that in such cases, the principles in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 1 WLR 1489
 applied. Ms Lee sought to persuade me to change that view.
8          In 
Lassiter
, Lai Siu Chiu J held that neither the fact that Registrar’s Appeals operated by way of rehearing nor O 38 r 2(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) gave a judge in chambers the discretion to automatically admit further testimony (oral or written), where damages had already been assessed and judgment thereon delivered. To allow such applications would be to set a dangerous precedent and open the floodgates to abuse of the rule that Registrar’s Appeals were dealt with by way of rehearing. The principles of 
Ladd v Marshall
 applied even to Registrar’s Appeals.
9          Ms Lee’s first further submission was that an appeal against the decision of the Registrar to a judge in chambers is by way of a rehearing and that registrars are not trial judges. As such, an appeal from the registrar to the judge in chambers is not an appeal in the true sense as compared to an appeal from the judge in chambers or an appeal from a judge in open court to the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, the judge in chambers hearing the appeal treats the matter as though it came before him for the first time. In support of this submission, she cited 
Chang Ah Lek v Lim Ah Koon
 
[1999] 1 SLR 82
 and 
Herbs and Spices Trading Post Pte Ltd v Deo Silver (Pte) Ltd
 
[1990] SLR 1234
. I would point out that 
Chang Ah Lek
, unlike 
Lassiter
, was not a case that involved the admission of new evidence on appeal from an assessment hearing before the registrar. In 
Chang Ah Lek
, the Court of Appeal was considering the manner in which a judge in chambers deals on the merits with an appeal from the registrar. There was no discussion at all relating to the judge’s powers to admit new evidence in such a situation. What was in issue was whether the judge could only interfere with the award made by the registrar if he was satisfied that the registrar had acted on a wrong principle of law or had misapprehended the facts or had made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages suffered. 
Herbs and Spices
 dealt with the nature of the jurisdiction of a district judge in hearing appeals from the registrar of the District Court and it too has nothing to do with the issue before me. Neither of these cases, in my judgment, preclude me from applying the 
Ladd v Marshall
 principles to the present case.
10        Ms Lee’s second argument was that in determining whether to allow the admission of further evidence on appeal, a distinction has to be drawn between admitting such evidence before a judge in chambers and admitting it before the Court of Appeal. Whilst the 
Ladd v Marshall
 test would be applied in an application to admit further evidence on an appeal to the Court of Appeal, the judge in chambers hearing an appeal from the registrar is free to allow the admission of fresh evidence in the absence of contrary reasons. This is because whilst O 57 r 13(2) of the Rules specifies that further evidence may only be admitted before the Court of Appeal when there are special grounds for such admission, there is no equivalent provision or restriction in respect of an appeal to the judge in chambers against the decision of the registrar. Ms Lee relied on the Court of Appeal decision, 
Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd
 
[1999] 2 SLR 233
, which held that in this situation the judge in chambers was free to allow the admission of fresh evidence in the absence of contrary reasons.
11        The appellants in 
Lian Soon Construction
 were the main contractors engaged by the respondents for a building project. During the course of the works, the architects issued various interim certificates. The appellants only received payment in respect of some of these certificates. They therefore sued the respondents for payment in respect of the other certificates. They then took out an application for summary judgment. The respondents filed two affidavits for this hearing. At the hearing, the deputy registrar gave final judgment to the appellants. The respondents appealed. Subsequently they filed a summons-in-chambers for orders that they be at liberty to file an additional affidavit for the purpose of the appeal to the judge in chambers. This application was allowed and the further evidence was admitted. The appellants appealed against this decision and argued that the judge had erred in failing to apply the higher 
Ladd v Marshall
 test in determining whether to allow the admission of the new affidavit. They recognised that the practice in the UK was to readily allow fresh evidence on appeal to a judge in chambers. They argued, however, that this practice should no longer be followed since, as of August 1991, the position with respect to the procedure for filing affidavits under O 14 r 2 of the Rules had been amended in Singapore. A strict timetable was now prescribed by the Rules and there was no equivalent in the UK.
12        The judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered by Karthigesu JA. His Honour recognised that the newly structured timetable for the filing and service of documents and new requirements in relation to the affidavit in support of the O 14 application had been introduced to ensure that O 14 proceedings were expedited and delays minimised. He then considered the 
Supreme Court Practice 1999
 and 
Singapore Court Practice 1999
 by Pinsler, both of which commented that a judge in chambers hearing an appeal from the registrar is entitled to treat the matter afresh as though it came before him for the first time and has an unfettered discretion to admit new evidence whilst the Court of Appeal does not have such unfettered discretion to receive further evidence on hearing an appeal on summary judgment and might only do so on “special grounds” as provided in O 57 r 13. Karthigesu JA then summarised the position as follows (at [38]):
The amendments to O 14 r 2 follow the rationale of summary proceedings and seek to expedite relief. Failure to comply strictly with those time limits may lead to an order for costs being made against the defaulting party: O 14 r 2(7). The rationale behind the amendments is distinct from the rationale behind the adduction of fresh evidence before a judge in chambers. A judge in chambers who hears an appeal from the registrar is entitled to treat the matter as though it came before him for the first time. The judge in chambers in effect exercises confirmatory jurisdiction. The judge’s discretion is in no way fettered by the decision below, and he is free to allow the admission of fresh evidence in the absence of contrary reasons. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, case law has established that the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the discretion of the judge unless satisfied that the judge’s discretion has been wrongly exercised. Order 57 rule 13 specifically states the manner in which further evidence may be received. There is no equivalent provision with respect to an appeal to a judge in chambers. … Lai Kew Chai J was thus correct in drawing a distinction between the admission of fresh evidence before a judge in chambers as opposed to the Court of Appeal.
13        The 
Lian Soon Construction
 case was cited to Lai Siu Chiu J in 
Lassiter
. She did not find it determinative of the question before her. She stated at [26], [27] and [29]:
26         I would also add that the fact that our (and UK) courts treat Registrar’s Appeals as rehearings does not give judges a 
carte blanche
 as Mr Hwang seemed to suggest, to admit fresh evidence as opposed to admitting additional affidavits for the appeal, which is routinely done. In my view, there is a vast difference between the two. I agree with the defendant’s submission that rehearing by way of Registrar’s Appeals only means that a judge in chambers is entitled to look at the case 
de novo
 based 
on whatever evidence that was presented to the Registrar below
; it does not extend to the admission of new testimony.
27         It bears remembering that, if the assessment of damages had been conducted before a judge (as was originally intended according to Mr Hwang) instead of by the Registrar and the plaintiff had appealed therefrom to the Court of Appeal instead of to a judge in chambers, there is no question that the principles in 
Ladd v Marshall
 would apply, in which case the applications would most likely have been refused.
28         …
29         Mr Hwang had cited my decision (as well as the Court of Appeal’s) in 
Chang Ah Lek v Lim Ah Koon
 as authority for his submission that even an appeal on assessment of damages to a judge in chambers is dealt with by way of a rehearing. That may be so, but neither in that nor in any of the other cases he cited has the court been known to admit fresh evidence by way of [affidavits of evidence-in-chief] or 
viva voce
 testimony on interlocutory applications.
[emphasis in original]
14        As Lai J pointed out, none of the cases that have previously been decided on the issue of adduction of fresh evidence before the judge in chambers was a case of an appeal against an award made at an assessment of damages hearing at which 
viva voce
 evidence had been received, cross-examination had taken place and parties had given prior discovery of all documents that they would be relying on. The facts of 
Lassiter
 are similar to the facts of the case before me in that in both cases, the appeals were against damages awards made by the registrar. Secondly, in both cases, the hearing before the registrar had been hotly contested, discovery had been given, affidavits of evidence-in-chief and bundles of documents had been filed, and witnesses had been subjected to extensive cross-examination on the allegations in their affidavits. The difference between 
Lassiter
 and the present case is that in 
Lassiter
, the plaintiff appellant wished to adduce further affidavits of evidence-in-chief and this would have necessitated the recalling of witnesses who had testified at the assessment. In this case, the defendant wished to adduce documents in the public domain in order to challenge the credibility of Mr Ang and one of his witnesses. The defendant here therefore submitted that there was no necessity to recall any witnesses or for the court to take any 
viva voce
 evidence.
15        I think that there is a distinction to be drawn between the adduction of further evidence before the judge in chambers on an appeal from the registrar against a decision on an interlocutory application like an O 14 application, and one that is against a final decision, albeit by a registrar, which has been taken after a full trial on the merits in that discovery has taken place, documents and affidavits of evidence-in-chief have been filed, 
viva voce
 evidence has been given and the parties have had the opportunity of cross-examining each other’s witnesses. In the first case, the original evidence would have been only documentary. Any prejudice that might have arisen from allowing further documentary evidence by way of affidavit could have been dealt with easily by giving the other party a right of reply. The second situation is very different. In that case, both parties would have (or should have) prepared for the hearing before the registrar in the same manner as for a trial in the High Court and would have engaged in the discovery exercise and in the cross-examination of witnesses. To allow further evidence to be freely adduced before the judge on appeal could easily lead to abuse of process. In the 
Lassiter
 case it would have meant the plaintiff and her witnesses being recalled for further cross-examination. That was not a desirable course. It would have been expensive and would have caused delay. Of course there are some instances where it would be correct to allow fresh evidence on appeal but there is already a procedure for deciding when this would be the correct thing to do and that is the procedure laid out in 
Ladd v Marshall
. In my view, there is no reason not to apply the 
Ladd v Marshall
 test to the adduction of fresh evidence on an appeal to the judge in chambers from an assessment of damages hearing before the registrar. The assessment hearing has all the characteristics of a trial. In procedure there is no distinction between that hearing and the hearing of a trial before a judge. As Lai J pointed out, the assessment hearing could well have taken place before the judge. It is only for administrative convenience that assessment hearings are often heard by registrars instead of by judges. The selection of the forum should not confer an additional advantage on the party who seeks to adduce further evidence.
16        The facts of the present case are not as egregious as those of 
Lassiter
. The additional evidence sought to be adduced is documentary in nature. The application does not, however, pass the 
Ladd v Marshall
 test since this evidence was available before the assessment hearing and could have been obtained then had due diligence been exercised. In fact, it could have been produced even after the assessment hearing since there was a time lapse between the hearing itself and the date of the decision. It is noteworthy that during this interim period the defendant did apply for leave to adduce a further affidavit from one of the medical witnesses. A similar application could very well have been made then in relation to the evidence that the defendant now seeks to adduce. Further, the second limb of 
Ladd v Marshall
, 
ie
 that the new evidence is such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, is not met here either. The purpose of adducing the new evidence is to attack the creditworthiness of two witnesses. The defendant’s position is, however, that these two witnesses are not worthy of credit based on the material which is already before the court. Lengthy submissions on creditworthiness having been made, one additional item of evidence is not going to prove pivotal.
17        Even if I am wrong and I do have an unfettered discretion to admit new evidence at this stage, I decline to exercise this discretion in favour of the defendant. As the evidence to be adduced goes to credit only, I do not think that it adds much to the case but, if it were admitted, I would think it necessary, and fair, to grant Mr Ang the opportunity of explaining the situation. This course would result in more expense and delay than the evidential value of the new evidence is worth.
18        For the reasons given above, I affirm my original decision on the defendant’s application to adduce new evidence.
The appeals
19        There has been no appeal against the award made for pain and suffering. Instead both appeals deal mainly with the financial consequences of the accident in relation to Mr Ang’s employment situation. It is necessary therefore to first give a fairly detailed account of his occupation both prior to and after the accident.
Mr Ang’s employment history
20        From 1994 until the accident in 1999, Mr Ang was an independent contractor for Grand Court Vegetarian Restaurant (“Grand Court”). In 1994, Grand Court commenced an outdoor catering business and it employed Mr Ang to assist it in relation to such catering functions. For these functions Grand Court would provide the food, the tables and chairs, crockery and cutlery and other related utensils and equipment. It would also provide the cook(s). Mr Ang’s duties were to transport the equipment from the Grand Court store to the site of the function. Once there, he had to set up the kitchen facilities for the function, supervise the setting up of the tables and chairs and the table settings and also, when necessary, supervise the setting up of tents to house the function. He also provided staff to wait at the tables and to clear up and clean. Occasionally, when there was a shortage of staff, Mr Ang would also assist in the cooking.
21        Mr Ang stated that he had worked for Grand Court for many years and over the years Grand Court had always been satisfied with his services. He was appreciated by Grand Court because:
(a)        he was able to undertake outdoor catering services at very short notice even when the function involved catering for over 2,000 persons;
(b)        he was always able to provide adequate support staff and supervision for the staff and the functions;
(c)        he was also able to provide the requisite number of suitably qualified staff to carry out the necessary duties for the outdoor catering functions; and
(d)        he took good care of the equipment supplied and ensured that it was all returned to Grand Court undamaged and in the same quantity as supplied.
22        When there was a function, Mr Ang would start work at about 10.00am in the morning and he would continue until late at night or the early hours of the next day. He was required to be present throughout the period of the function to supervise and co-ordinate the entire process. He also had to ensure that at the end of the function, the premises at which the function was held were returned in good order and all of Grand Court’s equipment was re-delivered to it. In the course of his duties, he had to be extremely fit as he was required to stack up bulky and heavy items of up to 50kg in weight. He also had to carry out a range of duties including driving the transport lorry, loading and unloading it, cooking, supervising functions of up to 200 tables (2,000 persons) and obtaining part-time staff.

These figures were based on a letter dated 22 June 1999 from Grand Court to Mr Ang’s solicitors. Mr Ang did not produce any other documents in support of his assertions as to the sums received from Grand Court.
24        Mr Ang asserted that his profits were approximately 15% to 20% of what Grand Court paid him. He obtained such profits because he performed many of the tasks involved in the catering service himself instead of hiring additional workers to do them. Among these tasks were those of a driver, a cook and a supervisor. Mr Ang calculated that the average amount received by him from Grand Court each month during the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 was $30,060.02 and that therefore, at the rate of 15%, his average monthly profit was $4,509.
25        In January 1999, Grand Court had ongoing outdoor catering contracts. After the accident, however, Mr Ang was unable to carry out these contracts. His physical disabilities did not allow him to perform the tasks necessary to carry out the work for Grand Court to the level he had performed at prior to the accident.
26        When he filed his affidavit of evidence-in-chief in June 2003, Mr Ang stated that he was currently the sole proprietor of a business called “68 Kopitiam” situated at 167 Neil Road. This business had been registered with the Registry of Businesses before the accident but actual business had not commenced at that time. Mr Ang’s intention had been to continue his contract work with Grand Court as it was lucrative but did not take up all his time. He would have been able both to run his coffee shop and to continue his work for Grand Court if he had not been involved in the accident.
27        Apart from his work for Grand Court, prior to the accident Mr Ang had also had a part-time job as a deliveryman for Smith & Nephew Pte Ltd. He was paid on an assignment basis. After the accident, Mr Ang was given medical leave for an initial period of 50 days. Thereafter, he was given another medical certificate that certified that he was only fit to do light duties for a further 20 days. He was told not to ride his motorcycle during this period and this meant that he could not go back to this despatch work. Mr Ang also claimed for loss of income from his despatch job as a result of the accident.
The appeals in respect of pre-trial loss of earnings
Loss of income from the despatch job
28        Mr Ang had claimed $5,172.80 for loss of income from his despatch job with Smith & Nephew during the years 1999 and 2000. The assistant registrar rejected this claim. She considered that he had not proved that he had suffered any loss of earnings from that job as a result of the accident.
29        In support of Mr Ang’s appeal against that holding, Mr Singh contended that there was no dispute that: (a) Mr Ang had worked for Smith & Nephew before and after the accident and (b) that he was on medical leave for a period of 70 days during which he was specifically excluded from riding a motorcycle. The evidence adduced by Mr Ang showed that in the year preceding the accident, he had earned $4,229 from Smith & Nephew. Mr Singh submitted that as a result of the accident, Mr Ang was only able to earn a sum of $1,632 in 1999 causing a loss of $2,597 for that year. In the year 2000, he had earned $1,653.20 from Smith & Nephew and suffered a loss of $2,575.80. His total loss over the two years was therefore $5,172.80.
30        The defendant’s position was that Mr Ang had failed to prove that he had suffered any loss of earnings from his part-time despatch job, apart from the period when he was on medical leave. This had lasted some two months and as Mr Ang’s average monthly earnings over 1997 and 1998 from this job had been $253.90 per month he should be awarded no more than $508 in compensation.
31        I agree that Mr Ang did suffer some loss of earnings in respect of his job with Smith & Nephew by reason of the accident. At the least, he should be compensated for the 70 days when he was on medical leave and could not carry out any despatch work. I also think that it would be fair to give him a further month’s compensation as, even after the 70 days’ medical leave expired, some hesitation in returning to riding his motorcycle for despatch work immediately would be understandable and acceptable. He had not proved, however, that the lower income from despatch work in 1999 and 2000 in comparison to his earnings in 1998 was entirely due to the accident. He was able to go back to work in 1999 and to earn a total of $1,632 that year. He should therefore have been able to carry out full despatch duties in 2000. No proof has been given that his lower income from despatch work in 2000 resulted from his injuries.
32        I allow the plaintiff’s appeal in respect of his earnings from Smith & Nephew. As regards quantum, it is not correct to simply deduct his actual earnings in 1999 from his earnings in 1998 and award him the difference. I think that his earnings in 1998 only should be used to assess his then current average monthly income from this job. I do not think a two-year average is required for an 
ad hoc
 job of this nature. On this basis, Mr Ang earned approximately $352 a month from Smith & Nephew in 1998. Three months’ loss of income in 1999 would therefore amount to $1,056 and I award him this amount for the reasons stated in [31].
Other pre-trial loss of earnings
33        The assistant registrar found that Mr Ang’s average monthly income from Grand Court from 1996 to 1998 was $4,509. She accepted Grand Court’s letter of 22 June 1999 as an accurate record of what he had been paid and disregarded the income tax returns that Mr Ang himself had filed showing a lower income. She also found that it was not possible for him to return to work for Grand Court as the medical evidence was that he was not fit to work in jobs that required him to lift heavy loads. Also, Mr Ang could not return to his former job because Grand Court had found a replacement for him. Finally, she found that Mr Ang could have worked as a food and drinks assistant in a coffee shop to mitigate his loss of income and that, if so, he would have earned $784 per month. She therefore assessed Mr Ang’s damages for pre-trial loss of earnings as follows:
(a)        for the period from the date of the accident, 
ie
 29 January 1999, to the expiration of his first period of medical leave, 
ie
 19 March 1999, which was approximately two months –
($4,509 less 9% to take into account income tax payable, 
ie
 $4,103.19) x 2 months = $8,206.38
(b)        for the period after 19 March 1999 to the date of trial on 9 October 2003, which was approximately 55 months –
$3,389.75 (
ie
 $4,509 minus $784 less 9%) x 55 months = $186,436.25
Total: $186,436.25 + $8,206.38 = $194,642.63
34        The defendant appealed against this award on the basis that the assessment of Mr Ang’s monthly earnings from the catering business prior to the accident at $4,509 as well as the assessment of his pre-trial monthly loss of income at $3,389.75 was unjustifiable and excessive. Ms Lee submitted that there was no documentary proof of the alleged monthly earnings of $4,509. On the contrary, Mr Ang’s income from his full-time employment as reflected in his income tax return form for the year ending December 1997 was $14,400 per annum or $1,200 per month and his total income declared in his income tax return form for the year ending December 1998 was $16,800 or $1,400 per month. The basic problem with the award therefore was that it was not based on reliable evidence of Mr Ang’s income.
35        As Mr Singh admitted, Mr Ang had no personal documentary records to substantiate his income during the time he was with Grand Court. The only documents that he could produce were two letters written in May and June 1999 by Grand Court to his solicitors in response to their queries about Mr Ang’s income. These letters were prepared by Grand Court’s freelance accountant, Mr Robert Xie Jin Yong. Grand Court itself did not have the additional accounting documents to support these figures as these had been kept by Mr Xie. According to the evidence of Mr Gwee Tsu Sun, the managing director of Grand Court, all documents pertaining to the accounts of Grand Court were kept by Mr Xie. They were not kept at Grand Court’s premises unless the auditors were coming in, in which case the documents were taken to the premises for auditing. Upon completion of the audit, the documents would be taken away by Mr Xie for safekeeping. Unfortunately, Mr Xie died in China. After his death, the accounting documents could not be found.
36        Mr Gwee produced Grand Court’s accounting documents for the period from May 2000 to May 2003. These documents had been prepared by a new accountant hired by Grand Court. Mr Singh submitted that these exhibited documents substantiated the existence of a system of records such as payment vouchers (albeit in different forms) for the payment of outdoor catering services. This was the same system that was in place in June 1999 when Grand Court wrote to Mr Singh setting out the amounts received by Mr Ang. These sums were not a figment of Mr Gwee’s imagination nor that of Mr Xie. There was no reason for them to have falsified the sums paid to Mr Ang or for the sums to have been incorrect. Evidence was adduced that Grand Court’s account were audited annually. Hence, it was submitted, the sums presented in the June 1999 letter must necessarily be reliable and accurate.
37        It was also submitted that the accuracy of the sums paid to Mr Ang could be tested against the oral evidence of Mr Gwee, Mr Ang himself and one Mr Chey Kum Cheong, a cook employed by Grand Court, who had taken over the task of supervising the outdoor catering functions. Mr Singh undertook a series of calculations based on testimony from these three witnesses that for a function involving 100 tables, Mr Ang had to supply 66 workers for whom he was paid at standard rates by Grand Court and from whom he took a small commission each and that he was also paid transport costs of between $100 and $150. Whilst the payments were based on a standard number of workers per function, Mr Ang did not have to return the wages of those workers who did not turn up and these so- called “savings” also formed part of his income. Mr Chey testified that for a function involving 100 tables, Mr Ang would be paid about $3,000 and transport costs and his profit from this sum would be about 15%. Based on these various calculations, it would appear that for such a function, Mr Ang would pay the pre-function workers $1,100, and the function workers $1,885. This would total $2,985. The workers would pay him commission amounting to $211 and he would collect a transport fee of $150. Assuming that Grand Court paid him $3,000 excluding transport, Mr Ang would make $211 plus $150 plus $15 (the difference between $3,000 and $2,985) 
ie
 $376 as profit, giving him a profit margin of not more than 12%. He would only earn more than this if some of the workers did not turn up and he was able to pocket the amounts allotted for their wages. If, as Mr Singh posited, one cook, one waitress and one dishwasher did not turn up, Mr Ang would be able to keep an extra $200 in his pocket giving him a profit of $576, a figure well within the 15% to 20% profit range that Mr Ang had asserted.
38        The above calculations have a certain weight to them. The problem is, however, that the exercise was undertaken to determine how much Mr Ang earned on a monthly basis. In order to do that, one would not only have to know how much money he could make from one 100-table function but how much he could make from smaller functions (where the number of workers involved would have been considerably smaller and the amount given to him therefore less) and exactly how many functions of each size there were each month. Thus, detailed records would be required either from Grand Court or from Mr Ang himself. In fact, records from Mr Ang would be better because these would reflect how many workers actually turned up on each occasion and what he managed to earn each time. No such records are available, however, and therefore the credibility of Mr Ang himself and of Mr Gwee becomes an important issue.
39        The only direct record of payment by Grand Court to Mr Ang was Grand Court’s letter of June 1999. Mr Gwee’s position was that payment vouchers in respect of payments to Mr Ang from Grand Court had existed. In his affidavit, he stated that he was not able to produce these payment vouchers because they were in the possession of the freelance accountant Mr Xie and he had passed away in China some time in March 2001. There was no evidence, however, that Mr Xie had been employed as a freelance accountant for Grand Court or that he had died in March 2001. Grand Court did have a firm of auditors to prepare its audited accounts, a company called L W Ong & Co, and Mr Gwee testified that Mr Xie had dealt with one Mr Ong from this firm in respect of all documents evidencing payment by Grand Court to third parties. The said Mr Ong was not, however, called as a witness to assist on the documentation. It also appeared to be unlikely that Mr Xie, a freelance accountant, would have retained records of payment belonging to Grand Court. Another discrepancy was that although Mr Xie was stated to have died in March 2001, Grand Court was able to produce its vouchers for the period from May 2000 up to March 2001. How is it that these vouchers were with Grand Court when Mr Xie was supposed to have kept all such vouchers as a matter of course? The other interesting point was that, according to Mr Gwee, Grand Court’s letter of June 1999 setting out the amounts paid to Mr Ang was drafted by Mr Xie who had the vouchers at that time. However, in the prior letter of May 1999, Grand Court had told Mr Ang’s solicitors that they were “unable to provide you copies of our payment vouchers”. During the assessment hearing when Mr Gwee was cross-examined as to why Grand Court had not provided the payment records when Mr Xie was still alive, he was not able to give a plausible answer. All Mr Gwee said was that he had left the computation of the sums paid to Mr Ang to Mr Xie and since Mr Xie had since died, Grand Court was unable to furnish the documents. In these circumstances, I find much merit in Ms Lee’s submission that Mr Gwee’s explanation for not producing the payment records was not satisfactory and should not be accepted. She further submitted that Mr Gwee was simply using the death of Mr Xie as a convenient excuse for not providing documentary proof of the alleged payments to Mr Ang by Grand Court. I accept that submission. In my view, the June 1999 letter from Grand Court cannot be accepted at face value as documentary proof of the amounts allegedly paid to Mr Ang by Grand Court or that he earned $4,509 a month by reason of his work for them.
40        Mr Gwee did, however, produce copious records showing payments made by Grand Court for outdoor catering services during the 16 months between May 2000 and August 2001. It would appear from these documents that there were fewer functions per month during these 16 months than there had been per month during the years 1996 to 1998. The amounts paid out varied between a high of $28,824.82 in May 2000 and a low of $5,230.90 in March 2001 with the average monthly payment being some $15,434.30. This contrasts with the much higher average figure of some $30,000 a month for the earlier period. If Mr Ang had been working for Grand Court between May 2000 and August 2001, then at a profit rate of 15%, he would have earned approximately $2,315 per month.
41        Mr Ang also relied on his own oral evidence of his income and the supporting oral evidence of Mr Gwee. In the defendant’s written submissions, there are numerous attacks on Mr Ang’s credibility and many of these have considerable force. First, there was the issue of what he had told his doctors regarding his occupation. Before the assessment hearing took place and during the time when he was operating “68 Kopitiam”, Mr Ang had been examined by two orthopaedic surgeons, Dr Tho Kam Sam and Dr Yeo Khee Quan. He told Dr Yeo that he worked in a coffee shop as a daily-rated worker and Dr Tho that he was an assistant in a coffee shop. He was asked why he had done this. His answers were evasive and prevaricating. This is the exchange that took place:
Q:         You informed the doctor that you are an assistant of a coffeeshop. That is not correct?
A:         Why is it not correct?
Q:         Because you are the owner.
A:         The owner also works.
Q:         But an owner has assistants. They are different.
A:         What do you mean it is different?
Q:         Owner and assistant are different?
A:         Are you saying that if I employ others, I need not work?
Q:         I am saying that the description is different.
A:         I do not understand.
Secondly, in relation to this issue of his position in the coffee shop, Mr Ang tried to explain that he was only a sole proprietor “in name” but was unable to give a credible explanation as to what he meant when he said “in name”. Instead, he claimed that he became the sole proprietor of the coffee shop business because his intended partner had withdrawn from it and he had no choice but to carry on the business on his own. Mr Singh tried to repair the damage during re-examination by asking Mr Ang whether the job he did in the coffee shop was like the job of a coffee shop assistant or that of a boss who sat back and acted like a boss. Mr Ang replied that he had to assist in the work because he was used to working and could not sit still. Then when he was asked directly by Mr Singh why he had told the doctor that he was a coffee shop assistant when he was also the sole proprietor, Mr Ang replied by asking “Is there anything wrong with saying that?” It was significant that even before entering court Mr Ang had been quite willing to misrepresent his occupation and income earning ability.
42        Secondly, Mr Ang was unable to provide a consistent and credible account of the circumstances in which he went into the coffee shop business. He claimed initially that he had been approached by a person whose name he could not remember to go into this business but this person had subsequently withdrawn. Then he said that this person had put in 50% of the money needed for the coffee shop. Subsequently, he said that this partner had withdrawn because he did not dare venture into the business and that he had withdrawn before he put in the money. Later he said that in July 1999, someone supported him and he was the one that contributed the 50%. This person was not the partner but did it out of his relationship with Mr Ang. When asked to identify this person, Mr Ang said it was his best friend. He was then asked for the name of his friend and after being pressed, he said that there were two persons who supported him, his father-in-law and his elder brother, who loaned him $20,000 and $30,000 respectively. This part of the cross-examination took place in the morning. In the afternoon, Mr Ang’s memory made a remarkable recovery and he remembered that his first partner was named Mr Yeo. He then said that Mr Yeo did not put in any money at all and admitted that previously when he had said that his partner had put in 50% of the money required, he was referring to Mr Yeo.
43        Mr Ang also claimed that he had no choice but to take over the coffee shop business when his partner withdrew. It subsequently transpired, however, that he had had a choice. The withdrawal took place in March 1999. At that stage, Mr Ang was not committed to renting the premises. The tenancy agreement was only signed in October 1999 and therefore there was no reason, other than his own desire to do business, why Mr Ang had to go ahead with the business when Mr Yeo withdrew.
44        Mr Ang was also less than candid when queried on his income from his coffee shop business, in particular for his income for the year ending December 1999, the year in which he commenced the business. He had initially denied that he had profit and loss statements for that year and asserted that he did not submit any income tax returns for the year ending December 1999. When the income tax return forms as well as the notice of assessment of income tax were brought to his attention, he claimed he could not remember or that he had no knowledge of the income tax documents submitted as some other parties had submitted the forms on his behalf.
45        Ms Lee submitted, and I agree, that Mr Ang’s evidence regarding the number of workers he employed for the coffee shop and the income received and expenses incurred in respect of this business contained many inconsistencies. He was unable to provide any credible explanation for the discrepancy between his profit and loss accounts submitted to the tax authorities and his loss and expense book for the business. After being pressed on these matters, Mr Ang admitted that he was prepared to falsify his income tax returns so that he would have less tax to pay.
46        Another area in which Mr Ang’s evidence was not satisfactory was in respect of his relationship with Grand Court. His initial evidence was that he was strictly an independent contractor for Grand Court’s outdoor catering jobs. Mr Ang denied that he was in any way interested in or related to Grand Court or that he held any shares in the company. When it was put to him, however, that Grand Court’s records filed at the Registry of Companies showed him to be the holder of 51,000 ordinary shares in the company and its third largest shareholder, Mr Ang claimed that he was only a shareholder in name in that he had not paid for the shares. He further claimed that he had only agreed to be a shareholder in name because Mr Gwee had “wanted to find someone whom they can get along to set up the business, so I lent my name for this purpose”. He then said that he did not know how to explain how he came to own the shares but that it was Mr Gwee’s idea. Mr Gwee was satisfied with his performance as a sub-contractor and had found Mr Ang’s name could go along very well with the vegetarian business so Mr Gwee had given Mr Ang shares without any monetary contribution from him. Mr Gwee’s evidence, however, was not consistent with that of Mr Ang on this point. Mr Gwee said that the shares were not a gift to Mr Ang. Instead they had been paid for by commission earned by Mr Ang for procuring outdoor catering business for Grand Court.
47        The examples given above are not exhaustive of the difficulties with Mr Ang’s evidence. On perusing the notes of evidence it was clear to me that on many occasions Mr Ang was less than truthful. He was also an evasive witness. He was argumentative at times when he did not want to answer questions. He told lies, not only in court but also to doctors out of court. He admitted that his income tax returns were not truthful. He did not seem to see any difficulty in this but regarded under-declaration of income to be a necessary expedient in order to achieve his aim of paying little or no income tax. He also admitted that in the accounts of the coffee shop business that had been prepared for the income tax authorities, the expenses had been inflated in order to decrease the income earned from the business. Overall, Mr Ang was not a satisfactory witness. In my view it would be unsafe to rely on his oral testimony except to the extent that the same was backed up by documents or the oral evidence of other witnesses if the latter were credible.
48        As regards his income from Grand Court, Mr Ang relied on supporting oral evidence from Mr Gwee. Mr Gwee’s evidence was not free from difficulty either. First, as stated earlier, he was not able to give a credible explanation as to why Grand Court could not provide the records of payments made to Mr Ang. Secondly, he prevaricated in his evidence regarding how Mr Ang came to be a shareholder in Grand Court. There were also some inconsistencies in his evidence regarding Mr Ang’s role as the outdoor catering contractor. Initially, he said that all such contracts were obtained from Grand Court’s own customers and it was only after a contract was secured that Mr Ang’s services would be engaged. Subsequently, however, he stated that more than half of Grand Court’s outdoor catering contracts were procured by Mr Ang. Then, he said that Mr Ang had earned a commission for introducing customers to Grand Court and this is what had paid for Mr Ang’s shares. Subsequently, Mr Gwee claimed that the shares were bonus shares in respect of which no payment had been made by Mr Ang.
49        As plaintiff, Mr Ang had the burden of proving that he had suffered a loss of monthly earnings at the rate of $4,509 per month from the outdoor catering business. The evidence that he adduced in order to discharge that burden was not satisfactory. There was no proof that, on the balance of probabilities, Mr Ang earned $4,509 per month from his work for Grand Court before the accident. As the oral evidence was unreliable, I am thrown back on the documents. The documents produced showed that for the period from May 2000 to August 2001, if Mr Ang had been carrying out the catering services, he would have earned an average of $2,315 per month and that too, only if he was able to meet a profit margin of 15% which would have depended on some workers not turning up. Though to some extent speculative, in the present case, $2,315 is the safest figure on which to base any assessment of Mr Ang’s pre-trial loss of earnings. However, it would not be correct to award Mr Ang the full amount as monthly loss of earnings for the pre-trial period. This is because he did have an income from his coffee shop business during most of that period. That income would have to be deducted from the $2,315. The difficulty is that one does not know how much that income was since his records were unreliable. The assistant registrar thought that he could have earned $784 a month as a coffee shop assistant. This, in my view, was not a realistic figure. It was based on official statistics of what such a worker earned on average rather than on evidence of Mr Ang’s own earnings. Mr Ang’s own evidence was that while he was running the coffee shop, he had employed his brother as supervisor and paid him $1,300 a month. He had also paid two other full-time workers $1,100 a month. On that basis, Mr Ang would probably have paid himself at least $1,500 a month if not more since he said he needed at least $3,000 a month in order to support his family. There is no evidence, however, of exactly how much money Mr Ang took home each month from the coffee shop business. He might well have taken home much more than $2,315 a month.
50        One other issue must be addressed. Mr Ang had registered the coffee shop business before his accident. His claim was that his intention was to start up the business and run it concurrently with his outdoor catering services for Grand Court and that he would have done this if it had not been for the accident. Instead, once the accident took place he was not capable of going back to work for Grand Court and had to carry on the coffee shop business only. The medical evidence was that Mr Ang was no longer capable of carrying loads heavier than about 7kg. He was, however, as shown by evidence from a private detective who followed him around for a number of days, capable of working long hours, driving a van, and doing a certain amount of fetching and carrying. He could therefore have gone back to work for Grand Court had he so chosen and employed another worker to do the heavy carrying that he could no longer do. The wages for this worker might have cut into his profit but he would still have been able to earn something from the Grand Court business. The evidence also was that Mr Ang did not even try to see whether he could resume some outdoor catering for Mr Gwee. Mr Gwee stated that Mr Ang did not approach Grand Court for outdoor catering jobs after the accident and did not express any intention or interest in resuming this business when the two of them met after the accident. Mr Gwee also confirmed that he had no objections to resuming business dealings with Mr Ang as Mr Ang was still a shareholder in the business. Mr Chey, who had taken over supervision of the outdoor catering functions, also stated that he would have no objection to Mr Ang going back to being Grand Court’s outdoor caterer. Mr Chey’s evidence was that he was not being paid any additional salary for the additional responsibilities he had taken on and that if Mr Ang resumed the outdoor catering work, then Mr Chey himself would not have to work so hard.
51        On the evidence, it appears to me that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Ang chose not to go back to work as an outdoor catering contractor for Grand Court after the accident because he wanted to concentrate on building up his own coffee shop business. Although he might have intended originally to do both, his plans must have changed after March 1999 when his erstwhile partner withdrew and it became clear that Mr Ang would be solely responsible for the new business if he decided to go on with it. In these circumstances, I think that Mr Ang is only entitled to recover the loss of earnings from his job with Grand Court for the period between the accident and the time when he started the coffee shop business. There is no proof that he sustained any loss of income after that business started in October 1999. The fact that the coffee shop business may have done badly thus leading to its being closed four years after it commenced is beside the point. It was up to the plaintiff to produce reliable figures. In any case, if he chose to go into a risky business rather than go back to a tried and true occupation, the defendant cannot be expected to underwrite him. Going on the basis of $2,315 per month, this would give Mr Ang $6,945 for the three months from February to April 1999. Further, if he had gone back to work as an outdoor caterer in May 1999, between then and September 1999, he would have earned $1,100 less (see [54] below) due to his physical disabilities. Therefore his total loss for the period from February to September 1999 was $12,445. The defendant’s appeal on this item is allowed and the award is reduced to $12,445.
Post-trial loss of earnings
52        The assistant registrar considered that Mr Ang’s loss of earnings per month subsequent to the trial would not differ from his loss of earnings per month for the period before the trial as there would not be a change of the factors affecting the quantum of loss. She therefore used the same multiplicand of $3,389.75 as for the earlier loss of earnings calculation. To arrive at a multiplier, she considered that Mr Ang was already 45 years old at the time of the assessment and that his previous job relied heavily on manual labour. He would have to carry very heavy loads of up to 30kg and his ability to do so would naturally diminish with age. Taking these factors into consideration, she was of the view that a multiplier of six would be fair. Hence, Mr Ang’s future loss of earnings was calculated at $3,389.75 x 12 months x 6 years = $244,062. She also found that Mr Ang’s disability that caused him to be unable to lift heavy loads would not hamper him in the job market as the disability was very limited. Hence, she did not award any damages for any loss of earning capacity.
53        There is no reason why Mr Ang cannot go back to his work as an outdoor catering contractor. Mr Ang himself asserted that customers had only engaged Grand Court for their outdoor catering functions because of their relationship with Mr Ang. He can still do the supervisory work, provide the transportation and use his self-proclaimed good contacts with workers to procure the necessary staff for these functions. Further, Mr Gwee’s evidence was that Mr Ang brought in a lot of business and he would be happy to take Mr Ang back. Mr Chey also seemed to welcome the prospect. If Mr Ang did this, he would be able to earn as much as he did previously except that being handicapped by his medical condition, he would have to employ someone as a general worker to do all the heavy lifting that he himself is no longer capable of. The defendant submitted, based on Mr Ang’s evidence of hourly wage rates, that it would cost Mr Ang not more than $480 a month to employ a part-time worker to help with the loading. In my opinion, however, if Mr Ang is going to carry out the work of an outdoor caterer, he would need someone available all the time to do the loading and unloading and would find it difficult if he had to rely on 
ad hoc
 labour. Going by the salaries that Mr Ang paid his full-time workers in the coffee shop, it would cost him at least $1,100 a month to have such a full-time worker.
54        As there is no reliable evidence of Mr Ang’s loss of earnings from his employment as an outdoor catering contractor, in my judgment, this is one of those cases in which the appropriate award should be for loss of earning capacity rather than for loss of future earnings. On the basis that his earning capacity would be reduced by $1,100 a month because he could no longer carry heavy loads and would need to employ someone else for such work, that figure should be taken as the multiplicand for a loss of earning capacity award. As regards the multiplier, even the defendant considered that a multiplier of six years was too low and submitted that the appropriate multiplier would be eight years. Mr Singh submitted that the multiplier should be increased to ten years. The retirement age under s 4 of the Retirement Age Act (Cap 274A, 2000 Rev Ed) had been raised to 62 as from 1 January 1999. Most of the authorities on the calculation of the length of the multiplier had been decided prior to the change in 1999. He cited the cases of 
Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon
 
[1996] 3 SLR 513
, where an eight-year multiplier had been used for a 48-year-old plaintiff, 
Shela Devi d/o Perumal v Rawi Bin Nahari
 (Suit No 1191 of 1995, unreported) where an 11-year multiplier was used for a 41-year-old plaintiff and another unreported case, 
Surendamugam s/o Narayanasamy v Low Chong Hock
 
[1993] SGHC 130
, where a 12-year multiplier was used for a 39-year-old plaintiff.
55        I agree that the multiplier of six used in this case was too low. Prior to the accident, Mr Ang was a healthy man who carried out onerous physical tasks with little difficulty. If he had not been injured, he would have been physically capable of carrying on in his usual fashion for many years. As a self-employed person depending on his established business contacts, there would be no prefixed cut-off date for his employment in the catering business. Even after his injury, the evidence was that he was capable of working long hours and undertaking a variety of tasks including carrying loads of up to 7kg and doing quite a lot of lifting. In these circumstances and in view of the changes in how older workers are viewed, I think a multiplier of ten would be appropriate.
56        I therefore set aside the award for future loss of earnings of $244,062. In its place, I award Mr Ang $132,000 (being $1,100 per month for ten years) as loss of earning capacity.
Costs of future medical treatment
57        The assistant registrar accepted Dr Tho’s finding that Mr Ang’s fractured left clavicle had triggered the development of arthritis in the acromioclavicular joint which needed to be treated with medical supplements for the rest of his life. These cost $600 per year. The assistant registrar took into account Mr Ang’s then age of 45 years and his estimated life expectancy to arrive at a multiplier of 20 in order to calculate the damages for future medical expenses. The award under this head was $12,000 being $600 per year for 20 years.
58        The defendant appealed against that award. Ms Lee submitted that the multiplier of 20 was too high and that a multiplier of 10 to 12 years would be fair and reasonable. In support she cited various cases from the 
Practitioners’ Library — Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents
 (Butterworths Asia, 2001). Among those cases the highest multiplier given for cost of medical care was 17 years and that was in respect of a plaintiff aged about 33 at the time of the assessment. Mr Singh resisted any change being made to the multiplier. He pointed out that Mr Ang would need the medication for the rest of his life. Mr Singh’s submission was that a distinction had to be drawn between a multiplier used for future earnings which was based on retirement date and a multiplier used for medication since the latter should be based on life expectancy rather than retirement date. The retirement age is now 62 and according to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Health, the present life expectancy of a male Singaporean is approximately 76 years. Further, even on the award made by the assistant registrar, a discount had already been given for the cost of medication going up and more medication being required with the pain getting worse with age.
59        There is merit in Mr Singh’s argument that an award for medical costs should be related to life expectancy rather than the retirement age. In this case, further information provided by Mr Singh showed that a male Singaporean like Mr Ang who was born in 1958 had a life expectancy of 60.6 years as of the date of his birth. However, in view of advances in medical practice and general health standards, it is likely that Mr Ang would live beyond 60 years though no one can say whether he will live to 65 or more. I think the award of 20 as a multiplier was on the high side. I reduce it to 15 years. The award for future medical costs is therefore reduced to $9,000.
Conclusion
60        For the reasons given above, both appeals are allowed in part. The awards made below are set aside to the extent indicated earlier in this judgment and replaced by the awards made above. Overall, the defendant has been the more successful in his appeal in that the quantum of damages awarded to the plaintiff has been reduced considerably. I therefore award the defendant 70% of the costs of the appeal.",2004-03-16 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judith Prakash J:
Background
1          In December 2000, China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd (“China Construction”), was carrying out construction works at the premises of the Nanyang Technological University (“the site”). On 26 December, one of the carpenters employed by China Construction, one Shao Hai, became involved in a fight with another worker, one Cao Yong Hui. Cao hit Shao with a piece of metal and fractured the latter’s hands.
2          In May 2001, Shao started this action in the District Court. The original defendants were Cao, three other co-workers and China Construction. Judgment in default of appearance was obtained against three of the defendants including Cao, but China Construction contested liability and the action went for trial. In July 2002, the district judge delivered judgment and held China Construction to be 50% liable for Shao’s injuries. The district judge found Shao himself to be 50% liable for his own injuries as he had provoked Cao and had thus been the co-author of his own misfortunes. China Construction has appealed.
The action below
3          In Shao’s statement of claim, two causes of action were pleaded against China Construction. The first was that it was vicariously liable for the wrongful acts of Cao and the other three co-defendants when they assaulted Shao. The second was that it was negligent at common law because it had failed to provide a safe and secure system of work at the site, proper supervision and/or safe fellow employees.
4          The facts that emerged at the trial were as follows. The construction project undertaken by China Construction involved the alteration of various buildings on the site in order to expand the teaching facilities available at the Nanyang Technological University. The work had to be done at different locations on the site. Shao, a Chinese national and a construction carpenter with some 15 years’ experience, had come to Singapore in April 2000 to work for China Construction. His duties as a construction carpenter included all carpentry work and the erection and stripping of formwork. At the material time, he was working at block N1.1.
5          On the morning of 26 December 2000, the foreman in charge of the carpenters on site had instructed Shao and a fellow carpenter to assemble a metal frame for the construction of the flooring between the third and fourth storeys of block N1.1. Once the frame was in place, the metal workers would install reinforced steel rebars and thereafter concrete would be poured into the frame. The work was done at a height of about 6m above ground level and both the carpenters and the metal workers had to work on a platform at this level. The carpenters had to assemble the frame using metal moulds or formwork and the metal workers had to bring the steel rebars up to the platform so that they could be inserted inside the assembled formwork.
6          Just before the lunch break Shao and his co-worker managed to collect all the formwork of the various sizes that were needed to fit the construction area. At about three o’clock in the afternoon, Shao discovered that one small piece of formwork was missing. He searched for it and found it on the platform being used as a support for some heavy steel rebars. He asked the metal workers present to give it back to him. When his request was not acceded to, he walked over to retrieve the missing formwork himself. When he pulled it away from the rebars, they fell off the platform onto the ground 6m below. The steel workers were upset as they had spent the whole morning carrying the bars by hand up to the platform. A heated argument and scuffle then broke out between Shao and Cao who was the team leader of the steel workers. Shao assaulted Cao by punching his face and kicking his leg. Under this sudden and grave provocation, Cao retaliated by hitting Shao with a piece of formwork. Shao’s hands were fractured when he tried to protect himself against being so hit. Subsequently, Cao was charged with the offence of causing grievous hurt to Shao under grave and sudden provocation under s 335 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to ten weeks’ imprisonment. Thereafter, he was deported to China.
7          At the trial of this action, evidence as to what had happened on the day in question was given by the investigating officer; Shao himself; one Jin Jie who was a site supervisor; one Guo Man Dong, the site manager and one Zhao Shen Ping who was a worker on the project. The trial judge considered this evidence in the context of whether the two causes of action had been substantiated. In relation to the claim of vicarious liability, the judge cited 
Salmond on Torts
 (13th Ed, 1961) at 122 to the effect that an employer was not responsible for a wrongful act done by his employee unless it had been done in the course of his employment. It would be deemed to be so done if it was either: (a) a wrongful act authorised by the employer or (b) a wrongful mode of doing an authorised act. The judge found that the illegal acts of assault committed by Cao on Shao during the fight were not acts that China Construction could be said to have expressly or impliedly authorised.
8          The judge further found that Shao could have, as he himself admitted, come down from the platform and walked to the base of the tower crane to get another piece of formwork instead of retrieving the piece on the platform. Shao had acted recklessly and dangerously by displacing the steel rebars from the six-metre high platform. This in itself was not a wrongful mode of doing an authorised act. Shao had been motivated “by nothing more than sheer perversity rather than any misguided attempt to finish his assigned task”. Further, “all the plaintiff’s and defendant’s acts against each other that afternoon were retaliatory destructive acts against each other”. The judge therefore concluded that there was no basis for a claim of vicarious liability in this case. Shao has not appealed against that finding.
9          In relation to the second basis of claim, following the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd
 
[1999] 4 SLR 579
, the judge stated that the common law duty that an employer owes his employees in relation to the system of work is to provide:
(a). a competent staff of men;
(b). adequate material; and
(c). a proper system of, and effective, supervision.
10        In relation to this head of claim, the trial judge held that the events on the material day had taken place in the following sequence:
(a)        Shao discovered that a piece of formwork he intended to use was missing, he went to look for the formwork and found it wedged below a pile of steel rebars.
(b)        Shao retrieved his formwork, causing the rebars to fall onto the floor below. When the bars hit the ground, there was an extremely loud clattering sound and that was loud enough for China Construction’s supervisor, Mr Jin, to hear even though he was in the toilet at that time.
(c)        Cao and three co-workers saw this happening and reacted by moving over to Shao’s work area.
(d)        Either Cao alone or all four workers proceeded to dismantle the formwork and this resulted in more construction materials raining onto the ground below.
(e)        Shao attempted to protect his formwork layout. As the metal workers approached Shao, he cowered down and attempted to cover the undemolished formwork and protect it.
(f)         Shao was manhandled by the four metal workers who pulled him into an upright position.
(g)        Shao resisted and a struggle ensued.
(h)        Shao hit Cao on the face and also kicked him.
(i)         Cao’s three co-workers either restrained Shao or attempted to separate the two or (as Shao himself testified) did not involve themselves in the fight.
(j)         Cao retrieved a piece of formwork and attacked Shao with it.
(k)        Shao used both hands to block the descending formwork piece wielded by Cao and sustained the bilateral fractures of his hands.
11        The judge considered that China Construction must have been aware that Cao had a propensity for violence because the site manager Guo had referred to both Cao and Shao as having been frequently warned not to engage in illegal fights. Guo had also assessed Shao as a known troublemaker who had gone through several supervisors before the incident. The judge also found that in so far as the system of work was concerned “there was a considerable degree of chaos on 26 December 2000, when the tower crane had broken down” (
[2004] SGDC 181
 at [84]). According to him, the fatigue of the metal workers caused by having to lug the heavy steel rebars up the scaffolding, combined with the restricted space in which the carpentry and metal workers had to work together and the time pressures on them to complete their tasks had contributed to “a volatile mix when [Shao] engaged in his perverse and ill-considered act of pulling his form work away from the pile of iron bars resting on it” (at [84] and [85]). The judge’s conclusions (at [91]) may be summarised as follows:
(a)        Shao’s injury was ultimately caused by a blow from Cao wielding the piece of formwork and this blow occurred at the last stage of the altercation between Cao and Shao.
(b)        Jin was elsewhere at that time and only reacted to the sound of poles falling onto the ground. He was the only supervisor in the immediate vicinity and had been tasked to supervise building works that were far apart. The level of supervision was woefully inadequate.
(c)        On the facts, the interval between the time when China Construction would have received a warning that something was amiss at the worksite and the time when the injury was inflicted was sufficiently long for it to have intervened and prevented the injury. Jin’s failure to intervene and take steps to suppress the fight was a failure to maintain proper supervision.
(d)        The negligence of China Construction was not premised on the mere fact that there was a fight between Cao and Shao, but rather that the injury was a preventable one that could have been avoided if China Construction had taken adequate measures to control the possibility of fights or to ensure that any fight that started was quickly suppressed before the combatants seriously injured each other. The injury was not the result of an un-preventable affray or a sudden fight.
The appeal
The law
12        The basis of China Construction’s liability to Shao was that it had been found negligent in the performance of its duty to ensure that, as its employee, he was provided with a safe and secure system of work and proper supervision. Neither counsel was able to cite another case in which it had been found that an employee’s injuries arising from a fight with a co-worker had in fact been due to a breach of the employer’s duty to provide a safe system of work and proper supervision. As noted in para 10-38 of 
Charlesworth & Percy on Negligence
 (10th Ed, 2001) “[i]f an employer has reason to anticipate his employee’s misconduct, which is likely to be dangerous to fellow employees, the employer is under a duty to those other workmen to take reasonable steps to avoid harm arising from it”. In the first instance a reprimand would be sufficient but repeated misconduct might put a duty on the employer to dismiss the errant worker. It is also stated in that paragraph that an employer could be held liable for employing a workman who was known to be vicious and dangerous if a fellow worker is injured in an attack. The cases cited in the text to support the foregoing statements of law did not, for the most part, deal with injuries arising from fights. It is instructive, however, to examine some of these authorities in more detail.
13        In 
Smith v Crossley Brothers, Ltd
 (1951) 95 SJ 655, the plaintiff was an apprentice employed in the apprentice training school of the defendant company. While he was working at a vice, another apprentice approached him from behind and placed a compressed air pipe near his rectum and signalled to a third apprentice to turn on the compressed air. In the result, the plaintiff sustained rupture of the colon. He sued the defendants for damages for negligence but they contended that the injuries were caused by unauthorised acts of the two apprentices in question. The trial judge held that the defendants had not exercised adequate supervision over the apprentices and that lack of supervision was the cause of the plaintiff’s injuries and constituted negligence. The defendants’ appeal against his finding was successful. The English Court of Appeal held, with regard to the alleged lack of supervision, that the compressed air pipe had been in the same position for ten years and no accident had happened before. The defendants had no reason whatsoever to anticipate that the two apprentices in question would use it in that way. The duty of an employer towards his employees was to take reasonable care for their safety and the evidence did not show any negligence by the defendants. The injury to the plaintiff resulted from what was wilful misbehaviour by the other two boys and the wicked act which the defendants had no reason to foresee.
14        In 
Hudson v Ridge Manufacturing Co Ltd
 
[1957] 2 QB 348
, the plaintiff suffered a fractured wrist when he was tripped by a fellow employee who was indulging in horseplay. This employee had made a nuisance of himself to his fellow employees for nearly four years by persistently engaging in skylarking activities. The defendant employers knew this. Their foreman had reprimanded the employee many times but without effect. The plaintiff successfully claimed against the defendants for damages on the ground that they had failed to maintain such discipline among their employees as would protect him from dangerous horseplay. 
Smith v Crossley Brothers Ltd
 was distinguished on the basis that in that case the injury was due to something that had never happened before whereas in 
Hudson
 the evidence was that the employee concerned had been in the habit of tripping up co-employees over and over again. Streatfeild J held that if a fellow workman was not merely incompetent, but by his habitual conduct likely to prove a source of danger to his fellow employee, a duty lay fairly and squarely on the employers to remove that source of danger.
15        In a third case, 
Coddington v International Harvester Company of Great Britain Ltd
 (1969) 6 KIR 146, the 
Smith
 case was applied and the 
Hudson
 case was distinguished. There, the defendants employed M as a workman in their foundry for 16 years. M was a known practical joker though his conduct had not caused any danger to his fellow workmen. The plaintiff was injured when M flicked a lighted tin of thinners with his foot to tease another workman, X. X was scorched and, in the agony of the moment, kicked the tin violently so that it upset and enveloped the plaintiff in a sheet of flame causing him severe injuries. The plaintiff sued his employers on the ground of vicarious liability and for failing to provide adequate supervision and control. Ormrod J, in dismissing the plaintiff’s case against the defendants, said at 151:
There was nothing in his previous conduct to suggest that he might endanger any other man’s safety in the foundry although he obviously might annoy some and amuse others. I do not think anyone would suggest that the defendants could possibly have foreseen any accident remotely resembling the one that happened …
and at 152–153:
This case seems to me to fall on the 
Smith v Crossley Brothers
 … side of the line rather than on the 
Hudson v Ridge Manufacturing Co Ltd
 … side of it. In 
Hudson
’s case … the employers knew that their employee was given to tripping people up and other kinds of horseplay, and were held liable for an accident to a fellow employee caused in just such horseplay by knocking the man down and breaking his wrist. In the present case there is no suggestion of any previous conduct by [M] which had caused danger or any reasonable apprehension of danger.
In these circumstances I am unable to hold the defendants liable for this accident.
16        In each of the above cases, an employee tried to make his employer responsible for injuries caused by the playful actions of another employee. The cases had differing outcomes and the vital distinction between the one in which the plaintiff was successful and the two in which he failed lay in the knowledge of the employers as to the actions of the misbehaving employee and the likely outcome of such actions. The employers in 
Hudson
 were held liable because they failed in their duty to provide a safe working environment for their employees because they continued to employ a co-worker whom they knew to be someone whose habitual behaviour could injure the other workers. In the other two cases, no such injuries to the workers concerned could have been anticipated from the prior conduct of the co-workers concerned.
17        There were only two cases that involved a fight between employees. The first of these, 
Walden v Court Line, Ltd
 (1965) 109 SJ 151, was cited by 
Charlesworth & Percy
. There, the plaintiff, a ship’s cook employed by the defendants on board their vessel, was the victim of a violent and vicious attack upon him by H, another member of the crew. H was not on duty at that time. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants knew or ought to have known that H was a dangerous man and likely to attack crew members for no good reason and yet had kept him in their employment. The attack on the plaintiff took place in July. In January of the same year, when the vessel was captained by Capt B, H had assaulted two other crew members. By July, the ship was under the command of Capt C. The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The judge stated that the plaintiff could only succeed if he could show that the defendants, by their servant the master of the ship, were negligent. The plaintiff’s real case was that the entries in the log relating to the January attack made it manifest that H was a danger to his shipmates. It was conceded that no blame attached to Capt C and on the evidence the judge could not say that it was incompetent and negligent of Capt B not to make up his mind that H should be got rid of.
18        The report of the case is very brief. It is difficult to discern the reasons for the judge’s decision as it certainly seems to have been arguable that Capt B would have known after the second attack in January that H was a violent man who was liable to harm his shipmates and thus that it was negligent of him not to have dismissed H. The case, however, is authority for the proposition that it may be negligent of an employer not to dismiss a worker whom he knows to be a danger to co-workers.
19        The second case which involved a fight between employees was a local case, 
Nani v Public Utilities Board
 
[1980–1981] SLR 406
. There, a widow claimed compensation under s 3 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act 1975 (Act 25 of 1975) on the basis that her husband had died in the course of his employment. The deceased, one Veloo, had been assigned to work in a team with one Rozario. While they were doing the work, an argument arose. This escalated and Veloo slapped Rozario and Rozario retaliated by pushing him. Veloo then fell backwards onto the floor and fractured his skull and died. The commissioner of workmen’s compensation held that the incident resulting in the death of Veloo did not occur in the course of his employment nor did it arise out of his employment. The widow’s claim was accordingly dismissed. She appealed to the High Court. Kulasekaram J allowed the appeal. He considered the facts and held that there was nothing personal in the argument between Veloo and Rozario. What had given rise to the dispute was the concern of both employees to carry out their work properly and therefore the dispute was in the course of the employment. He added (at 408, [12]):
Moreover when workers with the low level of education as the deceased and Rozario are asked to work as a team by their employer, with very little direct on the spot supervision as here, disputes such as these over the manner in which the work is to be carried out can by no means be said to be unexpected. Such incidents are incidental to and here manifestly arose out of their employment in working as a team. The deceased sustained these personal injuries in an accident in the course and arising out of his employment within the meaning of s 3 of the Act.
In that case, the question before the judge was whether, for the purposes of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the deceased had died from an accident that had occurred in the course of his employment. That was the sole question before the judge. He did not consider and did not have to consider whether there was any fault on the part of the employers. For the purposes of compensation under the Act, what was important was not whether the employer was negligent or not but whether the injury was sustained in the course of employment. The purpose of the Act is to provide compensation for workers who are injured in circumstances in which the common law would afford them no remedy. The observation of the judge, that disputes over the way work is to be done are not unexpected and arise in the course of employment, has to be read in that context.
20        Before I go on to discuss the judge’s findings in this case, I note the following established principles with regard to the role of an appellate court:
(a)        an appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial judge’s findings of fact which depend on the credibility and veracity of witnesses;
(b)        however, an appellate court would still need to test the quality of the evidence against inherent probabilities or against uncontroverted facts, including the conduct of the parties at the relevant time; in this respect, the appellate court is in as good a position as the court of first instance; and
(c)        where the credibility of the witnesses is not in issue and the only concern of the appellate court is to determine whether the trial judge has drawn proper inferences from the facts, the appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to evaluate the evidence.

Analysis
21        The judge stressed that China Construction ought to have anticipated the incident because it had frequently warned Cao and Shao not to engage in illegal fights and also knew that Shao was a troublemaker. This finding was, however, against the weight of the evidence. Whilst Mr Guo had stated that both these workers had been frequently warned not to engage in illegal fights, this statement was made in the context of his evidence that weekly meetings had been held at which all workers were reminded to observe safety procedures and the laws of Singapore including the prohibition against engaging in illegal activity such as fighting at the site. It was not Mr Guo’s evidence nor was it put to him by Shao’s counsel that either Shao or Cao had previously engaged in any fight or shown any inclination towards fighting with anyone. On the contrary, the evidence was that there was no fight on site at all between any of the workers before the incident of 26 December 2000. Until the incident, therefore, China Construction’s efforts to ensure that the workers conducted themselves properly while on the site had been successful.
22        Further, while prior to the incident Shao was known as a difficult worker who appeared to have some interpersonal relationship problems with his supervisors, these problems did not involve any physical interaction. Shao had simply complained frequently about his supervisors. No evidence was led of any propensity to violence on the part of Shao, much less on the part of Cao.
23        In determining whether China Construction had failed to provide a safe system of work and proper supervision, the correct question to ask, as submitted by Mr Tan, counsel for China Construction, was whether Cao had a propensity to violence which China Construction knew about or ought to have known about in order to have anticipated that more supervision was required of any site where Cao was working. It was not Shao’s pleaded case, nor was any evidence adduced by him, that Cao was a difficult worker or was a man who was prone to violence when under stress or otherwise. Mr Guo’s evidence was that neither Cao nor any of the other three metal workers sued by Shao had had any previous record of fighting or assaulting other workers or even of any sort of disciplinary problem at all. This evidence was not challenged.
24        Finally, before the incident, there was no known animosity between Shao and Cao which would have alerted China Construction that it should not put these two workers together or, if that could not be helped, that it should provide constant supervision during the course of their works so as to ensure that they did not fight with each other. Shao’s own evidence was that he had not known Cao at all before the incident. Shao had been on the site only seven days prior to the incident and he said it was not possible for him to have known Cao. He also agreed that the affray was a sudden and spontaneous incident. In any event, it was not part of Shao’s case that there was any previous fight at the site or any previous incident which would have required China Construction to step up the level of supervision in anticipation of potential trouble.
25        The next important part of the judge’s finding was that there was chaos in China Construction’s system of work on 26 December because the tower crane had broken down. There was, he thought, a volatile mix arising from the facts that the metal workers had to work in close proximity with the carpenters, the two groups of workers would be working at a height and would be extremely likely to get into each others’ way, the metal workers were fatigued after carrying the steel rebars up to the platform and they had to improvise with the formwork as a support in order to keep the rebars on the platform.
26        These findings by the judge were not based on any pleadings of Shao or any evidence raised by him in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. It was not his case therefore that the circumstances in which he and Cao had to work that day had given rise to a situation in which fights could be expected or that these circumstances were out of the ordinary. As the well-known case of 
Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd v Intraco Ltd
 
[1992] 2 SLR 793
 reiterated, a court is not allowed to make a finding or give a decision on material facts which have not been pleaded. A party is required by O 18 rr 7 and 15(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev Ed) to set out in his pleadings all material facts on which he relies for his claim so as to inform the opponent in advance of the case to be met so that the latter would have adequate opportunity to prepare and present his own case. Here, the particulars of negligence given by Shao in his statement of claim were very general. It was asserted that China Construction had failed to take precautions for Shao’s safety while he was carrying out his work; that it had failed to provide a safe system of work and that it had failed to provide proper supervision for the workers at the site. Subsequently, when further and better particulars were asked for, Shao had pleaded that the system of work was unsafe because China Construction had:
(a)        given deadlines to its workers which put them under pressure;
(b)        failed to provide sufficient formwork and/or to make formwork easily accessible; and
(c)        failed to train its workers to follow proper procedures and not take formwork away from another worker.
It was not asserted even at this stage that the system was unsafe because once the crane broke down, the metal workers would have to carry steel rods manually and this would fatigue them and cause them to be vulnerable to provocation. Nor was it alleged that it was wrong to require metal workers and carpenters to work on the same small platform. Perhaps that omission was because, as Shao admitted during cross-examination, all along during the works the metal workers and the carpenters had worked side by side.
27        As Shao did not raise the material facts contributing to the “volatile mix” in his pleadings, his allegations in relation to the same which were raised only in cross-examination should have been rejected by the judge.
28        The third basis of the judge’s finding that China Construction had been negligent in its duty of supervision was that there had been “a sufficiently long interval” for it to intervene and prevent any injury. Mr Tan submitted that this conclusion was speculative and not supported by evidence. This was because none of the witnesses had been asked for, or had given, any evidence as to how long the scuffle had actually lasted. Mr Jin’s evidence was that he had rushed out of the toilet immediately after he heard the sound of the falling rods and that the toilet was close enough to the site of the fight for him to see the fighting as soon as he emerged from it. He saw Shao and Cao fisting and kicking each other and four other workers attempting to separate the two. He also saw Cao pick up the metal piece and hit Shao with it. He had shouted at them to stop behaving badly and to come down to the ground. This evidence emerged during cross-examination. It was not, however, put to Mr Jin that there was sufficient time for him to have stopped the fight before the assault took place.
29        With respect, the judge’s conclusion that there was a long enough interval during which Mr Jin could have intervened was probably caused by the way he separated what had occurred during the fight into 11 distinctive acts as set out in [10] above. The judge noted that the sound of the metal bars clattering 6m down to the ground was event no 2 in the sequence and stated that since that alerted Mr Jin, he would have had sufficient time to do something between then and event no 11 which was when the metal formwork was brought down on Shao’s hands. This was pure speculation. As submitted by Mr Tan, the judge’s separation of the sequence of events into 11 distinct events was artificial and minute and could have given rise to an impression in his mind that the fight had taken quite a bit of time when there was no real evidence to that effect. It was submitted that the judge had fallen into the trap of being wise after the event. There is much force in this submission.
30        The judge also found that Shao would “in all probability not have suffered the injury” if China Construction had had adequate supervision at the worksite and “stopped the fight before that blow was struck”. He considered the supervision inadequate because there was only one supervisor in the immediate vicinity who was tasked to supervise building works that were far apart. In fact at the material time, the supervisor Mr Jin was at the right block but he was in the toilet and there was no other supervisor observing the works of the carpenters and the metal workers on the platform in question. The judge’s finding that the supervision was inadequate therefore necessarily meant that he considered that adequate supervision required the permanent presence of a supervisor.
31        The evidence of Mr Guo was that in December 2000, China Construction had at least six supervisors at the site. For better control and supervision, the workers were grouped according to their skills 
ie
 whether they were carpenters or metal workers, and each group was divided into three or four smaller groups with one sub-supervisor or foreman for each group. Mr Jin’s evidence was that he was one of three supervisors in charge of the carpenters and that he had 30 workers, including Shao, under his charge. His workers worked at two blocks and it was his routine to inspect both blocks after lunch. First, he went to block LT1 and then after 45 minutes or so, he walked to the block where Shao worked, block N1.1, and inspected it. This was his usual routine and no fights had taken place at either block prior to 26 December 2000. There was no evidence that Mr Jin was an incompetent foreman or that in the construction industry it was necessary, much less customary, to have a supervisor observing each group of workers all the time. There was no evidence either that Shao or Cao were inexperienced workers who needed extra supervision in order to be able to perform their work properly, unlike the situation in 
Parno’s
 case.
32        In 
Latimer v A E C Ld
 
[1953] AC 643
, the House of Lords was unanimous that when judging whether there had been a breach of duty on the part of an employer with regard to the safety of his employees, one had to apply the standard of care which an ordinary prudent employer would have taken in all the circumstances. Lord Tucker pointed out at 658 that the common law duty was a duty to take reasonable care for the safety of the employee rather than an absolute duty. He further said:
[I]t appears to me desirable in these days, when there are in existence so many statutes and statutory regulations imposing absolute obligations upon employers, that the courts should be vigilant to see that the common law duty owed by a master to his servants should not be gradually enlarged until it is barely distinguishable from his absolute statutory obligations.
Mr Tan submitted that the standard of care that was required of China Construction to Shao was not to anticipate and guard against every conceivable eventuality but rather only to take reasonable precautions for the safety of its workers having regard to the nature of the construction works, the skill level of the workers and the general conditions of the site. I accept that submission.
33        In the present case, there was no reason for China Construction to anticipate a fight between Shao and Cao. Neither of them had been involved in fights before. The carpenters and the metal workers had worked side by side on site without any disciplinary problem previously. The normal level of supervision had been satisfactory previously. The two workers concerned did not know each other and had no history of interpersonal animosity. Shao had not been able to get on with his foremen but his difficulties with them had not involved any physical assaults. The fight occurred because, as the judge found, Shao had acted perversely by retrieving his formwork from below the steel bars instead of going to get a new piece. His action caused a number of steel bars to fall to the ground and thereafter, as the judge found, his and Cao’s actions against each other were retaliatory destructive acts within a vicious tit-for-tat cycle. The fight occurred suddenly. It could not have been anticipated. Unfortunately, no supervisor was present to stop things from going too far and Shao was hurt. He himself, however, had, as the judge also found, provoked Cao and been co-author of his own misfortune. The circumstances were unfortunate but it is a truism that unfortunate circumstances can occur without negligence on the part of an employer. The weight of the evidence did not support the finding that Shao’s injury resulted from any breach of duty on the part of China Construction.
34        Further, Shao had breached the safety rules by recklessly causing the steel bars to fall off the platform and had breached the “no fighting” rule by hitting Cao on the face and kicking him. The essence of Shao’s claim is that China Construction is liable to compensate him because he was able to act badly since the supervisor was not around all the time. Since China Construction did not save him from himself, it has to pay him for the consequences of his own misdeeds. In my view, it would not be correct to allow Shao to recover compensation from China Construction from injuries that arose by reason of his own wrongful behaviour.

Delivered by Chao Hick Tin JA
1 This was an appeal against the decision of Rajendran J where he decided that the appellants, Hermant Govindprasad Bansal (""Bansal"") and his wife, Aneeta Bansal, (hereinafter collectively referred to as ""the Bansals"") were liable for conversion and for dishonest assistance in breach of trust in connection with certain shipping and related documents belonging to the respondents, the Central Bank of India (""CBI""). Damages were awarded against the Bansals. We heard the appeal on 26 November 2002 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
The facts
2 The trial was a consolidation of three suits instituted by CBI against the Bansals and another party, Natsyn Fibres Pte Ltd (""Natsyn""). Natsyn was a company incorporated in Singapore with the Bansals as the only shareholders and directors. The action against Natsyn was not proceeded with because the latter was wound up before the trial began.
3 In 1997, Natsyn purchased certain goods from two Indian companies, Bhagwati Cottons Ltd (‘Bhagwati’) and GPB Fibres Ltd (""GPB""). Bhagwati and GPB were founded by Bansal’s father and were family companies. At all material times, Bansal was a director and held substantial equity interest in both companies.
4 To effect the purchase, Natsyn obtained the issue of a letter of credit from Campagnie Financiere De Cic Et De L’Union Europeene (""CF Bank"") and another from Mees Pierson NV, (""Mees Pierson""). Both LCs were governed by the UCP 500 and the credit was available by negotiation. The beneficiaries of the credit were Bhagwati and GPB. For the purpose of the trial, the parties had not differentiated between Bhagwati and GPB. Therefore, hereinafter, reference to ""Bhagwati"" shall include ""GPB"".
5 Upon shipment of the goods, Bhagwati presented the requisite documents to CBI for negotiation under the LCs (""LC documents"") and was paid. CBI placed its stamp on all the documents. Subsequently, CBI handed the LC documents back to Bhagwati, without having received payment from either Bhagwati or any other party. Eventually, the documents came into the possession of Natsyn, who, without paying for the same, used the documents to obtain delivery of the goods. Thereafter, Natsyn sold the goods to a third party. By the time CBI realised what had happened and sought payment, Natsyn did not have the funds to pay in full. It effected only partial payments leaving outstanding the sums of US$1,190.893.28 and $274,319.04 under the two LCs, which formed the subject matter of the action.
Decision below
6 The action was based on conversion, conspiracy and dishonest assistance to a breach of trust. The trial below ended with the Bansals electing to submit that they had no case to answer. The trial judge, accepted that submission insofar as the claim was based on the tort of conspiracy. In his view, there was simply nothing to indicate any conspiracy as no evidence was presented to show the circumstances under which the LC documents were handed over by CBI to Bhagwati and, in turn, to Natsyn.
7 However, the judge found that there was a 
prima facie
 case of conversion and dishonest assistance. He based his determination primarily on the fact that CBI were entitled to the documents having paid for them. Natsyn, and in turn the Bansals, would have known that CBI had negotiated the documents as the CBI stamp appeared on all the documents. Ordinarily, the documents would have come through the issuing banks, i.e., CF Bank and Mees Pierson, in exchange for payments by Natsyn. However, Natsyn did not pay for the documents and the Bansals, being the directors in charge of Natsyn, would have known of that. The Bansals, being the mind behind Natsyn, nevertheless used the documents to obtain delivery of the goods and disposed of them.
Appeal
8 In the appeal, the Bansals raised two broad issues. The first was that the trial judge had not applied the correct test in determining whether there was a case to answer. The second was, whether there was sufficient evidence upon which the court could enter judgment in favour of CBI.
9 The Bansals submitted that, in the absence of any evidence to show how, and why, the documents were handed over to Bhagwati, there was no basis to hold that they had committed conversion or rendered dishonest assistance to a breach of trust.
The correct test
10 The trial judge, having noted the views of the authors of the book, 
Aronson & Hunter on
 
""Litigation: Evidence and Procedure""
 (16
th
 Edn), at p. 732, stated (at ¶21 of his Grounds of Judgment) that –
""A decision by a defendant not to adduce evidence in his defence is a decision that ought not to be lightly taken. Where a defendant makes such an election, the result will be that the court is left with only the plaintiff’s version of the story. So long as there is some prima facie evidence that supports the essential limbs of the plaintiff’s claim(s), then the failure by the defendant to adduce evidence on his own behalf would be fatal to the defendant.""
11 Counsel for the Bansals submitted that, in accordance with the views of the Court of Appeal in 
Storey v Storey
 [1960] 3 All ER 279, there were two different circumstances where a defendant could submit that there was no case to answer and the consequence might not be the same for both circumstances should the submission fail. First, a no case submission could be made on the basis that, accepting the plaintiff’s evidence at its face value, no case has been established in law. Second, the submission could be made on the basis that the evidence led for the plaintiff was so unsatisfactory, or unreliable, that the court should find that the burden of proof had not been discharged.
12 We should point out that 
Storey v Storey
 was examined by the trial judge, but it was distinguished on the ground that there the appellate court was considering the circumstances in which it could nevertheless, in a case where a submission of no case to answer had not been upheld, direct that a new trial be held. In that case, there was an appeal from an order of the Divisional Court directing that there should be a re-hearing of a summons for maintenance issued by the appellant wife against her husband based on persistent cruelty and desertion. The summons was first heard before justices of the peace where the husband elected, in submitting that there was no case for him to answer, that he would not call any evidence. The submission was accepted by the justices and the complaint was dismissed. The wife appealed. Though the Divisional Court thought that the justices were wrong to have accepted the submission of no case to answer, it did not make an order for maintenance in her favour or to have the case remitted to the same justices for further findings of fact. Instead, it ordered a new trial before a fresh panel of justices. Ormerod LJ, delivering the judgment of the court, said (at p. 282):-
""There can, we think, be no doubt that in the former type of submission a defendant is bound by his election, and there can be no new trial. This rule, in our opinion, however, does not of necessity apply to the second type of case where the judge is invited to dismiss the case because of the unsatisfactory or unreliable nature of the evidence. In some cases it may well be that the appellate court will be able to decide the case without sending it back, but in others, and this in our judgment is certainly one, justice could not be done without a re-hearing. …. In our opinion, if the submission of no case is based on the unsatisfactory or unreliable nature of the evidence led by the plaintiff, and the appellate court finds itself unable on the findings of the court below to come to a just conclusion, the only course to be adopted in the interests of justice is to order a new trial, even if the defendant has elected to stand on his submission.""
13 It seemed to us clear that the English Court of Appeal there agreed that there should be a new trial, notwithstanding the election by the husband because, and this seemed to be an important consideration, the case raised a question of status and thereby some public interest was involved. Ormerod LJ said (on the same page):-
""… .. it is better in matrimonial disputes for the justices to hear both sides before coming to a decision, particularly as a finding by them of desertion or persistent cruelty may form the basis for a subsequent petition for divorce.""
14 The trial judge was clearly conscious of the second circumstance under which a submission of no case to answer could be made. He did not rule out that a submission of no case could also be made on that basis, as can be seen from this observation of his (¶25 of his Grounds of Judgment):- -
""It may be that the view taken by 
Aronson and Hunter
 was too restrictive and that a submission of no case to meet may also be upheld where the evidence adduced by the plaintiff is so unsatisfactory or unreliable that the court is able to find that the burden of proof on the plaintiff has not been discharged. But that said, I nevertheless consider the summary by Aronson and Hunter a helpful one.""
15 The summary of 
Aronson and Hunter
 that the judge referred to was the passage found at p. 732 of the book:-
However, if the defence leads no evidence where there is a case to answer, its silence could (depending on the facts) be taken to strengthen the opposing case. In particular, circumstantial evidence which could cut both ways might well look stronger if the defendant or accused is in a position to dispel the doubt, but refuses to go into evidence:

 (1993) 178 CLR 217.""
16 In electing not to adduce any evidence, the submission of the Bansals was that, even accepting the plaintiff’s evidence on the face of it, no case had been made out against them. The submission made was not on the basis that the evidence led for the CBI was unsatisfactory or unreliable. This was a submission of no case to answer of the first type enumerated in 
Storey v Storey
. Therefore, the trial judge did not apply any wrong test or principle.
Prima Facie
 case
17 We now turn to consider the second issue as to whether the court below was correct to have ruled that a 
prima facie
 case had been made out in respect of the claims in conversion and dishonest assistance and given judgment in favour of CBI.
18 CBI called only one witness, Vijay Kumar Bhandari (Bhandari), its General Manager at the head office at Mumbai since 1996. The relevant records of accounts of Bhagwati were maintained at one of CBI branches at Mumbai. Bhandari had no personal knowledge relating to the transactions with Bhagwati and neither did he know why or how the LC documents were released to Bhagwati. He sought to adduce in evidence a pile of documents called ""Process Notes"", without the maker(s) being called to testify in court. The ""Process Notes"" were notes kept by officers of CBI of conversations with customers. The trial judge had ruled that those notes were inadmissible as evidence as they did not fall within the exceptions permitted under s 32(b) and s 34 of the Evidence Act.
19 The Bansals argued that, stripped of hearsay and other inadmissible evidence, what Bhandari stated amounted to no more than that CBI negotiated the documents tendered by Bhagwati under the LCs and that CBI obtained possession of the documents. Upon negotiation, the stamp of CBI was also placed on the documents. However, for reasons unknown, CBI passed the documents back to Bhagwati. The documents eventually found their way to Singapore into the hands of Natsyn, which used them to obtain delivery of the goods. On these bare facts, there was nothing to suggest that the Bansals committed the tort of conversion or of knowingly assisting in the commission of a breach of trust.
20 As at the close of the case for CBI, this was the view of the trial judge (¶28 of his Grounds of Judgment) -
"" … there was evidence on which the court could come to the conclusion that the Bansals knew, when they (through Natsyn) dealt with the goods covered by the documents, that the documents were the property of CBI. In proceeding to deal with the goods despite that knowledge, the Bansals could well be liable in conversion and/or as constructive trustees. But, by electing not to testify, the Bansals have elected not to put before the court their explanation of the events that happened. In these circumstances, I can only conclude that they had no defence to these claims.""
21 Before us, counsel for the Bansals made the following four points in contending that a 
prima facie
 case of conversion on the part of the Bansals had not been made out –
(i) CBI did not have the 
locus standi
 to sue, as they had not shown that they had actual possession or an immediate right to possession of the LC documents and, in turn, the goods;
(ii) that the Bansals did not deal with the LC documents, and the goods; it was the staff of Natsyn who dealt with the documents;
(iii) the Bansals did not know that the documents belonged to CBI; and
(iv) there was no intent to convert since Natsyn subsequently made partial payments.
22 It is clear that conversion may be committed in many ways, the most obvious being to wrongfully take possession, dispose of, or destroy the goods belonging to or in the possession of another. In all cases, the essential element is that of dealing with the goods of another person in such a manner as to constitute an unjustifiable denial of his rights in them or the assertion of rights inconsistent therewith. It is settled law that for a plaintiff to be entitled to sue for conversion he must have actual possession or an immediate right to possession of the goods in question: see 
Siew Kong Engineering Works (sued as a firm) v Lian Yit Engineering Sdn Bhd & Anor
 
[1993] 2 SLR 505
, and 
Winfield & Jolowicz on Tort (15
th
 Edition)
 at 597. This was the very point which the Bansals argued that CBI had not established.
23 The undisputed evidence was that CBI negotiated the LC documents submitted by Bhagwati. This fact of negotiation was indicated by the CBI stamp on each document. Following the negotiation, CBI were entitled to the documents and in turn the goods. Subsequently, the documents were handed by CBI to Bhagwati. There was no evidence as to the reasons for the documents to be handed over to Bhagwati. Neither was there any evidence that Bhagwati, or for that matter any other person, had purchased the documents from CBI. So 
prima facie
, notwithstanding that physical possession of the documents was with Bhagwati, ownership of the documents remained with CBI and CBI were entitled to the documents, and in turn the goods. There was nothing to indicate how the documents arrived at Natsyn. But Natsyn did use the documents to obtain delivery of the goods. Again, there was no evidence that Natsyn paid for the documents. On the contrary, after discovery by CBI of what happened, Natsyn made part payments towards the purchase, leaving outstanding the two sums, which were the subject of the present action. Thus, entitlement to the documents had always remained with CBI and they therefore had the right to immediate possession of the documents and, in turn, the goods.
24 Turning to the second point, what must be borne in mind was that the Bansals were the only shareholders and directors of Natsyn. So, they were the ones in charge of Natsyn. Since the Bansals did not come to court to testify, in the absence of any evidence indicating the contrary, it would be reasonable to infer that they had handled the documents that came into the possession of Natsyn and they had directed their staff to obtain or they had by themselves obtained, delivery of the goods with the documents.
25 The third argument concerned the question of knowledge. The Bansals said that they did not know that the documents belonged to CBI. We would make two observations on this. First, it did not matter whether the Bansals knew the documents belonged to CBI. The important thing was that the Bansals knew that the documents did not belong to Natsyn (as Natsyn had not paid for the documents) and nevertheless proceeded to use them to obtain delivery of the goods and dispose of them. By so obtaining and disposing of the goods, the Bansal intended to deny the rights of CBI to the documents. Second, the goods were to be paid for by way of the LCs, and, in the ordinary course of business, the LC documents would have come to Natsyn through the issuing banks. But here, the Bansals admitted that the documents came from Bhagwati. Putting it at the lowest, the Bansals would have known that Natsyn were not entitled to the documents and in dealing with the documents with such knowledge, they had committed conversion.
26 As for the fourth point, that the Bansals had not intended to convert the goods because Natsyn had made part payments, it must be rejected outright. Making amends, after the commission of a wrong, cannot erase the wrong although it would mitigate the damages payable. In this case, the material time to determine whether the tort of conversion had been committed was when the Bansals, on behalf of Natsyn, obtained the delivery of the goods with the documents.
27 In the premises, all the arguments raised by the Bansals on conversion failed. A 
prima facie
 case had been made out that the Bansals had dealt with the LC documents in a manner inconsistent with the rights of CBI and were thus liable for conversion.
Constructive trust
28 The judge below also found that the Bansals had dishonestly assisted Bhagwati in committing a breach of trust. The Bansals argued that they had not committed such a wrong. First, there was no evidence of a trust being imposed on Bhagwati when the documents were handed by CBI to Bhagwati. Second, there was also no evidence to implicate them that they had dishonestly assisted Bhagwati to commit a breach of trust.
29 The law on dishonest assistance was recently considered and elucidated by the Privy Council in 
Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Philip Tan Kok Ming
 
[1995] 3 WLR 64
 where an airline sought a remedy against a tour agent’s principal director and shareholder. The defendant director was held liable for dishonest assistance in respect of a breach of trust committed by his company.
30 For a third party to be liable for dishonest assistance of a breach of trust, there must be first, a trust, second, a breach of the trust, third, assistance rendered by the third party towards the breach, and lastly, the assistance rendered by the third party must be dishonest. What the decision in 
Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan
 clarified is that in determining such accessory liability, the pre-requisite of dishonesty was to be judged objectively.
31 From the facts which we have set out in ¶23 above, it was clear that when CBI handed the LC documents to Bhagwati, an implied trust arose. This was because the documents belonged to CBI and there was no evidence that Bhagwati, or any third party, had paid CBI for the documents. 
Prima facie
, a resulting trust arose in favour of CBI.
32 The next point is that when Bhagwati, without authority, passed the documents to Natsyn in Singapore, Bhagwati was acting in breach of trust, and as Natsyn had not paid for them, Natsyn would, in turn, be holding the documents as trustees for the rightful owner, CBI. In obtaining delivery of the goods by using the documents and then disposing of them, Natsyn had accordingly committed a breach of trust.
33 As mentioned above, the Bansals were in complete charge of Natsyn. 
Prima facie
, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it would be reasonable to infer that they were behind the actions of Natsyn and, were thus, accessories to the breach committed by Natsyn.
34 The main point of contention of the Bansals before us was that they had not dishonestly assisted Bhagwati in committing any breach of trust. They said that they had no knowledge of how the documents came into the hands of Bhagwati and neither was there any evidence that they have had a hand in transmitting the documents to Natsyn. That would appear to be so. But when Natsyn came into possession of the documents knowing full well that it had not paid for them, an implied trust arose in favour of the rightful owner. In using the documents to obtain the goods, the Bansals were thus guilty of assisting Natsyn in committing a breach of trust. In the circumstances of this case, the assistance rendered by the Bansals to Natsyn was clearly dishonest. Here, we would quote a passage from 
Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan
 where the Privy Council stated (at p.74-75):-
""Acting in reckless disregard of others’ rights or possible rights can be a tell-tale sign of dishonesty. An honest person would have regard to the circumstances known to him, including the nature and importance of the proposed transaction, the nature and importance of his role, the ordinary course of business, the degree of doubt, the practicability of the trustee or the third party proceeding otherwise and the seriousness of the adverse consequences to the beneficiaries. The circumstances will dictate which one or more of the possible courses should be taken by an honest person. He might, for instance, flatly decline to become involved. He might ask further questions. He might seek advice, or insist on further advice being obtained. He might advise the trustee of the risks but then proceed with his role in the transaction. He might do many things. Ultimately, in most cases, an honest person should have little difficulty in knowing whether a proposed transaction, or his participation in it, would offend the normally accepted standards of honest conduct.
Likewise, when called upon to decide whether a person was acting honestly, a court will look at all the circumstances known to the third party at the time. The court will also have regard to personal attributes of the third party, such as his experience and intelligence and the reason why he acted as he did.""
35 Natsyn had arranged for the goods to be paid by LCs. The Bansals, being experienced business persons in international trade, would have known that in the normal course of business, the LC documents would have come to them through the issuing banks, who would expect payment before the documents would be released to Natsyn. Natsyn had not paid for the documents and yet the Bansals proceeded to obtain delivery of the goods with the documents. They would have seen the CBI stamp on the documents. They were clearly not entitled to the documents until they paid for them. They would have known that something was amiss. There was no evidence that they made any inquiries. An honest person in similar circumstances would have made an effort to establish how the documents could have come into his possession when no payment had yet been made. In our opinion, in the absence of any explanation offered, it would be reasonable to infer that the Bansals had acted dishonestly.
36 In our judgment, CBI had established a 
prima facie
 case that the Bansals had committed the wrong of dishonest assistance. It would be seen that the only aspect on which we differed from the trial judge is that we were of the opinion that the dishonest assistance rendered by the Bansals was not in relation to the breach of trust by Bhagwati but by Natsyn. This was because there was nothing to indicate that the Bansals had a hand in the breach committed by Bhagwati.
37 Accordingly, the appeal of the Bansals must fail.",2003-01-18 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Yong Pung How CJ:
1
         
 This was the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence only. The respondents were Cheong Hock Lai (“Cheong”), Low Li Meng (“Low”) and Chow Foon Yuong (“Chow”). Four days into their trial in the District Court, they pleaded guilty to one charge each of engaging in a practice which operated as a deceit upon one MIL Corporate Services (Singapore) Ltd (“MIL”), an offence under s 102(b) of the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289, 1985 Rev Ed) (“SIA”). Each respondent had another charge under s 201(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2002 Rev Ed) (“SFA”) taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. Low and Chow also each had an additional charge under s 102(b) of the SIA taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The district judge sentenced the respondents to pay fines in the following amounts:
(a)
       
 Cheong:
 
 $100,000, in default ten months’ imprisonment;
(b)
       
 Low:
      
 $50,000, in default five months’ imprisonment;
(c)
       
 Chow:
    
 $30,000, in default three months’ imprisonment.
I dismissed the Prosecution’s appeal against the sentences imposed on all three respondents, and now set out my reasons.
Background
2
         
 The evidence in the court below was led by way of an agreed statement of facts. At the material time, the respondents were employees of Alliance Capital Management (Singapore) Ltd (“ACMS”), a subsidiary of Alliance Capital Management Limited Partnerships, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Cheong was the regional financial controller, and the person ultimately in charge of the day-to-day administration of ACMS funds. Low was a unit trust administrative manager. Chow was a unit trust administrative officer. Both reported directly to Cheong on administrative matters pertaining to ACMS funds.
The unit trust funds
3
         
 The principal activity of ACMS is to provide fund management and marketing of fund management services to retail and institutional clients. Among other funds, ACMS manages the Global Growth Trends Portfolio Class A and the International Health Care Portfolio Class A. These are both feeder funds that invest solely in their respective parent funds, the Global Growth Trends Portfolio and the International Health Care Portfolio (“the parent funds”).
4
         
 The parent funds are registered with Alliance Capital Management Global Investor Services SA Luxembourg (“ACM Luxembourg”). They are managed by portfolio managers based in New York. ACMS manages the feeder funds, but much of the marketing of these funds is performed by distributors, which are banks and financial institutions. Investors who wish to apply for units in the feeder funds submit their applications to these distributors, who then submit them to ACMS for processing.
5
         
 The trustee of the feeder funds is Bermuda Trust (Singapore) (“BT”). BT calculates the feeder funds’ daily net asset value per unit (termed “the price” herein for convenience). MIL is an affiliated company of BT, and the agent of the feeder funds’ registrar. As the registrar’s agent, MIL’s functions include processing subscriptions, redemptions, transfers and switches with respect to the funds.
How the price of the feeder funds is derived
6
         
 The New York-based portfolio managers invest the parent funds primarily in US and European equities. The price of the parent funds is therefore determined by the performance of their component equities on the US and European stock exchanges.
7
         
 On any given trading day (“T”), the price of the feeder funds is directly derived from that of their respective parent funds for the previous trading day (“T-1”). This is done in the following manner.
8
         
 After 3.00pm Singapore time (9.00am Luxembourg time) on T, ACM Luxembourg calculates the T-1 price of the parent funds. This figure is received by BT and ACMS at about 6.00pm Singapore time (12.00 noon Luxembourg time). The next morning (“T+1”), BT calculates the T price of the feeder funds, based on the T-1 market price of the parent funds supplied by ACM Luxembourg, and the prevailing foreign exchange rate. After 1.00pm, ACMS and MIL receive the T market price of the feeder funds from BT.
The 5.00pm trading deadline
9
         
 To qualify for the feeder funds’ T price, all investors wishing to buy, sell or switch units have to submit their application forms to the distributors by 5.00pm on T. Then the distributors would submit the forms to ACMS. This 5.00pm deadline is prescribed in the feeder funds’ prospectuses, but not in the Operating Memorandum (“OM”). The OM is a document signed by ACMS and BT, which sets out their internal guidelines and specifies the 5.00pm deadline only for transactions involving Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) and Supplementary Retirement Scheme funds. There was no such prescription for cash transactions, which are how the respondents carried out their trades on the feeder funds. Specifically, the OM only provided that all subscriptions, redemptions or switches from distributors were to be consolidated by ACMS and forwarded to MIL by 1.00pm on T+1.
The late trading
10
       
 As employees of ACMS, the respondents could purchase units in the feeder funds directly. They did not need to go through a distributor, and were not required to pay the 5% service charge.
11
       
 Between July and October 2002, the respondents traded in the feeder funds using their own accounts with MIL. They would submit their applications on the morning of T+1, but backdate their applications so that it appeared that they were dated on T. This was done so that they could qualify for the T price. The backdated application forms would then be placed together with all the other investors’ applications made on T. After that, the package would be forwarded to MIL for processing. MIL was thereby deceived into believing that the respondents’ applications were made on the dates stated on the application forms.
12
       
 The backdating allowed the respondents to determine the movement of the feeder funds with considerable accuracy. It enabled them to subscribe for units only when they had predicted an increase in their T+1 price. If they determined that the T+1 price would be higher than the T price, they would put in their backdated applications, thereby qualifying for the T price. Then they would redeem their units within 24 hours so as to take advantage of the higher T+1 price. This guaranteed a profit on every trade.
13
       
 During the material time, the respondents made profits through late trading amounting to:
(a)
       
 Cheong:
 
 $62,931.90;
(b)
       
 Low: 
     
 $19,671.51;
(c)
       
 Chow: 
   
 $3,792.81.
If the profits made on the charges taken into consideration are added to those figures, the respondents made total profits of:
(a)
       
 Cheong: $107,925.29;
(b)
       
 Low: 
     
 $46,556.05;
(c)
       
 Chow: 
   
 $16,162.32.
The respondents had already made full restitution before their trial commenced in the District Court.
The decision below
14
       
 In his grounds of decision (
[2004] SGDC 37
), the district judge observed that this was “the first case of its kind locally”. While there had previously been prosecutions under s 102(b) of the SIA, there had been none specifically for the practice of late trading. As such, he could look only to sentencing precedents in cases of other types of market misconduct, which he recognised to be “somewhat helpful though not directly on point”.
15
       
 In approaching the question of sentence, the district judge first considered the case law to determine the sentencing norm in market misconduct cases. Then, he considered whether there were any special reasons in this case to depart from the norm.
The sentencing norm in market misconduct cases
16
       
 The district judge examined cases of three types of market misconduct. These were cited to him by the Defence. They were:
(a)
       
 other offences under s 102(b) of the SIA, involving the fraudulent and deceitful use of others’ accounts to trade;
(b)
       
 market rigging; and
(c)
       
 insider trading under s 103 of the SIA.
17
       
 In his judgment, the respondents’ acts of deceit were not of the same degree as those offenders who were given custodial sentences for abusing others’ accounts to trade for their own benefit. Those offenders’ acts were clearly more aggravating in nature than late trading. The degree of tangibility of harm in the case before him was low, compared to cases in which the counter actually had to be suspended from trading. The district judge therefore concluded that it was “abundantly clear” from those cases that the respondents ought not to be given custodial sentences under the current sentencing benchmarks for market misconduct offences.
No special reasons to depart from the sentencing norm
18
       
 The Prosecution submitted that there were three reasons why custodial sentences should be imposed on the respondents.
19
       
 First, the Prosecution argued that there was a strong public interest element in this case. The respondents’ conduct was the type to “cause consternation” among the investing public. The district judge rejected this argument since it was characteristic of any form of market misconduct. He also noted that s 104 of the SIA had been amended with effect from 6 March 2000 to increase the maximum fine from $50,000 to $250,000. This enhanced sentencing range allowed the court to impose a severe fine as a deterrent sentence in appropriate cases without having to resort to a custodial sentence.
20
       
 Second, the Prosecution contended that the respondents had abused their position in committing the offences. The district judge rejected this argument since it also applied to practically all market misconduct cases. Late trading and other forms of market misconduct could only happen if the offender was in some position of authority or privilege 
vis-à-vis
 other investors. The district judge emphasised that “in such offences, abuse of position is not a unique factor that makes a custodial sentence almost automatic”.
21
       
 Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the nature of these offences was such that they were difficult to detect. The district judge rejected this argument. He observed that the respondents had given the Commercial Affairs Department their full co-operation. There had been no surreptitious concealment. In his view, there was a lack of fundamental controls in the system that “made it very ‘grey’” as to what would be permissible conduct, and what would not.
Approaches to regulating late trading
22
       
 The district judge concluded by pointing out that the respondents had been charged under s 102 of the SIA, a “catch-all provision” designed to cover forms of securities fraud not specifically dealt with elsewhere in the SIA. He cited the recent action instituted in the New York Supreme Court in September 2003 by the New York Attorney-General against Canary Capital Partners (
State of New York v Canary Capital Partners, LLC
), as an example of the manner in which late trading is dealt with in the United States – by way of a civil penalty action, rather than criminal proceedings.
23
       
 He highlighted that in Singapore, the civil penalty concept has been expanded under s 232 of the SFA to cover all forms of market misconduct. He noted that the civil penalty regime is meant to complement the existing criminal regime by providing a “calibrated approach to enforcement” that punishes and deters market misconduct, but does not impede the growth of the securities markets here.
24
       
 In his view, the ultimate question was “whether it would be fair with the benefit of hindsight to adopt a draconian approach to punish the accused persons with a custodial sentence for late trading”. He reasoned at [42] that:
Prior to the indictments of these offences, the sheer lack of internal and external regulatory controls actually facilitated late trading and made them possible. They include, no date/time stamping, inconsistent and vague operating instructions in different documents, unclear or no guidelines for staff trading, liberal and/or unauthorised communication of acceptance of application forms out of time, no internal verification of application forms and the list goes on.
He added, however, that a report carried in 
The Business Times
 on 13 February 2004 showed that the Monetary Authority of Singapore had recently taken steps to put corrective and preventive actions in place to frustrate any contemplated late trading.
25
       
 In the light of all these factors, the district judge sentenced the respondents to pay fines in the amounts set out earlier.
The appeal
26
       
 Before I turn to the appeal proper, it bears repeating that an appellate court may only interfere with the sentence meted out by the trial judge if it is satisfied that:
(a)
       
 the trial judge made the wrong decision as to the proper factual basis for sentence;
(b)
       
 the trial judge erred in appreciating the material before him;
(c)
       
 the sentence was wrong in principle; or
(d)
       
 the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, or manifestly inadequate, as the case may be.
This is trite law, as set out in 
Tan Koon Swan v PP
 
[1986] SLR 126
, and recently reiterated in 
Ong Ah Tiong v PP
 
[2004] 1 SLR 587
.
27
       
 The Prosecution brought this appeal on the fourth ground. It was argued that the sentences imposed on the respondents were manifestly inadequate in light of the district judge’s misplaced reliance on other market misconduct cases as sentencing precedents and his failure to appreciate that the present facts called for a deterrent sentence in the form of a custodial term.
28
       
 I turn now to consider the arguments raised.
The district judge’s reliance on cases of other types of market misconduct
29
       
 The Prosecution took issue with the district judge’s reliance on these cases for the following reasons. As to the other s 102(b) cases, he had failed to properly consider the decisions of this court in 
Peh Bin Chat v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 15 of 1998 (5 May 1998) (unreported) 
and 
Syn Yong Sing David v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 266 of 1998 (2 March 1999) (unreported), both digested in 
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts
 (2nd Ed, 2003) at 782–783. As to the market rigging cases, he had wrongly formed the view that they evidenced greater harm to the market, and that the offenders in those cases had demonstrated higher degrees of culpability. As to the insider trading cases under s 103, the district judge was wrong to have referred to them at all. In particular, it was emphasised that an “important distinguishing factor” of this appeal was that it concerned CPF-approved unit trusts, which are marketed to all sectors of society, including laymen investors, as a low-risk investment option.
30
       
 I was firmly of the view that the important distinguishing factor in this case was not the nature of the funds, but the fact that the respondents had traded on their own accounts at all material times. It was beyond question that this evidenced a lower degree of deceit than if they had chosen to trade unauthorised on an account belonging to a member of the investing public. Unauthorised trading on another person’s account was a common denominator in those cases of market misconduct in which a custodial sentence was imposed. In my opinion, the district judge could not be faulted for referring to these cases. On the contrary, it was eminently reasonable for him to do so in the absence of direct precedent.
31
       
 I turn first to consider the s 102(b) cases. The Prosecution referred to an article reporting 
Peh Bin Chat
, entitled “Illegal Trading: Man Spared Jail”, which was carried in the 6 May 1998 edition of 
The Straits Times
 at 3. In that article, I was reported as saying that “[e]very future offence will indeed mean a custodial sentence”, and that I had imposed a fine of $50,000 only because I was bound to follow precedent. The report is incontrovertible, but the offence in 
Peh Bin Chat
 involved unauthorised trading on a share trading account opened in someone else’s name for the express and sole purpose of carrying out unauthorised trades. Peh had opened a share trading account with Tat Lee Securities in the name of one Tan Liap Song, an illiterate man who worked as a driver in Peh’s company. Peh traded almost $2.5m worth of shares on that account, and racked up some $25,642 in losses.
32
       
 It is apparent from the face of the report alone that the offender in 
Peh Bin Chat
 demonstrated a far higher degree of culpability than the respondents in this appeal. In my view, he had committed precisely the type of offence under s 102(b) for which a custodial sentence should be imposed and, therefore, I made this clear when a fine had to be imposed upon him simply because I was constrained to do so by statute and by precedent.
33
       
 I would also add that, as the district judge correctly noted, the maximum fine stipulated under s 104 for offences under s 102(b) was increased from $50,000 to $250,000 with effect from 6 March 2000. The legislative intent behind this amendment, as reflected in the speech of the Deputy Prime Minister, Brigadier-General Lee Hsien Loong, given at the Second Reading of the Securities Industry (Amendment) Bill (No B 40 of 1999), was to “[strengthen] the criminal sanctions for market misconduct such as price manipulation and insider trading”: see the 
Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (17 January 2000) at col 676. This significant increase now gives the courts far more flexibility in the exercise of sentencing discretion. In my view, the district judge rightly took advantage of the higher statutory limit in this case, in particular, to impose a hefty fine of $100,000 on Cheong. Before 6 March 2000, he would have been compelled, as I was in 
Peh Bin Chat
, to impose a fine of only $50,000 on Cheong. Clearly, that would have been manifestly inadequate on the present facts.
34
       
 By way of further illustration, I refer to 
Syn Yong Sing David
, and two other cases under s 102(b) cited to me by the Prosecution, 
Teo Kian Leong v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 147
 and 
Shapy Khan s/o Sher Khan v PP
 
[2003] 2 SLR 433
.
35
       
 In 
Syn Yong Sing David
, the offender, a senior assistant manager with Deutsche Bank, made use of a client’s account in order to generate enough trades to meet his annual profit target. He racked up some RM2m in losses, and never made restitution. I upheld the sentence of four months’ imprisonment imposed in the district court.
36
       
 In 
Teo Kian Leong
, the offender was convicted on eight charges under s 102(b). He was a dealer’s representative at UBS Warburg & Associates (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“UBS”). His job was to make securities transactions on behalf of laymen investors who had trading accounts with UBS. From March to May 2000, the offender traded on accounts belonging to 11 such clients of UBS, who only found out about the trades when UBS issued letters of demand for the losses incurred, which amounted to some $500,000. In upholding the sentence of six months’ imprisonment for each charge, with two of the sentences to run concurrently, I held at [46] that the offender had:
… deliberately abused the trust and confidence [his clients] had in him and [come] up with a scheme to profit and later escape responsibility. Even after being confronted about his “mistakes”, he boldly continued to carry out similar transactions and accumulated greater losses at the expense of his clients, probably in the hope of recouping the losses and evading the consequences of his actions … [T]he appellant in this case, while causing less loss to his clients, had acted against their wishes and caused them financial hardship.
37
       
 Similarly, in 
Shapy Khan s/o Sher Khan
, the offender was a dealer at a securities firm who traded on behalf of one Yeo and one Mok, both of whom were his clients. Mok issued a cheque to cover some 
contra
 losses on his account, and gave it to the offender, who credited the sum into Yeo’s account to cover 
contra
 losses that the offender had incurred on unauthorised trades. The offender faced one charge under s 102(b) of the SIA, and one charge under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”). The sentencing judge indicated that she would have imposed a fine of $50,000 for the s 102(b) charge, but for the indication that the offender was unable to pay. She therefore sentenced him to four months’ imprisonment.
38
       
 Therefore, the Prosecution was quite right to point out that custodial sentences have consistently been imposed for offences under s 102(b) after 
Peh Bin Chat
, and despite the higher statutory maximum fine prescribed under s 104. I would also point out that in 
Shapy Khan s/o Sher Khan
, the sentencing judge was initially minded to impose a fine. In all those cases, up to and save for this appeal, there was a clear abuse of position by professional securities dealers 
vis-à-vis
 laymen investors who came to them for assistance and advice on trading. These dealers instead used their clients’ accounts to carry out unauthorised trades. While it is not at all in question that the respondents’ conduct was criminal in nature, these aggravating factors were simply not present on the facts before me. The respondents traded in their own names, and for themselves, at all material times. No laymen investor clients were involved.
39
       
 Next, I turn to the market rigging cases. The district judge referred specifically to 
PP v Kwek Swee Heng
 District Arrest Cases Nos 28926, 3045 and 3046 of 2003 (unreported) (“the Links Island case”), and 
PP v Gwee Yow Pin
 District Arrest Case No 1738 of 2001 (unreported) (“the Mid-Continent Equipment case”). In the Links Island case, the offender effected transactions in Links Island Holdings shares in order to manipulate the price of those shares. His actions led to the counter being suspended. He was sentenced to pay a total fine of $90,000. In the Mid-Continent Equipment case, the offenders transacted in shares for the sole purpose of creating the impression that there was a high level of interest in those shares. This jacked up the price of those shares from 15 cents to 87.5 cents. The counter was also suspended, the shares cornered and the stock de-listed. After a 45-day trial, the offenders were each sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.
40
       
 Returning to the appeal before me, the respondents together generated profits of less than $200,000, which must be juxtaposed against the size of the unit trusts. They are worth more than US$1bn. The respondents’ conduct caused nothing even remotely close to the level of market mayhem triggered in the Links Island and Mid-Continent Equipment cases. In light of those factors, I could not agree with the Prosecution’s submission that these cases evidenced less harm to the market, and that the offenders therein demonstrated lower degrees of culpability than the respondents in the present appeal. I was therefore also unable to see why a custodial sentence should be imposed in this case, when a fine was imposed in the Links Island case.
41
       
 Finally, I come to the insider trading cases, in which fines, rather than custodial sentences, were imposed. As regards these cases, the Prosecution’s submission was simply that the district judge should not have referred to those cases because the objective of the law against insider trading is predominantly to ensure a level playing field in the market, rather than to protect investors’ interests from 
mala fides
. I took the Prosecution’s point, but would emphasise that s 102(b) is a catch-all provision, intended to cover 
any other form
 of securities fraud not specifically dealt with by other provisions in the SIA. As such, I did not think it inapposite to draw the analogy between insider trading under s 103, and the particular type of offence under s 102(b) which formed the subject matter of this appeal. The respondents had no knowledge of price-sensitive information specific to the unit trusts. However, by backdating their application forms to T on T+1 morning so that they could use the price information provided by BT to their advantage, the respondents were effectively practising something akin to insider trading, in that they traded with an illicit advantage over other investors. Therefore, I found it difficult to see why the district judge should not have taken those cases into account.
Whether it was necessary for a deterrent sentence to take the form of a custodial term in this case
42
       
 This argument may be dealt with very shortly. It is clear that a deterrent sentence need not always take the form of a custodial term. As I made clear in 
Chia Kah Boon v PP
 
[1999] 4 SLR 72
, a deterrent sentence may take the form of a fine if it is high enough to have a deterrent effect on the offender himself (“specific deterrence”), as well as others (“general deterrence”).
43
       
 The Prosecution argued that only a custodial sentence was appropriate to achieve the objective of general deterrence in this case. In support of its submission, the Prosecution also relied on this passage from 
Rupchand Bhojwani Sunil v PP
 
[2004] 1 SLR 596
 (“
Rupchand
”) at [28]:
[W]hen a court is faced with a charge of cheating involving a sum of money akin to that in this appeal, it has to impose a sentence that has the potential to deter future similar offences. In that respect, a fine, though appropriate in other cases, would not have a deterrent effect in cases that are similar to this appeal. … The criminal law should never become a “business” of sorts.
I was urged to “send a clear message” to deter potential late trading, and to show that the courts will adopt a robust approach to the protection of investors’ interests, and not condone abuses by administrators and fund managers of unit trusts.
44
       
 There could be absolutely no quarrel with that statement on principle, and so I wholeheartedly agreed with the Prosecution in so far as the requirement for a deterrent sentence was concerned. In my judgment, however, the Prosecution faced an uphill task in persuading me that it was necessary to impose a custodial sentence to achieve the objective of general deterrence on these particular facts. This was not a case in the category of previous s 102(b) cases such as 
Teo Kian Leong
 and 
Shapy Khan s/o Sher Khan
, in which the interests of specific laymen investors suffered at the hands of their trusted fund managers. It is certainly not in dispute that the respondents committed criminal offences, but the fines imposed on them by the district judge were not insubstantial. For the reasons I have already set out, I did not think the fines were manifestly inadequate. In my view, they were also sufficiently high to achieve a deterrent purpose.
45
       
 I did not think that 
Rupchand
, which should be strictly limited to very similar facts, was applicable to the appeal at hand. The genesis of that passage in 
Rupchand
 was my decision in 
Lim Choon Kang v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 927
, a case under s 415 of the PC, in which I held at 928–929, [6]–[7]:
In my view, fines instead of custodial sentences can be imposed where the amounts involved are not of great magnitude or consequence, but when the operation smacks of something on a considerable scale, a custodial sentence must necessarily follow. … 
I think it should also be remembered that prosecutions for such offences normally take place in the district courts in which a district judge’s power to fine is presently limited to only $10,000.
 People who are minded to commit such offences of multiple share applications on a substantial scale must be discouraged from thinking that, if they are caught, they can simply surrender their ill-gotten gains and the worst that will then happen to them will be a fine of $10,000. For them, there must now be a custodial sentence. [emphasis added]
46
       
 Rupchand
 was a case of cheating under s 417 of the PC, in which the offender deliberately downloaded an Internet site so that he could access orders for merchandise placed through the site. The offender cheated one Kevyan-Alf of US$42,000 in this manner. 
Rupchand
 was next applied in 
Chua Kim Leng Timothy v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 74
 and 
Lim Teck Chye v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 72
, both cases under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed). Both cases involved elaborate scams, conceptualised and orchestrated by the offenders, to short-supply fuel oil to customers of their companies, which provided ship bunkering services. The scams also involved the offenders’ bunker clerks and bunker surveyors. The latter were systematically bribed to “overlook” the provision of lower grades of fuel oil, or shortfalls in supply of fuel oil.
47
       
 I did not think that that passage in 
Rupchand
 was applicable to the present appeal. First, the prescribed punishment under both ss 415 and 417 is one year’s imprisonment, or fine, or both, and the maximum limit on any fine that may be imposed is $10,000 by virtue of s 11(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). I have no doubt that in the present context, a fine as low as $10,000 would certainly lead potential offenders to think of the criminal law as a mere “business of sorts”. By contrast, however, the offence under s 102(b) of the SIA may be met with a fine of up to $250,000, as prescribed by s 104 of the same. Therefore, in dealing with the offence of late trading, the district court may impose the maximum fine by virtue of s 117(4) (
in pari materia
 with s 327 of the SFA) read with s 11(7) of the CPC, and does not operate under its ordinary criminal jurisdictional limit as in 
Rupchand
 and 
Lim Choon Kang
.
48
       
 Second, where 
Rupchand
 is applied outside the narrow confines of ss 415 and 417 of the PC, and where it involves a departure from the usual sentencing norm for the offence in question, the circumstances justifying such departure must be exceptional: 
Lim Teck Chye
 at [73]. The offence to which the principle is applied must contain, 
inter alia
, the crucial element of deliberate organisation calculated to further the offender’s criminal intent on a systematic and very large scale. There was nothing of this sort on the evidence before me. I did not see any parallels with either 
Rupchand
 or 
Chua Kim Leng Timothy
 that would have necessitated the imposition of a custodial sentence. In my judgment, the fines imposed by the district judge amply served the twin aims of specific and general deterrence.
Conclusion
49
       
 In the light of the general approach to market misconduct cases and the specific circumstances of this appeal, I did not think that the fines imposed by the district judge were manifestly inadequate. Accordingly, I dismissed the Prosecution’s appeal.

Woo Bih Li J:
 
Introduction
 
1          The plaintiff, RBG Resources plc (“RBG”), is a public limited company incorporated in England. It was placed in compulsory liquidation in England on 12 June 2002. The present action involves a claim by the second defendant, Credit Lyonnais (“CL”), a bank incorporated in England, to various metals stored in warehouses in Singapore. CL’s claim is resisted by the liquidators of RBG who, in turn, have made a claim against CL for conversion of metals owned by RBG.
 
2          RBG was known by the name of Impactworld plc on incorporation. It changed its name to Allied Deals plc on 17 July 1996 and then to RBG Resources plc on 17 September 2001.
 
3          RBG (then known as Allied Deals plc) became a customer of Credit Lyonnais Rouse Ltd (“CLR”) in 1998. CLR was at all material times a wholly-owned subsidiary of CL and a ring-dealing member of the London Metal Exchange (“LME”). Subsequently, from October 2001, RBG entered into metal trading with a division of CL called Credit Lyonnais Rouse Derivatives (“CLRD”). This division trades in various commodities, including metal. The transactions between RBG and CLRD were between October 2001 to April 2002. During this period, there were 158 transactions between CLRD and RBG regarding the purchase of metals in various locations around the world. These 158 transactions included 45 purchase transactions relating to metals in warehouses supposedly operated by Fujitrans (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Fujitrans”).
 
4          The parties have referred to these warehouses as Fujitrans or Rong De warehouses. I should clarify that the warehouses were leased from PSA Corporation Limited (“PSA”) by a company known as Rong De Distribution Pte Ltd (“Rong De”). Rong De was in the warehousing and transhipment business. From January 2000, Rong De operated a warehouse at Block 513, Keppel Distripark, #02-108, at Kampong Bahru, Singapore. In late 2000, one Lim Tau Hee (“Lim”), a warehouse manager of Fujitrans, approached Rong De to provide packing, unpacking and storage services for Fujitrans. Rong De agreed. Block 513, however, was also used to store cargo from other entities. As the cargo stored for Fujitrans was increasing, Rong De was concerned about the weight thereof on the second storey of Block 513. Therefore, in March 2002, it leased another warehouse from PSA, namely, Block 519, #01-105 in the same Keppel Distripark. This warehouse was on the first floor or ground floor, as it was sometimes called, and was used exclusively for Fujitrans. For easy reference, I will also refer to these warehouses as “Fujitrans warehouses”.
 
5          CL treated the 45 purchases mentioned above as 13 groups of transactions. Each group of transactions comprised an initial purchase of metal by CLRD, the grant of a call option to RBG to buy the metal and a subsequent exercise of the call option by RBG, followed by what has been called “rolls” or “rollovers”, 
ie
 CLRD would then purchase the metal which RBG had exercised its option for, and grant to RBG another call option and so on. I will elaborate on the structure of the transactions later.
 
6          CL’s claim relates to five groups of metal transactions between RBG and CLRD. The metals forming the subject matter of those transactions were stored in the Fujitrans warehouses. These were:
 
(a)        173.519mt of nickel cathodes,
 
(b)        494.987mt of nickel cathodes,
 
(c)        692.447mt of copper cathodes,
 
(d)        504.360mt of tin ingots, and
 
(e)        50.882mt of tin ingots.
 
7          RBG’s claim against CL relates to 300mt of nickel briquettes which were removed from a Fujitrans warehouse, on the instructions of CL, on 9 May 2002.
 
8          Although RBG initially started trading with CLR back in 1998, there is no claim arising from transactions between RBG and CLR, which is a separate legal entity from CL. As can be seen, the claims involve the transactions with CLRD only. As CLRD is a division of CL, CL is the litigant against RBG.
 
9          I will deal with CL’s claims first and then with RBG’s claim. I have included, at the end of my judgment, a schedule listing the 
dramatis personae
 for easy reference. The list is of those I have referred to in my judgment more than once.
 
The structure of the transactions between RBG and CLRD
 
10        Prior to the first metal transaction between RBG and CLRD, RBG and CLRD had engaged in an exchange of e-mail in which RBG had sought financing from CLRD and CLRD agreed to provide financing. However, the eventual structure of each group of transactions is as set out below.
 
11        CLRD would purchase a certain quantity of a particular metal (
eg
 nickel) from RBG on an over-the-counter or private contract basis. The metal was supposed to be of LME grade. The purchase was constituted or evidenced by CLRD’s purchase confirmation, the terms of which required delivery documentation to be delivered to CLRD. The purchase confirmation also provided for title and risk to the metal to pass from RBG to CLRD when the delivery documentation was received by CLRD and the purchase price was paid by CLRD.
 
12        The purchase price was the price calculated by CLRD and agreed to by RBG. The calculation started off with a basis price from which various items were discounted or deducted. This lower price became the purchase price. The various items deducted were in respect of:
 
(a)        warehouse rent,
 
(b)        finance charges,
 
(c)        CLRD’s margin, and
 
(d)        deliverability allowance.
 
13        It was anticipated that CLRD would enter into a concurrent LME hedging transaction with CLR for the forward sale by CLRD to CLR of a similar quantity of the same generic LME metal. The price for this forward sale formed the basis price for the initial purchase by CLRD from RBG. The period of time between the initial purchase and the forward date was the period of time over which the discounts were calculated.
 
14        On the same date as the purchase confirmation, CLRD would grant RBG a call option giving RBG the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a similar quantity of the same generic metal. The call option was exercisable within a stipulated period. The expiry date of the option would be a date earlier than the forward date in the hedging transaction.
 
15        If and when RBG exercised the call option, the hedging transaction placed by CLRD would be unwound or closed out. In the meantime, CLRD was supposed to deliver, by way of documentation, the metal to RBG and RBG would make payment.
 
16        However, in the groups of transactions before me, the matter did not end there. After the exercise of a call option, CLRD would enter into a similar set of transactions all over again, 
ie
 CLRD would purchase the metal from RBG, hedge it and issue a call option to RBG to purchase the metal during a future period. This was referred to as a “roll” or “rollover”. The number of rollovers would vary depending on whether RBG exercised the call option or not and whether another set of transactions was then entered into. However, in the rollovers, no fresh delivery of delivery documentation was required of RBG.
 
17        In each rollover, RBG’s obligation to pay for its purchase was set off against CLRD’s obligation to pay for its subsequent purchase. The difference was reflected in RBG’s account.
 
18        I should mention here that the delivery documentation I have referred to was in the form of warehouse receipts on Fujitrans’ letterhead. The person involved in such delivery documentation was Fujitrans’ Lim.
 
Background leading to the dispute between RBG and CL
 
19        In early March 2002, CL received information that RBG’s auditors had resigned on the ground that certain transactions undertaken by RBG could not be substantiated. CL then decided to have a visual inspection of the metals it believed it had purchased from RBG. The inspection of metals in Fujitrans warehouses was done on 12 March 2002 by CLRD’s William John Harris (“Harris”), also known as Bill Harris, the person who had been dealing with RBG’s representatives on the metal transactions. After this inspection various events occurred:
 
(a)        On 2 May 2002, the English court ordered RBG to be placed in provisional liquidation with effect from 3 May 2002.
 
(b)        On 6 May 2002, Darryl John Kennard (“Kennard”), an English solicitor representing another bank, Banque Cantonale Vaudoise (“BCV”), spoke to and also met with Lim about the metals in the Fujitrans warehouses. Lim told Kennard that all such metals belonged to RBG.
 
(c)        On 7 May 2002, Harris had a telephone discussion with Lim. As a result of the discussion, another warehouseman, C Steinweg Warehousing (FE) Pte Ltd (“Steinweg”), was allowed to take delivery of 300mt of nickel briquettes out of a Fujitrans warehouse, on behalf of CL on 9 May 2002. This is the subject of RBG’s conversion claim.
 
(d)        On 9 May 2002, BCV commenced an action in Singapore against RBG and Fujitrans. BCV also obtained, on the same day, an interim injunction restraining RBG and Fujitrans from dealing with or disposing of all metals which were the property of RBG.
 
(e)        On 11 May 2002, CL commenced an action in Singapore against Fujitrans. CL also obtained, on the same day, an interim injunction to restrain Fujitrans from dealing with or disposing of all metals held by Fujitrans for CL.
 
(f)         Between 16 May and 20 May 2002, Fujitrans joined Lim and others as parties to the BCV action and obtained, 
inter alia
, Anton Piller orders against them.
 
(g)        On 18 June 2002, Fujitrans applied in the BCV action for interpleader relief, citing the claims against Fujitrans made by BCV and CL, and the demands from various other bank creditors of RBG.
 
(h)        Lim was found dead on or about 25 June 2002. He had apparently committed suicide.
 
(i)         On 10 July 2002, RBG obtained an order in the BCV action giving RBG discovery of all documents obtained by Fujitrans under Fujitrans’ Anton Piller orders and all affidavits filed by Lim and documents produced by Lim in the BCV action. The order also allowed RBG to use any of the documents discovered, as a result of the order, for the protection or determination of RBG’s rights whether in Singapore or otherwise.
 
(j)         On 2 August 2002, interpleader relief was granted in the BCV action, in which Fujitrans was ordered to issue an interpleader summons to all known claimants to the metals in any Fujitrans warehouse, and for each claimant to set out the basis of its claim on affidavit.
 
(k)        On 7 August 2002, RBG filed a petition in Singapore in Companies Winding Up No 60 of 2002. On 8 and 13 August 2002, various orders were made appointing Singapore provisional liquidators over RBG and allowing them to survey and sell metals in various warehouses, including Fujitrans warehouses, without prejudice to the claimants’ rights and to hold the proceeds of sale of the metal goods pending further order. The survey was done by SGS Testing & Control Services Singapore Pte Ltd (“SGS”). On 7 October 2002, RBG was ordered to be wound up by the Singapore court and the persons previously appointed as provisional liquidators in Singapore were appointed its liquidators in Singapore. After the survey, the metals were sold and the sale proceeds of the disputed metals are being held pending the court’s determination of the disputes.
 
(l)         In the meantime, on 6 September 2002, after considering the claims of various claimants pursuant to the orders given for interpleader relief in the BCV action, I directed RBG to commence a fresh action as plaintiff and to name the claimants as defendants. I also gave directions on various matters including the exchange of pleadings and discovery of documents.
 
(m)       On 4 October 2002, RBG commenced the present action and served its writ of summons on various defendants. Thereafter this action proceeded to trial. However, before the trial commenced, RBG reached a settlement with the first, third, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants. There was no settlement with the fourth defendant which did not even enter a defence to RBG’s action. A judgment in default of defence was entered against the fourth defendant. CL, the second defendant, was the only remaining claimant to metals in the Fujitrans warehouses.
 
(n)        The trial of the action was between the period 8 January 2004 to 10 February 2004, after which I gave directions for the exchange of closing submissions and reply submissions.
 
20        CL made its claim to the metal in each group transaction on three bases:
 
(a)        That CL had purchased generic metal from RBG in each purchase transaction which metal was subsequently ascertained by appropriation to each contract of purchase. Hence title therein passed to CL (“the Ascertainment Claim”).
 
(b)        Alternatively, that after the metal had been ascertained, it was wrongfully commingled by Fujitrans with other metal in the Fujitrans warehouses and no longer became capable of ascertainment. Accordingly, the metal in each category of metals corresponding to the metal purchased by CL and remaining in the Fujitrans warehouses was held for RBG and CL as tenants in common (“the Commingling Claim”).
 
(c)        Alternatively, that each of CL’s contracts for the purchase of metal was of a specific quantity of unascertained metal that formed part of a bulk which bulk was identified not in the purchase confirmation but by subsequent agreement between RBG and CL. Accordingly, CL was owner in common with RBG of the metal to the extent of the quantity purchased by CL pursuant to s 20A of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Bulk Claim”). I will refer to the Sale of Goods Act as “the Act”.
 
Claim by RBG to ownership of metal in Fujitrans warehouses
 
21        Before I deal with the various claims, there is one other point I should deal with first.
 
22        There was a long discourse by CL in its closing submissions that because RBG was claiming to be the owner of the metals in Fujitrans warehouses, it was incumbent on RBG to prove that assertion. I do not agree that RBG has to do so for the reasons set out below.
 
23        CL, and the other defendants, are the substantive plaintiffs as CL, and the other defendants, derive their alleged title or interests from RBG. For example, CL is claiming as purchaser from RBG. Its claim must be premised on RBG’s ownership of the metal goods just prior to the purchase. Indeed, para 4(1) of CL’s reply and rejoinder states that RBG’s ownership of the metal claimed by CL and its ability to give absolute title is admitted by RBG and/or is not in issue and proof of the same is not necessary. If it is for RBG to prove its ownership prior to CL’s purchase, then where would CL stand if RBG failed to do so? After the purchase, CL’s claim to title as purchaser depends on whether CL is able to establish its claim. If CL fails to do so, then by default, title to the metal remains with RBG 
vis-à-vis
 CL. Whether other claimants should subsequently surface is another matter which does not concern CL’s claim.
 
24        As for RBG filing the present action as plaintiff, this was pursuant to a direction from me when Fujitrans was seeking interpleader relief. I have alluded to this above. As there were various claimants at the time, I was of the view that it would be neater for RBG to be the plaintiff and the various claimants to be the defendants. There would then be one action and several defendants instead of several actions, one by each claimant, and with only RBG as defendant. Also, with RBG as plaintiff in the same and one action, it would be in a better position to lead and co-ordinate the various interlocutory steps leading to the trial. However, CL and the other claimants remain the substantive plaintiffs except, of course, in relation to RBG’s claim for conversion where RBG is the substantive plaintiff.
 
The Ascertainment Claim
 
25        It was common ground that at the time of each contract of purchase by CL, CL was purchasing a certain metal (
eg
 nickel). The quantity was stated in round numbers (
eg
 400mt of nickel) but the metal was not yet ascertained.
 
26        As I have stated, under the terms of each purchase confirmation, title to and the right to possess the goods would pass from RBG to CL upon receipt of delivery documentation by CL and payment of the purchase price to RBG.
 
27        CL’s position was that for each of its purchases, delivery documentation was received by it and payment made to RBG accordingly. The delivery documentation was sent by fax and was in the form of a warehouse receipt on a Fujitrans letterhead certifying that Fujitrans was holding a specific quantity of goods for the account of and to the order of CL. The original was later received by CL.
 
28        In view of the importance which CL has placed on the warehouse receipts, I set out below the terms of one warehouse receipt as an example. The others were in similar terms:

Authorized Signatory    
 
29        It was also common ground that property, 
ie
 title to the metal, would not pass to CL notwithstanding its receipt of delivery documentation unless and until the metal was ascertained in view of s 16 of the Act. The most common way of ascertainment is by appropriation but that is not the only way. For example, there can be ascertainment by exhaustion, see 
Benjamin’s Sale of Goods
 (6th Ed, 2002) at para 5-062.
 
30        In the present case, however, the issue under the Ascertainment Claim was whether the goods had been ascertained by appropriation. On this point, it was also common ground that appropriation need not be by way of physical segregation of the goods but could be by way of a warehousing accounting system.
 
31        CL’s position was that the appropriation was achieved by each warehouse receipt it received which contained references to lot numbers. While CL accepted that the Fujitrans warehouses did not actually have such lot numbers, CL’s position was that the lot numbers were part of a warehouse accounting system operated by Fujitrans or by Lim. However, Fujitrans was not called to give evidence of such an accounting system, presumably because Fujitrans was disavowing Lim’s actions. Also, Harris had admitted that CL had no direct evidence of a Fujitrans warehouse accounting system in which the lot numbers played a role in the appropriation. CL therefore relied on a number of indirect factors to establish appropriation by way of a warehouse accounting system:
[1]
 
(a)        the Tinfos transaction, where 401.791mt of zinc was purchased by CL, released by CL and shipped out of Singapore by Tinfos using lot reference numbers in a Fujitrans warehouse receipt;
 
(b)        conscientious amendments to errors in faxed Fujitrans warehouse receipts (as seen in the case of the 300mt of nickel briquettes);
 
(c)        returns given by Fujitrans to CL’s request for monthly confirmations by reference to metals held by Fujitrans for CL under lot reference numbers;
 
(d)        Lim’s identification of metals in the Fujitrans warehouses as metals held by Fujitrans for CL when Harris visited the Fujitrans warehouses on 12 March 2002;
 
(e)        instructions by CL to Fujitrans for the release of metal to various banks, using the lot reference numbers in the relevant Fujitrans warehouse receipts; and
 
(f)         the fact that Lim had no problem storing, maintaining, identifying and delivering 300mt of nickel briquettes to CL when instructed to do so.
 
32        As regards the lot numbers in the warehouse receipts, I am of the view that they were neither here nor there. They could have been genuine references from a warehouse accounting system or numbers which Lim or RBG had plucked out of the air to give the appearance of physical lot numbers or of lot numbers as part of a warehouse accounting system.
 
33        The monthly summaries sent by CL for Fujitrans’ confirmation and the subsequent confirmations also referred to the same reference numbers but were likewise neither here nor there.
 
34        As for conscientious amendments to errors in faxed warehouse receipts, those amendments were again neither here nor there. If they were part of a sham, the sham had to be maintained by correcting errors in lot numbers.
 
35        In so far as CL also relied on what was referred to as the Tinfos transaction, this did not carry CL’s case further. The Tinfos transaction was a matter in which CL had purchased 401.791mt of zinc from RBG on or about 10 January 2002. As was in the other instances of purchase, CL received a Fujitrans warehouse receipt. On or about 24 April 2002, CL sold the zinc to RBG. CL was then informed by RBG that it had sold the zinc to Tinfos Nizi SA.
 
36        It was agreed that upon receipt by CL of payment of its price, CL would procure the release of the zinc by sending an appropriate authorisation to Fujitrans to release the zinc to Tinfos. CL was also requested to give an undertaking to Tinfos that upon receipt of a certain sum, it would release the zinc to Tinfos and CL did so. Apparently, before payment was received by CL, Fujitrans had provisionally released the zinc to Tinfos by reference to the same lot numbers in its initial warehouse receipt of January 2002. When CL received payment, it sent a fax instruction to Fujitrans to release the zinc. This fax made reference to the lot numbers under the January warehouse receipt. Fujitrans then wrote to Tinfos to confirm release of the zinc by reference to the same lot numbers.
 
37        CL argued that the lot numbers were a point of reference and accounting. Although I accept that the lot numbers were a point of reference in communication, this did not necessarily mean that they amounted to a warehouse accounting system of identification or appropriation. The lot numbers were consistent with the point that Lim was just using such lot numbers as he thought fit for use in Fujitrans warehouse receipts and other communication to give the impression that metals in each warehouse receipt had been appropriated to the order of CL when, in fact, this was not so. Thus, he could use the same metals again for different purchasers and lenders, so long as he used different lot numbers in his documentation for the metals transacted with these purchasers and lenders.
 
38        In the absence of any further evidence to suggest otherwise, I am of the view that that was what Lim did and the lot numbers were not a means of appropriation by way of a warehouse accounting system. That Tinfos had also referred to the same lot numbers in its communication with Fujitrans was also neither here nor there because Tinfos had, in my view, simply used the same lot numbers as must have been given to it by RBG or CL or Lim.
 
39        Likewise, the fact that CL gave instructions to Fujitrans to release metals to various banks, using lot reference numbers from warehouse receipts, did not establish the warehouse accounting system which CL was relying on.
 
40        The fact that Lim could deliver another quantity of metal, 
ie
 300mt of nickel briquettes, to CL when asked to do so also did not advance CL’s position further. I will say more later about the release of the 300mt of nickel when I deal with RBG’s conversion claim.
 
41        I come now to the visit by Harris on 12 March 2002. The background to this is as follows.
 
42        As I have mentioned, prior to 12 March 2002, CL had received information that RBG’s auditors had resigned on the ground that certain transactions of RBG could not be substantiated. Harris then decided to come to Singapore to do an inspection to establish that what was believed to be held by Fujitrans to the order of CL was, in fact, in the warehouses.
 
43        When Harris arrived in Singapore, he went to Centennial Tower where Fujitrans’ administrative office was located. There, Harris received directions to the warehouse facility and went to meet Lim.
 
44        Harris said he had brought copies of all warehouse receipts issued by Fujitrans to CL. He presented them to Lim and although Lim did not make copies, Lim did refer to them during the inspection. Lim then pointed out various locations where metals were stored and purportedly kept to the order of CL. This included the metals which are the subject of the present action. Subsequently, Harris made a report of this visit, although the report contains an error about the date of the visit being 11 March 2002. I would add that the trip report was written only on or about 31 May 2002, more than one and a half months after the visit on 12 March 2002. Harris said that he wrote this report based on his contemporaneous notes and his recollection.
 
45        In any event, Harris accepted that there were no lot reference numbers in the locations which Lim pointed to, as were found in the warehouse receipts. Furthermore, the metals which Lim pointed to were part of larger bulks as I elaborate on below, when I cite Harris’ affidavit of evidence-in-chief.
 
46        For completeness, I add that Harris also made a second visit to the warehouses on 29 July 2002, after CL had commenced action against Fujitrans. By 29 July 2002, Lim had passed away and this inspection was done by Harris together with CL’s Singapore and English solicitors. They were accompanied by one Gordev Singh, who was the warehouse manager of Rong De. The summary of Harris’ inspection of 29 July 2002 is set out in his statutory declaration of 31 July 2002 wherein he said (at para 40):
 
The metal goods in the Rong De/Fujitrans Warehouse Premises that I saw on 29 July 2002 and identify herein were generally the same goods as those shown to me by Lim Tau Hee on 11 March 2002 as goods held by Fujitrans for the account of Credit Lyonnais, apart from the fact that:
 
(1)        Some of these metal goods were not in the same locations within the Rong De/Fujitrans Warehouse Premises on 29 July 2002 as they were on 11 March 2002, and
 
(2)        the number of drums of Nickel Cathodes I saw at both Blocks 513 and 519 on 29 July 2002 appeared to be less than those I saw on 11 March 2002.
 
47        As can be seen, the 29 July 2002 visit did not advance CL’s position further. Indeed CL did not rely on the 29 July 2002 visit in its pleadings or submissions to constitute appropriation by Lim. CL was relying on the visit of 12 March 2002 as that was the time when Lim had pointed out metals in various locations to Harris. However, in so far as CL was relying on the earlier visit for appropriation by Lim, it is significant that Harris’ affidavit of evidence-in-chief suggested otherwise. Paragraph 69 thereof stated:
 
The fact that quantities of metal purchased by Credit Lyonnais were at some time held as part of an unsegregated bulk of that type of metal by way of a non-physical segregation of metal in the warehouse is evident from the manner in which Lim Tau Hee showed me metal that Fujitrans held for Credit Lyonnais when I visited the Fujitrans warehouse on 12
th
 March 2002. The Trip Report that I made with respect to my 12
th
 March 2002 trip to the Fujitrans warehouse records that metal goods held by Fujitrans for Credit Lyonnais were shown to me by Lim Tau Hee in a way that suggests that Credit Lyonnais’ metal may have been kept as part of a general bulk of nickel, copper or tin in the Fujitrans warehouse or by way of non-physical segregation of such metal …
 
48        Furthermore, Harris’ evidence was:
[2]
 
Q.        … Now, Mr Harris, I am suggesting to you that the statutory declaration which was sworn in July does not show that the metal which you saw, whether on 11 March [meaning 12 March] or on 29 July, can be positively identified to CLRD?
 
A.        I think Mr Gill is correct in assuming that, your Honour, given that we go back to the same point, that the lot reference numbers of Mr Lim’s system of identifying material, that benefit to us does not exist anymore. Mr Gill is correct, it cannot be identified.
 
49        One day earlier during cross-examination, Harris’ evidence was that perhaps Lim had lied to him when Lim had pointed out various metals during the 12 March 2002 visit:
[3]
 
Q.        So, that brings me to the question which I wanted to ask before I went down this road and I told his Honour that I will ask you the question at the end, but I have asked you lots of questions along the way, but now finally I come to that question.
 
            Can you tell the Court if you still believe that Mr Lim Tau Hee was being truthful when he pointed to material at the Fujitrans’ warehouse, as you say, and told you that that material belonged to CLRD? We have seen so much. What is your view now?
 
A.        At the time I visited the warehouse, your Honour, when Mr Lim pointed out cargoes that were owned by Credit Lyonnais to me, I believed he was telling the truth, that they were the cargoes that Credit Lyonnais owned. There is obviously some dispute over the cargoes as they stand at the moment. Everyone has their own view as to the problems that are occurring. If you ask me do I believe now that he was lying or not, I think the only thing we can look at is the man’s character, your Honour. From what we see, given the fact that he said several different conflicting comments to several people, he obviously cannot be telling the truth to everybody. Given that fact, he must have lied to somebody, or two people or everybody. I think it would be wrong for me to turn around and say that I believe in my heart that he was only telling me the truth and everyone else a lie. So, if the question is do I think he was lying to me specifically or lying to everybody, he was lying to somebody, yes, so maybe it could have been me.
 
50        Harris was referring to a conversation and a meeting which Lim had had with Kennard on 6 May 2002. I have alluded to this above. According to Kennard, Lim had told him that all the metals in the Fujitrans warehouses belonged to RBG. There was also apparently an inspection by Joseph Quiazon, a representative from another bank, but he did not give evidence.
 
51        In my view, Lim knew that RBG did not have enough metals for its transactions with various banks, whether the banks were purchasers or lenders. I will refer to this as the overlapping of metals. On 12 March 2002, he knew where different metals were stored, he knew the purpose of Harris’ visit and he took Harris around and pointed to various locations where sufficient metals of the type in question were stored so as to give the impression that he could identify CL’s metals to the exclusion of those of others.
 
52        There is one minor qualification. In one of the SGS survey reports, 
ie
 SGS Survey Report Certificate No 6005/170028, for severonickel dated 14 April 2001, there is a reference, at p 74, to words on a document on one drum of nickel identified in the SGS report as 519-W127. These words on the document are “Credit Lyonnais RBG A/C”. The document is a piece of paper stuck near the bottom right of the drum with the words barely visible. In cross-examination, Mr Malcolm Brian Shierson (“Shierson”), one of the English liquidators of RBG, was prepared to give some weight to that sticker and agreed, initially, that it was possible to associate other drums in the same area as being nickel held for CL. However, he then said he was prepared to accept that the sticker gave CL “some credibility to claim that drum” alone.
[4]
 
53        However, in RBG’s closing submissions at para 4.8.12, RBG was not prepared to concede this one drum to CL arguing that the sticker was clearly insufficient to identify Lot 519-W127 as part of CL’s claim.
 
54        In my view, if the effect of the sticker on one drum is to apply to other drums, the question will then be how many other drums are covered. There is no evidence to say how many other drums were intended to be covered, if at all any, by the person who pasted the sticker. This highlights the problem of ascertainment which CL faces. Indeed, as there was no evidence as to who pasted the sticker on the drum, I might not have attributed the action to Lim and the one drum to CL. However, in view of the fact that Shierson was prepared to accept CL’s claim to this one drum, I will allow CL’s claim in respect of it only.
 
55        Accordingly, except for the one drum, I am of the view that CL has failed in the Ascertainment Claim. In the circumstances, it is not necessary for me to express a view on other points, for example, a tracing exercise which Shierson said had been undertaken or the point raised by the liquidators that the warehouse receipts were forgeries.
 
The Commingling Claim
 
56        As I have stated above, the Commingling Claim is based on the premise that after the metals had been ascertained (by appropriation), they were wrongfully commingled by Fujitrans with other metals. As CL has failed to establish that the metal it claims were ascertained in the first place, the Commingling Claim must also fail.
 
The Bulk Claim
 
57        The Bulk Claim was based on ss 20A(1) and 20A(2) of the Act which state:
 
20A.—(1) This section applies to a contract for the sale of a specified quantity of unascertained goods if the following conditions are met:
 
(a)        the goods or some of them form part of a bulk which is identified either in the contract or by subsequent agreement between the parties; and
 
(b)        the buyer has paid the price for some or all of the goods which are the subject of the contract and which form part of the bulk.
 
(2)        Where this section applies, then (unless the parties agree otherwise), as soon as the conditions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) are met or at such later time as the parties may agree —
 
(a)        property in an undivided share in the bulk is transferred to the buyer; and
 
(b)        the buyer becomes an owner in common of the bulk.
 
58        The liquidators submitted, therefore, that the following requirements had to be satisfied in order for CL to be able to rely on s 20A:
 
(a)        The first requirement of sub-s (1) is that there should be “a contract for the sale of a specified quantity of unascertained goods”;
 
(b)        The second requirement is that the goods or some of the goods form part of a bulk, 
ie
 the goods must be fungible goods in that they must be of the same kind and interchangeable with any other goods therein the same number or quantity;
 
(c)        The third requirement is that the bulk must be identified either in the contract or by subsequent agreement between the parties; and
 
(d)        The fourth and final requirement is that the buyer must have paid the price for some or all of the goods which are the subject of the contract and which form part of the bulk.
 
I will adopt this categorisation for present purposes.
 
59        As regards the first requirement, it was not disputed, subject to the submissions on s 62(4) of the Act, which I will come to, that each contract of sale to CL was a contract for the sale of a specified quantity of unascertained goods at the time the contract was entered into.
 
60        As regards the second requirement, s 61(1) of the Act defines “bulk” as:
 
... a mass or collection of goods of the same kind which —
 
(a)        is contained in a defined space or area; and
 
(b)        is such that any goods in the bulk are interchangeable with any other goods therein of the same number or quantity ...
 
61        As both sides referred to the report on 
Sale of Goods Forming Part of a Bulk
 by The Law Commission and The Scottish Law Commission (Law Com No 215; Scot Law Com No 145), 20 July 1993 (“the Commissions”) when they proposed the present s 20A, I will do likewise. The definition of bulk in s 61(1) was proposed by the Commissions. The Commissions also provided guidance as to what constitutes a bulk at para 4.3 of their report:
 
(a)        a cargo of wheat in a named ship;
 
(b)        a mass of barley in an identified silo;
 
(c)        the oil in an identified storage tank;
 
(d)        cases of wine (all of the same kind) in an identified cellar;
 
(e)        ingots of gold (all of the same kind) in an identified vault;
 
(f)        bags of fertiliser (all of the same kind) in an identified storehouse;
 
(g)        a heap of coal in the open at a specified location.
 
62        After these illustrations, the Commissions said that their proposed definition (of “bulk”) was intended to exclude a seller’s general stock.
 
63        Relying on this statement, the liquidators argued that since RBG was in the business of buying and selling metals, the metals in the Fujitrans warehouses were part of RBG’s general trading stock and hence, should be excluded from the definition of bulk.
 
64        I do not agree with that approach. The Commissions’ statement (at para 4.3) was followed by another sentence and I set out both below:
 
The definition is intended to exclude a seller’s general stock. A person who buys a quantity of unascertained goods to be delivered out of the seller’s general stock would not be buying an item out of an identified bulk.
 
65        I am of the view that the general stock was intended to be excluded because it would not be an identified bulk. However, if a bulk comes within the definition of s 61(1) of the Act and it is identified, it will come within s 20A(1) even if the identified bulk is also part of the general stock of the vendor. The real question on this requirement is whether there was a bulk within the definition of s 61(1) and whether it has been identified.
 
66        As will be recalled, the definition of “bulk” refers to a mass or collection of goods “of the same kind”. In the examples given by the Commissions, reference was made to ingots of gold, all of the same kind.
 
67        In the case before me, the metals in the Fujitrans warehouses were not all of the same kind. There were, for example, copper, nickel and tin. That the nickel, copper and tin might each have constituted a sub-bulk of metal of the same kind is a different point.
 
68        Furthermore, the warehouse receipts did not identify the location of the particular warehouse in which the metals were stored. Each warehouse receipt was on the letterhead of Fujitrans and there was a reference in its contents only to “Inwarehouse Singapore”. I have set out the full text of one such warehouse receipt (at [28] 
supra
) as an illustration.
 
69        Likewise, the monthly confirmations from Fujitrans also did not identify the location of the particular warehouse. The cover letter from CL forwarding each monthly summary for confirmation also did not identify the location of the particular warehouse. It simply referred to “a summary of base metal stock stored within your warehouse facilities” as at a certain date.
 
70        As regards the third requirement, CL had to establish that the bulk was identified either in each contract or by subsequent agreement between the parties. It was common ground that at the time each contract was entered into, the bulk was not identified as the location of the metal sold was not mentioned in the contract document, 
ie
 the purchase confirmation. Indeed it was CL’s position that, legally, RBG was not obliged to tender or forward delivery documentation from Fujitrans subsequent to the entry of each contract so long as the delivery documentation pertained to metal of the type and quality sold, even though CL and RBG may have been contemplating metal in a Fujitrans warehouse.
 
71        The question then was whether the bulk was identified by subsequent agreement between the parties. Here, CL’s case also ran into difficulty.
 
72        Its case was that the warehouse receipts, and also the monthly stock confirmations, had appropriated the metals set out therein by virtue of the lot numbers mentioned therein and not that these documents had identified the bulk from which the metals were coming from.
 
73        Likewise, CL’s case was that in Harris’ visit of 12 March 2002, the metals had been appropriated by Lim by his pointing out of metals at various locations in the warehouses to Harris.
 
74        In the circumstances, the liquidators submitted that CL “cannot turn a failed attempt to purchase unascertained but subsequently specific goods into an ex-bulk sale”. Although this submission was not happily worded as the metals were never specified, 
ie
 ascertained, I agree that there cannot be an agreement on a bulk by default. Either the bulk was identified subsequently by agreement or it was not. A failed or invalid appropriation of goods in a bulk does not become an agreement that the goods were sold as part of that bulk. There was no such agreement. As much was admitted by Harris in cross-examination:
[5]
 
Q.        I said with RBG, Mr Harris, did you have an agreement with RBG that the material that they were selling you and which subsequently became identified in the warehouse receipt was going to be held as part of a bulk in the Fujitrans’ warehouse? It is a very simple question: was there such an agreement or was there no such agreement with RBG?
 
A.        Sorry, I misunderstood the question. There was no agreement with RBG that it would be held as a bulk. It was specified goods. Sorry, Mr Gill.
 
75        In the circumstances, CL would also be unable to satisfy the fourth requirement. Although it has paid the price under each contract of purchase, the metal was not purchased as part of a bulk.
 
76        Accordingly, CL has also failed in the Bulk Claim.
 
Are the liquidators estopped by objective acts?
 
77        CL also submitted that by delivering or procuring the delivery of the warehouse receipts to CL, RBG had represented to CL that it was appropriating metals to the purchases or alternatively, that it was identifying the bulks of nickel, copper and tin in the Fujitrans warehouses as bulks from which CL’s metals were to come. In reliance on such representations, CL had acted to its detriment by paying the purchase price and RBG is therefore estopped from contending otherwise.
 
78        However, estoppel was not pleaded and CL was not entitled to rely on estoppel.
 
79        Secondly, the cases relied on by CL on estoppel do not advance its position.
 
80        The first case relied on by CL was 
Knights v Wiffen
 (1870) LR 5 QB 660. However, that case did not deal with the issue as to whether the liquidators of a company are bound by representations made by that company. The headnote for that case states:
 
The defendant, having a quantity of barley in sacks lying in his granary which adjoined a railway station, sold eighty quarters of it to M. No particular sacks were appropriated to M., but the barley remained at the granary subject to his orders. M. sold sixty quarters of it to the plaintiff, who paid him for them and received from him a delivery order addressed to the station-master, as was usual in such cases. The plaintiff sent this order in a letter to the station-master, saying, “Please confirm this transfer.” The station-master shewed the delivery order and the plaintiff’s letter to the defendant, who said, “All right, when you get the forwarding note I will put the barley on the line.” M. became bankrupt; and the defendant, as unpaid vendor, refused to deliver the barley when the forwarding note was presented to him by the station-master acting for the plaintiff:—
 
Held
, that the defendant was estopped by his statement to the station-master from denying that the property in the goods had passed to the plaintiff; for, by making such statement, he induced the plaintiff to rest satisfied under the belief that the property had passed, and so to alter his position by abstaining from demanding back the money which he had paid to M.
 
81        CL also submitted that the legal position from 
Wiffen
 was acknowledged in 
In re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd
 
[1995] 1 AC 74
 in which the Privy Council distinguished the facts there from those in 
Wiffen
. However, I note that in 
Goldcorp Exchange
, what the Privy Council had said of 
Wiffen
, at 93, was that:
 
There may perhaps be a shadow over this decision, notwithstanding the high authority of the court: see the observations of Brett LJ in 
Simm v Anglo-American Telegraph Co
 
(1879) 5 QBD 188
, 212.
 
The Privy Council then proceeded on the assumption that the decision in 
Wiffen
 was correct but considered that 
Wiffen
 did not apply to the facts before it.
 
82        In any event, the issue before me is not so much whether RBG is estopped but whether the liquidators of RBG are estopped 
vis-à-vis
 CL’s Ascertainment Claim and Bulk Claim.
 
83        On this issue, the liquidators relied on three cases which, I agree, mean that they are not estopped. I will refer to the cases in chronological order.
 
84        In 
In re Exchange Securities & Commodities Ltd
 
[1988] Ch 46
, Harman J said, at 58:
 
If the liquidator did not make the statement, it does not fall within the fifth probandum of the requirements of estoppel by representation as stated in 
Spencer Bower and Turner, Estoppel by Representation
, 3rd ed. The liquidator, and I have used the words “trustee” and “liquidator” entirely interchangeably in this set of observations, is entirely free to say, “I am not the company for this purpose. I am here fulfilling the statutory function of considering the debts of the company and paying its true creditors. Let all creditors come in and satisfy me as to their true debts regardless of what may have been the position caused by estoppels, which are only, of course, rules of evidence, as between the company and you before it went into liquidation.”
 
85        In 
The Fat Kee Firm v The Po On Marine Insurance Co., Ld.
 
[1907] 4 HKCU 1
, the facts are similar to those before me, although they are not identical. There, the firm of Kwong Yik Wo was a large dealer in flour which was stored in the Hop Yick godowns. The firm obtained advances on its consignments of flour from various persons including the firm of Fat Kee and Hung Sheung, from an insurance company and also from the owner of the godowns, one Mrs Musso. Kwong Yik Wo encountered financial difficulties and its managing partner disappeared. The firm was made bankrupt and the Official Receiver was appointed trustee. The manager of the Hop Yick godowns also disappeared. It was discovered that very little flour remained in the godowns and these had been seized by Mrs Musso. Subsequently, some flour was found in the Po On godowns deposited in the names of Chan Wai Chi and Chai Kee. Fatt Kee and Hung Sheung filed a writ against Po On Marine Insurance Co and Chan Wai Chi in trover for the return of 10,000 bags of flour in the Po On godowns and damages for detention. Apparently these claimants were pledgees or chargees of the flour. The Chief Justice of Hong Kong said there were two main contentions. The first was whether there was a sufficient appropriation of the bags of flour, assuming that the law as to ascertainment in the case of sales applied to pledges of goods. The second was whether the plaintiffs could acquire title based on estoppel, assuming they could not establish appropriation.
 
86        After considering various cases on the issue of estoppel, including the case of 
Wiffen
, the Chief Justice of Hong Kong concluded (at 29):
 
[O]ne thing is abundantly clear from this discussion: that the creditors of Kwong Yik Wo, who are represented by the Official Receiver, are not bound by the estoppel, and that so far as the bankrupt’s estate is concerned, the plaintiff cannot set up this estoppel.
 
However, I should mention that although this legal principle is clearly stated, it was not entirely clear to me what representation or conduct in that case was alleged to have constituted the estoppel. It may have been the presence of the manager of Kwong Yik Wo in a godown when inspection was done by a representative of a claimant.
 
87        The third case is an unreported decision by Choo Han Teck J in 
Asia Sawmill Co Pte Ltd v Tan Bak Liang
 
[1999] SGHC 160
. Although the facts there are different from those before me, an issue arose as to whether an alleged agreement, if it existed, could bind the liquidators of Asia Sawmill. Choo J said at [5] to [7]:
 
Counsel for Liang argued that the liquidator is estopped from reneging from the agreement between the parties. She submitted that Liang San is prejudiced because Kheng Kee had already been wound up. This argument fails on two counts. First, as I have stated, there was no evidence of any representation by Asia Sawmill to Liang San. …
 
Secondly, any estoppel that might have arisen against Asia Sawmill in these circumstances does not bind the liquidator. On the assumption that a representation as alleged was indeed made, it was made by the company Asia Sawmill as Liang San contends. It is not alleged that the liquidator made it or was privy to it in any way. On that basis, Liang San’s case would still fail at the threshold because the defence of estoppel operates only against the person who made the representation whether by himself or his agent. This liquidator was not in the circumstances of this case the agent of Asia Sawmill. …
 
The principle that a liquidator may not be estopped by representations made by the company was fully explored in 
Re Exchange Securities & Commodities
 
[1988] 1 Ch 46
. This case concerned the application by the liquidator of two companies in liquidation for directions. The two companies were related and were involved in the business of speculating internationally in commodities. It transpired that they had reported fictitious profits to some investors. In the course of the liquidator’s applications the question of whether the liquidator was estopped by the representations of the companies in respect of the fictitious profits. Harman J held that he was not. The question to be asked is whether the estoppel will defeat the statutory scheme (of liquidation). Harman J held that it would because it would permit fictitious creditors to deplete the company’s assets. This case before me may not involve a fictitious creditor or claim, but the answer would be the same because the alleged agreed set-off by Asia Sawmill, if at all (I have found on the documents and defendant’s affidavit that there was no agreement by Asia Sawmill), was clearly made in bad faith by an errant director, and ought not bind the liquidator. …
 
88        Accordingly, I am of the view that estoppel cannot be used as against the liquidators of RBG.
 
89        Furthermore, I doubt if estoppel would have been available as against RBG itself, assuming it was not in liquidation, to overcome an absence of ascertainment. For example, if RBG sold 100mt of nickel to each of three purchasers and there were only 120mt of nickel in the Fujitrans warehouses, how would any of the purchasers be able to claim its 100mt in the face of competing claims by the others? Of course, if RBG decided to physically deliver to one purchaser its 100mt first, that would probably constitute the appropriation, leaving aside any question of undue preference in a liquidation. However, in the absence of such a delivery, each of the purchasers would still have no title to the metals in the warehouses. Estoppel would not help as the question would remain as to which metals the purchaser has title to.
 
90        As to whether estoppel could be available against RBG itself in a bulk claim, I also have some doubt if the bulk has not been identified. Further, can there be a bulk claim by estoppel over and above the s 20A claim?
 
91        Perhaps, in most instances, the illustration above would resolve itself either by RBG making physical delivery or payment of damages or going into liquidation.
 
Public policy
 
92        CL also raised another issue which it said need not be pleaded. CL said that to allow RBG its claim to the metals is contrary to public policy and would doubly enrich RBG. CL submit that such a claim should be dismissed on the further ground of 
ex turpi causa non oritur actio
 (from a base act no action originates) and/or of 
ex dolo malo non oritur actio
 (from fraud or an illegal act no action originates). CL also submitted that the fact that RBG’s claim is advanced by liquidators makes no difference. CL relied on 
In re Silver Valley Mines
 (1882) 21 Ch D 381 and 
Knowles v Scott
 
[1891] 1 Ch 717
 for the proposition that liquidators are agents of the company. In my view, the facts in those cases are very different and do not involve the question of public policy or illegality.
 
93        CL also referred to 
Beresford v Royal Insurance Company, Limited
 
[1938] AC 586
. The headnote of that case reads:
 
The personal representative of a person, who, having insured his life, commits suicide while sane, cannot recover the policy moneys from the insurance company, for it would be contrary to public policy to assist a personal representative to recover the fruits of the crime committed by the assured. It makes no difference in law that the policy on its true construction binds the insurance company to pay in the event of the assured’s suicide while sane, after the expiry of a year from the commencement of the insurance, for the Court will not enforce a provision which is illegal or contrary to public policy.
 
According to CL, that case illustrates that even a personal representative of the estate of a wrongdoer is bound by the doctrine that a wrongdoer is not allowed to benefit from his illegal conduct. In my view, that case is clearly different from the facts before me.
 
94        As I have already mentioned, RBG is not the substantive plaintiff in so far as CL’s claims are concerned. CL is making its claim to metals in Fujitrans warehouses and I see nothing contrary to public policy to require CL to establish its title to the metals. It is not a question of allowing RBG to benefit from its illegal conduct in the sense mentioned in 
Beresford
. Furthermore, there is no question of double enrichment. CL has paid for the metals. If it cannot establish its title to the metals, it will have to claim as an unsecured creditor.
 
Section 62(4) of the Act
 
95        As CL was relying on s 20A of the Act, RBG sought to deny CL any relief under s 20A by, in turn, relying on s 62(4) of the Act. Section 62(4) states:
 
The provisions of this Act about contracts of sale do not apply to a transaction in the form of a contract of sale which is intended to operate by way of mortgage, pledge, charge, or other security.
 
96        In view of my conclusion on the Bulk Claim, it is, strictly speaking, not necessary for me to decide the issue arising from s 62(4). However, as there were much evidence and arguments on this issue, I will offer some views on it.
 
97        The parties had initially proceeded on the basis that it was necessary for the liquidators to establish that, in reality, each sale contract was a contract by RBG to provide metal as security to CL for a loan to RBG. In dealing with this point, much was said on behalf of the liquidators about financing transactions as though a financing transaction was necessarily a transaction for a loan. In my view, a financing transaction does not necessarily encompass a loan. Thus in 
Thai Chee Ken v Banque Paribas
 
[1993] 2 SLR 609
, the Court of Appeal cited the following passages with approval. In 
In re George Inglefield, Limited
 
[1993] Ch 1
, Romer LJ said at 27:
 
The only question that we have to determine is whether, looking at the matter as one of substance, and not of form, the discount company has financed the dealers in this case by means of a transaction of mortgage and charge, or by means of a transaction of sale; because, of course, financing can be done in either the one way or the other, and to point out that it is a transaction of financing throws no light upon the question that we have to determine.
 
Also 
Gough on Company Charges
 (Butterworths, 1978) states at 252:
 
Identical ‘financing’ transactions might be effected equally in the form of a loan with mortgage given as security (subject to redemption) or by means of a legal sale (whether or not the seller retains any legal, conditional right of repurchase). The law can describe any given transaction as having a certain legal nature determined independently of its economic ‘object’. It is possible, therefore, to express certain transactions, having the same economic object, in various legal forms.
 
98        In 
Thai Chee Ken
, the respondent bank had purchased shares in another company from the appellant company, Pan-Electric Industries Ltd (“Pan El”). However, it was a condition of that agreement to purchase that Pan El would execute the repurchase agreement contemporaneously. Naturally, the repurchase was to be done at a later date from the purchase. However, Pan El went into liquidation and the liquidators contended that the transactions were really a loan with a charge which were void 
vis-à-vis
 the liquidators for want of registration. The Court of Appeal concluded that the transaction was a purchase and repurchase and was not a loan with a security. The Court of Appeal noted, 
inter alia
, that there was no suggestion that the documents were a sham or a disguise.
 
99        Although 
Thai Chee Ken
 does not concern the application of s 62(4) of the Act or its equivalent, the observations of the Court of Appeal are helpful, as I have noted above. As in 
Thai Chee Ken
, there was no suggestion in the case before me that the documents regarding the purchase and the call option were a sham or a disguise in the sense that they were illegal or that CL had acted dishonestly. The suggestion of a sham or a disguise was in the sense that the transactions did not reflect commercial reality. By that, the liquidators meant that the transactions amounted in commercial reality to loans because of the financing element.
 
100      In addition to what I have already said about financing transactions, I will say that a loan envisages the relationship of a borrower and a lender and the obligation of the borrower to pay the lender. A mortgage, pledge or charge is a security which is provided to secure a payment obligation.
 
101      On the facts before me, there was no relationship of borrower and lender and no obligation on the part of RBG to pay CL after each sale, although the original intention might well have been for CL to lend money to RBG on the security of the metals it purchased. It seems to me that the legal transaction was a sale and purchase and not one of a loan with a security. The fact that CL was holding the same metals it had bought against each call option does not change the position.
 
102      However, that is not all. In the liquidators’ closing reply submissions, the liquidators sought to rely on a new point not pleaded arising from a passage of the judgment of the Lord President in 
Gavin’s Trustee v Fraser
 
[1920] SC 674
. Before I refer to that passage, it is important to bear in mind the facts in the case of 
Gavin
.
 
103      In 
Gavin
, Mr Gavin had initially borrowed some money from the defendant, one Mr Fraser, a timber merchant. He had also entered into a contract with Mr Fraser to haul timber which Mr Fraser was felling and to put it on railway wagons. Mr Gavin was to supply the haulage plant and the job was expected to last more than a year. About a month after this contract was entered into, Mr Gavin entered into a transaction with Mr Fraser in which he allegedly sold the plant to Mr Fraser. The transaction was evidenced by an exchange of letters in which Mr Fraser agreed to sell the plant back to Mr Gavin one year later on repayment of the capital sum plus interest at 6% per annum. Subsequent correspondence also showed that Mr Gavin sought to get a higher sum for the plant thereafter, from Mr Fraser, but Mr Fraser refused to agree to this. Mr Gavin continued to be in possession of the plant and used it for the haulage contract. However, he became bankrupt a few months later.
 
104      It was in these circumstances that the trustee in bankruptcy made a claim against Mr Fraser for, 
inter alia
, the plant alleging that the sale contract of the plant was a fictitious one. The trustee was, therefore, the pursuer and Mr Fraser was the defender. In the course of the dispute, Mr Fraser relied on s 18 r 1 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 regarding the passing of title in a sale of specific goods while the trustee relied on s 61(4) of the 1893 Act which, for present purposes, is 
in pari materia
 with s 62(4) of the Act.
 
105      In these circumstances, the Lord President said at 686–687:
 
But the point on which I definitely part company with the Lord Ordinary is as to the meaning of the relative clause. The exclusion applies in terms, not to transactions which, while they employ sale form, 
actually
 operate by way of security, but to transactions which, while they employ sale form, 
are intended
 so to operate. The latter class logically includes, but is wider than, the former. The former class could not, in any case, fall within the application of an Act dealing only with sale; at any rate, if section 61(4) applies to them at all, it does so only to the effect of stroking the t’s and dotting the i’s of the law as existing without it. But the latter class, in so far as its content exceeds that of the former, falls directly within the application of the Act. [emphasis in original]
 
106      This was the passage which the liquidators relied on to argue that even if the transactions were sale contracts, s 62(4) of the Act would still kick in because the intention of the parties was to create a security arrangement.
 
107      However, the Lord President also continued to say immediately after that passage (at 687):
 
Now, a transaction which actually operates by way of security is one which produces the legal relations of security – holder and reversioner. In like manner, a transaction which is intended so to operate is one which is intended to produce those legal relations. The intention of parties with regard to the operative effect of a transaction into which they enter, one with another, is the same thing, in substance and in quality, as that common intention which is the vital ingredient in all forms of agreement. It “must refer to legal relations: it must contemplate the assumption of legal rights and duties as opposed to engagements of a social character” (Anson on Contract, I. 1, 4). The intention may miscarry on technical grounds, or on account of other legal defect; but that is another matter.
 
Midway in his opinion the Lord Ordinary arrives at the conclusion that the transaction in the present case was a contract of sale, not of loan, and adds – rightly, as I think – that, “after entering into it the defender could not have sued Gavin as his creditor in any part of the ₤1200, either before or after 31st December 1918”. So much for the legal rights of parties under the transaction. But the Lord Ordinary goes on to contrast with this what he calls the “intention” of the parties. That “intention” was, the Lord Ordinary says, 
inter alia
, that (notwithstanding the sentence above quoted) “if the defender did not want to keep the plant and preferred his money, Gavin was to pay him his ₤1200 if able to do so”. The Lord Ordinary is at pains to make it clear that by “intention” in this passage is meant, not any contractual intention, but an understanding which “had no legal validity,” and as to which “it is not proved that either party had any belief that it had, or that the other was under any but a moral obligation to carry it out, and was not bound in law by the contract literally, as it was expressed in writing”. My examination of the evidence has failed to disclose any trace of any such understanding or moral obligation. But the Lord Ordinary goes on to construe the relative clause in section 61(4) as covering “intention” in this sense, and arrives at the conclusion that the transaction was not attended with a transfer of property, because it was “intended” – in the sense explained in the passage referred to – “by the parties to it, notwithstanding its form and the legal relations which it created of seller and purchaser, simply to serve the purpose of affording the defender some security for his advances as against possible creditors of Gavin.” I am unable, for the reasons already given, to agree with the interpretation of the relative clause on which this conclusion is based. It appears to me that there underlies it a confusion between the motive which may have inspired the transaction and the contractual intention with which the actual transaction was made.
 
108      Accordingly, in so far as the liquidators were seeking to go behind the legal relationship between RBG and CL, it seems to me that the Lord President’s judgment in the case of 
Gavin
 did not assist the liquidators.
 
109      The other judgments in the case of 
Gavin
 also do not support the liquidators’ contention.
 
110      For example, Lord MacKenzie said at 688:
 
The issue is the same as in the latest case in this Division 
Hepburn v. Law
 [1914 SC 918], whether there was merely the form of a contract of sale without the reality, and in the English case of 
Maas v. Pepper
 [
[1903] 1 KB 226
, 
[1905] AC 102
], in which the Lord Chancellor used the expression that the sale was colourable. The word “colourable” is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as “covert, pretended, feigned, counterfeit, collusory, done for appearance only”. None of these expressions can be applied with justice to the transaction here. If not, and if the contract amounts in reality to a contract of sale, it matters not, in my opinion, what the ulterior object may have been. A real contract of sale is not struck at by any rule of the common law or by the provisions of section 61(4) of the Sales of Goods Act.
 
111      Lord Skerrington was able to reach a conclusion without having to express a definite opinion on the object and effects of s 61(4) of the 1893 Act. Nevertheless, he went on to say at 696:
 
The language used is wide enough to include a case where an attempt has been made to conceal a loan under the disguise of a sale. I am disposed, however, to think that the Legislature had primarily in view transactions in which a lender stipulates for and obtains a property title as a security for his loan and by a transparent and innocent legal fiction is represented to be a purchaser; and also sales where, by a collateral agreement, the purchaser undertakes to account to the seller for any profit which he may make on a resale after recouping himself with interest for his outlays, including the price which he paid for the goods. … As regards the case now before us, I am of the opinion that the facts established at the proof do not justify the Lord Ordinary’s finding to the effect that the transaction between the parties was intended to operate by way of security. There is no evidence to the effect that the parties intended to subject themselves to any “moral obligation” different from or additional to their legal obligations. Even if there had been evidence to that effect I should not have regarded as material an “intention” which the parties deliberately deprived of any legal efficacy.
 
112      Lord Cullen said at 699–700:
 
While the Lord Ordinary holds that the contract between the parties was one of sale, and that there was no contract of loan, thus disposing of the issue of fact raised on record in favour of the defender, he has gone on to decide that Rule 1 of section 18 does not apply to the case. He holds it excluded by section 61(4) of the Act, which provides: “The provisions of this Act relating to contracts of sale do not apply to any transaction in the form of a contract of sale which is intended to operate by way of mortgage, pledge, charge, or other security”. The pursuer has no plea expressly directed to this enactment. I confess to having some difficulty in grasping quite clearly the Lord Ordinary’s view in this part of his judgment. He has held that the contract of December 1917 was a true contract of sale, attended with no contractual reservation or collateral engagement, apart from the 
pactum de retrovendendo
, which in itself did not make the sale any the less a true sale. Accordingly, the “intention” that the said sale should operate “by way of mortgage, pledge, charge, or other security” which the Lord Ordinary finds to have existed, would seem to have been nothing contractual in nature, but only some state of mind, presumably common to both parties, which bound neither, and which each was free to modify or desert entirely at pleasure. I have difficulty in supposing that this is what is postulated in section 61(4) by the word “intended”, but assuming that it is, I am, unlike the Lord Ordinary, unable to find evidence of its existence in the present case. I do not find proof that the parties to this contract of sale were minded in common that it should operate by way of mortgage, pledge, charge, or other security. The defender’s evidence is to the contrary effect. Gavin’s evidence, for what it is worth, is to the effect that there was no contract or sale but only a contract of loan, a presentation of the facts the truth of which has been negatived. Under reference, however, to the cases which the Lord Ordinary says he has followed, the pursuer’s counsel argued that if a transaction which embraces a contract of sale is, on all its terms taken together, such that, when it is put in operation according to its terms, the resulting rights and obligations 
hinc inde
 are just those appropriate to a simple and explicit contract of loan on security, then the transaction, in respect of such 
modus operandi
, falls under the ban of section 61(4). This may or may not be right, but it does not appear to me to apply to the present case. It is not a true description of the 
modus operandi
 of the contract here in question to say that it was equivalent to that of a mere security transaction. The contract had alternative modes of operation. If Gavin had exercised his power of repurchase by paying to the defender the ₤1200 with interest, the parties would, no doubt, have stood in the end in the same position in which they would have stood as the result of a loan given and repaid. There would, however, have been these differences, that the defender during the interval stood owner of the plant, and that Gavin was under no obligation to repay the money. On the other hand, in the event, which happened, of Gavin failing to exercise his power of repurchase, the 
modus operandi
 of the contract was to leave the defender owner of the plant as by right of purchase, freed from the spent 
pactum de retrovendendo
. A transaction by way of security only does not operate to such an effect.
 
113      Accordingly, while it may be said that e-mail from RBG prior to the transactions had suggested that RBG was seeking a loan with the metals being provided as security, and CL’s e-mail in response did not disagree with what RBG was seeking, the end result was the contractual structure of a purchase and an option granted to RBG which gave RBG the entitlement but not the obligation to buy the metals back. As was observed by Lord Cullen in 
Gavin
, RBG would have stood in the same position as a borrower who had repaid the loan to it if RBG exercised its option. However, in the interval, CL would have been the owner, if the appropriation had been properly and validly carried out. Further, if RBG chose not to exercise its option, then CL would remain the owner of the metals.
 
114      The liquidators also relied on the minutes of a CL credit committee meeting of 7 December 1998, where the following was stated:
 
For the future, there are possibilities to enhance our income from this relationship by providing self securing, self liquidating stock finance facilities (“Cash & Carry”) either on an on balance sheet or an of balance sheet basis. This would benefit both CLUK and CL Rouse as the business would be structured in such a manner as to ensure that CL Rouse transacts the hedging. In addition, the CL group would benefit from the fact that margin payments made under such a facility would be retained in the organisation.
 
115      The names below those minutes were those of Andy Howell, Relationship Manager, and Roy Pemberton, Head of Commodities. Neither were called by CL to give evidence to explain this paragraph of the minutes which seemed to suggest that CL was looking at a security arrangement. However, Harris said that Andy Howell was working in a separate department and reported to Roy Pemberton while Harris himself reported to Andy Grooch. Harris also said that Andy Howell had never spoken to him about CLRD’s relationship with RBG. Moreover, I note that the minutes were dated about three years before RBG began to enter into transactions with CLRD. Accordingly, I did not place much weight on the minutes.
 
116      What is more interesting is cl 5 of the standard Call Option Confirmation which the liquidators also relied on. It will be recalled that after each purchase by CL, CL would grant RBG a call option to buy back the metals. Clause 5 stated:
 
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default RBG shall not be entitled to exercise its rights under this call option and all such rights shall lapse and CLRD may sell nickel it is holding against this option to third parties and RBG shall indemnify and keep indemnified CLRD against all losses, costs and expenses incurred by CLRD as a result of such third party sales.
 
117      In the call option confirmation, one of the events of default was if RBG became insolvent or was generally not paying its debts as they became due. Bearing in mind that RBG was not contractually obliged to exercise the call option in the first place, the inclusion of cl 5 was surprising. It gave rise again to the spectre of a security arrangement.
 
118      Harris, not being a lawyer, could only say that he had inquired of CL’s legal department and it was explained to him that as CL was holding stock against each option, there might be a loss to CL if CL had to liquidate the stock. CL would then want to claim consequential damages against RBG. Clause 5 was incorporated to take into consideration the case of 
Hadley v Baxendale
 (1854) 9 Exch 341; 156 ER 145.
[6]
 
In para 148 of CL’s reply submissions, CL submitted that cl 5 would have applied where RBG, having exercised the call option, committed a breach of the terms of the call option. In my view, cl 5 was not worded as such.
 
119      In any event, I note that cl 5 would not apply if RBG had simply allowed the call option to lapse without an event of default. Accordingly, I am of the view that cl 5 did not turn a purchase and a call option into a loan with a security.
 
RBG’s claim in conversion
 
120      As I have mentioned above, Harris had made an inspection of Fujitrans warehouses on 12 March 2002. Subsequently, on 7 May 2002, he had a telephone discussion with Lim and instructed Lim to release metals purchased by CL to Steinweg.
 
121      According to the evidence of Tay Choon Peng, an operations officer with Steinweg, Steinweg received written instructions from CL on 7 May 2002 to take delivery of the following metals from Fujitrans:
 
(a)        1,000 bundles of ENAF brand tin ingots weighing 504.360mt nett;
 
(b)        100 bundles of ENAF brand tin ingots weighing 50.882mt nett;
 
(c)        1,000 drums of Severo brand nickel cathodes weighing 494.987mt nett;
 
(d)        150 bags of Sherritt brand nickel briquettes weighing 300mt nett; and
 
(e)        350 drums of Severo brand nickel cathodes weighing 173.519mt nett.
 
122      The Keppel Distripark was in a free trade zone as was Jurong Port where Steinweg’s warehouse was located. Steinweg had to obtain cargo clearance permits to move the metals from one free trade zone to another. Steinweg obtained the permits on 8 and 9 May 2002. It then informed Lim that it was sending its hauliers to collect CL’s cargo. Lim then released 150 bags of nickel briquettes to Steinweg. After they were moved out of Keppel Distripark on 9 May 2002, Tay telephoned Lim to ask about the next batch of CL’s metal to be released and at that time Lim said he had instructions not to release any metal. The 150 bags amounted to 300mt.
 
123      The liquidators’ position was that according to RBG’s records, which were admittedly incomplete, there should have been 750mt of nickel briquettes in the Fujitrans warehouses as at the date of provisional liquidation in England in May 2002. There was no reference in any packing list of nickel briquettes leaving the Fujitrans warehouses. The liquidators submitted that CL was not able to demonstrate that the 300mt of nickel briquettes removed on its behalf belonged to it and that its 300mt would have been part of the 450mt missing from the warehouses.
 
124      In any event, I note that CL could not establish appropriation of the nickel briquettes prior to the release for the same reasons I have stated in respect of the Ascertainment Claim.
 
125      I also note that CL is not relying on s 18 rr 5(1) and 5(2) of the Act to claim that the release of the nickel briquettes amounted to appropriation if there was no earlier appropriation of the same. If CL had sought to rely on the release, it would have had to contend with two questions bearing in mind that the date of release, 
ie
 9 May 2002, was after the effective date of the appointment of provisional liquidators and commencement of winding up in England. The questions then would have been whether Lim still had authority to release the metal and whether the release was void for being a disposal of RBG’s assets after the commencement of winding up.
 
126      CL, however, relied on the telephone conversation between Harris and Lim of 7 May 2002 wherein Lim had said that 100% of CL’s nickel briquettes were in the warehouses. It seems to me that this argument pertained to the question whether the nickel briquettes had been appropriated, prior to their release to Steinweg, by the warehouse receipts and the other factors which CL had relied on for the Ascertainment Claim. I have already given my view on that. I also do not place much weight on what Lim had said. In my view, he said whatever he wanted to regardless of the fact that there was no appropriation of the metal. I do not consider that statement of his, during the telephone conversation, as being adequate evidence of earlier appropriation by him.
 
127      As for the argument that Lim apparently had no difficulty in identifying the nickel briquettes for release to Steinweg, that is again neither here nor there. There were 300mt of nickel briquettes in the Fujitrans warehouses and it was convenient for him to pick those for release and not because they had been earlier appropriated to CL.
 
128      On another point, RBG argued that what was released to Steinweg did not conform to what was purchased by CL. This argument was raised because CL’s initial contract of purchase of nickel briquettes and subsequent rollovers were for the purchase of nickel briquettes of LME grade. The nickel briquettes released were not all of LME grade. However, on this point, Harris said that after the initial purchase, CL was aware that not all the nickel briquettes were of LME grade and therefore a further discount was given by RBG to CL for the deliverability allowance as the non-LME metal would attract a bigger discount should it be on-sold by CL to others. There was documentary evidence of this further discount. Thus, although the contract documents were not amended, it seems to me that RBG and CL had agreed that what was being sold to CL were nickel briquettes of mixed grades. However, this view does not get CL off the hook in the light of my conclusion that the nickel briquettes had not been appropriated to CL before the release to Steinweg.
 
129      In the circumstances, I find that RBG has established its claim against CL for conversion.
 
Orders
 
130      Accordingly, I make the following orders:
 
(a)        I declare that, save for the drum of nickel identified as 519-W127
 
by SGS, RBG remains the legal and beneficial owner of the metals in the Fujitrans warehouses which had been held for the account of RBG prior to any dealing of the metals between RBG and CL.
 
(b)        The sale proceeds of RBG’s metals are to be released to RBG or its solicitors, as RBG’s solicitors may direct.
 
(c)        CL is to pay damages to RBG for conversion of the nickel briquettes. Such damages are the net purchase price or prices which CL has obtained for the same.
 
(d)        CL’s counterclaim is dismissed save for the said drum of nickel for which I declare CL to be the legal and beneficial owner. The sale proceeds of that drum of nickel are to be released to CL or its solicitors, as CL’s solicitors may direct, subject to any set-off in view of (c) above.
 
131      I will hear the parties on interest, costs and any other consequential relief.
 
Plaintiff’s claims allowed, save for one drum of nickel. Second defendant’s claim dismissed, save for one drum of nickel.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          This was an appeal from an order by Magistrate Wong Li Tein acquitting and discharging the respondent of an offence under s 45(b) of the Telecommunications Act (Cap 323, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) for transmitting a message that he knew to be false. The Prosecution appealed against the grounds upon which the court below based the acquittal. I allowed the appeal and now set out my reasons.
The facts
The charge
2          The respondent claimed trial to the following charge in the court below:
MAC 2323/2003
You, JOHN BOON YU KAI, M/40 yrs, NRIC: S1534441E, are charged that you on the 25
th
 day of March 2003, at or about 9.23 am, at Block 117 Commonwealth Drive #01-717, Singapore, did transmit to one, Sergeant Shew Syn Hui of Combined Operations Room, Police Headquarters, Singapore, by means of telephone message to the effect that “Can you send your man to arrest the suspects driving dark green Corolla SCE 9345? He want to murder this Mdm Tan think Blk 108 07-252 Commonwealth Crescent. Mdm Tan is wearing a yellow dress now. The suspect is in the market now” which you know to be false, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 45(b) of the Telecommunication Act, Chapter 323.
The Prosecution’s case
3          It was the Prosecution’s case that the respondent had called the police and given them the aforesaid message at about 9.23am on the day in question. In response to his message, police officers were despatched to the vicinity of the market at Block 117 Commonwealth Drive where they conducted a foot patrol of the area from 9.40am to 9.50am. However, there was no sign of either the respondent or the suspect complained of.
4          On the same morning, the respondent made three more calls to the police to check if they had reached the market:
(a)        At 9.38am, he telephoned the police and asked, “Earlier I called, is the police coming?”
(b)        At 9.58am, he called again and said, “Has your Police reached the market? Catch the young chap. He wants to kill Mdm Tan.”
(c)        At 10.30am, the respondent called the police one last time, stating that “Mdm Tan wearing yellow dress. The man in a dark car SCE 9555 wants to kill her. Why your men haven’t arrived yet? Just now I got call.”
The alleged murder target, Mdm Tan, was one Mdm Tan Sun Nio, the respondent’s mother.
5          Dr Sim Kang, psychiatrist and Registrar of Woodbridge Hospital, was the expert witness for the Prosecution who had examined the respondent after his arrest. Dr Sim stated, in his report, the circumstances surrounding the respondent’s telephone calls to the police as narrated by the respondent to him. Apparently, one Mdm Wong, an ex-neighbour of the respondent and his family, had been causing them various problems for more than ten years. Mdm Wong and her gang had come to their residence on many occasions to scratch their door and open the windows of their unit. Mdm Wong had also told him on several occasions about her intention to kill his mother.
6          The respondent told Dr Sim that on the morning in question, he had gone to the market with his mother when someone took her photograph. On his mother’s instructions, he telephoned the police. He feared for her safety.
7          Dr Sim also interviewed the respondent’s parents and elder sister, and set out the information obtained from them in his report. The respondent’s parents claimed that Mdm Wong had put threatening letters and knives under their door, that she had asked gangsters to burn their home and cut the electrical wiring outside their flat, and that she had wanted to kill the respondent as well. However, the respondent’s sister had never witnessed these events and she had doubts about their veracity. In fact, she had brought the respondent to see a private psychiatrist on her own accord in September 2002, much against the wishes of their mother.
8          Taking into consideration his examination of the respondent on various occasions, his interviews with the respondent’s family members, reviews of the respondent’s old notes and the nurses’ report about the respondent’s behaviour during remand, Dr Sim concluded that the respondent suffered from:
… mild mental retardation (IQ 58) and delusional disorder characterised by firm, fixed delusions about being persecuted and harmed. He was of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offence. Although he knew the nature of his act, he did not believe that it was wrong or against the law to notify the police as he firmly believe[d] that serious harm may befall his mother.
In Dr Sim’s opinion, the respondent’s parents, especially his mother, also shared his delusions of persecution and harm by Mdm Wong and her gang. The Defence did not dispute Dr Sim’s evidence.
9          The respondent also furnished to the police three threatening notes that were allegedly left at his residence by unknown persons. In addition, the police received two complaint letters against the Investigating Officer, one signed by the respondent and the other by his mother. The notes and letters were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for handwriting analysis, whereby the HSA analyst opined that the evidence was consistent with the finding that the same person authored the notes and letters.
10        Though the Prosecution conceded that Mdm Wong did exist and that there had been bad blood between the two families, it maintained that these incidents had happened some 20 years ago. The Prosecution contended that it had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Alternatively, it argued that if the trial judge should be minded to acquit the respondent due to his unsoundness of mind, she should report the case for the order of the Minister and have the respondent kept in safe custody pending the Minister’s order, pursuant to s 315 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”).
Close of the Prosecution’s case
11        At the end of the Prosecution’s case, the trial judge was mindful that the evidence would only have to be approached with minimal evaluation at this stage of the trial. She noted that the respondent had admitted that he made the telephone calls to the police and called upon the respondent for his defence. However, the respondent elected to remain silent. There were no other witnesses for the Defence.
The defence
12        Counsel for the respondent rightly submitted that three elements had to be proved in order to convict the respondent on the charge, namely that:
(a)        the respondent did transmit or cause the message to be transmitted;
(b)        the message was false; and
(c)        the respondent knew that the message was false.
13        It was not disputed that the respondent made the telephone calls to the police. However, counsel contended that the second and third elements of the charge had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. First, he claimed that the evidence before the court was insufficient to warrant the conclusion that the message was false. Second, based on the evidence of Dr Sim, counsel contended that the respondent genuinely believed in the truth of his message.
The decision below
14        The trial judge held that the Prosecution had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt as the second and third elements of the charge had not been established. On the second element, while the trial judge did not rule explicitly as to whether the message was false, she seemed to be of the view that it was more likely to be true than false.
15        She ruled that the following information, which Dr Sim had obtained from the respondent and his parents about their grievances with Mdm Wong, was hearsay:
(a)        The respondent did not claim to have witnessed Mdm Wong and her gang taking photographs of his mother but his mother had told him so;
(b)        The respondent’s mother believed that Mdm Wong was out to kill her and that Mdm Wong had been harassing their family for the last ten years; and
(c)        The respondent’s father similarly believed that Mdm Wong had been harassing their family for the past ten years.
Thus, the aforementioned information did not go towards proving the truth of the events which had taken place.
16        However, the trial judge held that, since the respondent’s parents shared his belief about Mdm Wong’s attempt to murder his mother on the morning in question, it would be harder for the Prosecution to prove its case against the respondent. She also noted that the police had not been able to prove, conclusively, the existence of Mdm Wong and that the Prosecution had conceded that there was bad blood between the respondent’s family and Mdm Wong some 20 years ago.
17        As for the third element, the trial judge disagreed with the Prosecution as to the extent to which the respondent’s delusional disorder affected his perception of the events on the morning in question. She found that the respondent lacked the requisite 
mens rea
 for the offence, not because of his delusional disorder, but because he genuinely believed in the truth of the information that he gave the police. Accordingly, she acquitted and discharged the respondent.
The appeal
18        At the outset, I was mindful that, as an appellate judge, I should be slow to disturb a lower court’s findings of fact unless they were clearly reached against the weight of the evidence or they were plainly wrong: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
; 
PP v Chong Siew Chin
 
[2002] 1 SLR 117
. This was especially so with findings of fact which hinged on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
; 
PP v Hendricks Glen Conleth
 
[2003] 1 SLR 426
. In the present case however, there was no issue as to the credibility and veracity of witnesses. The evidence before the court mainly comprised the unchallenged evidence of Dr Sim with respect to the mental condition of the respondent, as well as established facts derived from the statement of agreed facts. In such a case, it is settled law that an appellate judge is as competent as the trial judge to draw any necessary inferences from the established facts and the circumstances of the case: 
Soh Yang Tick v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 42
; 
Awtar Singh s/o Margar Singh v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 439
.
19        With these principles in mind, I examined the substantive issues on appeal.
20        The relevant provision of the Act in this appeal reads:
45.
 
Any person who transmits or causes to be transmitted a message which he knows to be false or fabricated shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction —
(a) in the case where the false or fabricated message contains any reference to the presence in any place or location of a bomb or other thing liable to explode or ignite, to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both; and
(b) in any other case, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.
As set out at [12] above, the three elements to be proved in order to convict the respondent under s 45(b) of the Act are, namely, that he transmitted or caused the message to be transmitted, that the message was false, and that he knew that the message was false.
21        It was common ground that the first element of the offence had been established. However, the appellant disputed the trial judge’s implicit finding that the second element of the offence was not established. The appellant contended that the 
actus reus
 for the offence, 
viz
 that the respondent transmitted a false message, had been established.
22        Regarding the third element of the offence, the appellant agreed with the trial judge that it had not been established as the respondent lacked the requisite mental element for the offence. Thus, the appellant did not dispute that the respondent should be acquitted. However, the appellant contended that the absence of the requisite mental element was due to the respondent’s unsoundness of mind and not, as the trial judge found, because he genuinely believed in the truth of his message. The appellant contended that the respondent’s act was an offence but for his unsoundness of mind. As such, the trial judge should have stated specifically that the respondent had committed the offence under s 45(b) of the Act, as required under s 314 of the CPC.
 Section 314 of the CPC provides that:
Whenever any person is acquitted upon the ground that at the time at which he is alleged to have committed an offence he was by reason of unsoundness of mind incapable of knowing the nature of the act alleged as constituting the offence or that it was wrong or contrary to law, the finding shall state specifically whether he committed the act or not.
23        
The appellant further contended that the trial judge had failed to report the case for the order of the Minister and to have the respondent kept in safe custody pending the Minister’s order, pursuant to s 315 of the CPC
, which provides that:
(1) Whenever the finding states that the accused person committed the act alleged, the court before which the trial has been held shall, if that act would but for incapacity found have constituted an offence, order that person to be kept in safe custody in such place and manner as the court thinks fit and shall report the case for the orders of the Minister.
(2) The Minister may order that person to be confined in a mental hospital, prison or other suitable place of safe custody during the President’s pleasure.
24        I shall now deal with each of these arguments in turn.
Whether the second element of the offence was established
25        Counsel for the respondent contended that, just because the respondent’s mother had not been murdered, as the respondent had claimed she would be, it did not follow that the message was untrue. He contended that further investigations should have been conducted so as to prove conclusively whether the message was true or false.
26        I was not persuaded by counsel’s contentions. In my view, it was plain from the established facts of the case that the message was false. The offence in this case revolved around the message given by the respondent to the police, as reflected in the charge against the respondent. As far as could be seen from the evidence before the court, the message was patently untrue. The respondent’s message was very specific. It involved a green Corolla with a certain licence plate number, a woman in a yellow dress and a murder suspect who could apparently be found in the market situated at Commonwealth Drive. Yet, it was indubitable that the policemen who were despatched to the scene on the morning in question did not find the slightest hint of the case as reported by the respondent. There was no sign of the car, the alleged murder suspect and the alleged murder target. There were also no incidents in the vicinity of the location provided by the respondent, which could be conceivably linked to the alleged murder attempt. More significantly, the respondent himself failed to come forward to the police and identify himself as the complainant. Instead, he made three further calls to the police to check if they had responded to his first telephone call.
27        In my opinion, the events of that morning in themselves evidenced that the falsity of the respondent’s message had been 
prima facie
 established. It would then be in the respondent’s interest, as the maker of the message, to cast light on the whole incident and give his version of events. The absence of the alleged incidents at the location provided by the respondent certainly called for some explanation which he was in the position to give, and it was imperative that he did so. Yet, he chose to offer none. Neither did he call upon any witnesses on his behalf.
28        Since the respondent had elected to remain silent, the court was entitled to draw such inferences from his refusal to give evidence as appeared proper under s 196(2) of the CPC: 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
            As Lord Diplock said in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
[1980-1981] SLR 73
 at [21]:
What inferences are proper to be drawn from an accused’s refusal to give evidence depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, and is a question to be decided by applying ordinary commonsense …
In my considered opinion, the respondent’s decision to remain silent was highly incriminating and greatly undermined the Defence’s case.
29        At this point, I should also make reference to the complaint letters and threatening notes which were sent to the HSA for handwriting analysis.
 The HSA analyst had opined that the threatening notes and complaint letters were, in all likelihood, authored by the same person. To my mind, this further weakened the respondent’s case as it 
affirmed the hollowness of his message to the police, regardless of whether the various letters and notes had been penned by the respondent himself or by a family member
. 
Moreover, the fact that the respondent suffered from delusional disorders about being persecuted was also borne out by Dr Sim’s evidence, which was not disputed by the Defence.
30        Drawing the threads of the entire picture together, and as a matter of common sense, the irresistible inference from the respondent’s refusal to give evidence was that the message was false. In such circumstances, I was unable to agree with the trial judge’s finding on the second element of the offence. Accordingly, I found that the 
actus reus
 for the offence had been established.
Whether the trial judge’s reasoning in finding that the third element of the offence was not established was flawed
Whether the trial judge was entitled in law to reject Dr Sim’s reasoning that the respondent did not have the requisite mens rea due to his mental disorder
31        The trial judge accepted Dr Sim’s evidence that the respondent did not possess the requisite 
mens rea
 for the offence. However, she seemed to disregard his reasoning in coming to his conclusion. While Dr Sim’s evidence established that the respondent did not know his message was false only because he was labouring under a mental disorder, the trial judge held that the respondent’s mental disorder did not affect the way in which he perceived the events of the morning, leading to his telephone calls to the police. She found that the respondent lacked the requisite 
mens rea
 because he honestly believed in the truth of the message.
32        The appellant argued that the trial judge had contravened the principle enunciated by the Court of Appeal in 
Saeng-Un Udom v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 1
 in so rejecting Dr Sim’s reasoning. The appellant relied on that case for the proposition that a judge is not entitled to reject unopposed and sound expert evidence on a matter which is outside the learning of the court, and to substitute it with his or her own opinion on the matter.
33        I disagreed with the appellant’s contentions. I was of the opinion that as a matter of law, the trial judge was entitled to form her own conclusion as to why the respondent lacked the requisite 
mens rea
. As I previously held in 
Ng So Kuen Connie v PP
 
[2003] 3 SLR 178
, the issue of whether an accused had the requisite 
mens rea
 for an offence is not something which falls within scientific information outside the experience and knowledge of a judge. Instead, it is a finding of fact to be inferred from the available evidence and surrounding circumstances. Implicit in this principle is that the judge’s basis for finding the existence of the requisite 
mens rea
 or lack thereof, is 
a fortiori
 a finding of fact to be inferred from the existing circumstances as well. 
34        In 
Ng So Kuen Connie v PP
, I had in fact distinguished 
Saeng-Un Udom v PP
 as a clear case where the pathological expert evidence was strictly outside the learning of the court. In such a case, the judge should defer to the opinion of the expert. The matrix of the present appeal is similar to 
Ng So Kuen Connie v PP
 as it also deals with a finding of whether an accused possessed the requisite 
mens rea
 for an offence, which in itself encompasses the accompanying reasoning behind such a finding. Accordingly, 
Saeng-Un Udom v PP
 was not helpful to the case at hand.
35        It would be fitting to reiterate the Court of Appeal’s warning in 
Chou Kooi Pang v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 593
 at [17] that:
A chief and justified concern of the courts is that the fact-finding process should not be surrendered to professionals such as psychiatrists, but should remain the province of the courts.
This is especially palpable in cases where there is conflicting medical opinion but perhaps less so in cases like this, where there is a sole psychiatrist giving unchallenged expert evidence. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that Dr Sim’s role in this case was not to usurp the trial judge’s fact-finding role but rather, to assist the court in its finding of fact. As such, it could not be said that the trial judge erred in law when she arrived at her finding by a different reasoning from Dr Sim’s.
Whether the trial judge’s basis for finding that the respondent lacked the requisite mens rea was supported by the available evidence and surrounding circumstances
36        Contrary to Dr Sim’s expert evidence, the trial judge found that the respondent had honestly believed
 in the truth of the message 
and that it was not sufficiently established that his belief stemmed from his unsoundness of mind. While the trial judge was not bound by Dr 
 
Sim’s reasoning in finding that the respondent lacked the requisite 
mens rea
, I found that the available evidence and circumstances of the case did not amply support the reasons behind her finding. Instead, what could be
 evinced was that it was clearly the respondent’s delusions 
that exonerated him from having the requisite 
mens rea
, as his delusions prevented him from recognising the falsity of his message.
37       
 Dr Sim’s unequivocal evidence in his report and in court was that the respondent was mentally unsound at the time of the alleged offence. More importantly, he asseverated that it was this unsoundness of mind that led the respondent to believe that it was not wrong or contrary to the law to give his message to the police. In court, Dr Sim testified as follows:
Q:         What was accused’s diagnosis?
A:         He was suffering from mild mental retarded and delusional disorder (D/D) … D/D is a major psychiatric illness and a form 
of
 psychotic disorder that is characterised by fixed, firm delusions about things which happen around them. This unsoundness of mind was based on fact that 
patient suffer
 [
sic
] 
from psychiatric illness and that led to him not thinking that it was wrong or contrary to the law to do what he did
.
…
Q:         … accused did not know that 999 calls he made to police were false?
A:         Yes … was in the context of D/D that the event happened.
[emphasis added]
38        These parts of Dr Sim’s evidence made it difficult for me to agree with the trial judge that the respondent’s delusional disorder scarcely affected his belief in the truth of his message. Furthermore, the trial judge had omitted to give any weight to these critical parts of Dr Sim’s evidence
 in her grounds of decision. To my mind, since the trial judge had purported to rely on Dr Sim’s evidence, albeit with a focus only on certain parts, it was evident that she found him to be a sound and reliable witness. I surmise that if she had given due weight to the part of Dr Sim’s evidence that established the link between the respondent’s psychiatric disorder and his belief, she would have deferred to the expert opinion.
39        In light of Dr Sim’s unchallenged evidence, I perused the other evidence on record to ascertain if there was anything to render his evidence untenable. However, upon taking into account the entirety of the case and the evidence before me, I could find no other evidence to displace Dr Sim’s evidence. In fact, I found that the evidence lent undeniable support to Dr Sim’s finding that the respondent’s belief in the truth of his message and his inability to see that he was acting contrary to the law, stemmed from his delusional disorder.
40        Another point brought to my attention was that the trial judge had been too hasty in assuming that hearsay information from the respondent’s parents, mentioned above at [15], could hypothetically support her finding that the respondent did not have the requisite 
mens rea
. The trial judge had stated in her grounds of decision at [31] and [32] that:
I must make it clear that I regard this information as hearsay, given that neither the accused nor his parents did take the stand … As such, it did not affect my determination regarding the 
mens rea
 of the accused at the time of the commission of the alleged offence.
Nonetheless, even if I did not regard this information as hearsay, the conclusion that can be drawn from Dr Sim’s report is this: that the impression that the accused has regarding the said Mdm Wong’s attempts to murder his mother, is not unique to him. It is shared by his mother and father who live with him. … The scale between truth and delusion would be tipped against the Prosecution if the accused’s belief that the said Mdm Wong is out to harm his mother … is shared by the other members of his household as well …
41        However, it should not be the case that just because the respondent’s parents shared his belief that Mdm Wong was out to harm his mother, the accuracy and truth of that belief would automatically be bolstered. After all, the trial judge was not, at any point, equipped with the opportunity to assess the veracity and credibility of the respondent’s parents. Furthermore, Dr Sim had noted in his report that the respondent’s parents shared his delusions of being harmed and persecuted by Mdm Wong. Thus, I concluded that the information could not lend credence to the trial judge’s finding that the respondent believed in the truth of his message in spite of his delusions.
42        It 
was clear that the respondent’s belief that it was not wrong or unlawful to make the telephone calls to the police was inextricably linked to his unsoundness of mind.
 He knew the nature of his act and it was his unsoundness of mind that 
eradicated the presence of the requisite 
mens rea
 on his part. As such, I agreed with the appellant that the respondent should be acquitted on the ground of his mental disorder as he did transmit a false message to the police, which would have constituted an offence but for the fact that he was found to be by reason of unsoundness of mind, incapable of knowing that his act was wrong or contrary to law.
The implications of acquitting the respondent on the ground of mental disorder
43        The appellant argued that upon the court finding that an accused committed the 
actus reus
 of an offence but acquitting him by reason of his unsoundness of mind, ss 314 and 315 of the CPC would come into play.
44        As this was the first case of its kind before me, I found it helpful to look to a number of Indian decisions where ss 314 and 315 have been dealt with at length. Section 314 of the CPC is in 
pari materia
 with s 334 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (“the Indian Code”). Section 315 of the CPC is substantially the same as s 335 of the Indian Code, save that s 335 extends a wider discretion to the Indian courts to order delivery of the acquitted person to his relative or friend.
45        The position under ss 314 and 315 is very clear. Under the Indian equivalent of s 314, it is uncontroversial that the court must give a specific finding as to whether the accused committed the act charged against him, as has been affirmed in 
Daljit Kaur v State
 (1968) Cri L J 1090. As for s 315 of the CPC, a plain reading of the provision evinces that when an accused person is found to have committed the act as charged but is acquitted according to s 314 of the CPC, the procedure prescribed under s 315 is mandatory. There is nothing complex about this procedure and it is clear that it must be followed upon acquittal: 
Kuttappan v State of Kerala
 (1986) Cri L J 271; 
Elkari Shankari v State of Andhra Pradesh
 (1990) Cri L J 97.
46        In this case, since s 314 had been satisfied, the steps to be taken under s 315 would follow. I noted that under s 315, it is the court before which the trial has been held that shall order the acquitted person to be kept in safe custody in such place and manner as the court thinks fit and shall report the case for the orders of the Minister. I therefore remitted the case to the trial judge for her to take the necessary steps pursuant to s 315 of the CPC.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          This was a criminal revision filed by a district judge seeking to have this court set aside her conviction and sentence against Sinsar Trading Pte Ltd (“Sinsar”) on the ground that she had exceeded her jurisdiction in accepting Sinsar’s plea of guilty by letter. Sinsar also appealed against the fine of $15,000 meted out by the district judge. Both the criminal revision and the appeal were heard together before me. I allowed the criminal revision, and ordered the conviction and sentence to be set aside for a fresh plea to be taken on an appropriately amended charge. I will now give my reasons.
Facts
2          The National Environment Agency (“NEA”) brought a departmental summons (NEA Summons No 54140 of 2003) against Sinsar on the following charge:
You, Sinsar Trading Pte Ltd, 197702716K of Blk 150 South Bridge Rd #03-14 Fook Hai Bldg Singapore 058727 are charged that you, 
on 05 Jun 2003
 at about 11.00 am, at 150 South Bridge Road, 
no person shall sell or offer for sale any hazardous substances unless he holds a licence granted by the director for such purpose
 and you have thereby contravened section 22(1) of the Environmental Pollution Control Act 1999 and committed an offence under section 22(3) and punishable under section 27 of the aforesaid Act. [emphasis added]
3          The relevant sections of the Environmental Pollution Control Act (Cap 94A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) are as follows:
Application of this Part to hazardous substances
21. This Part shall apply to the hazardous substances specified in the first column of Part I of the Second Schedule except where —
(a) they fall within the exclusion specified in the second column of that Part corresponding to those substances; or
(b) they are contained in any substance, preparation or product specified in Part II of that Schedule.
General prohibition with respect to importation and sale of hazardous substances
22.—(1) 
No person shall import, possess for sale, sell or offer for sale any hazardous substance unless he holds a licence granted by the Director-General for such purpose.
(2) Every licence granted to any person under this section shall not be transferable to any other person and no licence shall authorise the import, possession for sale, sale or offer for sale of any hazardous substance by any individual other than the individual named therein.
(3) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2) shall be guilty of an offence.
Penalty for offences involving hazardous substances
27. Any person who is guilty of an offence under this Part, for which no penalty is expressly provided, shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years
 or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $2,000 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction. [emphasis added]
4          Under the Second Schedule of the Act, acetic acid is listed as the first hazardous substance on the list. There are two exclusions listed in the second column of the Second Schedule next to acetic acid, namely:
(a)        substances containing not more than 80%, weight in weight, of acetic acid; and
(b)        preparations and solutions for photographic use.
5          The NEA first informed Sinsar that it had contravened s 22(1) of the Act by a letter dated 28 July 2003. The letter mentioned an officer’s inspection of Sinsar’s premises on 5 June 2003. During this inspection, the officer realised that Sinsar had purchased 523 drums, or 110mt, of glacial pure acetic acid from Times Chemicals Pte Ltd for re-export. Subsequently, a summons was sent to Sinsar on 20 August 2003. This summons was accompanied by a document entitled “Plea of Guilty by Letter” for Sinsar to plead guilty if it so wished.
6          Under s 137(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed), an accused may plead guilty by way of letter under certain circumstances. Section 137(2) states:
Personal attendance of accused may be dispensed with.
137(2). In any case relating to an offence punishable by fine or 
by imprisonment not exceeding 3 months
 or by both and in which a Magistrate has issued a summons, an accused person desiring to plead guilty and be convicted and sentenced in his absence may appear by advocate, or may by letter addressed to the court plead guilty and submit to pay any fine which may be imposed in respect of that offence, and the court may thereupon record a plea of guilty and convict him according to law, and may sentence him to a fine with or without a sentence of imprisonment in default of payment of the fine. [emphasis added]
7          Sinsar pleaded guilty by way of letter. In this letter, it stated two grounds for the judge to consider in mitigation:
(I)        The physical handling/transportation of this cargo from Malaysia to Pasir Panjang Port (for export) were [
sic
] all done by our suppliers (who hold a valid licence to deal with such products). At no time were we physically involved with this cargo.
(II)       The export permit for this cargo was approved by the Trade Development Board of Singapore.
8          The matter came up for hearing before the district judge during a night court session on 28 October 2003. The plea of guilty by letter was tendered by the prosecuting officer. Sinsar did not appear in court and it was not represented by counsel at the hearing. The district judge recorded the plea of guilty and imposed a fine of $15,000.
9          Subsequently, Sinsar engaged counsel. It obtained leave from the High Court on 9 January 2004 to file an appeal against the sentence out of time and the appeal against sentence was filed on the same day. The district judge issued her grounds of decision on 28 January 2004. In considering the sentence to be imposed, the district judge made the following observations (
[2004] SGDC 54
):
7          Against this background, I am of the opinion that the relevant factors to be taken into consideration for this offence would include the quantity of the substances involved (the larger, the more aggravating), the level of co-operation on the part of the defendant with the agency in relation to subsequently dealing with the hazardous substances in question, the type of hazardous substances involved and its relative danger to the environment, genuine oversight on the part of the defendant, and the presence or absence of previous convictions for similar offences. Turning to the facts of this case, it was not stated in the charge or in the defendant’s letter pleading guilty to the offence the type or quantity of hazardous substances involved. I did however accept as a mitigating circumstance the fact that the defendant did not physically handle the cargo and it was physically handled all the way through to export by its Malaysian suppliers who were licensed to do so. I had to balance this against the legislative intention that the import and sale of such substances must be strictly regulated and that 
all
 potential importers and sellers at any stage of the transactions in such substances must be assessed by the relevant agencies before they are permitted to deal in these substances. I was however unable to give any weight to the fact that the Trade Development Board had approved the export permit for the cargo of hazardous substances as it did not address the main concern of the legislative provision under which the defendant was convicted. Even if the cargo was subsequently exported, its presence in the Singapore ports was a potential risk to our environment.
8          Taking into account the relevant mitigating factor, the fact that the defendant is a first offender and the maximum fine of $50,000 and/or 2 years’ imprisonment for this offence, I was of the opinion that a fine of $15,000 was appropriate.
10        On 10 March 2004, the district judge filed this criminal revision to set aside her conviction and sentence on the ground that she had exceeded her jurisdiction under s 137(2) of the CPC.
11        The Prosecution agreed with the district judge that the conviction and sentence should be set aside. The Prosecution raised three grounds in support of its contention: (a) the charge had been defective; (b) there had been a procedural irregularity; and (c) a disparity in sentencing had arisen. It submitted that this court should quash the conviction, set aside the sentence and remit the case back to the subordinate courts for a fresh plea to be taken on a charge as appropriately amended. Counsel for Sinsar also agreed with the district judge that the conviction and sentence should be set aside. However, counsel went one step further by urging me to grant Sinsar a discharge amounting to an acquittal.
Issue before this court
12        The sole issue for my determination was whether the criminal revision should be allowed and, if it was allowed, the consequential order to be made.
General principles on criminal revision
13        In 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
, I cited Indian cases that discussed the general principles to be considered by the High Court when faced with an application for criminal revision and came to the following conclusion (at 330, [17]):
Thus various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is 
something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
 [emphasis added]
14        
Ng Kim Han v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 293
 arose out of the arrest of seven persons and one Chua Seong Soi while playing a game of cards in a factory. All seven petitioners in that case were jointly charged, pleaded guilty and duly sentenced in the subordinate courts. Subsequently, I allowed Chua Seong Soi’s appeal against his conviction (see 
Chua Seong Soi v PP
 
[2000] 4 SLR 313
) on the ground that the factory did not constitute a gaming house under the provisions of the Common Gaming House Act. Pursuant to that decision, the seven persons in 
Ng Kim Han v PP
 petitioned for a criminal revision of their conviction and sentence. I allowed the criminal revision and found that the petitioners had been convicted and sentenced even though a crucial element of their offence was absent. In coming to that decision, I observed at [10]:
While there is no clear-cut test of what constitutes “serious injustice”, I believe that it cannot really be disputed … that such injustice should be held to exist when a person has been convicted despite the obvious absence of an essential constituent of the offence concerned. Thus, 
petitions for criminal revision have been allowed in cases where the statement of facts do not disclose all the necessary elements of the offence but where the petitioner pleads guilty anyway
. See, for example, 
Chen Hock Heng Textile Printing Pte Ltd v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 745
. [emphasis added]
15        Like the present case, 
Chen Hock Heng Textile Printing Pte Ltd v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 745
 involved a departmental prosecution. In that case, the appellant company pleaded guilty to a charge under s 5 of the Building Control Act (Cap 29, 1990 Rev Ed) (“BCA”) and was sentenced to a total fine of $197,600. Section 5 of the BCA prohibits persons from carrying out building works without the approval of the Building Authority. However, the statement of facts revealed that the appellant company had merely allowed two sheds to remain erected at the front and side of the factory premises.
16        In its appeal against sentence, counsel for the appellant contended that the facts stated in the statement of facts did not constitute any offence under the relevant statutory provisions. This was conceded by the Prosecution. I found that no offence could have been committed by the appellant since there was no allegation of building works being carried out by any person at all, much less the appellant, during the relevant period. I found that the facts of that case fell squarely within the situation contemplated in 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
, and commented, at 749, [11], that:
There can hardly be another case in which it is more “manifestly plain that the offence charged is nowhere disclosed in the statement of facts”.
I then exercised the revisionary powers of the High Court to quash the conviction.
17        With these principles in mind, I will now turn to the detailed errors in the prosecution and sentencing of Sinsar in the court below.
Procedural irregularity
18        This formed the basis of the district judge’s application for criminal revision. To my mind, it was the single most straightforward ground for allowing the criminal revision. Under s 137(2) of the CPC, an accused person may plead guilty by way of letter only if the offence is punishable by fine or by imprisonment not exceeding 
three months
 or by both. Section 27 of the Act, which stipulates the punishment for the offence with which Sinsar was charged, states that the maximum punishment for that offence is a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment of up to 
two years
 or both. In light of the maximum imprisonment term of two years under s 27 of the Act, which exceeds that prescribed under s 137(2) of the CPC, it was patently clear that the district judge had exceeded her jurisdiction in recording the plea of guilty by way of letter. 
19        Be that as it may, it must be remembered that the procedural irregularity originated from the fact that the NEA sent the summons to Sinsar with a standard form letter to facilitate Sinsar to plead guilty by letter if it so wished. Since Sinsar could not have pleaded guilty by letter for the offence with which it was charged, I found that the NEA should not have attached the standard form letter in the first place. Much confusion could have been avoided if the standard form letter had not been sent. Surely it would have been reasonable for the NEA to check whether it was possible for Sinsar to plead guilty under the offence with which it was charged before attaching the standard form letter. Yet, it appeared to me that the NEA failed to perform the requisite checks.
Defective charge
20        The procedural irregularity was but the tip of the iceberg as far as errors in Sinsar’s prosecution, conviction and sentence were concerned. The genesis of the errors in the prosecution of Sinsar could be traced to the blatantly defective charge. I noted with great surprise that the charge was so poorly drafted that it did not conform to basic rules of grammar. The words in the charge did not even form a proper sentence: see the emphasised words in the charge quoted at [2] above. It appeared to me that the words in the charge were merely copied and pasted from the words in s 22(1) of the Act: see the emphasised words in s 22(1) of the Act reproduced at [3] above. Apart from the obvious grammatical inaccuracies in the charge, I found that the charge was substantively defective on four grounds.
21        Firstly, the date of the offence reflected on the charge was erroneous. The charge stated that the offence was committed on 5 June 2002. However, that was the day the NEA officers inspected Sinsar’s premises and found records of the export. The cargo clearance permits issued by the Trade Development Board showed that Sinsar had exported the 525 drums of acetic acid on 3 June 2002. This was confirmed by the affidavit of one Sulaiman bin Abdul Rahman, an NEA officer whose affidavit was procured by the Prosecution for the purposes of this criminal revision. In short, it appeared to me that NEA did not realise that the offence could have been committed when the drums of acetic acid were exported on 3 June 2002, and not on 5 June 2002 which was the date reflected on the charge.
22        Secondly, the charge did not specify the hazardous substance that Sinsar sold and the concentration of that substance. It is trite law that an accused person has to be given sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged, in order to ensure that he is able to answer the charge. This is reinforced by s 159(1) of the CPC which states:
The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence and the person, if any, against whom or 
the thing, if any,
 in respect of which it was committed 
as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the manner with which he is charged.
 [emphasis added]
23        I have perused Part I of the Second Schedule to the Act. I found that there are 274 hazardous substances listed therein. Since it was not at all clear which of the 274 hazardous substances the charge was referring to, I failed to see how the summons could be said to have put Sinsar on notice of the manner with which it was charged. I noted, however, that the NEA did send a letter dated 28 July 2003 informing Sinsar about its officer’s inspection of Sinsar’s premises on 5 June 2003, and how that officer came to realise that the acetic acid had been re-exported. Be that as it may, it must be remembered that the summons was sent on 20 August 2003, almost one month after the letter. Under these circumstances, I found that the NEA should have restated the hazardous substance in the charge. The situation might have been different if the summons had been accompanied by the letter informing Sinsar of the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the offence. However, this was not the case here.
24        This omission to state the hazardous substance was compounded by the fact that the substance involved in this case was acetic acid which is not hazardous at all in low concentrations. In fact, vinegar used in cooking contains about 4–8% acetic acid. The materiality of the concentration of acetic acid can be gleaned from the Act itself. Section 21 of the Act states that Part VII of the Act only applies to substances listed in the first column of the Second Schedule except where they fall within the exclusions specified in the second column of that Schedule. For acetic acid, the Second Schedule states two exceptions, namely, substances containing not more than 80%, weight in weight, of acetic acid and preparations and solutions for photographic use. In light of this particular quirk of acetic acid, it was my opinion that not only should the prosecuting authority have named the substance, it should also have indicated the concentration of the acetic acid in the charge. Yet, it failed to do both.
25        Thirdly, the charge did not state the amount of acetic acid that Sinsar had re-exported. This omission was material because it would have affected the trial judge’s ability to pass an appropriate sentence. Indeed, this omission, as well as the omission to state the type of hazardous substance involved, was noted by the district judge at [7] of her grounds of decision: see [9] above. I noted that the quantity was stated in NEA’s letter of 28 July 2003 but, as I have pointed out above, this letter was sent to Sinsar almost one month before the summons.
26        Fourthly, the charge was ambiguous about the 
actus reus
 involved in the offence. It was unclear whether Sinsar was being charged for having sold the goods, or for having offered to sell the goods.
27        Quite apart from these four defects in the charge, I next had to determine whether I should amend the charge and convict Sinsar on an amended charge. In 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP
 
[1995] 3 SLR 701
, I held that the High Court can amend the charge so long as the safeguards against prejudice are taken into account. Then, I made the following findings on the facts of that case at 723, [91]:
I am satisfied that the amended charges can in no way prejudice the appellants’ defence. The amendments only pertain to the form of the charges. It is clear that the proceedings in the trial would have taken the same course. The evidence recorded would have been the same. Accordingly, I see no difficulty in ordering the amendments. The appellants will stand convicted on the amended charges as I am satisfied that the case has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
28        While I found that three of the four elements could have been amended without causing Sinsar much prejudice (
viz
, the date of the offence, the quantity of the hazardous substance, and the 
actus reus
), I refrained from doing so because there was no reliable evidence before me with regard to the concentration of the substance. Without knowing the concentration, one could not amend the charge with certainty. The unique facts of the present case were such that it would be inappropriate for me to amend the charge. In any event, there was no need for me to amend the charge because, for reasons to be enunciated at [36] and [37] below, I found that a more prudent course would be to remit the case back to the subordinate courts for a fresh plea to be taken on an amended charge.
Disparity in sentencing
29        The above would have been more than sufficient to demonstrate that serious injustice would have been occasioned if Sinsar’s conviction and sentence were allowed to stand. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, I wish to address the issue of disparity in sentencing.
30        It was undisputed that the Act is a relatively new Act, having been passed by Parliament only in 1999. Even the district judge noted this, and observed that there were no previous authorities on the appropriate sentence for this offence for her to rely on.
31        Bearing that in mind, I commend the district judge in considering a spectrum of relevant factors to take into consideration as she did at [7] of her grounds of decision: see [9] above. I agreed with her that the factors to be taken into account for an offence under s 22(1) of the Act would include:
(a)        the quantity of the hazardous substance involved;
(b)        the level of co-operation on the part of the defendant;
(c)        the type of hazardous substance involved and its relative danger to the environment;
(d)        whether there was genuine oversight on the part of the defendant; and
(e)        whether there were previous convictions for similar offences.
32        Be that as it may, she appeared to have inadvertently overlooked the sentence she meted out for a similar offence under s 22 of the Act during the same night court session: 
PP v Welcome Trading Pte Ltd
 NEA Summons No 42529 of 2003. In that case, Welcome Trading Pte Ltd (“Welcome Trading”) pleaded guilty to a charge under s 22 of the Act for export of hazardous substances. Welcome Trading had exported 120mt of sodium cyanide to a buyer in North Korea. Like Sinsar, Welcome Trading did not handle the goods; it merely purchased and re-exported them. From the documents that counsel adduced before me, it appeared that Welcome Trading’s only contact with the goods was nominal. Like Sinsar, Welcome Trading was a first offender and had co-operated with NEA in its investigations. The only difference appeared to be that Welcome Trading was represented by counsel at the night court session whereas Sinsar was not. Welcome Trading was sentenced to a fine of $5,000 while Sinsar was given a $15,000 fine.
33        It is trite law that a sentencing judge has the discretion to look to the unique facts and circumstances to determine the appropriate sentence in each case: see 
Soong Hee Sin v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 253
. However, it is desirable to achieve some form of parity in sentencing for cases where the facts are similar. In 
Teo Kian Leong v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 147
, I stated at [44] that:
While 
parity of sentencing is an important principle, this argument can only succeed if all the circumstances of the previous cases and the present one are identical or at least very similar.
 
34        While the present case and 
PP v Welcome Trading Pte Ltd
 may not be completely identical, there are certain striking similarities. The quantity of hazardous substances involved in both cases was similar: Sinsar exported 110mt whereas Welcome Trading exported 120mt. Both companies had little contact with the hazardous substances as they appeared to have bought them for direct re-export. Both Sinsar and Welcome Trading pleaded guilty. In light of these facts, I found that the similarities were simply too stark to warrant a disparity of some $10,000 in the fines meted out in the two cases. The disparate sentence was therefore yet another ground for allowing the criminal revision.
35        To my mind, this mistake occasioned by the district judge was an inadvertent oversight and nothing more. One must remember that the mistake arose in a night court session, where the turnover of cases is typically high and where a judicial officer is rarely given much time to ponder over the facts of each case before the next case comes before him or her. Under such conditions, one would not be entirely surprised if a very rare mistake like the present was to be occasioned. To err is human.
Appropriate order to be made
36        In light of the above, I found more than ample grounds for the criminal revision to be allowed. Unlike cases where an accused person seeks to retract his plea of guilt willy-nilly, there were simply too many errors in the prosecution, conviction and sentence for Sinsar’s conviction and sentence to stand. Consequently, there was no doubt in my mind that Sinsar’s conviction and sentence ought to be set aside.
37        It remained for me to determine the consequential orders to be made. Counsel for Sinsar submitted that there should be a discharge amounting to an acquittal. I found that that would be too indulgent a course of action to take. There was hardly any concrete evidence to convince me that Sinsar should have been let off scot-free. A more prudent course of action was to remit the case back to the subordinate courts and for a plea to be taken by Sinsar as and when the charge is appropriately amended by the Prosecution.
Appeal against sentence
38        As I had decided to allow the criminal revision and set aside the conviction and sentence, Sinsar’s appeal against sentence became superfluous. Consequently, I deemed it to have been withdrawn.
Conclusion
39        There was no doubt in my mind that serious injustice would have been occasioned if Sinsar’s conviction and sentence were allowed to stand. I therefore allowed the criminal revision, set aside the conviction and sentence meted out by the district judge and remitted the case back to the subordinate courts for a fresh plea to be taken on an appropriately amended charge.
40        It leaves me to say a few words about NEA’s conduct of the present case. I am disappointed by the slipshod manner in which the prosecuting authority commenced this action against Sinsar. The charge was abysmally defective. Not only was the charge grammatically bad, it failed to state material facts in the charge and, even when it did so (
viz
, the date of the offence), it was inaccurate. To make matters worse, the poorly drafted charge was sent to Sinsar with a standard form letter to plead guilty by letter even though Sinsar could not have pleaded guilty by letter for the offence it was charged with. The entire case was put on a wrong footing right from the start. It is my fervent hope that the NEA and other departmental authorities will refrain from making such mistakes in future and be more careful in their conduct of departmental prosecutions. It is in the interest of justice to ensure that parties and the courts do not have to be put through the inconvenience of such faulty or procedurally-irregular prosecutions.
Criminal revision allowed, conviction and sentence set aside for a fresh plea to be taken on an appropriately amended charge. Appeal against sentence deemed withdrawn.",2004-06-24 00:00:00,SG High Court

MPH Rubin J:
Introduction
1          This action, which was heard by me on 15 March and 12 May 2004, is a sequel to an earlier High Court action in Suit No 929 of 2002. The earlier action was heard and determined by Choo Han Teck J in favour of the plaintiff, Diva XL Pte Ltd (“Diva”), against a Singapore-incorporated company known as Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd (“Lalasis”), in April 2003: see 
[2003] SGHC 97
.
2          Both proceedings arose from the same set of circumstances and were instituted by the same plaintiff, Diva. The defendant in the earlier suit was Lalasis. In the action before me, the defendant is one Goenka Mahesh Kumar (“Goenka”) who is the managing director as well as the substantial shareholder of Lalasis. The records placed before me showed that he holds 999,999 out of the 1,167,200 shares issued by Lalasis and the remaining 167,201 shares are registered in his wife’s name.
3          In the earlier suit, Diva’s claim against Lalasis was for the refund of moneys paid as deposits by Diva to Lalasis in respect of two contracts for the purchase of a product described as “Pentium P4 CPU” (“CPUs”) by Diva from Lalasis. There was also a claim by Diva against Lalasis for damages for breach of contract.
4          In the event, Choo J awarded judgment in favour of Diva for a sum of $384,930 representing the deposits and damages in the sums of US$43,200 and $100. The facts that gave rise to the proceedings before Choo J are comprehensively set out in the judgment delivered by him on 25 April 2003. The background facts pertaining to both actions can be summarised as follows.
Background facts
5          Diva is a Singapore company engaged in the business of wholesale trading, importing and exporting of electronics and computer parts. Lalasis is a Singapore company engaged in the business of selling electronics and computer parts.
6          Diva entered into two contracts to purchase CPUs from Lalasis. Diva paid $950,000 in respect of the first contract (in two tranches – $100,000 on 11 June 2002 and $850,000 on 12 June 2002) and another sum of $250,000 in respect of the second contract.
7          Had Lalasis performed the two contracts, a balance of $87,204.85 would have been payable to Lalasis by Diva in connection with the first contract and a sum of $692,796.80 in relation to the second contract.
8          Lalasis only delivered 2,000 CPUs out of the total of 3,000 CPUs on the first contract and delivered none of the 2,880 CPUs under the second contract. Lalasis, however, refunded $100,000 and US$15,000 (equivalent to S$26,400) to Diva, leaving a net balance of $382,130.10.
Suit No 929 of 2002
9          Following the short delivery of the goods, Diva brought an action against Lalasis for the refund of a sum of $382,130.10. It also claimed US$4,000.00 as damages for loss of profit on the first contract, US$43,200.00 as damages for loss of profit on the second contract, interest and costs. The action was tried in the High Court before the Choo J from 14 to 16 April 2003.
10        Lalasis denied owing Diva the amounts claimed. Its defence was as follows:
(a)        There was an inter-linked relationship between one Zirco International and Lalasis (both businesses were substantially owned and controlled by Goenka).
(b)        Zirco International had done business with a Singapore company called Fifth Avenue Electronics Pte Ltd (“Fifth Avenue”). The principal person who ran the business for Fifth Avenue was one Rajesh Kumar Jain (“Kumar”).
(c)        As a result of some business dealings, Kumar’s Fifth Avenue business owed Zirco International $348,988.20 as at 31 December 2000. Kumar agreed to pay off his debt in the near future.
(d)        Later, Kumar approached Lalasis on a business deal to purchase CPUs. Goenka insisted that Kumar settle his debts (
ie
, the outstanding accounts with Zirco International) before Lalasis would agree to enter into fresh deals with Kumar. Kumar agreed to do so.
(e)        Kumar paid $950,000 ($100,000 on 11 June 2002 and $850,000 on 12 June 2002) to Lalasis against which Lalasis set off $348,988.20 for the debt owed by Kumar. The remaining sum was taken as advance payment for the CPUs which Diva had contracted for as a result of which Diva had short paid Lalasis and was in breach of the two contracts.
11        In the event, Choo J did not accept Lalasis’ account of the events or, for that matter, that of Goenka and gave judgment in favour of Diva in the sums of $384,930 and damages of US$43,200 and $100.
12        Following the judgment, Diva’s attempts to receive payment on the judgment from Lalasis were to no avail. Having failed to obtain satisfaction through garnishee proceedings as well as judgment summons, Diva commenced the present action against Goenka.
The present action
13        Diva’s present action against Goenka is founded in tort – conspiracy and alternatively conversion. After stating the background, Diva averred in paras 11 to 15 of its statement of claim as follows:
11.        The Defendant knew of the First and Second Contracts and their essential terms, having negotiated the same on behalf of Lalasis.
12.        The Defendant caused, induced or procured the breaches of the First and Second Contracts pleaded by paragraphs 6 and 9 above. The Defendant caused the sum of $348,988.20 of the monies paid by the Plaintiff to Lalasis to be applied to his account and for his benefit by way of a purported discharge of debt allegedly owed by a company called 5
th
 Avenue Pte Ltd to himself trading as Zirco International, and thereafter caused Lalasis to refuse further performance of the First and Second Contracts on the ground that it had not been paid by the Plaintiff.
13.        The Plaintiff commenced action against Lalasis and judgment was given against Lalasis on 25 April 2003 in the sums of $384,930 and damages of US$43,200 and $100. This judgment has not been appealed against. Interest and costs were awarded against Lalasis on 9 May 2003.
14.        By reason of the matters pleaded by paragraph 12, the Plaintiff has suffered loss and damage, namely in the sums of $384,930 and US$43,200 and $100. The Plaintiff will give credit for such sums as may be received from Lalasis in payment of these sums.
15.        Further or alternatively, the Defendant converted the sum of $384,930 to his use, alternatively was a party to conversion of the same by Lalasis and is liable to the Plaintiff for the same in the tort of conversion or for money had and received to his use.
14        Goenka denied Diva’s claim. After maintaining, contrary to the express findings by Choo J in the earlier action, that Lalasis was not in breach of any contract, he averred in paras 11 to 14 of his defence as follows:
11.        The Defendant denies that the alleged or any breaches of contract were caused, induced or procured by the Defendant or at all. The Defendant further denies that he caused the sum of $348,988.20 of the monies paid by the Plaintiff to Lalasis to be applied to his account and caused Lalasis to refuse further performance of the contracts on the ground that it had not been paid. In further answer the Defendant states that at all times he acted for and on behalf of Lalasis as its alter ego and that all the money received was banked into Lalasis’ bank account and only journal entries were made in the books of Lalasis in respect of the sum of $348,988.20 apportioned, being the sum in dispute with the Plaintiff. The Defendant further states that even if the sum of $348,988.20 were taken into account, there was thus a shortfall of $87,204.85 under the First Contract and a further shortfall of $866,791.97 under the Second Contract. The need to protect and safeguard the rights of Lalasis prevented the Defendant from taking any step to the detriment of Lalasis until the dispute, as aforesaid, had been resolved or lawfully determined. 
In the premises the Defendant states that as a director acting as the alter ego of Lalasis, he exercised his duties bona fide for and on behalf of Lalasis and in the best interests of Lalasis
.
12.        Paragraph 13 of the Statement of Claim is admitted.
13.        No admissions are made as to the breach, loss and/or damage suffered by the Plaintiff and the cause thereof as alleged in paragraph 14 of the Statement of Claim or at all, and the Plaintiffs are put to strict proof of the same together with the cause thereof. If, which is denied, the Plaintiff have suffered the alleged, or any loss and/or damage, it is denied that the same was caused induced, procured or intended by the Defendant, as alleged or at all. The Defendant states that he had no knowledge, actual or constructive, that the Plaintiff were purchasing the goods from Lalasis for resale or of the likelihood of the Plaintiff suffering damages as a consequence of the position taken by Lalasis in the matter.
14.        Paragraph 15 of the Statement of Claim is denied and the Plaintiff are put to strict proof thereof. In further answer the Defendant reiterates that he acted as a director for and on behalf of Lalasis as its alter ego and all money received was banked into Lalasis’ bank account and only journal entries made in the books of Lalasis in respect of the sum of $348,988.20, until the dispute, as aforesaid, could be lawfully resolved or determined.
[emphasis added]
Evidence
15        In so far as is relevant, Mirthipati Subramanyam, a director of Diva, who was the sole witness for Diva, said in his evidence-in-chief as follows:
10.        In particular, the Court did not accept that it was Kumar who paid the $100,000 and the $850,000 to Goenka (this can be found in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Judgment) nor did the Court accept that the payments of these sums were for the settlement of the debt between Kumar and the Defendant. The Court found that the sums were paid as deposits for the two contracts which the Plaintiffs had entered into with Lalasis (see paragraph 18 of the Judgment).
11.        The Defendant admitted, at paragraphs 10 to 12 of his Affidavit filed on 11 February 2003 for Suit No 929 of 2002/Q, that he had used the sums of $100,000 and $248,988.20 which he received to the (
sic
) settle the alleged debt between Kumar and himself. He even produced 2 receipts at Exhibit GMK-4 of his Affidavit filed on 11 February 2003 for Suit No 929 of 2002/Q to prove this.
14(h).   The Defendant knew of the First and Second Contracts and their essential terms, having negotiated the 2 contracts on behalf of Lalasis.
14(i).    The Defendant by his own admission caused the sum of $348,988.20 of the monies paid by the Plaintiff to Lalasis to be applied to his account, supposedly for the discharge [
sic
] a debt allegedly owed by Kumar to the Defendant and then caused Lalasis to refuse further performance of the First and Second Contracts on the ground that it had not been paid by the Plaintiffs.
15.        As a result of the Defendant using the sum of $348,988.20 for his own purpose (
ie
 to discharge an alleged debt) and failing to cause Lalasis to perform the First and Second Contracts (the CPUs were not delivered to the Plaintiffs), he has caused Lalasis to breach the First and Second Contracts.
16        In so far as the evidence of the defendant, Goenka, is concerned, his averments in paras 5 to 8, the first sentence of para 10 and para 21 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief bear reproduction and they read as follows:
5          Contrary to the Plaintiffs’ contention, I did not convert any part of the sum of $384,930.00 or have any part of the monies received from Kumar and/or the Plaintiffs applied to my account and for my benefit as alleged. The cash money received was all banked into Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd’s bank account and only a journal entry made in respect of the sum of $348,988.20 to signify that it was to being allocated according to my version of events. Produced before me and marked as exhibit “GMK-1” are copies of the journal entries from the books of Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd showing that the full sum of $950,000.00 received from Kumar was banked into the bank account of Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd and further showing how the funds were allocated by Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd to reflect my version of events.
6          The truth of the matter is that in the capacity as a director of Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd, I had acted cautiously and in good faith and did not intend to or cause, induce or procure the breaches of the First and Second Contracts made between the plaintiffs and Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd as alleged by the plaintiffs. As the director of Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd I had to act cautiously and in the interests of Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd because as a director I had a duty to safeguard and protect the interests of Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd. This duty to act cautiously was all the more imperative in view of the dispute on what the terms of payment and delivery were. As stated herein, it was agreed with Kumar that he would not only make full payment of my debt of $348,988.20 but also full payment under the new contracts 
ie
 the First Contract and Second Contract. As the director of Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd I had acted bona fide exercising caution when dealing with the Plaintiffs who [
sic
] I knew the Plaintiffs had a paid up capital of only $2.00 and it was in this regard that I had to insist that the agreed terms of payment and delivery were fulfilled 
ie
 full payment before full delivery to the Plaintiffs. Produced before me and marked as exhibit “GMK-2” are copies of the Instant Information Search of the Plaintiffs showing, inter alia, the issued and paid-up capital.
7          Thus, if I had acted otherwise than with caution as I did, I believe I would have been negligent as there was nothing much Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd could do if the Plaintiffs were to default on their payment obligations after receiving full delivery of the goods. Further with my knowledge of prior dealings with Kumar, the Plaintiffs’ representative, who had previously led me to incur a mountain of debt previously, I could not allow my guard to be let down. In the circumstances I had to exercise due caution to ensure that all payments due and payable were received by Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd. As a responsible director I could not authorise delivery by Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd before payment was received as such conduct would have been contrary to the agreement that payment would be made in full. If I had disregarded this cautionary step, the whole arrangement I made with Kumar to be paid in full for the past debt and for the new contracts would have been pointless. Although the Plaintiffs took issue with me I believe I acted bona fide and reasonably and had no choice subsequently when the Plaintiffs decided to have the dispute adjudicated by the Courts. Thus at all times no part of the monies received from Kumar and/or the Plaintiffs was applied to my account and for my benefit as alleged.
8.         The Plaintiffs [
sic
] contention that I had caused the sum of $348,988.20 of the monies received by Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd to be applied to my account or for my benefit is therefore misconceived. In fact upon receipt of the order under the First Contract on 10 June 2002 Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd had already contacted their supplier in Hong Kong and ordered 3,000 CPUs. Thus it cannot be said that I caused, induced or caused the breach of the First Contract. That Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd had acted to place the order for 3,000 CPUs is evidenced by a letter dated 10 June 2002 from ST Agencies stating that the first batch of 2,000 CPUs were on the way and that the balance 1,000 CPUs would be following in a few day’s time. Produced before me and marked as exhibit “GMK-3” is a copy of the letter dated 10 June 2002.
10.        As for the allegation that I had caused, induced or procured the breach of the Second Contract this is again not true. …
21.        In the premises it is certainly not true or fair to allege that I am responsible for having caused, induced or procured the said breaches of the First Contract and Second Contract by Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd as alleged[.] Further I have not converted the sum of $384,930.00 to my use or was I a party to the conversion of the sum of $384,930.00 by Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd as alleged. As explained above all monies received were deposited into the bank account of Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd for the use by Lalasis Trading Pte Ltd. In the premises I humbly pray that the Plaintiffs’ action herein be dismissed.
17        In cross-examination, Goenka claimed that although the records reflected the transfer of the deposit sums to his personal account, there was no actual remittance of the moneys to him. It was merely a journal entry and he had since then caused it to be reversed. With a view to substantiating his statements, Goenka referred to some printouts.
[1]
 
The actual account books or original documents were, however, not produced to the court. He claimed that the book entries transferring the subject moneys to him were made in several tranches on 12 June 2002 and the reverse entries were made sometime after Choo J awarded judgment against Lalasis in the earlier action. In this connection, his answers as to the date on which the reverse entry was made
[2]
 
were noticeably ambivalent. First he said it was in December 2002, but when his attention was directed to the fact that the judgment in the earlier action was handed down in April 2003 he back-footed and claimed that the reverse entries were made about one week after the judgment.
Arguments, issues and conclusion
18        The action by Diva in the present suit is founded on the premise that Goenka consciously and deliberately interfered with the contracts between Diva and Lalasis, diverted the deposits paid by Diva wrongfully to his credit and thereby caused Lalasis not to perform its obligations to Diva. Counsel for Diva submitted that such an action on the part of Goenka, the person who ostensibly controlled the will and the entire spectrum of Lalasis’ operations, read in the context of Goenka’s blatant boast that he did so as the alter ego of Lalasis, rendered him personally liable for the wrong caused and the loss suffered by Diva.
19        Goenka’s counsel endeavoured to downplay the actions of his client. He contended that Goenka acted in good faith as a director of Lalasis and as a director he had to act cautiously and in the interests of Lalasis to ensure that full payment was received before goods were delivered to Diva. Another argument advanced by Goenka’s counsel was that what Goenka did was no more than a book transaction and he had since then caused the entries to be reversed in the books of Lalasis. In this connection, he made reference to DB-1 to 5, all of them dated 31 December 2002. I must say presently that despite the fact that these documents were not agreed documents, Goenka did not call the maker of the entries or call any evidence to substantiate the authenticity of the alleged transactions contained in those documents. If it was true that he gave instructions to his employees to reverse the book entries after Choo J handed down his decision in April 2003, in my opinion the documents reflecting the various entries could not have been dated 31 December 2002. Furthermore, when queried as to what happened to the sums paid by Diva if they were in fact not taken out, Goenka could only reply feebly that Lalasis was experiencing some cash flow problems. I should add here that I found his explanations in this regard to be false and insincere.
20        The legal and factual ingredients necessary to establish the tort of inducing or procuring a breach of contract are adequately set out by the authors of 
Bullen & Leake & Jacob’s Precedents of Pleadings
 (14th Ed, 2001) at para 51-01 as follows:
The claimant … needs to plead and prove the following:
(1)        the defendant(s) knew of the contract in question and its essential, though not necessarily its precise, terms;
(2)        they so acted or “interfered” whether by persuasion, inducement or procurement or other means (which the claimant may, as in cases of indirect inducement, need to establish are unlawful means) so as to show that they intended to cause a breach of the contract or prevent its performance by one party to the detriment of the other party;
(3)        there was a breach of the contract attributable to such act or interference; and
(4)        damage was occasioned, or was likely to be occasioned to the other party to the contract.
21        In respect of the first and fourth ingredients above, there was hardly any dispute over them. In any event, having regard to the evidence and pleadings, my finding was that Goenka was fully cognisant of the contracts as well as their terms and that there was indeed loss and damage occasioned to Diva. As regards the second and third elements, it was submitted on behalf of Goenka that Diva had not adduced any evidence of deliberate conduct on the part of Goenka to breach the contracts made between Diva and Lalasis. Counsel for Goenka contended that Goenka’s actions were carried out in good faith and that there was no evidence that Goenka had applied or used moneys paid or converted them to his use.
22        In my determination, Goenka, who by his own admission is the alter ego of Lalasis, knowingly and deliberately interfered with the contracts referred to. His claim that he did it in good faith was found by me to be patently hypocritical, for the records clearly evince to the court that he was motivated by personal gain over legal consequences. As pointed out by Lord Macnaughten in 
Quinn v Leathem
 
[1901] AC 495
 at 510, “it is a violation of legal right to interfere with contractual relations recognised by law if there be no sufficient justification for the interference”. In Singapore, in 
Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd
 
[2000] 3 SLR 405
 at [17], the Court of Appeal held that to found a sustainable cause of action for the tort of inducing a breach of contract, a two- fold requirement needs to be satisfied: first, the plaintiff must show that the procurer acted with the requisite knowledge of the existence of the contract; and second, that the procurer intended to interfere with its performance. Intention to this end is to be determined objectively.
23        The issue whether there was any contractual relationship between Diva and Lalasis had already been determined by Choo J in the earlier action. As to the issue whether there was sufficient justification for the interference by Goenka with the contractual relationship, I was unable to agree with the arguments of Goenka’s counsel that Goenka was acting in good faith, and that his intention was to protect the interests of Lalasis and nothing more. I found that Goenka was clearly interposing his personal interests and gain over the contractual obligations between Diva and Lalasis. The Court of Appeal in 
Gabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong Jin
 
[1998] 1 SLR 374
 at 387, [33] stated that “where directors order an act by the company which amounts to a tort by the company, they may be liable as joint tortfeasors on the ground that they have procured or directed the wrong to be done”. In the case at hand, Goenka, by deliberately causing Lalasis not to perform its obligations to Diva, is liable for the actionable wrongs committed by him.
24        Goenka was seen to be twisting and turning in the witness box and I found his testimony substantially unreliable. Goenka’s claim that the transfer of the moneys from Lalasis was merely a book transaction and that the entries had since been reversed was not supported by any credible, let alone admissible, evidence. In my view, there was clear, deliberate and direct unjustified interference by Goenka with the contracts referred to. His claim that the moneys were still with Lalasis was not supported by any valid evidence. A compelling inference was that Goenka spirited the deposit sums from Lalasis, hence the inability of Lalasis to pay its creditors.
25        In the premises, I awarded judgment in favour of Diva as claimed in the statement of claim and costs. Diva was also awarded interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the judgment sum from the date of writ until the date of judgment, 
ie
, 12 May 2004.
Claim allowed.

Yong Pung How CJ (delivering the judgment of the court):
1
         
 The appellants in these two appeals disputed the decision of the court below, which held them liable in negligence for the respondent’s liver failure. We heard the appeals on 26 May 2004 and reserved judgment.
The parties
2          The respondent, Andrea Heidi de Cruz (“Andrea”), was a 27-year-old artiste with MediaCorp Studios (“MediaCorp”) when she suffered liver failure. She instituted an action against five defendants in the court below for the liver damage, allegedly caused by her consumption of a slimming drug, “Slim 10”. The first defendant, a company incorporated in China, was the manufacturer of Slim 10 (the “Chinese manufacturer”). As the Chinese manufacturer could not be located for the purpose of service of the writ of summons, the trial could not proceed against it. The second defendant, Health Biz Pte Ltd (“Health Biz”), was a Singapore company which imported and sold Slim 10. The third defendant, Semon Liu (“Semon”), was the director and principal shareholder of Health Biz. He was also the appellant in the second of the two appeals before us. TV Media Pte Ltd (“TV Media”), the fourth defendant, was the sole distributor of Slim 10 in Singapore. It appealed in the first of the two appeals before us. The fifth defendant, Rayson Tan (“Rayson”), was Andrea’s colleague who supplied her with Slim 10. Andrea claimed in negligence against Health Biz, Semon and TV Media, and sued Rayson for breach of contract.
Andrea’s case
3          For conciseness, this judgment will only set out Andrea’s version of events in full. The material facts disputed by the appellants will be dealt with in conjunction with the appellants’ arguments.
4          Andrea came to know Rayson and his wife, Chen Liping (“Liping”), in December 2001 when they were cast together in the Chinese drama series 
No Problem
. They spent a lot of time together during filming. During this period, Andrea saw TV Media’s television commercials on Slim 10 that featured Liping, who was known to be having problems with her weight. The commercials showed “before” and “after” pictures of Liping, and Andrea was very impressed by the difference. The commercials were “infomercials”, which were longer and more informative than ordinary commercials. They represented that Liping had tried the pills which were “100% herbal”. They featured TV Media’s name and stressed that TV Media was the distributor of Slim 10.
5          Andrea saw life-sized cardboard cutouts and large posters of Liping advertising Slim 10 at TV Media’s retail outlet in Beach Road. She viewed the advertisements aired over various television channels in Singapore until late March 2002 when she went to Bangkok. She knew that TV Media was a large and reputable company as her family had bought products from it before, and she had seen its advertisements in the United States. Hence, she believed that TV Media would have made the necessary tests to ensure that Slim 10 was safe for consumption before endorsing and marketing the product so aggressively. Andrea testified that the reputation, reliability and credibility of health supplements were very important to her. She would not have bought Slim 10 from Rayson had it been marketed by Health Biz or the Chinese manufacturer as she knew nothing about them and they had no reputation in Singapore.
6          In December 2001, Andrea told Rayson that she had seen the Slim 10 advertisements and commended him on how much weight his wife had lost. Rayson replied that the pills really worked and that Andrea should take Slim 10 if she was concerned about her weight. A few days later, Rayson asked Andrea whether she wanted the Slim 10 pills as he had some in his car. He offered them to her at $130 per bottle of 120 capsules, which was cheaper than each bottle’s retail price of $149.90. Andrea decided to buy two bottles and was given two clear, unmarked test tubes containing the capsules. Rayson told her that side effects might include insomnia, chills and pain in her calves. Other than that, the pills were definitely safe as they were all natural. Andrea paid him for the pills, not doubting that they were the Slim 10 pills advertised by TV Media, since Rayson’s wife was after all the poster girl for the product. The transparent test tubes and the white or off-white colour of the capsules also resembled those shown in TV Media’s advertisements.
7          As she was still filming at the time, Andrea did not start taking the pills immediately, as she did not want her performance to be affected by insomnia. She only started consuming Slim 10 when filming for 
No Problem
 was coming to an end, around late January or early February 2002. She had to take four capsules three times a day. As Andrea experienced some of the side effects mentioned by Rayson, as well as palpitations, she reduced her intake of the pills to four-four-two pills per day so as to minimise disruption to her sleep.
8          On 15 February, she sent a text message to Rayson telling him that she had “run out of skinny pills”. Some time on 18 February, Rayson handed her a second batch of 240 pills. These were packed in aluminium foil, and Rayson explained that he had asked the Slim 10 boss to pack them in this manner as Rayson always kept the pills in his car and did not want them to be affected by the heat. Again, Andrea did not doubt that these were Slim 10 pills. She started consuming this second batch sometime in early to mid-March 2002 after finishing the first batch of pills.
9          On 29 March, Andrea flew to Bangkok where she finished the second batch of Slim 10. On 11 April, she returned to Singapore and sent another text message to Rayson asking him to order more pills. On 14 April, Andrea’s sister observed that Andrea’s eyes looked very yellow and jaundiced. Andrea saw her doctor the next day, whereupon the doctor told her that her liver was inflamed and her eyes very jaundiced. Andrea went to Changi General Hospital where it was confirmed that her liver was inflamed and she had to be hospitalised. She was referred to Mount Alvernia Hospital. Sometime in the second week of her hospitalisation, Andrea underwent a liver biopsy, with inconclusive results.
10        On 3 May, Dr Dede Selamat Sutedja of the National University Hospital (“NUH”) liver team visited Andrea. He prescribed some drugs for her but she threw them up. On 4 May, she was moved to NUH. On 5 May, she was encephalopathic. She was unable to recognise anyone and was muttering incoherently. She was taken to the intensive care unit for immediate liver dialysis, which allowed her to recover her lucidity temporarily. As Andrea’s fiancé was the only suitable liver donor who could be found, the Ministry of Health granted special permission for an unrelated living donor transplant to be carried out. On 7 May, Andrea was transferred to Gleneagles Hospital because the NUH liver team had never carried out a living donor transplant. Dr Tan Kai Chah of Gleneagles Hospital successfully carried out the transplant.
11        In the meantime, the Singapore Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) had convened an urgent meeting with Health Biz on 2 April 2002 because people who had consumed Slim 10 were complaining of medical problems. The following day, Semon and Peter Boo, the Vice President of Health Biz, wrote in to HSA appealing against the recall of Slim 10, as it would have devastating consequences for Health Biz. On 15 April, HSA ordered Health Biz to suspend all sales of Slim 10 immediately and to withdraw the product from the market by 29 April 2002.
12        Later tests found that Slim 10 contained the undeclared substances of nicotinamide, fenfluramine, thyroid gland extract and N-nitrosofenfluramine. Fenfluramine is an appetite suppressant which can damage heart valves but does not normally cause liver damage. It is banned in various countries, including the USA, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, China and Singapore. N-nitrosofenfluramine is an adulterated version of fenfluramine, suspected of causing Andrea’s liver damage.
13        Andrea sued TV Media for negligently advertising and promoting Slim 10 as being 100% herbal and safe. She also sought to hold Semon personally liable for authorising, directing and/or procuring Health Biz’s negligent acts of importing and selling Slim 10.

TV Media’s appeal on liability
Whether Andrea consumed Slim 10
15        The judge found that the pills taken by Andrea “came through an unbroken chain from [Health Biz] to [Rayson] to [Andrea] … no one was in any doubt that the only slimming pills imported by [Health Biz] were those meant to be marketed as Slim 10”: See 
De Cruz Andrea Heidi v Guangzhou Yuzhitang Health Products Co Ltd
 
[2003] 4 SLR 682
 at [162].
16        TV Media disputed this finding on several grounds. We now deal with them in turn.
Different packaging of the pills
17        TV Media first contended that the judge had no basis for ruling that what Andrea consumed were Slim 10 capsules since they were packaged differently from the Slim 10 pills advertised and sold by TV Media.
18        The first batch of pills bought by Andrea came packaged in two clear test-tubes. The second batch was contained in two aluminium foil packets. Both the test-tubes and aluminium foil packets were unmarked. In this aspect, they differed from the Slim 10 pills packaged for TV Media by DAC Pharmalab (“DAC”) into marked, clear test tubes for retail and distribution. TV Media disclaimed any knowledge that these unmarked and untested capsules were being sold by Health Biz, Semon or Rayson, arguing that it should not be liable to Andrea if she had bought them.
19        In reply, Andrea adduced Semon’s testimony that although the pills came in a variety of unmarked packages, Health Biz had imported only one product from one manufacturer, which product was Slim 10. As all the packages contained Slim 10, he had never tried to distinguish the various packages or to mark them as containing Slim 10.
20        TV Media knew that Slim 10 came in a variety of unmarked packages. It also knew that Health Biz was conducting product testing with various MediaCorp artistes by providing them with samples of Slim 10 in its original unmarked packaging. Moreover, a TV Media representative, Wilfred Wong (“Wilfred”), testified that he and another staff member had tried Slim 10 products that had come in various forms of packaging and in different colours. Despite the fact that the pills were neither uniformly packaged nor properly marked, Wilfred trusted that he was consuming Slim 10 because the pills came “direct from Semon Liu”. In our view, this was a reasonable assumption to make. It also belies TV Media’s attempt to portray Andrea as unreasonable for trusting that the pills she bought from Rayson were also Slim 10. Rayson’s wife was, after all, the poster girl of Slim 10, and he knew the Slim 10 boss, Semon. There was every reason for Andrea to trust that the pills Rayson gave her were really Slim 10.
21        As such, we are of the view that TV Media has no leeway to disclaim knowledge that Slim 10 was being distributed in unmarked packages of various types. The fact that Andrea had consumed capsules that were not packaged in properly marked test tubes in no way precluded the judge from ruling that she had nevertheless consumed Slim 10.
Different formulations of Slim 10
22        TV Media then asserted that different variants of Slim 10 were being imported. As it was under the impression that it was only advertising and retailing a product approved by HSA, it should not be held liable if Health Biz, Semon and Rayson were importing and selling “pirated pills” of different formulations.
23        We are not persuaded by this argument. We accept Semon’s testimony that each batch of pills that arrived would be given to DAC for repackaging. DAC would take a round number of pills for repackaging and give the surplus pills from each batch to Rayson for distribution to his friends, relatives and colleagues. This means that the pills distributed by TV Media, Health Biz and Rayson all came from the same batches and that TV Media is equally implicated in the sale of different batches of Slim 10.
24        Moreover, it is clear that none of the pills being distributed was approved by HSA, save for the initial sample of Slim 10 submitted to HSA in June 2001 when Health Biz was applying for product listing approval. In fact, the judge found that although Health Biz gave a written undertaking to HSA to conduct tests for poisons and synthetic substances on each consignment of Slim 10, it failed to do so. Rather, “due to the hopelessly haphazard way in which [Semon] permitted the importation to be done, there was no definable ‘batch or consignment’ to even speak of”: [15] 
supra
 at [183]. In turn, TV Media neglected to follow up on Health Biz’s undertaking and blindly trusted Semon to keep his word. It therefore appears that subsequent batches of Slim 10 were not even tested, let alone HSA-approved. In our view, this sounds the death knell for TV Media’s argument that it had only distributed HSA-approved pills whilst Health Biz and Rayson sold “pirated” pills.
Ignorance that Rayson was selling Slim 10
25        TV Media claimed ignorance that Rayson was selling Slim 10 on a large scale. It admitted knowing that samples were being given to Rayson to distribute amongst friends, relatives and other MediaCorp employees, but not that he was selling them for a profit. It submitted that since Andrea failed to purchase her pills through proper sales channels, imposing a duty on it would be akin to making a legitimate retailer, selling original products, responsible for damage caused by Rayson who was selling counterfeit goods.
26        Again, we are wholly unmoved by this argument. TV Media, Health Biz and Rayson were clearly selling pills from the same source, which means that the “pirated pills” argument cannot stand. Whether Rayson was giving out the pills for free or selling them for a profit is irrelevant to the issue of TV Media’s liability. Rather, having approved of the fact that Rayson would help to promote the pills amongst his circle of friends and colleagues, TV Media cannot now seek to disassociate itself from Rayson’s actions.
Constituents of the pills
27        TV Media alleged that Andrea failed to adduce test results which showed that the ingredients of the pills she took were the same as those in Slim 10. However, as we find no compelling reason to overturn the judge’s finding of fact that the pills taken by Andrea and those distributed by TV Media came from the same source, we do not see any necessity for Andrea to have adduced test results as to the constituents of the pills.
28        In the final analysis, we are of the view that TV Media has not provided sufficient reason for us to overturn the judge’s finding that Andrea had indeed consumed Slim 10 pills, and that this ground of appeal must fail.
When Andrea consumed Slim 10
29        Having established that Andrea had indeed consumed Slim 10, we turn next to the issue of when she consumed Slim 10. There are three possible sets of dates on which Andrea could have consumed Slim 10 based on the evidence before the court.
30        The first range of dates falls between December 2001 and January 2002. Andrea gave these dates to the doctors at Mount Alvernia Hospital in the second week of her hospitalisation. The relevant clinical notes observed that Andrea was clinically well and alert. She was able to mention two other health supplements, Spirulina and Pcynogenol, which she had been taking, and to give a fairly accurate estimation of how long she had been consuming the products.
31        The second range of dates is between November 2001 and February 2002. Andrea gave these dates to the NUH doctors when she was first moved to NUH on 4 May 2002. At this time, Andrea was already encephalopathic and the credibility of this evidence is doubtful.
32        The third set of dates, which the judge accepted as correct, is between late January and early February 2002, and late March and early April 2002. Andrea gave these dates in her affidavit dated 6 March 2003, and confirmed them in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief and her testimony in court.
33        TV Media challenged the judge’s acceptance of the third set of dates, arguing that the contradictory versions of Andrea’s evidence in relation to the commencement and cessation times of her ingestion of Slim 10 showed that her evidence was neither truthful nor reliable. Instead, TV Media asserted that the first set of dates was the most accurate. Naturally, this set of dates was also in its favour since three months would have elapsed from the time Andrea stopped consumption of Slim 10 in January 2002 to her falling ill, thus ruling out any link between Slim 10 and her liver failure.
34        When analysing TV Media’s arguments, we bore in mind that the litmus test for overturning any finding of fact by a trial judge requires the appellant to show that the finding of fact is plainly wrong or unjustified on the totality of the evidence before the trial judge: 
Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong
 
[1996] 2 SLR 305
. After considering the totality of the evidence, we find that TV Media has failed to surmount this high threshold.
The third set of dates – Rayson’s evidence
35        We note that although the judge was aware of the discrepancies in the dates given by Andrea, he found that Rayson’s evidence “rescued” Andrea from these discrepancies. Rayson testified that he had only come to know Andrea well during the filming of “No Problem” in December 2001 and that she had asked him about the pills in late December 2001. He handed her the first two sets of pills on 11 January 2002. He adduced evidence of a text message sent to him by Andrea on 15 February, saying that she had run out of “skinny pills” and needed more of them, as well as a copy of a cheque for $260 (the cost of two sets of pills) from Andrea dated 18 February 2002. We agree with the judge that the cheque and text message are objective evidence consistent with Andrea’s testimony that she received the second batch of pills on 18 February. As two sets of pills would have lasted Andrea 20 days if taken in the recommended dosage of 12 pills a day, the first batch of pills would at least have lasted Andrea until the middle of February if she began consuming them in late January or early February. Thus, the fact that Andrea sent Rayson the text message on 15 February supports Andrea’s testimony that she only began consuming the pills when the filming for 
No Problem
 was coming to an end in late January or early February 2002, that she had reduced her dosage to ten pills a day and that she may have missed some doses due to erratic filming hours.
36        The second batch of pills would have lasted Andrea roughly 24 days if she consumed ten pills daily. On the premise that she began consuming the second batch after receiving them on 18 February, they would have lasted her until the middle of March. In fact, the second batch of pills may have lasted her longer than that, given her testimony that she had reduced her intake of the pills to ten pills daily, and since she may well have missed some doses along the way. This corresponds with the judge’s finding that Andrea would have finished the second batch of pills around 20 March 2002 and no later than 29 March 2002. It also accords with Rayson’s testimony that Andrea had sent him a text message around 21 March, asking him to help her buy more pills as she was going for a holiday in Bangkok and needed the pills for “maintenance”, as well as with Andrea’s own testimony that she finished the second batch of pills in Bangkok. As it is agreed that Andrea never consumed the third set of pills, she would have stopped taking Slim 10 after 29 March 2002. Hence, it is evident to us that the dates provided by Rayson are largely consistent with Andrea’s testimony.
37        To get around this, TV Media sought to cast aspersions on Rayson’s credibility, contrasting his insistence that he had paid $130 for each set of pills with the documentary evidence that he had only paid $100 for each set. We find this argument fallacious. Rather, we agree with the judge’s finding that Rayson’s evidence was all the more compelling because he had “no reason to state the dates falsely and would certainly gain nothing by assisting [Andrea] in advancing her case”. We fail to see how it could be in Rayson’s interests to lie about the dates on which he had sold the pills to Andrea. If he could prove that he had sold her the pills earlier, that would make it more difficult for her to establish that the pills had caused her liver failure, which would in turn weaken her case against him. Moreover, TV Media’s arguments disregarded the existence of objective evidence that bears out Rayson’s testimony about the dates.
The first and second set of dates
38        What weight should be accorded to the first set of dates given by Andrea to her Mount Alvernia doctors? The clinical notes documented that Andrea was alert and well when she gave her answers. This was in contrast with Andrea’s condition when she gave a second set of dates to the NUH doctors, since she was encephalopathic by then. Dr Julia Alexis Wendon, an expert witness for TV Media, testified that, in her experience, patients who have had acute liver failure have little or no recollection of the chronology of events pre-transplantation. We accept that this casts doubt on the accuracy of Andrea’s affidavit evidence, supporting TV Media’s case that the first set of dates is more likely to be accurate.
39        The judge explained his choice of the third set of dates by suggesting that Andrea may have been “nonchalant” in her answers during the taking of her medical history by the Mount Alvernia doctors, or distraught and confused at the discovery that her liver might be damaged: [15] 
supra
 at [163]. More importantly, we note that Rayson’s evidence and the objective evidence of the text message and cheque, both dated after Andrea had supposedly finished the first batch of pills, support the third set of dates. In contrast, there is nothing to corroborate the first and second sets of dates.
Credibility of Andrea’s evidence
40        Andrea asserted in court that she had overlooked one tube from the first batch of pills in her refrigerator. The judge did not accept this evidence, noting that it had surfaced very late in her testimony and appeared to have been “conjured up to match a starting date of consumption closer to Chinese New Year”: [15] 
supra
 at [166]. TV Media submitted that Andrea’s utter dishonesty on this aspect of evidence should render her entire evidence incredible. We disagree. Reprehensible as her lie may have been, we cannot reject her entire evidence as incredible, given Rayson’s testimony and the objective evidence before us.
41        We are also not convinced by TV Media’s other argument on this point, that the judge failed to take into account Andrea’s evasiveness in not wanting to provide an answer on the precise or approximate time gap between the date she ordered the pills and the date they were delivered. We think that TV Media is clutching at straws here. Andrea’s inability to recollect the timeframe of events that took place over one and a half years ago in any detail is perfectly understandable in the circumstances.
42        After careful consideration of the totality of the evidence, we find that TV Media has failed to prove that the judge’s finding of fact was plainly wrong or unjustified by the evidence. This ground of appeal must fail. To this end, all issues canvassed by TV Media which turn on the dates of Andrea’s consumption also fail.
Whether TV Media owed Andrea a duty of care
43        Apart from being the exclusive wholesale distributor of Slim 10, TV Media also advertised and sold the pills. The judge found that Andrea bought Slim 10 after being convinced by TV Media’s advertisements that Slim 10 was effective and safe. He held that it was TV Media’s corporate backing of the pills which assured Andrea of their safety, as she would not have relied on the names of Health Biz, the Chinese manufacturer, or any assurances given by Rayson to purchase herbal medicines which had no established reputation in Singapore. TV Media challenged this finding.
44        The three criteria for the imposition of a duty of care have been ably summarised by Lord Bridge of Harwich in 
Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman
 
[1990] 2 AC 605
. They are:
(a)        foreseeability of damage;
(b)        proximity of relationship between the parties; and
(c)        that it is fair, just and reasonable to impose such a duty.
45        We will now consider each criterion in turn.
Foreseeability of damage
46        TV Media protested that it could not have foreseen that Andrea would take pills from unmarked containers without written precautions or dosage instructions, or that Health Biz and Semon would provide these unmarked, undeclared and untested pills to Rayson. This was essentially a rehash of the arguments which we have dealt with earlier in this judgment. TV Media knew that Health Biz was conducting product testing by getting Rayson to distribute Slim 10 to MediaCorp artistes in unmarked packaging. If so, TV Media must have foreseen that these artistes would then take the pills without the benefit of written precautions or dosage instructions. We are satisfied that the test of foreseeability of damage is met.
Proximity
47        The notion of proximity has been described in 
Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman
 (1985) 157 CLR 424 at 498 as including “reliance by one party upon such care being taken where the other party ought to have known of such reliance”. TV Media averred that it should not owe a duty to Andrea, since she was not in the class of people who relied on TV Media’s advertisements and bought pills from an authorised retailer. Rather, she was part of an “unknown and unlimited” class of people who may have acted on TV Media’s statements. It sought to rely on a portion of Lord Reid’s judgment in 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465
 at 483 where he said:
It would be one thing to say that the speaker owes a duty to a limited class, but it would be going very far to say that he owes a duty to every ultimate “consumer” who acts on those words to his detriment.
48        We do not agree that TV Media can rely on this statement to eschew its duty to the consumers of Slim 10 pills. 
Hedley Byrne
 dealt specifically with a situation where the only damage suffered was pure economic loss. The statement quoted above was made in the context of a discussion on the duty of care owed to a person who suffers pure economic loss through reliance on a negligent misstatement. It is worth noting that the courts have repeatedly distinguished economic loss claims from most physical damage claims, so as to take a more restrictive approach to the imposition of a duty of care in economic loss cases.
49        The case before us is patently a case of physical damage. Contrary to TV Media’s claims, tortious liability to the world at large for physical damage due to defectively manufactured articles can be traced back to the seminal case of 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 562
. Although the 
ratio decidendi
 of 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 was confined to the liability of a manufacturer of goods towards ultimate consumers, the principle it laid down has since been extended to apply to negligent distributors of goods. Thus, it is established law that a distributor or wholesaler may be in a proximate enough relationship to the consumer so as to owe him a duty of care to check the safety of what he distributes: 
Watson v Buckley, Osborne, Garrett & Co, Ltd
 [1940] 1 All ER 174. That the distributor or wholesaler is also under a duty to take reasonable steps to deal with reputable suppliers is implicit in 
Watson v Buckley
, where the court stressed the incautiousness of the distributor in buying its product from an unknown supplier.
50        In our judgment, TV Media was in a sufficiently proximate relationship to Andrea. Andrea would not have relied on assurances of safety from Semon, Health Biz or the Chinese manufacturer because she did not know them or have any inkling as to their reliability or credibility. Similarly, it was unlikely that she would have relied solely on Rayson’s word since he had no knowledge of Chinese medicine. She bought the pills because they had the backing of a reputable company, and merely chose to purchase them through Rayson for reasons of convenience and in order to secure a discount. We are of the view that the judge’s finding of fact was eminently reasonable and should be upheld.
Fair, just and reasonable
51        In our view, it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on TV Media. We cannot agree with TV Media’s argument that to do so will open the floodgates of litigation to anyone who might have bought the pills from an illegitimate source, since we fail to see how Rayson could be termed an “illegitimate source” of Slim 10 for reasons given earlier in this judgment.
Andrea’s failure to mention the advertisements to Rayson and Liping
52        Having examined the three 
Caparo
 criteria, it remains for us to deal with a peripheral issue raised by TV Media. Rayson testified that, contrary to Andrea’s evidence, she never mentioned the Slim 10 advertisements when she asked him to obtain the pills for her, but only asked what the secret of Liping’s weight loss was. TV Media asserted that Rayson’s testimony was clear indication that Andrea had not seen the advertisements at the time she approached Rayson. If she had, its argument ran, she would surely have mentioned them to Rayson and Liping.
53        We disagree. A perusal of the relevant notes of evidence reflects that counsel for TV Media only asked Rayson whether he agreed that he and Liping had not mentioned anywhere 
in their affidavits
 that Andrea had asked about Slim 10 because she had viewed the TV Media advertisements. Rayson agreed that “there was no mention”. Counsel for TV Media never asked Rayson whether Andrea had 
actually
 mentioned the advertisements to him. Andrea testified that she had done so, and the judge, who had the advantage of observing her demeanour, accepted her testimony. This quibble over semantics hardly provides us with strong enough cause to overturn the judge’s finding of fact that Andrea was induced by TV Media’s advertisements to buy the Slim 10 pills.
54        Having determined that all three 
Caparo
 criteria are satisfied, we endorse the judge’s finding that TV Media did owe Andrea a duty of care in its promotion, endorsement and advertisement of Slim 10.
Whether TV Media breached its duty of care to Andrea
55        A defendant is in breach of his duty of care if his conduct falls below the standard of a reasonable and prudent man. In 
Watson v Buckley
, distributors were held liable to a customer who was injured after applying their hair dye. The distributors did not ascertain the type of supervision under which the manufacture of the dye was carried out and never tested the solution supplied. Nevertheless, they advertised that the hair dye was “absolutely safe and harmless”. The court ruled that their conduct was careless and adjudged them liable to the customer for his injury.
56        There are striking parallels between 
Watson v Buckley
 and the present case. TV Media did not ascertain the conditions under which the manufacture of Slim 10 was carried out and never took steps to test the pills. Nonetheless, it proceeded to hold them out as “100% natural” and “safe for consumption”. As the judge commented ([15] 
supra
 at [186]):
… [TV Media] was negligent in placing blind faith in everything [Semon] said. [Health Biz] had no track record of any sort. [Semon] had no experience at all in the importation of Chinese medicines. Without verification, [TV Media] began accepting Slim 10 packs for sale. Again, without verification, it began to proclaim to the consumer world that Slim 10 was 100% herbal and was safe for consumption. It could not excuse its lack of diligence and care by plaintively pleading that the wording of its advertisements was vetted and approved by the HSA. It was the responsibility of the distributor to make sure that what it represented to the public was true and plainly, it was not.
The process of importing and testing Slim 10
57        TV Media contested this finding on several grounds. Before dealing with them, it is necessary to lay out the process by which Slim 10 was imported and tested in some detail. The original formulation which Semon intended to import through Health Biz was “yue zhi tang qing zhi shu”. Semon sent samples of this product to Setsco Services Pte Ltd (“Setsco”), an accredited test laboratory, for testing. Health Biz then applied to HSA for import and wholesale dealer licences, as well as for conversion of the name “yue zhi tang qing zhi shu” to “Slim 10”. In its application, Health Biz submitted two test reports from Setsco, as well as a sample for analysis. The licence for Slim 10 was granted on 27 June 2001.
58        In July 2001, the Chinese manufacturer launched a new version of Slim 10, “yue zhi tang jian fei jiao nang”, which it described in a letter to Health Biz as being “our improved version of the slimming pill”. However, the same letter pointed out that “both types of slimming pills [have] exactly the same ingredients and quantity”. Health Biz later confirmed with HSA that it was seeking approval for the second name, not the first.
59        In August 2001, HSA asked Health Biz why the powder in the new version of Slim 10 and the original version of Slim 10 differed in colour and smell. The content of the new “yue zhi tang jian fei jiao nang” pills was brown, coarse and fragrant, whereas the original Slim 10 pills contained a smooth pale yellow powder. Health Biz assured HSA that from then onwards, Slim 10 capsules would only contain the yellow powder. On 1 November 2001, Health Biz sent HSA a letter of undertaking stating that it would ensure that all subsequent consignments of Slim 10 would be free from poisons and synthetic adulterants. We would highlight that it was 
in exchange
 for this letter that HSA granted Health Biz product listing approval on 2 November 2001.
60        It was not disputed that Health Biz eventually breached its undertakings to HSA. It did not test the next few consignments of Slim 10 for poison, but supplied these consignments to TV Media and Rayson without declaring that the pills were free of poisons, as required by the Medicines (Licensing, Standard Provisions and Fees) Regulations (Cap 176, Reg 6, 2000 Rev Ed). Keith Norman, a Scientific Officer in the Australian Federal Police Force who analysed samples of Slim 10 in July and August 2002, testified that all three samples of Slim 10 given to him for analysis contained brown powder, which indicated that Health Biz had breached its undertaking to HSA to import and sell only capsules which contained yellow powder. In turn, TV Media accepted the consignments for sale without checking that Health Biz had complied with its undertakings.
TV Media’s misplaced faith in Semon
61        TV Media protested that it had no reason to disbelieve Semon when he indicated that each batch of pills would be tested prior to packing in Singapore to ensure the safety and quality of Slim 10. TV Media’s litany of reasons for trusting Semon ran as follows: Semon was a successful businessman who ran an archery and chinchilla business, he had invested his own money in the manufacturing process, he had a famous grandfather and uncle, he had taken Slim 10 himself and lost a lot of weight, he had agreed to take up insurance cover and he had kept TV Media constantly informed as to the status of the planning approval for the product and appeared to know what needed to be done.
62        We fail to appreciate the relevance of most of these factors to the matter before us. In our opinion, the points germane to the issue are those that follow. TV Media knew that Semon had no experience in the medical or pharmaceutical industry and that this was his first foray into Chinese proprietary medicine. TV Media did not conduct any independent checks on Semon or on Health Biz apart from checking the company’s paid-up capital. It failed to check on Health Biz’s system of business practices. TV Media omitted to conduct any independent checks on the Chinese manufacturer before signing the agreement to distribute Slim 10. Before distributing Slim 10 in Singapore, TV Media did not consult any expert herbalists or any legal experts about the distribution of Slim 10 but merely depended on the research that Wilfred carried out on the Internet, even though he acknowledged that he was not an expert herbalist. TV Media relied on the representation of Peter Boo (“Peter”), the Vice President of Health Biz, that as Health Biz already had a wholesale dealer’s licence, TV Media did not need to apply for one as well. In the event, TV Media had to plead guilty to 20 charges of conducting wholesale distribution of Slim 10 without a wholesale dealer’s licence.
63        We do not think that a reasonable distributor would have been so slipshod in its approach to marketing a new drug that would be ingested by consumers. On the contrary, a reasonable distributor would at least have taken steps to deal with a reputable supplier and, if it knew that the importer had no experience with such products, would have done more to ensure the safety of the product. As in 
Watson v Buckley
, we cannot accept that it is a tenable defence for TV Media to assert that it had placed reliance on another party in the chain of distribution if it had neglected its own duties.
64        After enumerating the reasons for its trust in Semon, TV Media then denied placing blind faith in everything Semon had said. It offered as proof of this its insistence that the effective date of the contract between Health Biz and TV Media should be 1 December 2001, after product approval was granted by HSA. We are not satisfied with this explanation. A careful examination of the events leading up to the contract led us to conclude that the effective date of the contract was a mere formality since the actual distributorship agreement was originally dated 1 March 2001 and signed by both parties in July 2001, months before HSA granted product listing approval for Slim 10 in November 2001. In fact, it was only in mid-November 2001 that TV Media wrote to Health Biz proposing that the distributorship agreement be re-dated to commence from 1 December 2001. These were hardly the actions of a distributor which was truly anxious for product listing approval to be granted before entering into a distributorship agreement for the product. In the meantime, Semon had been supplying Slim 10 to Rayson for distribution to MediaCorp artistes with TV Media’s approval, and this continued after 1 December 2001. It is therefore clear to us that TV Media supported the distribution of Slim 10 to consumers at all material times, even though none of these consignments of Slim 10 was tested for safety.
65        In 
Leitz v The Saskatoon Drug and Stationery Co Ltd
 
[1980] 5 WWR 673
; 112 DLR (3d) 106, the court found the distributor liable for falsely advertising that the sunglasses it distributed were impact resistant. The distributor had never conducted any tests on the sunglasses to determine if they were really impact resistant, and worsened this by devising a tag containing untrue information to entice consumers to buy the sunglasses. Similarly, TV Media failed to ensure that tests were conducted on the pills to determine their safety and instead advertised blithely that the pills were safe for consumption.
HSA’s approval and testing
66        The linchpin of TV Media’s assertion that it did not breach its duty of care was that it had placed its faith in HSA and only prepared the advertisements after HSA had given product approval for Slim 10 and approved the use of the phrase “100% herbal” in TV Media’s advertisements. It argued that, as an approved body with scientific resources, HSA would have been able to provide a clear view on whether or not the pills were safe for consumption. HSA failed to detect the presence of fenfluramine in Slim 10 even though it was set out in the Setsco reports presented to HSA. Instead, HSA carried out its own tests and approved Slim 10. TV Media could not be blamed for relying on HSA’s approval, as it was too onerous to expect TV Media to have insisted on seeing batch test reports and seeking professional advice about them. TV Media’s role was confined solely to applying for the advertising permit.
67        In this respect, Dr Bosco Chen Bloodworth (“Dr Bloodworth”), Head of the Pharmaceutical Laboratory and of the Poisons Information Centre, HSA, explained that HSA did not usually rely on reports submitted by vendors, since vendors would not submit flawed reports damaging to their own interests. Rather, HSA would base its decision to grant the import licence on its own test results. It thus ignored the Setsco report, which set out the presence of fenfluramine, and conducted its own tests which screened for fenfluramine but did not detect it. Dr Bloodworth explained that fenfluramine was not stated as “fenfluramine” in the Setsco report but by its chemical name, which no one except a structural chemist would be familiar with as it was subject to numerous permutations. He insisted that HSA’s role was only to ensure that the minimum level of testing had been satisfied. Importers were ultimately responsible for the safety of the product they were importing, as it was virtually impossible for HSA to test for every possible contaminant in Chinese medicine.
68        We agree with TV Media’s submissions in so far as it asserted that HSA should bear some degree of responsibility when granting approval for a product. HSA is a government regulatory body whereas distributors clearly have a vested interest in promoting their products. We consider that laymen in Singapore wanting to buy drugs will indubitably place more confidence in HSA’s stamp of approval on the product than in the distributor’s platitudes about it. For HSA to insist that products are not necessarily safe even though it has given them its stamp of approval begs the question of what its role in the approval process is. We think that if HSA does not intend its approval process to signal a guarantee of the safety and quality of the approved product, it should make this clear to both importers and the public.
69        Nevertheless, we cannot condone TV Media’s attempt to shirk its responsibility for ensuring product safety. The letter of undertaking, which Health Biz gave to HSA in exchange for product listing approval of Slim 10, reflected Health Biz’s awareness of its responsibility to ensure that the pills did not contain poison or synthetic substances. It stated:
To the best of [Health Biz]’s ability, [Health Biz] shall ensure that Slim 10 slimming capsules shall not contain any poison or synthetic substances or drugs in Slim 10.
[Health Biz] shall comply to [
sic
] HSA’s requirements to submit the Test Results for Toxic Heavy Metal and Microbial Contamination within two months of the import of the consignment of Slim 10 capsules from China.
70        Further, s 3(2)(d) of the Medicines (Licensing, Standard Provisions and Fees) Regulations required Health Biz to submit a declaration stating that Slim 10 was free from poisons and synthetic substances 
before
 selling 
each
 consignment of the pills. In our view, legislation would not require importers to submit such declarations and test results if HSA had indeed undertaken all responsibility to warrant the safety of the products it tests. Similarly, Health Biz’s undertaking would not have made any sense in such a context. We also recognise that, as a matter of public policy, it might not be reasonable to expect a government agency to carry out in-depth testing of each of the thousands of products submitted to it. Equally, it might not be economically efficient to place the costs of such testing on the government. Rather, given the large profits TV Media hoped to rake in from sales of Slim 10, we do not deem it too onerous for TV Media to have sought professional advice on the Setsco report.
71        In any event, we consider the issue of HSA’s liability to be academic as it was not party to the proceedings below and none of the defendants made any attempt to join it as a third party to proceedings. As a joint tortfeasor, TV Media is still liable to Andrea for the whole damage she suffered. In our judgment, TV Media was not entitled to place such unquestioning reliance on HSA’s approval of the product, and was accordingly in breach of its duty of care to ensure the safety of Slim 10.
TV Media’s doubts about the safety of Slim 10
72        Our finding that TV Media had breached its duty of care to Andrea is fortified by the contents of several of its internal e-mails which were adduced in evidence. We will not detail the contents of these e-mails. Suffice it to say that the e-mails were telling evidence that TV Media had strong doubts about the safety of Slim 10, and knew or suspected that Semon was not taking adequate steps to ensure its safety.
73        It is painfully apparent to us that TV Media was manifestly more concerned about any “fallout” on the company than about taking steps to ensure the safety of Slim 10. This attitude evinces a callous disregard for consumer safety that we cannot condone, and we have no difficulty in finding that TV Media was in breach of its duty of care to Andrea.
Whether TV Media’s breach caused Andrea’s liver failure
74        The judge observed that if TV Media had taken care to insist on seeing the batch test reports and to seek professional advice on them, it would not have made its claims about the safety of Slim 10 on television. In consequence, Andrea would not have been lured to her “devastating debacle”: [15] 
supra
 at [186].
75        TV Media appealed on the grounds of 
novus actus interveniens
 and contributory negligence. It adduced Andrea’s testimony that whilst she was taking the pills, she had experienced chills, slight pains in her feet and calves, insomnia and palpitations. TV Media argued that Andrea was contributorily negligent in that she ought to have stopped taking Slim 10 or seen a doctor when she experienced these symptoms.
76        We do not agree that Andrea’s omission to seek medical aid was so “wholly unreasonable” as to constitute a 
novus actus interveniens
 which would obliterate TV Media’s wrongdoing. It is only where the act or omission of a party is of such a nature as to constitute a wholly independent cause of the damage that the intervening conduct may be termed a 
novus actus interveniens
: 
Muirhead v Industrial Tank Specialities Ltd
 
[1986] QB 507
. Thus, in 
McFarlane v Tayside Health Board
 
[2000] 2 AC 59
, the House of Lords emphatically confirmed that the failure to undergo a termination of pregnancy or to give the child up for abortion did not break the chain of causation between a negligently performed sterilisation operation and an unwanted birth. Similarly, we fail to see how Andrea’s failure to seek medical aid could be anything more than part of the sequence of events. It was certainly not a wholly independent cause of her damage.
77        TV Media did not plead the defence of contributory negligence below. We ruled in 
Rajendran a/l Palany v Dril-Quip Asia Pacific Pte Ltd
 
[2001] 3 SLR 274
 at [19]–[20] that if the defence of contributory negligence was not pleaded below, or if the facts pleaded below were not sufficiently clear that the defendant was alleging the plaintiff’s partial responsibility for the injuries giving rise to the action, then the court below would not be entitled to make a finding of contributory negligence. This seems enough for us to dispose of this ground of appeal.
Whether Slim 10 caused Andrea’s liver failure
78        Analysing the issue of causation required us to consider the expert evidence presented before the court below. In so doing, we bore in mind that the approach to be taken in evaluating conflicting expert evidence is to examine the scientific grounds and bases on which the experts rely and to determine the soundness of their opinions in the light of the facts: 
Singapore Finance Ltd v Lim Kah Ngam
 
(S’pore) Pte Ltd
 
[1984–1985] SLR 381
 and 
Tengku Jonaris Badlishah v PP
 
[1999] 2 SLR 260

Andrea’s expert witnesses
79        Andrea adduced the testimony of two expert witnesses. The first witness was Dr Dede Selemat Sutedja (“Dr Sutedja”), a consultant in the Division of Gastroenterology and a member of NUH’s Liver Transplant Programme. A liver specialist for the past eight years, Dr Sutedja was involved in Andrea’s diagnosis and treatment at NUH. He took her period of ingestion of Slim 10 as being between December 2001 and January 2002 and said that the onset of her liver injury was “certainly” somewhere in early March 2002, or even late February 2002. He eliminated non-drug related causes and opined that the temporal relationship between the last ingestion of Slim 10 and the onset of liver failure was compatible with a possible drug hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity is the medical term for liver damage caused by drugs and other chemicals. Dr Sutedja considered a histopathology report by Dr Jean Ho (“Dr Ho”), a consultant pathologist, and concluded that Andrea’s liver failure was drug-induced.
80        Dr Sutedja evaluated the other two health products taken by Andrea before her illness, Spirulina and Pycnogenol. He observed that only Slim 10 contained hepatotoxic substances, whilst the other two supplements had no known adverse effects. Slim 10 was found to contain nicotinamide, fenfluramine, thyroid gland extract and N-nitrosofenfluramine. Nicotinamide can cause hepatotoxicity when taken in excessive amounts. N-nitrosofenfluramine is a nitrosamine, which is an N-nitroso compound, and such compounds are generally thought to be hepatotoxic. Moreover, Andrea had consumed Spirulina and Pycnogenol for two and a half years without problems. As such, he was “very satisfied” that Slim 10 was the likely cause of Andrea’s liver failure.
81        Andrea’s second witness was Dr Tan Kai Chah (“Dr Tan”). Director of the Liver Transplant Programme in NUH since 1995, Dr Tan performed Andrea’s liver transplant. Upon consideration of Dr Ho’s histopathology report and the fact that Andrea’s liver had been severely damaged, he concluded that there was strong indication that Andrea’s liver failure was drug-induced. He followed the same diagnosis of exclusion as Dr Sutedja to conclude that Slim 10 was the only possible causative drug.
82        Dr Tan also referred to a report from the Japanese Ministry of Health entitled “Results of Investigation into Chinese Diet Health Food Products”. Detailing the results of laboratory tests on animals with N-nitrosofenfluramine, the report said:
Although weight gain was suppressed, an increase in the absolute liver weight was also observed, and the results of biochemical testing … 
showed liver cell damage
 and that the biliary system was affected.
From these results, it has been inferred that 
N-nitrosofenfluramine not only damages liver cells, but also caused hepatic toxicity in the broadest possible sense
 including possible damage to the biliary system. [our emphasis]
TV Media’s expert witnesses
83        TV Media likewise adduced testimony from two expert witnesses. The first was Dr David Joyce (“Dr Joyce”), a physician of clinical pharmocology and toxicology and an associate professor of medicine and pharmacology in the School of Medicine and Pharmacology of the University of Western Australia. He applied a test suggested and partly validated by Naranjo and others in 1981, and estimated that the attribution of Andrea’s liver failure to Slim 10 could be scored at 2 or 3, which meant that association between Slim 10 and her liver failure was in the “possible” zone. We note that Dr Joyce was unable to apply some of the criteria in the Naranjo test, as they required the re-taking of Slim 10, which was impossible in the circumstances.
84        Dr Joyce postulated that as Andrea had eaten seafood in Bangkok, her liver failure might be due to a seafood source. The amount of fenfluramine and nicotinamide in Slim 10 was much too low to have caused her liver failure. He felt that the link between N-nitrosofenfluramine and hepatotoxicity is not sufficiently established. Although N-nitrosofenfluramine is a nitrosamine and some nitrosamines are known to be hepatotoxic, the most toxic of nitrosamines is N-nitrosodimethylamine (“NDMA”), which is associated with cirrhosis rather than acute liver failure. If N-nitrosofenfluramine works in the same way as NDMA, it should be rapidly metabolised, so that Andrea would have had to take 480 Slim 10 pills at one go in order to suffer liver failure.
85        TV Media’s second expert witness was Dr Julia Alexis Wendon (“Dr Wendon”). A senior lecture and honorary consultant physician at the Institute of Liver Studies in London, Dr Wendon is responsible for running the Institute’s Liver Intensive Care Unit, which sees about 120 to 180 cases of acute liver failure annually.
86        Dr Wendon posited that toxic insult to Andrea’s liver had been delivered fairly recently. Fenfluramine is unlikely to be hepatotoxic. N-nitrosofenfluramine and nitrosamines are very rarely associated with liver toxicity and are related more to chronic cirrhosis and carcinogens than to acute hepatic necrosis. However, nitrosamines may render an individual at greater risk from hepatotoxicity. As such, although the compounds in Slim 10 do not appear to have any direct hepatotoxic effects, they may render the risk of hepatotoxicity greater should an individual be exposed to an unrelated source of hepatotoxin. Applying the Maria and Victorino clinical scale, a clinical scale for the diagnosis of drug-induced hepatitis, Dr Wendon arrived at a score of 3 to 7 based on Andrea’s consumption of Slim 10 between February to early April 2002, which meant that Slim 10 was an “excluded” or “unlikely” cause of her liver failure.
87        Dr Wendon further testified that Spirulina may become contaminated with toxins, which may in turn affect the liver resulting in necrosis (the death of living cells). The risk of such toxicity increases with the duration of ingestion. She cited a case where doctors in Japan had surmised that Spirulina might be associated with the liver injury of a 52-year-old Japanese man who had taken Spirulina for five weeks before admission to hospital. She concluded that she did not believe that a definitive cause of acute liver failure could be determined. Andrea might have suffered from sero-negative hepatitis, which would effectively exclude other causes of liver failure. As such, she ascribed Andrea’s liver failure to an unknown viral cause.
The judge’s findings
88        The judge first examined the temporal relationship between Slim 10 and Andrea’s liver failure. Hyman J Zimmerman’s 
Hepatotoxicity: The Adverse Effects of Drugs and Other Chemicals on the Liver
 (2nd Ed, 1999) states that most instances of drug-induced hepatic injury occur five to 90 days after taking the drug. Where the interval from stoppage of drug intake to onset of injury is 15 days or less, the injury is likely to have been caused by the drug. If the interval is more than 35 days, it is unlikely to have been caused by the drug.
89        Based on the dates of consumption which we discussed earlier in this judgment, Andrea began consumption of Slim 10 in late January or early February 2002 and completed consumption of the second batch of pills around 20 March 2002 and no later than 29 March 2002. Dr Wendon placed Andrea’s probable date of liver injury at 11 April. If so, the interval between the date when Andrea began consumption of Slim 10 and the onset of her liver injury would fall well within Zimmerman’s buffer period of 5 to 90 days. The interval from stoppage of intake to appearance of injury would have been 12 to 21 days, which would be around the 15-day range required to establish that the injury was likely to have been caused by Slim 10, and well within the 35-day range mentioned by Zimmerman
.
90        The judge also considered the “worst-case scenario” for Andrea. This entailed her starting her course of Slim 10 in the last five days of January 2002 and consuming both batches of Slim 10 in the recommended dosage of 12 pills a day. She would have finished both batches of pills by 7 March 2002. The gap of 34 days between 7 March and 11 April was still within Zimmerman’s 35-day range.
91        Since Andrea had been taking Spirulina regularly for two and a half years, the judge concluded that it would “fail spectacularly” the Zimmerman test. Moreover, apart from the case of the 52-year-old Japanese man who also had a host of other medical conditions, there was no known case of Spirulina being hepatotoxic. On the other hand, N-nitrosofenfluramine belongs to the nitrosamine family, which is generally accepted as hepatotoxic. Animal tests conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health have also confirmed its harmful effects on the liver.
92        The judge also considered the case of another Singaporean lady who had suffered liver failure after consuming Slim 10 and died. The coroner in that case accepted the expert’s opinion that the deceased’s liver failure was related to the N-nitrosofenfluramine present in Slim 10. Dr Tan opined that the fact that there were only two cases of liver failure from Slim 10 among the many who consumed the pill indicated that the damage caused was not dose-related, but that Andrea had probably suffered an idiosyncratic drug reaction.
93        Based on the evidence before him, the judge made the following finding ([15] 
supra
 at [180]):
On the evidence placed before me, I am convinced on a balance of probabilities that Slim 10 did cause the liver failure in this case. The totality of the circumstantial evidence points quite ineluctably to Slim 10 as having been the causative agent of [Andrea’s] massive hepatocellular necrosis. … I do not … think that one theory of causation is extremely improbable and the other virtually impossible. I do think that Slim 10 is the highly probable cause and all the other possibilities highly improbable.
94        It now remains for us to examine the various arguments canvassed by TV Media on appeal.
Whether Slim 10 induced liver failure
95        TV Media took issue with the judge’s finding that the totality of evidence showed that Slim 10 had caused Andrea’s liver failure on a balance of probabilities. First, the experts agreed that Andrea had suffered from fulminant liver failure, that is, a sudden and severe attack on the liver. This was contrary to the behavioural pattern of NDMA, which causes cirrhosis of the liver (scarring of the liver through regular insults to the liver). Andrea’s liver did not exhibit any signs of cirrhosis – in other words, there was no clinical picture of repeated poisoning in small dosages, which should have been the case given that Andrea consumed Slim 10 over a period of three months.
96        Second, even assuming that N-nitrosofenfluramine is as toxic as NDMA, which is the most potent hepatotoxic nitrosamine known, Dr Joyce’s opinion was that Andrea’s daily dose of Slim 10 was around 40 times lower than the estimated dose necessary to produce acute liver damage in a human. Moreover, nitrosamines are generally very quickly metabolised and removed from the body.
97        Both contentions were premised upon the assumption that N-nitrosofenfluramine functions in the same way as NDMA. As the judge below noted, there is no medical literature as yet on this subject. Dr Tan also cautioned that the effect of N-nitrosofenfluramine in this case might have been different as it was combined with a cocktail of other substances present in Slim 10. These conjectures aside, the only established evidence before us is first, that N-nitrosofenfluramine is a nitrosamine, and nitrosamines are generally accepted to be hepatotoxic; and second, that animal studies conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health have confirmed N-nitrosofenfluramine’s harmful effects on the liver.
98        As established by the Privy Council in 
Grant v Australian Knitting Mills, Ltd
 
[1936] AC 85
, circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to connect a product to damage or injury in the absence of any other explanations. In 
Grant
, the appellant claimed against the retailers and manufacturers of his woollen garments after he had contracted dermatitis, allegedly from the presence of free sulphite in the garments. Lord Wright noted at 96 that “pieces of evidence, each by itself insufficient, may together constitute a significant whole, and justify by their combined effect a conclusion.” As such, “the coincidences of time and place, and the absence of any other explanation” than the presence of free sulphite in the garments pointed strongly in the appellant’s favour.
99        Similarly, after considering the temporal relationship between Slim 10 and Andrea’s liver failure as well as a host of other factors, the judge ruled out any other explanations for Andrea’s liver failure. We have heard nothing in TV Media’s submissions which persuade us that the decision by the judge was wrong and ought to be revisited.
Whether Andrea’s liver failure was drug-related or caused by a viral infection
100      Dr Ho agreed that her earlier histopathology report of 2 May 2003 had leant towards a diagnosis of drug-induced liver failure. However, after further tests and research she was unable to come to a conclusion, based on the biopsy specimen alone, whether the cause was a toxic substance or a viral infection. TV Media contended that as Dr Sutedja had relied on Dr Ho’s initial report to conclude that Andrea’s liver failure was drug-induced, his clinical finding ought to have been re-evaluated in light of Dr Ho’s change in testimony.
101      We find this argument unmeritorious. Dr Sutedja’s conclusion that Andrea’s liver failure was drug-induced was not based solely on Dr Ho’s report but on a consideration of all the evidence before him as well as the medical literature. Moreover, Dr Ho did not rule out drug-induced hepatotoxicity altogether. She merely said that a viral cause was also a possibility.
Whether Andrea suffered an idiosyncratic drug reaction
102      Similarly, we are not persuaded by TV Media’s argument that since Dr Ho dispelled the notion of Andrea suffering from a drug reaction, there was no reason for the judge to conclude that Andrea had suffered from an idiosyncratic drug reaction. It is apparent from the notes of evidence that Dr Ho made no such statement. She merely testified that Andrea’s liver failure might have been caused by a drug reaction 
or
 a viral infection.
103      In similar vein, TV Media’s assertion that Dr Sutedja and Dr Tan had only brought up the possibility of an idiosyncratic drug reaction on the witness stand does not stand up to scrutiny. Dr Sutedja’s clinical notes referred to Andrea’s condition as a “drug induced immuno-allergic toxic hepatitis”. In our understanding, an immuno-allergic reaction is a type of idiosyncratic reaction.
Maria and Victorino clinical scale
104      TV Media further charged that the judge had failed to take the Maria and Victorino clinical scale into account when reaching his decision. To the contrary, the judge accepted that the Maria and Victorino scale test militated against Andrea’s case. Nevertheless, he noted the limitations to the test since it was impossible to perform certain components of the test in this case, such as the re-challenging or re-introduction of the suspect drug.
105      We find more merit in TV Media’s next argument, that the judge could not have held that the probable cause of Andrea’s liver failure was drug-related given Dr Wendon’s score of 3 to 7 when she applied the scale, since this placed Slim 10 in the “excluded” or “unlikely” range. However, it is worth noting that all the experts, including Dr Wendon, agreed that clinical scales are merely “crude guides” which are difficult to apply to new drugs. Dr Sutedja testified that there are drugs which have been considered “unlikely” by these scales but which have been found to cause liver hepatotoxicity. In deciding the question of causation, the totality of the clinical picture still has to be considered. The Maria and Victorino scale was only one of the many factors which the judge considered. We do not see how the judge can be faulted for concluding that Slim 10 had caused Andrea’s liver failure on a balance of probabilities.
Shortcomings in expert reports
106      TV Media cast various aspersions on the credibility of Andrea’s expert witnesses. Most of these have already been dealt with in the preceding paragraphs. A brief overview of the remaining criticisms follows.
107      TV Media levelled various criticisms at Dr Sutedja. First, it alleged that he failed to consider the diagnosis of sero-negative hepatitis in his affidavit. This criticism is unmeritorious. Dr Wendon defined sero-negative hepatitis as “a diagnosis of effective exclusion of other causes of acute liver failure”. It is apparent from this definition that doctors will only make a diagnosis of sero-negative hepatitis if they are unable to find a cause of liver failure. Since Dr Sutedja had already concluded that Andrea’s liver failure was drug-induced, there was no reason for him to even consider the diagnosis of sero-negative hepatitis.
108      In answer to TV Media’s argument that Dr Sutedja’s assessment of the time of onset of Andrea’s liver failure was not substantiated by any clinical or scientific studies, we would say that this was irrelevant, since the judge eventually accepted Dr Wendon’s suggested date of Andrea’s liver failure (11 April 2002) rather than adopting Dr Sutedja’s approach.
109      Similarly, we must dismiss TV Media’s contention that Dr Sutedja had no basis for his clinical diagnosis since Andrea did not have features of drug-induced toxicity like joint aches, skin rash and swollen lymph nodes. Zimmerman states clearly that the lack of such features does not exclude the diagnosis of drug-induced liver disease.
110      We reject as preposterous TV Media’s criticism of Dr Tan’s evidence because he only saw Andrea the day before her operation and did not have any “first hand perception” that her injury was drug-induced. After all, TV Media’s own experts, Dr Wendon and Dr Joyce, were flown in from overseas and never talked to Andrea, let alone examined her.
N-nitrosofenfluramine and liver failure
111      TV Media’s final attempt to deny that Slim 10 could have caused Andrea’s liver failure was to advance the argument that there was no basis for blaming N-nitrosofenfluramine for Andrea’s liver failure. First, Andrea did not show any signs of carcinogenic effects after ingesting Slim 10 even though nitrosamines are carcinogenic. Second, no evidence was adduced to show that n-nitroso compounds were found in Andrea’s urine or waste samples.
112      In our opinion, both contentions are spurious. First, TV Media’s unequivocal statement that nitrosamines are carcinogenic is blatantly untrue. The Australian tribunal in 
Re Brown & Repatriation Commission
 (1994) 33 ALD [
Administrative Law Decisions
] 211 at [27], the case cited by TV Media in support of this proposition, merely noted that nitrosamines are carcinogenic in animals and 
might
 be carcinogenic in humans. In any case, whether or not N-nitrosofenfluramine is carcinogenic is hardly relevant to the issue before us, which is whether it is hepatotoxic.
113      Second, the tribunal in 
Re Brown
 said, at [34], that N-nitroso compounds are 
not normally found
, other than in trace amounts, in human urine or faeces. This statement hardly supports TV Media’s argument that failure to find these compounds in Andrea’s urine or waste samples points ineluctably to the fact that N-nitrosofenfluramine was not responsible for her liver failure.
Conclusion on TV Media’s appeal as to liability
114      In our judgment, all the evidence points to Slim 10 as the cause of Andrea’s liver failure. As the distributor and advertiser of Slim 10 in Singapore, TV Media patently owed Andrea a duty of care once she purchased and consumed the pills. By representing to the public that Slim 10 was totally natural and absolutely safe for consumption, TV Media was in breach of that duty of care. For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the judge’s finding that TV Media was liable for Andrea’s liver failure.
Semon’s appeal on liability
115      Semon adopted the arguments of TV Media on the issues of medical causation. For the reasons enumerated above, we would dismiss this aspect of the appeal.
Whether Semon authorised, directed or procured Health Biz’s negligence
116      The judge held Semon personally liable for authorising, directing and/or procuring Health Biz’s negligent acts. Semon appealed. Before turning our attention to the substantive issues on appeal, we will deal briefly with some preliminary points.
Preliminary issues
117      A fundamental tenet of company law is that a company is a separate legal entity from its members or shareholders. As such, the members are not liable to be sued in respect of a breach of the company’s obligations: 
Salomon v A Salomon and Co, Ltd
 
[1897] AC 22
. In an extension of this principle, the courts have held that proof of the commission of a tort by a company does not automatically prove that the directors who manage its affairs are also guilty of the tort: 
Rainham Chemical Works, Ltd v Belvedere Fish Guano Co Ltd
 
[1921] 2 AC 465
, 
Gabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong Jin
 
[1998] 1 SLR 374
.
118      The law has carved out an exception to this principle. Where directors order an act by the company which amounts to a tort by the company, they may be liable as joint tortfeasors on the basis that they have “procured or directed” the wrong to be done: 
Performing Right Society, Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate, Ltd
 
[1924] 1 KB 1
.
119      At this juncture, we can quickly dispose of Semon’s argument that it was improper for the judge to lift Health Biz’s corporate veil to find him liable for authorising, directing and/or procuring Health Biz’s negligent importation of Slim 10, since Andrea’s statement of claim did not plead that the corporate veil should be lifted. In our view, Andrea’s claim against Semon for authorising, directing and/or procuring Health Biz’s negligence was essentially a claim asking the court to lift Health Biz’s corporate veil. After all, a court can only find a director personally liable for authorising, directing or procuring the company’s tort if it has first lifted the company’s corporate veil which otherwise protects a director from being found liable.
120      Hence, it only remains for us to consider the question of whether Semon authorised, directed and/or procured Health Biz’s negligence so that this Court should lift the corporate veil and find him personally liable in negligence.
The definition of “authorised, directed and/or procured”
121      Semon made much of the correct interpretation of the phrase “authorised, directed and/or procured”. He argued that the phrase is directed at a situation where the wrong can be isolated as a positive, clear, deliberate act or where there has been an assumption of personal liability by the director. In contrast, both his negligence and that of Health Biz lay in omissions which formed a negligent course of conduct.
122      In support of this, Semon referred us to 
Performing Right Society
, where the phrase “authorised, directed and/or procured” was first used. This was a case of copyright infringement, and the words “authorised”, “procured” and permitted” were statutorily derived from the English Copyright Act of 1911 (c 46). Semon argued that when read in context, the words were only meant to apply to a director authorising, permitting and/or procuring a positive act such as copyright infringement, as opposed to a wrongful omission to act.
123      This formulation is too narrow and inadequate in three aspects. In the first place, Semon’s reliance on 
Performing Right Society
 as authority for his proposition does not stand up to scrutiny. Bankes LJ held at 9 that:
I agree … that the Court may infer an authorization or permission from acts which fall short of being direct and positive; I go so far as to say that indifference, exhibited by acts of commission 
or omission
, may reach a degree from which authorization or permission may be inferred. [our emphasis]
124      Second, while the common law stops short at imposing liability for “pure omissions” (
Smith v Littlewoods Organisation Ltd
 
[1987] AC 241
), it is clear that there can be tortious liability for both omissions and commissions. The classic definition of negligence, as formulated in 
Blyth v The Company of Proprietors of the Birmingham Waterworks Co
 (1856) 11 Exch 781 at 784; 156 ER 1047 at 1049, and cited by the House of Lords in 
British Railways Board v Herrington
 
[1972] AC 877
 at 907, is:
the 
omission
 to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or 
doing
 something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. [emphasis added]
Similarly, Lord Atkin adjudged in 
Donoghue v Stevenson
, [49] 
supra
 at 580, that:
You must take reasonable care to avoid 
acts or omissions
 which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. [emphasis added]
125      Third, it is not apparent to us that a valid distinction can be drawn between acts of commission and omission. Should it come down to an issue of semantics, a tort of omission can equally well be phrased as a tort of commission. For instance, Health Biz’s failure to conduct tests on each batch of Slim 10 can be restated as a positive act of negligently selling untested pills. Its failure to ensure that only yellow-powdered Slim 10 was sold was also a positive act of selling the contaminated brown-powdered Slim 10.
126      Denning LJ said in 
Hawkins v Coulsdon and Purley Urban District
 
Council
 
[1954] 1 QB 319
 at 333 that:
… I would suggest that there is no longer any valid distinction to be drawn between acts of commission and acts of omission. It always was an illogical distinction. Many acts of commission can be regarded as acts of omission and vice versa. It all depends on how you look at it.
Even though this 
obiter dicta
 by Denning LJ was made in the context of a discourse on the duties of occupiers of land towards their licensees, we think that the reasoning employed by him applies with equal force to other acts of negligence such as those complained of in the present case. We do not see why liability should only be imposed on a director for authorising, directing and/or procuring a positive act of negligence, whilst another director’s tortious omission to act should escape liability.
127      All this aside, we fail to see the relevance of Semon’s contention since Andrea’s statement of claim against Health Biz was couched in positive terms:
The 2nd Defendant by its servants or agents 
imported, distributed and/or sold
 in Singapore, the Pills which contained poisonous and/or harmful substances. [emphasis added]
128      In sum, we determine that the phrase “direct, procure and/or authorise” is eminently suited to Andrea’s claim in negligence against Semon and that it is irrelevant that Semon stands accused of having directed, procured or authorised a negligent course of omissions rather than a single positive act.
Evidence that Semon authorised, directed and/or procured Health Biz’s negligence
129      We now turn to Semon’s contention that there is no evidence that he authorised, directed and/or procured Health Biz’s negligence.
130      The judge identified Health Biz’s negligent acts as:
(a)        failing to ensure that only the HSA-approved yellow-powdered Slim 10 was imported and sold;
(b)        failing to keep proper records on the consignments of pills being imported so that each consignment could be identified and tested; and
(c)        failing to conduct proper batch tests and to ask for professional help in interpreting test reports.
131      Semon sought to downplay his personal involvement with Health Biz by highlighting the role which Peter played in the business. He asserted that Peter was in charge of important aspects of licensing and testing the pills and was instrumental in liasing with DAC and HSA. For instance, it was Peter who signed the letter of undertaking to HSA promising to conduct tests for poisons and synthetic substances on each consignment of Slim 10. TV Media’s representatives testified that they had looked to Peter when it came to the licensing and approval aspects of Slim 10. Peter wrote to HSA to ask about the tests required for Slim 10, which Semon highlighted as significant evidence that he had never authorised Peter to cut corners when it came to testing the pills. In light of all this, Semon argued that Peter’s involvement with Health Biz went beyond liasing with HSA to acting and making decisions on Health Biz’s behalf even in Semon’s absence.
132      The judge disagreed. He found that Peter, “despite his directorship and the high-sounding title of Vice President, was nothing more than an employee”. Semon, on the other hand, was the founder, director and president of Health Biz, its “one constant director and shareholder from its inception”: [15] 
supra
 at [193]. Semon only employed Peter after he made the decision to import Slim 10 and signed a contract with the Chinese manufacturer. He admitted in court that he invited Peter to join Health Biz “after we discussed that I needed a personal assistant”.
133      We cannot help but agree with the judge. While we acknowledge Peter’s involvement in all stages of Slim 10’s licensing and testing, we see his involvement as consistent with his role as Semon’s assistant, which would have required him to handle all administrative matters. To us, what is significant is that Peter had to report to Semon at every stage in the process, and that Semon took all decisions which were of any import. For example, when HSA decided to recall Slim 10, Semon decided to appeal against this recall and instructed Peter to draft the letter of appeal to HSA. Wilfred stated in his affidavit that:
Semon Liu decided to appeal
 
against the voluntary recall. As it was very late at night by then and as Peter Boo was noticeably exhausted, Health Biz requested me to help them type out a letter that very night so that 
Semon Liu could approve
 
it
 and Peter Boo could submit it to the HSA the next morning. Peter Boo and I drafted the first draft, which was 
then faxed to Semon Liu
 
for vetting and editing
. In all I think about 3 drafts were typed up 
before Semon Liu agreed to the final copy
. [emphasis added]
134      As such, we think that Peter’s role in Health Biz does not dilute the fact that Semon had absolute control of Health Biz, which in turn supports the judge’s finding that Semon’s involvement in Health Biz’s negligence was total. We see no reason to overturn this finding.
135      We turn next to Semon’s contention that there is no evidence before the court to show that he directed, authorised and/or procured Health Biz’s negligence. We are not so persuaded. The totality of the evidence leads us to the inescapable conclusion that Semon was the only person in the position to direct, authorise and/or procure Health Biz’s negligence.
136      Both before and after Peter’s employment, Semon represented Health Biz in all significant dealings with third parties. For instance, Semon dealt with the Chinese manufacturer on cash terms and in person. Every time an order for Slim 10 was placed, Semon would personally fly to China to make payment in cash. He flew to
 China 
to attend the launch of the “new and improved” version of Slim 10, “yue zhi tang jian fei jiao nang”, and decided to import the new version of pills instead. When HSA queried Health Biz on the reason for the disparity in colour and texture of the Slim 10 pills, it was Semon who flew to
 China 
to ask the manufacturer for a written explanation for this disparity.
137      When HSA expressed dissatisfaction with the explanation given by the Chinese manufacturer, Health Biz assured HSA that from then onwards, Slim 10 capsules would only contain the yellow powder. Since it is not disputed that Semon was the only person who had any form of contact with the Chinese manufacturer, we find ample reason to believe that he was the only one who could and should have ensured that the Chinese manufacturer supplied only the yellow-powdered Slim 10 pills as it had promised. We also find that he was the only person who could have instructed the Chinese manufacturer to adhere to a proper system of batching so that the pills would not have been imported in such a haphazard manner.
138      There are other indications of Semon’s overwhelming personal involvement in the importation of Slim 10. For instance, rather than approaching TV Media, Rayson and Liping in his capacity as director of Health Biz to promote the company, Semon presented his personal portfolio and 
curriculum vitae
 to them when he met them for the first time. Although the other shareholder and director of Health Biz, Tan Eng Kiat was present at this meeting, Rayson testified that Tan Eng Kiat hardly spoke, which indicates to us that it was Semon who was in full control of the situation. Moreover, Wilfred testified that during his meetings with Semon, Semon represented that he had invested his personal savings into the Chinese manufacturer, which was why Semon was able to go to the factory, take photographs and get close to the boss and the boss’s son, whom he called his “godfather” and “godbrother” respectively.
139      Semon also raised the well-worn argument that he thought it safe to assume that HSA’s granting of product licences confirmed the safety of Slim 10. For the reasons given earlier, we give no credence to this argument.
140      On the totality of the evidence, it is patently clear to us that Semon, and Semon alone, had absolute control of Health Biz. It stands to reason that Semon was the person directing its negligent acts or omissions. We find no reason to overturn the judge’s finding that nothing was done without Semon’s knowledge, and that Semon’s involvement in the negligence of Health Biz was not merely very great, but was total.
Whether Health Biz’s corporate veil should be lifted
141      Having established that Semon did direct, authorise and/or procure Health Biz’s negligence, we turn to the issue of whether there are exceptional circumstances which warrant the lifting of Health Biz’s corporate veil in order to fix Semon with personal liability.
142      Semon contended that that his involvement in the saga was only a “miniscule part of a vast and complex constellation of interacting causative factors”. He cited the case of 
British Thomson-Houston Co, Ltd v Sterling Accessories, Ltd
 
[1924] 2 Ch 33
 for the proposition that where a director is to be fixed with liability as principal, his agency of the company must be established substantively and cannot be inferred from his holding of director’s office and his control of the company shares alone. Additionally, he drew our attention to the case of 
Fairline Shipping Corp v Adamson
 
[1975] QB 180
, where the English Court of Appeal held that however small the company, and however powerful the director’s control over its affairs, the director should not automatically be identified with his company for the purpose of the law of tort.
143      The judge was clearly aware, and said as much in his judgment, that Semon’s liability could not be inferred from his holding of director’s office and his control of Health Biz’s shares alone. However, he went beyond Semon’s directorship of Health Biz and his 99% shareholding in the company to analyse the level of Semon’s involvement in the importation and testing of Slim 10. As we have discussed earlier, the judge took a multitude of other factors into account before arriving at his conclusion that Semon’s involvement in Health Biz’s negligence was total and that the very exceptional circumstances of the case justified a lifting of Health Biz’s corporate veil.
144      We are similarly unmoved by Semon’s arguments. We recognise that the issue of a director’s personal liability for his company’s torts involves the consideration of difficult policy questions. On the one hand, there is the principle that a company is separate and distinct in law from its shareholders and directors, and that there is a commercial interest in allowing companies to enjoy the benefits of limited liability which are offered by incorporation. On the other hand, directors of companies should not be allowed to escape personal liability to third parties for torts that they personally committed merely because they committed the torts in the course of carrying out their duties as directors of the company. Previous courts have weighed these considerations in the balance and arrived at the conclusion that whether or not a director is personally liable for a tort committed by his company depends on the factual situation at hand. The court must look at the level of his involvement in the company in order to determine the extent to which he is the company’s alter ego: 
Gabriel Peter
, [117] 
supra
 at [35].
145      In our considered opinion, Semon’s level of involvement in Health Biz indicates that he was clearly the controlling mind and spirit of Health Biz. We cannot agree with Semon’s attempts to portray Peter as anything more than a mere employee of the company. We accordingly find sufficient reason to lift Health Biz’s corporate veil and find Semon personally liable for authorising, directing and/or procuring Health Biz’s negligent acts.
Causation
146      This leads us to Semon’s next line of argument, which is that even if he had authorised, directed and/or procured Health Biz’s negligent acts, these acts did not lead to Andrea’s injury. He raised three arguments in support of this.
147      He first took issue with the judge’s comment in his judgment, that “only [Semon] could have decided that a general screening for poisons was not necessary”: [15] 
supra
 at [194]. Semon disagreed with this, asserting that Health Biz had sent the pills to Setsco for testing. We think that the judge’s comment must be read in context of his entire judgment. He was clearly aware that some screening tests had been commissioned for the pills, since he admonished Health Biz for not getting professional help in interpreting the Setsco test reports. Rather, he was referring to the fact that many batches of pills were not tested, and that this could only be due to Semon’s decision that general screening tests for 
every batch of pills
 were unnecessary.
148      Semon’s second and third arguments run along similar lines. He averred that even if Slim 10 had been properly batched and each batch sent for screening, the same test reports would have been generated and Andrea would still have suffered liver failure. Moreover, even if Health Biz had issued declarations of safety for each batch, they would have been inaccurate since N-nitrosofenfluramine was unknown to chemists at the time and would not have been detected.
149      In our opinion, both arguments miss the point. As the judge emphasised, Health Biz’s negligence lay in failing to test the batches of pills and 
then
 in failing to get professional help in interpreting the test results. As such, even if the same results would have been generated after testing each batch of pills, and even though these results might not have revealed the presence of N-nitrosofenfluramine, they would have revealed the presence of other banned poisonous substances like fenfluramine. If Health Biz had sought professional help in interpreting these test reports, the pills would not have been sold and Andrea would not have consumed them or suffered liver failure. This is the precise line of reasoning followed by the judge and we do not see how it can be faulted.
Policy arguments
150      Semon raised various policy arguments in his final attempt to persuade us to allow his appeal. He argued that making him personally liable will be tantamount to ruling that in virtually all situations, a dominant director will be made liable or impugned by virtue of having been linked to some of the company’s acts and omissions. This will result in “open hunting season” on small companies.
151      We are not so persuaded. As the judge stressed, Semon’s liability was founded on the very exceptional circumstances of this case. It is unlikely that this particular concatenation of circumstances will arise in many future cases and we do not share Semon’s concern that dismissal of his appeal will open the floodgates of litigation.
Conclusion on Semon’s liability
152      We accordingly find Semon personally liable for authorising, directing and/or procuring Health Biz’s acts of negligence and dismiss this aspect of his appeal.
The appellants’ appeal on quantum
153      This leaves us to deal with the appeals of TV Media and Semon as to the quantum of damages awarded to Andrea.
Apportionment of blame
154      The judge decreed that liability between Health Biz, Semon and TV Media should be on a joint and several basis. TV Media challenged this, arguing that Semon’s degree of blameworthiness was very much higher than TV Media’s blameworthiness. It canvassed the same litany of arguments discussed in an earlier part of this judgment to argue that Semon’s act of selling and distributing the “pirated” pills was a direct causative act of Andrea’s liver injury, in contrast to TV Media’s acts of advertising and retailing the pills.
155      The law as to the apportionment of damages between joint tortfeasors is laid out in 
Dingle v Associated Newspapers
 
Ltd
 
[1961] 2 QB 162
, which was adopted by us in 
Chuang Uming (Pte) Ltd v Setron Ltd
 
[2000] 1 SLR 166
. The English Court of Appeal held at 188–189:
Where injury has been done to the plaintiff and the injury is indivisible, any tortfeasor whose act has been a proximate cause of the injury must compensate 
for the whole of it
. As between the plaintiff and the defendant it is immaterial that there are others whose acts also have been a cause of the injury and it does not matter whether those others have or have not a good defence. These factors would be relevant in a claim between tortfeasors for contribution, but the plaintiff is not concerned with that; he can obtain judgment for total compensation from anyone whose act has been a cause of his injury. [emphasis added]
156      We also find it useful to refer to the case of 
Wong Jin Fah v L & M Prestressing Pte Ltd
 
[2001] 4 SLR 529
, where the judge held at [92]:
… [The] defendants were each a proximate cause of the injury inflicted on the plaintiff. Although they were not acting in concert when the accident happened, their contemporaneous acts of omission caused the indivisible damage to the plaintiff. The defendants left it to the others to take the necessary precautions and, cumulatively, they did nothing at all. Each turned a blind eye to safe working practices and relied on the others. Their faults and breaches indisputably overlapped such that each of them must be held liable to the plaintiff for the whole damage.
157      The situation in 
Wong Jin Fah
 is akin to that presently before us. TV Media left it to others to take the necessary precautions. In the event, proper records of the consignments of pills being imported were not kept, and proper batch tests were never conducted. Given its position of responsibility as the promoter and seller of Slim 10, TV Media cannot now plead ignorance to escape liability. TV Media’s actions are clearly a proximate cause of Andrea’s damage and it is therefore liable for the whole of that damage.
158      TV Media also contended that Andrea’s own failure to stop consuming the pills in spite of side effects was a proximate intervening act, which carried a greater degree of blameworthiness than TV Media’s acts. We have dealt with this argument earlier in this judgment and need only repeat that it is wholly unmeritorious.
159      An appellate court is only justified in interfering with a trial judge’s apportionment of damages in “very exceptional circumstances”: 
The Macgregor
 
[1943] AC 197
 at 201; 
Ramoo v Gan Soo Swee
 
[1969–1971] SLR 34
 at 41, [15]. We do not find that the circumstances warrant an interference with the judge’s decision.
Quantum of damages awarded
160      The judge awarded Andrea $250,000 in general damages and gave her a multiplier of 34 for her medical expenses. Semon aligned himself with TV Media’s arguments regarding the quantum of damages awarded to Andrea. Both appellants raised three issues in this respect. We will assess them in turn.
That the judge erred in awarding Andrea $250,000 in general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities
161      In reaching his award of $250,000 for Andrea’s general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities, the judge did not refer to any case law since there is no comparable local precedent for liver transplant cases. Instead, he took into account a range of factors spanning both Andrea’s past and present sufferings.
162      With regard to her past sufferings, the judge noted that Andrea had been hospitalised for 36 days; had undergone numerous blood tests, a liver biopsy and a liver transplant; and had suffered from lethargy, jaundice, hallucinations and bouts of vomiting. The judge also considered Andrea’s future sufferings as detailed by the expert witnesses. Amongst these are a restriction of her physical activities and food preferences; a nagging fear of liver failure or that her weakened body will succumb to disease; risks to her and her foetus if she becomes pregnant; an increased risk of renal failure and skin cancer so that she will have to cover up when she goes out under the sun, thus affecting her social and working life; the fact that visits to hospital are now a way of life for her and that she must remain on immuno-suppressant medication for the rest of her life; and the fact that she is now uninsurable. In light of this “horrific list” of injuries, the judge considered an award of $250,000 to be appropriate.
163      Before us, the appellants contended for an award of $35,000 to be made to Andrea for her pain and suffering and loss of amenities, arguing that the award of $250,000 was too high.
164      At the outset, it is pertinent for us to note that an appellate court will only interfere with an award of damages when it is convinced either that the trial judge acted upon some wrong principle of law or that the amount awarded is so manifestly high or low as to have been a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage: 
Peh Diana v Tan Miang Lee
 
[1991] SLR 341
 at 345, [17].
165      In passing, we also note that the general purpose of damages in personal injuries cases is to compensate the victim and not to punish the tortfeasor for his actions: 
Livingstone v The Raywards Coal Co
 
(1880) 5 App Cas 25
 at 39. We see no reason to depart from this principle in the present case. We now turn to the arguments laid before us by counsel.
166      As a preliminary point, the appellants argued that the judge was wrong in taking Andrea’s past sufferings into account when assessing general damages for pain and suffering. This argument is misconceived. Damages in respect of pain and suffering are awarded for both future pain and suffering as well as for what has already been endured: 
Birkett v Hayes
 
[1982] 1 WLR 816
.
167      The appellants next asserted that Andrea’s pain and suffering were not severe enough to warrant damages of $250,000. First, they argued that, based on Dr Wendon’s testimony, Andrea’s quality of life is still excellent. Second, they contended that the award of $250,000 was too high because even quadriplegics have not been awarded general damages near that amount. Third, they cited several personal injury cases to buttress their argument that $35,000 is an adequate award of damages for Andrea. We will deal with these three arguments in turn.
168      First, Dr Wendon testified that Andrea can carry out reasonable cardiovascular activities like walking and light jogging. In her experience, Andrea can hope for a “good quality of life”. However, she will require long-term follow-up treatment and will not get back her “normal quality of life”. Dr Wendon agreed that Andrea will be at higher risk of infection than the general population, but noted that the period carrying the highest risk has already passed without incident. Andrea may give birth so long as her pregnancy is closely monitored, although Dr Wendon acknowledged that there are cases of smaller babies and abnormal foetuses where their mothers have hypertension in later stages of the pregnancy and or on immuno-suppressants, as is Andrea.
169      On the basis of this evidence, the appellants contended that Andrea’s disabilities are only a restriction in her food intake, a stipulation against travel to destinations where there is a higher probability of infection, tiredness at times, pregnancy risks, and the possibility of another transplant in future. We think that this understates Andrea’s disabilities somewhat. Andrea is not only at risk of infection when she travels but also in Singapore, since her immune system has been weakened by the immuno-suppressants which she has to take. Moreover, she is at higher risk of renal failure and skin cancer, which will affect both her quality of life as well as the scope of work she can undertake as an actress.
170      Second, the appellants cited several cases of awards made to quadriplegics in order to buttress their claim that the award of $250,000 for Andrea was too high. In return, Andrea countered that the comparison with damages awarded to quadriplegics was inaccurate, since the sufferings of quadriplegics differed vastly from what she had suffered and would continue to suffer.
171      We find ourselves in agreement with the appellants on this point. Admittedly, the sufferings of liver transplant patients and quadriplegics cannot be quantified or measured “apple to apple”. Nevertheless, this is not to say that a comparison between their sufferings is inappropriate. To our minds, a strong case can be made that the travails of quadriplegics exceed those of liver transplant patients. Whilst the latter can still exercise control over their own bodies, quadriplegics cannot walk on their own and need assistance in the most fundamental tasks of feeding, bathing themselves or using the toilet. They are susceptible to a multitude of illnesses which may strike at any time. Their opportunities of travel or pregnancy are even more limited than those of liver transplant patients. We therefore think it pertinent to compare Andrea’s award of damages with those awarded to quadriplegics.
172      We considered a number of cases in this regard but will confine ourselves to mentioning just four in this judgment. In the first, 
Toon Chee Meng Eddie v Yeap Chin Hon
 
[1993] 2 SLR 536
, a seven-year-old boy was awarded $160,000 in general damages after a road accident left him with irreparable brain damage, paralysis on the right side and a very slim chance of being able to speak again.
173      In the second case, 
Gunapathy Muniandy v Dr James Khoo
 
[2001] SGHC 165
, the judge awarded the plaintiff $100,000 in general damages, describing her condition as follows, at [23.12]:
The result of the radiation damage done to her brain was immense and intolerable agony for Gunapathy. Now, when she walks she walks with a grotesque gait. So she avoids walking. She uses a wheelchair with the help of a maid. Her own hands cannot even push it. The few words she utters she utters as though she was born with a birth defect like cerebral palsy. She is not even half the lively person that everyone said she was before the radiosurgery. She is crippled by severe dysphasia and right-sided severe hemiparesis … She needs to be permanently cared for because her deficits are permanent. Emotionally she is insecure in the extreme.
174      Although we later overturned this decision on the basis that the defendants had not been negligent and therefore had no cause to decide the issue of quantum of damages (see 
Dr Khoo James v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy
 
[2002] 2 SLR 414
), we find the amount awarded by the High Court to be a useful reference point for present purposes.
175      In the third case, 
Lim Yee Ming v Ubin Lagoon Resort Pte Ltd
 
[2003] SGHC 134
, the judge awarded the 26-year-old plaintiff $130,000 in damages for pain and suffering. Like Andrea, the plaintiff in that case remained mentally active and alert after the accident. Unlike Andrea, however, she suffered paralysis to her lower limbs, loss of sexual function, bladder and bowel dysfunction.
176      Finally, we noted the case of 
Chen Qingrui v Phua Geok Leng
 
[2001] SGHC 64
, where the plaintiff was awarded $206,000 in general damages by the assistant registrar. However, the injuries she sustained were far worse than those suffered by Andrea, as the accident left her blind, bound to a wheelchair and unable to speak.
177      We are of the opinion that the afflictions of the plaintiffs in these cases are at least comparable to, if not far worse, than Andrea’s. As such, we find that the award of $250,000 in damages to Andrea is manifestly high and should be adjusted accordingly.
178      This brings us to the appellants’ third argument under this heading, that $35,000 is an appropriate award of general damages for Andrea. To buttress this proposal, they referred us to several cases involving injuries such as contusion, lacerations to the liver and loss of one kidney. As we find this argument entirely lacking in merit, we will not attempt to set out a detailed analysis of the cases. We fail to see how the sufferings accompanying lacerations of the liver or colon are on par with the travails of liver transplant patients. For one, it does not appear that any of the plaintiffs in the cases cited by the appellants suffered any debilitating long-term effects from their injuries, whereas Andrea does face a host of problems, including increased susceptibility to illness and the risk of liver failure. We do not hesitate to find that these cases are not of much assistance to the appellants in this appeal, and that the sum of $35,000 is manifestly too low in the circumstances.
179      Andrea brought our attention to the United Kingdom case of 
A v National Blood Authority
 [2001] 3 All ER 289; 60 BMLR 1 at [279], where the plaintiff, a 56-year-old lady, suffered from cirrhosis of the liver and underwent a liver transplant operation. She was awarded £45,000, roughly $124,313 at the time of trial. In our view, a plethora of reasons mandate against the comparison of awards given in
 Singapore 
and foreign countries in this manner and, indeed, Andrea did not refer us to any local cases which have followed awards given by foreign courts.
180      We found the case of 
Tan Hun Hoe v Harte Denis Mathew
 
[2001] 4 SLR 317
 more helpful in assessing what an appropriate quantum of damages was. The plaintiff in this case was already infertile to a fair extent before he underwent surgery, but became totally infertile after a botched operation. He had to undergo hormone replacement therapy which increased his risk of liver cancer. The trial judge awarded him $50,000 in general damages. We increased this award to $120,000 and observed that if Mr Harte had been a “normal fertile man” before the accident, we would have awarded him a higher sum. Like Mr Harte, Andrea has more or less had to give up the prospect of parenthood, but in contrast to him, she was a perfectly healthy individual before she took Slim 10. Whilst Mr Harte was at increased risk of liver cancer, Andrea is now at risk of cancer, osteoporosis, hypertension and diabetes.
181      After a careful evaluation of the case law, we conclude that an appropriate quantum of general damages for Andrea’s pain and suffering and loss of amenities is the sum of $150,000.
That the judge erred in providing a multiplier of 34 years
182      The judge provided for a multiplier of 34 years in relation to Andrea’s medical expenses. The average life expectancy for females in Singapore is 80 years. Since Andrea was 29 years old at the time of trial, she argued for a multiplier of 51 (that is, 80 minus 29). The judge decided that, bearing in mind the contingencies of life, a fair multiplier would be two-thirds of the expected 51 years of life, that is, 34 years.
183      The appellants challenged this and asked that a multiplier of 18 years be awarded. They referred us to several High Court cases in which similar multipliers were given. The first of these is a case which we have referred to earlier in this judgment, 
Lim Yee Ming v Ubin Lagoon Resort Pte Ltd,
 [175] 
supra.
 The judge provided for a multiplier of 15 years for the 26-year-old plaintiff. In the second case, 
Ng Song Leng v Soh Kim Seng Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd
 
[1997] SGHC 289
, the judge awarded the 29-year-old plaintiff a multiplier of 17 years. In yet another case, 
Teo Seng Kiat v Goh Hwa Teck
 
[2003] 1 SLR 333
, the judge determined that a multiplier of 18 years was appropriate for the plaintiff, who was 28 years old at the time of the accident. We also had regard to the case of 
Chen Qingrui v Phua Geok Leng
, [176] 
supra
, wherein the female plaintiff aged 18 years was awarded a multiplier of 18 years for nursing care.
184      We have not come across a case where a multiplier as high as 34 has been awarded, and Andrea was not able to cite us even one instance of such a case. She attempted to argue that this present case presents a unique factual matrix, thus justifying the award of a particularly high multiplier. We are not in the least convinced by this argument since the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs in the cases mentioned above are, at the very least, comparable to Andrea’s.
185      Considering that Andrea was 27 years old when her liver failed, and that the plaintiffs in the cases we have just detailed were also in the same age range, we think that a multiplier of 17 years is more appropriate and order accordingly.
That the judge failed to deduct the sum of $135,565.87 from Andrea’s award
186      We can deal briefly with this point. The judge found that Andrea was entitled to claim the sum of $135,565.87, which was paid by her insurers, NTUC Income, towards her hospitalisation costs and expenses. The appellants contested this. They argued that since NTUC Income paid out the sum voluntarily without any policy liability, they cannot now recover this amount from Andrea. The judge should therefore have deducted this sum from the total expenses incurred by Andrea, so as to avoid her recovering the sum twice.
187      This argument does not take the appellants anywhere. The documentation before us indicates that although NTUC Income paid out the money under Andrea’s insurance scheme, Andrea has to reimburse this sum to NTUC Income under the insurance policy co-payment scheme. MediaCorp stated that it had assisted Andrea by giving her an interest-free loan of this amount, but that Andrea would have to repay the loan.
188      As such, this sum of $135,565.87 forms part of Andrea’s expenses, which she is entitled to claim for. This ground of appeal is wholly unmeritorious.
Conclusion
189      For the reasons we have canvassed, we deem it fit to dismiss both appeals against liability but to allow the appeals against quantum. Andrea’s award of general damages is to be reduced to $150,000 and a multiplier of 17 years shall be given for her medical expenses.
190      It remains for us to deal with the question of costs. We note that while we have allowed the appeals in part, both appellants have only succeeded on the question of quantum and not on the larger issue of liability. We further note that although Semon raised the issue of his personal liability, an argument not advanced by TV Media, TV Media also put forward arguments which were not issues in Semon’s appeal. As such, taking into account the appellants’ success on quantum, we order that Andrea shall have 60% of the costs of the appeals. The security deposits are to be released to Andrea’s solicitors to account of her costs.
Appeals against liability dismissed. Appeals against quantum allowed.",2004-07-08 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant was convicted on four charges of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”), two charges of using criminal force under s 352 of the PC and one charge of criminal intimidation under the second limb of s 506 of the PC. All seven charges related to a single incident of maid abuse, and the appellant was sentenced to a total of three months and two weeks’ imprisonment. She appealed against both conviction and sentence. I dismissed both appeals and I now give my reasons.
Facts
2          The appellant is a 30-year-old tuition teacher who lives at Block 392 Tampines Ave 7 #10-235 (“the flat”) with her husband, Ng Sen Ho (“the appellant’s husband”) and her two young children. In April 2002, the appellant approached Arrow Employment Agency (“the agency”) to request for a Filipino maid. The agency informed her that one Jean Ganzon (“Jean”) was available, as she was a transfer maid who had recently been rejected by her previous employers. The appellant selected Jean after an interview and Jean joined the household soon after.
3          The appellant’s relationship with Jean was difficult. She sent Jean to the agency for counselling at least twice as she was dissatisfied with Jean’s attitude and alleged propensity to lie. During these sessions, Jean told the staff at the agency that the appellant scolded her regularly. Jean also claimed that the appellant had hit her arm and pushed her sometime in June 2002, causing her to fall. 
4          The seven charges before me stemmed from a single incident on 13 July 2002, some three months after Jean started working for the appellant.
The Prosecution’s case
5          The Prosecution relied primarily on Jean’s testimony. At about 2.00pm on 13 July 2002, Jean was ironing clothes in the flat when the appellant suddenly entered the room and scolded her for leaving the window open. When Jean tried to explain, the appellant grew more agitated. Jean then informed her that she wanted to go to the agency to request a change in employer. When the appellant heard this, she demanded that Jean pack her belongings immediately. Before Jean could finish packing, the appellant pushed her out of the flat and told her to go to the agency. 
6          Jean first went to the flat of the appellant’s mother, Ng Ah Hong (“Mdm Ng”), to inform her that she was leaving. Jean was familiar with Mdm Ng as the latter visited the appellant’s flat every day to help look after the appellant’s young daughter. The appellant’s second child had not been born at this time.
7          After visiting Mdm Ng, Jean proceeded to the agency where she spoke to two staff members, one of whom was Michelle Chin Mee Chuen (“Michelle”). Jean explained that she was frightened of the appellant and did not want to continue working for her. However, Michelle informed Jean that she could not get another transfer, as she had not finished paying her agency fees and was already a transfer maid. She warned Jean that she could be repatriated if a new employer could not be found. Jean was advised to return to the appellant’s flat, which she eventually did at about 4.00pm. 
8          In the corridor outside the flat, Jean met the appellant’s husband who was leaving the flat with his daughter after having returned from work. Jean approached the door of the flat and rang the doorbell. When the appellant opened the door and saw Jean, she immediately grabbed her shirt and pulled her into the flat. After closing the door, she pushed Jean, who fell onto a concrete shoe rack and injured her right elbow. The appellant ordered Jean to get up. As Jean obeyed, she grabbed Jean by the shirt and brought her to the maid’s room. She pushed Jean again, causing Jean to hit her head against the wall. When Jean tried to protect her head, the appellant grabbed her shoulders and hit her head against the wall three more times. 
9          After this, the appellant pulled Jean to the kitchen toilet and pushed her in. Jean fell and hit her jaw against a pail. As she got up, the appellant scooped water from a pail and poured it over her. The appellant took some ice cubes from the refrigerator and placed them in Jean’s bra and short pants. She also put some ice cubes in Jean’s hands and ordered her to eat them. Frightened, Jean did as she was told. The appellant then brought a fan from another room and switched it on, directing it at Jean and causing her to feel cold and shiver.
10        Sometime after, the appellant told Jean to change her clothes. However, she refused to allow Jean to change out of her wet underwear. After Jean had changed, the appellant brought her to the living room and demanded that she kneel before her. While Jean was kneeling, the appellant scolded her and kicked her on her right thigh, causing her to fall over. When Jean resumed her kneeling position, the appellant kicked her again, this time on her left thigh.
11        Finally, after scolding Jean further, the appellant ordered her to stand up. She told Jean, “I am not scared to kill you. I can afford to pay you.” She then instructed Jean to clean the flat and prepare to accompany the family out to dinner. The entire household later left for dinner at a restaurant in Tampines Mall. Although Jean was not restrained at the mall, she did not run away as she was holding a bag belonging to the appellant and did not want to be accused of theft.
12        The next afternoon, while the family was asleep, Jean ran away to the Embassy of the Phillipines. On the advice of the officers there, she made a police report. She was also sent for a medical examination at Alexandra Hospital. As a result, the appellant was charged with four counts of voluntarily causing hurt, two counts of using criminal force and one count of criminal intimidation. Two of the four original charges of voluntarily causing hurt (District Arrest Cases Nos 26175 and 26176 of 2003) concerned the earlier incident in June 2002, when the appellant allegedly hit Jean’s arm and pushed her. On the first day of trial, these two charges were stood down, and two fresh charges of voluntarily causing hurt (District Arrest Cases Nos 26181A and 26181B of 2003) relating to the events of 13 July 2002, were preferred.
13        The trial against the appellant therefore proceeded on the following seven charges, all of which pertained to the incident on 13 July 2002:
(a)        voluntarily causing hurt to Jean by pushing her and causing her to hit her head against the wall (District Arrest Case No 26177 of 2003);
(b)        using criminal force on Jean by pouring water on her and making her stand in front of a fan (District Arrest Case No 26178 of 2003); 
(c)        using criminal force on Jean by placing ice cubes inside her bra and short pants (District Arrest Case No 26179 of 2003);
(d)        voluntarily causing hurt to Jean by kicking her (District Arrest Case No 26180 of 2003);
(e)        committing criminal intimidation on Jean by saying she was not afraid to kill Jean, which was a threat to cause death (District Arrest Case No 26181 of 2003);
(f)         voluntarily causing hurt to Jean by pushing her and causing her to fall and injure her elbow (DAC 26181A/2003); and
(g)        voluntarily causing hurt to Jean by pushing her and causing her to fall on a pail (DAC 26181B/2003).
14        Jean also filed a civil suit against the appellant.
The defence
15        The appellant denied all of Jean’s allegations. According to her, on the afternoon of 13 July 2002, she had spoken to Jean “in a normal tone” about the work that had to be done around the house. Jean then said she wanted a change of employer since the appellant was not happy with her. The appellant told Jean she could pack her bags and go straight to the agency to inform them. She maintained that she did not shout at Jean or push her out of the flat. Jean walked out on her own.
16        After Jean left, the appellant called Michelle at the agency to help counsel Jean. She also called her mother, Mdm Ng. During this conversation, Jean appeared at Mdm Ng’s flat and said “Mum don’t want me”. The appellant told Mdm Ng not to say anything more, as she had already told Jean to go to the agency. Later in the day, at about 4.00pm, Michelle called the appellant and told her that Jean had gone to the agency to tell them that the appellant wanted a new maid. However, after counselling, Jean had been advised to return to the flat. Michelle had also warned Jean that she might be repatriated and forced into prostitution to repay her outstanding agency fees.
17        After the phone call, the appellant’s daughter woke up and began crying. The appellant’s husband returned home at around the same time and brought the child out of the flat to pacify her. Just after they left, Jean returned home and the appellant let her in. As she entered her room and began to unpack, the appellant asked her why she had told Mdm Ng and Michelle that the appellant wanted a new maid, when in fact it was Jean herself who wanted a new employer. Jean refused to reply. The appellant then gave her a “light push” to elicit a response. Jean lost her balance and fell on the floor. After she fell, Jean deliberately struck her head against the wall.
18        Stunned by the turn of events, the appellant went to the living room and started to cry. Jean then came to the appellant and knelt on the floor to apologise, and hugged the appellant to console her. The appellant said everything was all right and told Jean to continue with the household chores. At about 5.00pm, the appellant’s husband returned with their daughter and the whole family left with Jean for dinner.
19        After the incident, the appellant decided to look for a new maid. She fixed an appointment with a maid agent at 10.00am the very next day. On the morning of 14 July 2002, she woke up at 7.00am to prepare for the appointment. She also used her computer to browse the webpage of an employment agency that supplied Filipino maids. At this time, Jean was moving around the flat and could have seen what the appellant was doing. When the agent called the appellant at 9.30am, Jean could also have heard the details of their conversation. The appellant left the flat to meet the agent and also went to Jean’s agency to look at other maids. By the time she returned to the flat, Jean was gone. The appellant speculated that Jean had run away because she realised that the appellant was going to replace her.
The decision below
20        The district judge recognised that he had to be extremely cautious in convicting the appellant based solely on Jean’s allegations: 
Kwan Peng Hong v PP
 
[2000] 4 SLR 96
. After scrutinising the evidence in exhaustive detail, he concluded that Jean had been earnest and forthright in her testimony. While there were certain inconsistencies in her evidence, they were minor and inconsequential in nature. It was the broad facts, and not the little details, that mattered: 
PP v Gan Lim Soon
 
[1993] 3 SLR 261
.
21        In contrast, he found the appellant to be a guarded and manipulative witness who was not above tailoring and slanting her testimony to suit her case. She painted a rosy picture of her relationship with Jean that was incongruous with the rest of the evidence, while her own defence was riddled with material inconsistencies. The evidence of the appellant’s husband was also discounted, as he appeared to be testifying pursuant to an agenda.
22        After carefully evaluating the totality of the evidence, the district judge concluded that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Besides the veracity of Jean’s evidence, the Prosecution’s case was also corroborated by the objective medical evidence. Dr Tan Ken Leon of Alexandra Hospital examined Jean on the night of 14 July 2002 and communicated with her through a Filipino nurse, who acted as the interpreter. Dr Tan found the following injuries on Jean:
(a)        a 3cm haematoma at the occiput, consistent with Jean’s head being hit against a hard object such as a wall;
(b)        0.5cm bruises on both knees, likely to be caused by kicks and not by kneeling; and
(c)        a 3cm linear abrasion on the elbow.
23        Turning to the issue of sentencing, the district judge considered in mitigation the fact that Jean’s injuries were relatively minor, and the abuse appeared to be a “one-off incident”. However, there were also aggravating factors that clearly justified the imposition of a custodial sentence in this case. The appellant’s assault on Jean was wicked and persistent, resulting in no less than seven different offences being committed. After considering the relevant benchmark sentences for the various offences, and taking into account the circumstances of the case, the district judge sentenced the appellant to:
(a)        one week’s imprisonment on each of the four charges of voluntarily causing hurt (DACs 26177, 26180, 26181A and 26181B/2003);
(b)        one week’s imprisonment on each of the two charges of using criminal force (DACs 26178 and 26179/2003); and
(c)        three months’ imprisonment on the charge of criminal intimidation (DAC 26181/2003).
24        The sentences in DACs 26177, 26180 and 26181/2003 were ordered to run consecutively, bringing the appellant’s total sentence to three months and two weeks’ imprisonment.
The appeal
25        The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence.
Appeal against conviction
26        The appellant’s grounds of appeal centred entirely on the district judge’s findings of fact. Essentially, she contended that the district judge had erred in:
(a)        accepting the evidence of Jean;
(b)        rejecting the evidence of the appellant; and
(c)        failing to give sufficient weight to the evidence of the appellant’s husband and Mdm Ng.
27        It is trite law that an appellate court would be slow to overturn a trial judge’s findings of fact, having not had the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
; 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
. I found this principle to be especially significant in this appeal, as I was presented with directly contradictory versions of the events from the two main interested parties. As the final decision necessarily rested on the acceptance of one account over the other, I gave due regard to the fact that the district judge had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses in court when he assessed the credibility of their evidence. Given the circumstances, the appellant obviously faced an uphill task in convincing me that the district judge’s findings should be set aside. With these considerations in mind, I turned to evaluate each of the appellant’s grounds of appeal. 
Jean’s evidence
28        Counsel for the appellant pointed to a number of alleged improbabilities in Jean’s testimony. First, her inability to recall the actual duration of her ordeal at the hands of the appellant. I did not find this to be persuasive. It was perfectly reasonable for a victim undergoing such abuse not to be conscious of the time. As for Jean’s failure to run away in Tampines Mall on the evening of 13 July 2002, it would be unfair to speculate now, with the benefit of hindsight, what Jean should have done in that situation. Given her state of mind at that time, her explanation that she was afraid of being accused of theft was perfectly plausible.
29        Many of the appellant’s arguments against Jean also challenged the most minute of details, such as whether Jean’s shirt should have been torn if the appellant had pulled her into the bathroom, and whether the appellant could have knocked the ice out of the ice tray and separated them into cubes before placing them in Jean’s underwear and forcing her to eat them. While the appellant obviously wished to undermine the credibility of Jean’s evidence in any way she could, this line of argument bordered on the absurd. For the parties to debate over every single point that could ostensibly be challenged would do nothing more than waste valuable court time and effort. As the district judge had rightly noted, it was the material issues, and not the minor details, that were crucial. To succeed before me, the appellant had to raise significant questions to discredit Jean’s otherwise compelling evidence.
30        There were undoubtedly a number of discrepancies between Jean’s testimony in court, her police report and the statement of claim in her civil suit. However, they again concerned minor points such as whether Jean was pushed from the front or behind at the shoe rack and whether she had been pushed to the floor when she tried to stand up during the kneeling incident. While these discrepancies did involve part of the sequence of abuse, I found that it would be unreasonable to expect Jean to recall every single detail accurately. The district judge was perfectly entitled to disregard these minor inconsistencies, which did not detract from the value of the rest of Jean’s testimony: 
Chean
 
Siong Guat v PP
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
; 
PP v Kalpanath Singh
 
[1995] 3 SLR 564
. After all, the court is entitled, for good and cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and to reject the other: 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 15
; 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
.
31        In any case, neither the police report nor the statement of claim was required to contain elaborate details of the abuse. The police report is simply meant to provide information of a cognisable offence to the police, so as to set the investigation in motion. The form of the report merely requires “brief details including date, time and place at which the offence occurred”. It clearly does not contemplate elaborate details of the alleged offence nor the reproduction of the Prosecution’s entire case: 
Tan Pin Seng v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 418
. Similarly, under O 18 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev Ed), the statement of claim in a civil action should only contain a brief statement in summary form, of the material facts of the claim. Since Jean was only required to provide a succinct outline of the events in these two documents, omissions and minor discrepancies were only natural. Most importantly, the police report and statement of claim actually substantiated her testimony in court in the most material particulars. The main aspects of the abuse and the sequence of events were broadly similar in all of Jean’s accounts.
32        When it came down to the important details, Jean’s testimony never wavered. In the circumstances, the district judge’s finding that Jean was a truthful and credible witness was clearly borne out by the evidence. Although there were opportunities for Jean to embellish her evidence to further incriminate the appellant, she maintained with conviction the same account of events she had given throughout. For example, she could have alleged that the appellant had often physically abused her. Instead, she honestly insisted that the incident was an isolated occurrence.
33        The injuries that Jean claimed to have suffered were also largely corroborated by Dr Tan’s findings of injuries to her knees and the back of her head. There were admittedly some portions of Jean’s evidence that were missing from Dr Tan’s medical report. In particular, there was no mention that Jean had hit her jaw after being pushed by the appellant, or that ice cubes were placed in her underwear. Instead, according to Dr Tan’s report, Jean had told him that the appellant slapped her, an allegation that was never made in Jean’s testimony.
34        Although these were valid points, I noted that Dr Tan had conducted his examination without the assistance of a trained interpreter. In court, Dr Tan agreed that his record of Jean’s allegations was only as accurate as the nurse’s translation, and he did not rule out the possibility that Jean’s complaint of hitting her jaw could have been mistakenly translated as a slap on the face. Bearing in mind the constraints faced by Dr Tan, and the skeletal contents of his report, I was of the view that these apparent inconsistencies did not detract from the overall credibility of Jean’s evidence.
The appellant’s defence
35        The appellant’s evidence was, on the other hand, simply too far-fetched to be believed. When asked about her relationship with Jean prior to 13 July 2002, the appellant claimed that everything was going well and she even treated Jean like a younger sister. Even on the afternoon of 13 July 2002, the appellant insisted that she was not angry, only “a little unhappy”. This flies in the face of the rest of the evidence. Michelle from the agency testified that the appellant had sent Jean for counselling at least twice, and both times Jean requested for a change in employer because of the appellant’s regular scoldings. Her claim that she was not angry with Jean on 13 July 2002 is also contradicted by her own police statement, in which she clearly admits to being “angry” and even “furious” with Jean. The picture of domestic bliss painted by the appellant was contrived to say the least.
36        The appellant’s version of events was also inherently incredible. I could not accept that Jean would deliberately hit her own head so hard against the wall that it would cause the haematoma found by Dr Tan. Moreover, the appellant’s suggestion that it was all part of Jean’s elaborate ploy to frame her simply did not correspond with the rest of her evidence. The appellant claimed that Jean had been happy to continue working for her and had only decided to run away on the morning of 14 July 2002, after discovering that the appellant was looking for a new maid. It made no sense for Jean to deliberately injure herself on 13 July 2002 to frame the appellant if she only decided to leave the appellant’s employment the next day.
37        Further, the appellant’s claim that Jean’s injury was deliberately self‑inflicted was obviously crucial to her defence. Yet, there was no mention of this anywhere in the appellant’s police statement. When confronted with this glaring discrepancy, the appellant tried to shift the blame onto Inspector Johnny Chiang (“Insp Chiang”) who recorded the statement. She admitted that her statement was given voluntarily, without any threat, inducement or promise. However, she claimed that the discrepancies were a result of Insp Chiang’s bias against her. Yet, the appellant could offer no reason to explain Insp Chiang’s alleged prejudice against her.
38        The contents of her police statement also indicated that it was fairly and accurately recorded. Although there were portions of the statement which were incriminating when compared with her testimony in court, much of it was also exculpatory. The appellant was given ample opportunity to read through the statement and make any amendments she wished. Although she chose to give her evidence in court with the aid of a Mandarin interpreter, she was a tuition teacher who taught English, among other subjects. She was clearly aware of the accusations she was facing, and also capable of reading and understanding the implications of her statement. I found it inconceivable that she would have signed the statement if it did indeed omit to mention a critical fact to her defence.
The evidence of the appellant’s husband and Mdm Ng
39        The appellant also urged me to place greater weight on the evidence of her husband as well as her mother, Mdm Ng. With regard to the appellant’s husband, I found it obvious that he was tailoring his evidence to protect his wife. Whenever he was questioned on issues that could possibly incriminate her, such as whether she had told him that she had assaulted Jean, he professed either indifference or forgetfulness. Yet, his memory became remarkably clear when it came to other aspects of his testimony that supported the appellant’s version of events.
40        Moreover, his testimony in court contained several material discrepancies from his police statement. He also attributed these to the fault of Insp Chiang. I found that his allegations against Insp Chiang were, like the appellant’s, completely unsubstantiated. He must have known that his statement would be used by the police in their investigation of his wife for maid abuse. Given the gravity of the situation, I could not accept that he would have signed the statement if it did not accurately reflect what he told Insp Chiang. 
41        In so far as Mdm Ng’s evidence was concerned, it was simply irrelevant to the charges against the appellant. All Mdm Ng could say was that Jean had gone to her flat to inform her that the appellant no longer wanted to keep her as a maid. She was never in a position to provide any further evidence on the alleged abuse and she certainly could not substantiate the appellant’s defence in any material way.
Conclusion
42        In the circumstances, I found that there was no merit whatsoever in the appeal against conviction. Jean’s evidence of the abuse was clear and consistent in the most material particulars, while the appellant’s defence was woefully unconvincing.
Appeal against sentence
43        Having found that the appellant was correctly convicted of the charges, I turned to examine the appeal against the sentence imposed by the district judge. The appellant’s main submission before me amounted to a bare statement that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
44        The district judge had held that the only real mitigating factors here were Jean’s relatively minor injuries and the lack of any established pattern of abuse. Relying on my decision in 
Chen Weixiong Jerriek v PP
 
[2003] 2 SLR 334
 (“
Chen Weixiong
”), he reasoned that the appellant’s lack of antecedents could not be considered a mitigating factor as she was convicted of no less than seven offences.
45        In 
Chen Weixiong
, I had refused to consider the accused’s lack of prior convictions as a serious mitigating factor as he was convicted of seven different charges of robbery and voluntarily causing hurt. However, the facts in 
Chen Weixiong
 are materially different from those in the present appeal. In 
Chen Weixiong
, the seven offences committed by the accused took place over several days. No less than 38 other charges were also taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing which indicated that the only reason the appellant had no prior convictions was because the law had not yet caught up with him for his past misdeeds. In the present case, all seven charges against the appellant related to a single incident and there were no other charges taken into consideration. The exceptional aggravating circumstances in 
Chen Weixiong
 were clearly not present and I found that the district judge ought to have considered the appellant’s lack of antecedents as an additional mitigating factor.
46        This did not necessarily mean that the appeal against sentence would succeed as a matter of course. The mitigating factors had to be balanced against the aggravating factors. Our courts have consistently taken a harsh stand on cases of maid abuse. I observed in 
PP v Chong Siew Chin
 
[2002] 1 SLR 117
 at [40] and [43]:
[M]aids require additional protection because of their special circumstances. …
…
Maid abuse usually takes place in the privacy of the home where offences are hard to detect. … [A] deterrent sentence should be imposed to arrest the rising trend of such offences. In addition, I noted that such disgraceful conduct lowers Singapore’s international reputation and damages bilateral relations with neighbouring countries.  
47        A maid’s abased social status does not mean that she is any less of a human being and any less protected by the law: 
Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP
 
[2001] 4 SLR 610
. It is certainly not a licence for employers to vent their frustration and anger on her: 
Ho Yean Theng Jill v PP
 
[2004] 1 SLR 254
. Taken together, the appellant’s offences constituted a protracted and persistent sequence of cruel abuse. Not only did the appellant inflict physical injuries on Jean, she also subjected her to humiliating and degrading punishment. A custodial sentence was clearly warranted on the facts.
48        The sentencing norm for similar cases involving maid abuse where no serious physical injury was caused, is one to six weeks’ imprisonment. In 
PP v Chong Siew Chin
 (
supra
 at [46]), the accused was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment for each of the three charges of voluntarily causing hurt for slapping her maid three times. In 
PP v Faridah bte Abdul Fatah
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 225 of 2000 (unreported), the accused was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment for placing clothes pegs on her maid’s ears and pulling them off one by one. In 
Ng Chai Imm Evelyn v PP
 
[2001] SGMC 37
, the accused pleaded guilty to two charges of kicking her maid’s buttocks and grabbing her neck and pushing her. The accused was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment and three weeks’ imprisonment on each of the charges respectively.
49        In light of these cases, the appellant could hardly argue that her sentence of one week’s imprisonment on the charges of voluntarily causing hurt and using criminal force were manifestly excessive. In fact, her sentence fell at the lowest end of the sentencing range. Nonetheless, I chose not to disturb the sentence on these charges since the district judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the appellant’s lack of antecedents as a mitigating factor.
50        As for the remaining charge of criminal intimidation, the appellant had made a threat to cause death, which fell under the second limb of s 506 of the PC. The maximum punishment is seven years’ imprisonment or a fine or both. The district judge had sentenced the appellant to three months’ imprisonment, following my decision in 
Woon Salvacion Dalayon v PP
 
[2003] 1 SLR 129
. The facts of the case were broadly similar to those in the present appeal. In that case, the accused was convicted of threatening to kill three maids who were recruited by her employment agency, and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. I lowered this sentence to three months’ imprisonment after taking into account the fact that the threat was made in a fit of anger, no weapons were used and the victims were not put in immediate fear of their lives. The same considerations applied to the appellant’s threat here.
51        No doubt, the accused in 
Woon Salvacion
 had threatened three victims, whereas in the present appeal the appellant had directed her threat to Jean alone.  However, I did not find this to be a sufficient justification for lowering the sentence against the appellant. In determining the appropriate sentence to be passed, I had to consider the extent to which a serious threat had been made. In determining this, both the intention of the maker of the threat as well as the fear that the victim was put in, were of great relevance: 
Lee Yoke Choong v PP
 
[1964] 1 MLJ 138
 and 
PP v Luan Yuanxin
 
[2002] 2 SLR 98
. Although the appellant, in all probability, did not seriously intend to threaten Jean’s life, I had to balance this against the extremely vulnerable position that Jean was in at the time. She was alone and defenceless, and her fear would certainly have been exacerbated by the fact that the threat was made immediately after the appellant had subjected her to a series of humiliating abuse. Bearing in mind the usual tariff for a charge under this limb of s 506 was a term of six months’ imprisonment, the appellant’s sentence of three months’ imprisonment on this charge was clearly not manifestly excessive.
52        As the appellant was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for seven distinct charges, the district judge was bound by s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) to order the sentences for at least two of these offences to run consecutively. In this case, he ordered the sentences in three of the seven offences to run consecutively. Taking into account the appellant’s lack of remorse as well as the degrading abuse that she subjected Jean to, I saw no reason to disturb this aspect of the district judge’s order.
Conclusion
53        For the reasons above, the appellant’s appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed.

Choo Han Teck J:
1          The plaintiff was the main contractor in the construction of the condominium known as Glendale Park. It was awarded the tender on 4 April 1997. Under this contract (“the main contract”) the material for the pipe work was specified to be “hubless” cast iron for all soil and waste pipes with diameters of 150mm, 100mm and 80mm, but uPVC (a type of plastic) for pipes 50mm in diameter. No other measurements were indicated for pipe sizes. The lump sum values of these pipes were set out in the plaintiff’s bill of quantities in items 5(a)(i) to (xii). It is important to note that in addition to the above stipulated work and tendered prices, the plaintiff also provided a document known as the schedule of rates in its contract documents. This schedule provided for the prices of materials that might have to be purchased on an 
ad hoc
 basis in the course of construction. That is to say, it was meant to provide a schedule of costs for items that had to be purchased which were not anticipated and set out in the bill of quantities. These would usually cover items or materials in variation works. There was a price differential between identical items in each of the two lists. The prices in the bill of quantities were lower because they were negotiated with suppliers on a “bulk purchase” basis.
2          The defendant was a company employed directly by the developer to be the mechanical and electrical consultant for the project. The defendant gave instructions on 18 March 1998 to change “all horizontal soil waste pipes from cast iron to uPVC”. Two days later, the architect for the project issued his instructions to the plaintiff to comply with the defendant’s instructions. The plaintiff duly implemented the changes as required. There were no complaints in respect of the completed work which was accepted as a variation. However, the change from cast iron to uPVC pipes was intended to and did result in a saving in costs to the developer. The plaintiff had, therefore, to credit the developer the difference, that is, the savings. The question was, how was the savings to be calculated? The problem arose in connection with this question.
3          The plaintiff made its calculations by using the differential between the costs of the uPVC pipes as set out in the schedule of rates (because these were variation items and had to be purchased 
ad hoc
), and the price of the cast iron pipes as set out in the bill of quantities since these were the originally intended items. According to this calculation, the plaintiff had to credit or reimburse the developer the sum of $92,396. This was then submitted to the quantity surveyor in June 1998 after the work was completed. The defendant, however, valued the savings using a different formula based entirely on the bill of quantities, the defendant found the savings to be in the sum of $390,920.
4          The plaintiff rejected this valuation and commenced this action, by way of an originating summons, against the defendant. The plaintiff sought an order that on the true and proper construction of the main contract, the savings should be valued according to the formula used by the plaintiff and not any other – that is to say, that the formula used by the defendant was wrong. Secondly, the plaintiff sought a determination on whether in calculating the savings in the way it did, the defendant was “in breach of a duty of care in the tort of negligence”. In the alternative, the plaintiff sought a determination as to:
[W]hether if the Defendant were to determine and assess [the] value of the Variation otherwise than in accordance with [the formula adopted by the plaintiff] with knowledge that the Employer would rely on the Defendant’s said determination and assessment in performing the Employer’s obligations under the Contract, the Defendant would thereby induce wrongfully and tortiously the Employer to breach the Contract as against the Plaintiff; …
5          Miss Tan Lee Cheng, counsel for the defendant, in written submission demurred that the action was misconceived because the payment of the contract sum and, by that same token, any reimbursement, is between the developer and the plaintiff. The defendant was not a party to the contract between the developer and the plaintiff. She disputed the allegations that the defendant was negligent or had induced a breach of contract. Mr Coomaraswamy argued that the defendant’s valuation was to be relied upon by the quantity surveyor, who in turn would report to the Architect and he, in his turn, would, on behalf of the developer, make a final determination of the sum payable. In this regard, counsel accepted that in principle, the quantity surveyor was not bound to agree with the valuation or the method of valuation of the defendant. Indeed, if he were to exercise his own judgment as he ought to, he would have to make his determination with reasoned grounds, and not simply adopt the assessment made by someone who was not contractually, or duty bound, to make such assessment. In the framework of the contractual structure, it appears that the person who was so bound was the quantity surveyor himself.
6          Mr Coomaraswamy argued, however, that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff that when it took it upon itself to carry out the valuation of the savings, it was bound to adopt a fair and reasonable formula. Counsel relied on the High Court decision in 
Hiap Hong & Co Pte Ltd v Hong Huat Development Co
 
[2000] SGHC 131
 in which the court, relied on two court of appeal cases (
RSP Architects Planners & Engineers v Ocean Front Pte Ltd
 
[1996] 1 SLR 113
 and 
RSP Architects Planners & Engineers (Raglan Squire & Partners FE) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1075
 
[1999] 2 SLR 449
) for the proposition that a person who was charged with a duty to certify (in the cases cited it was the architect), was bound to discharge his duty with care and skill and owes a duty of care not to cause economic loss to the (in relevant cases) contractor. The 
Hong Huat
 decision on this point was not dealt with on appeal. The facts were also significantly different. The defendant here, who was not contractually bound to certify the savings or reimbursement, cannot be likened to the architect who was contractually bound to certify the satisfactory completion of work.
7          On the simple and so far undisputed facts that gave rise to the questions to be determined, some intractable problems stand in the way of the plaintiff. The person who had to certify the savings had to be either the quantity surveyor or the architect but it was not specifically stated which. All that the parties had agreed on was that the defendant had “assumed” the task of ascertaining the savings with the view of reporting it to the quantity surveyor, who it appeared, was waiting for the report. Assuming that that was so, there was no evidence before me that the quantity surveyor had vowed to accept the defendant’s findings no matter what. It meant that at this point, it was not clear what the quantity surveyor would actually do. Thus, he might agree with the plaintiff, in which event, the plaintiff would have suffered no loss or damage. If the quantity surveyor adopted the defendant’s valuation, the proper recourse would be for the plaintiff to dispute it as a matter of contract between itself and the developer, assuming that the developer wished to accept the quantity surveyor’s certification. In that event, it would be questionable whether any cause of action would lie against the defendant. The issue as to how much the developer owes the contractor and how much reimbursement is due, are matters of contract between them.
8          If the plaintiff alleges that the assessment of the savings by the defendant caused the developer to rely erroneously on it and thus incurred loss and damage to the plaintiff, the loss and damage must first be proved. No damage had been proved. Counsel’s argument that the quantity surveyor was almost likely to adopt the defendant’s valuation is not sufficient. The tort of negligence requires proof of damage. It is not a tort that is actionable 
per se
. Economic loss or potential economic loss does not merit a 
quia timet
 injunction. Injunctions of that nature may be granted in cases where there is a risk of imminent or impending physical harm or damage.
9          Furthermore, an action in negligence ought to be commenced by way of a writ action with particulars of negligence and damage properly and sufficiently pleaded. These particulars are wanting in this originating summons. There were other difficulties in the present case. If this court were to accept that the plaintiff’s formula was correct, the finding would not bind the developer who is entitled to say that contractually, he would be right to use a different formula from that used by the plaintiff. If this court were to make a determination on the duties and rights under the contract, the developer must be a party to the proceedings since it was a party to the contract. Ordinarily, in the circumstances, the action ought to be dismissed. However, it is open to the plaintiff to commence the proper action in order to air its grievances, and as such an action might require the defendant to be made a party, I decided that the appropriate decision was to make no orders on the questions sought to be determined, but order costs to be awarded to the defendant as if the action was dismissed. After hearing submissions from Miss Tan and Mr Coomaraswamy I fixed costs at $5,000 plus reasonable disbursements.",2004-08-16 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Introduction 
The plaintiffs and defendants are both Singapore incorporated companies of well known pedigree. They have at all material times been carrying on business in the manufacturing, distributing and sale of paints.
Both companies have been manufacturing and marketing a range of paints under their corporate name in Singapore. They have been and are by far the dominant players in the Singapore retail paint market.
The plaintiffs filed proceedings in March 2000 claiming that the defendants were passing off or attempting to pass off or assisting others to pass off one of a range of the plaintiffs` wall paints, namely, an interior wall paint which the defendants introduced and began marketing in October 1999 which they called `Supreme 3 in 1` for the plaintiffs` interior wall paint introduced in February 1995 which the plaintiffs were successfully marketing under the name or mark `3 in 1`. The plaintiffs consequently prayed for an injunction for delivery and destruction of the offending paint product of the defendants or an order for the obliteration of the offending name or mark `Supreme 3 in 1` from the defendants` product and damages suffered or at the plaintiffs` option an account of profits.
 The undisputed facts 
 
 
 
The plaintiffs and defendants have been manufacturing and selling various brand names of paints under their corporate names directly or through a limited number of specially appointed wholesalers to retailers and retailers to customers. On divers dates after 1994 the plaintiffs and the defendants introduced new interior wall paints which had as far as it is relevant the get-up and livery in the following form and impression on their cans.

On 7 February 1995, the plaintiffs had filed an application with the Registry of Trade Marks to register its `Nippon 3 in 1` mark, ie at about the time the said mark was launched. The Registry objected to the application on the grounds that the mark contained numerals. The application was renewed by the plaintiffs and filed on 5 February 1997. This time the Registry of Trade Marks was only prepared to accept the application subject to a disclaimer to the words and numerals `3 in 1` and the letter `n`. The plaintiffs` solicitors wrote to the Registry stating that the plaintiffs were agreeable to having the disclaimer imposed on (i) a word and numerals `3 in 1` and (ii) a letter `n`. The Trade Marks Act (Cap 332) was amended in 1998 (Act 46 of 1998). The amended Act permitted the plaintiffs if they had made an application after the amendments were instituted to register the mark `Nippon 3 in 1` without a disclaimer. However, the plaintiffs had still not attempted to register such a mark when these proceedings came up to be heard. However, the defendants had proceeded and registered their `Supreme 3 in 1` mark under the amended Act as appears in the 
 Trade Mark Journal 
, Journal No 69 dated 18 August 2000. Plaintiffs` counsel stated in court that the plaintiffs would in due course be raising an objection to the registration of the said mark `Supreme 3 in 1`.
It was common ground established by the evidence that: 
(i) over the years paint products had become more sophisticated; 
(ii) both ICI and Nippon conducted their business through wholesalers and retailers and also by selling their paints directly to contractors or end customers; 
(iii) contractors have been and are the largest group of paint purchasers and as that could be considered as professionals, they knew what paint they were buying and that about 80% of the paint sales were being made to such contractors and further that correspondingly only 20% sales were being made to walk-in buyers such as household consumers; 
(iv) household consumers had a very high percentage of loyalty to a brand they were used to; 
(v) all retail outlets sold both ICI and Nippon paints in their shops. Such outlet may give more prominence and exposure to the corporate brand name of a paint where they specially represented one or the other manufacturer to produce volume sales for better discounts; 
(vi) both ICI and Nippon published colourful brochures and colour charts every year for distribution to their customers both at the direct and retail level; 
(vii) retailers presented the brochures and or colour charts to their customers especially the walk-in customers and were in the habit of explaining the different brands of paint to them and left the choice of paints to the customers suggesting an alternative corporate brand name paint only where a choice of colour was unavailable; 
(viii) both the plaintiffs and defendants closely followed the paint products of the other, conducted specialist independent surveys very regularly for self-renewal and to feel the market`s needs; 
(ix) the household customers as purchasers of paint were generally a literate lot.
 The plaintiffs` case 
 
 
 
The plaintiffs` case was that the plaintiffs were the first in Singapore to introduce a `3 in 1` multi-purpose interior wall paint having launched it in February 1995. The `3 in 1` mark for a paint was novel in Singapore. The `3 in 1` paint became successful immediately as the percentage share of sales of `3 in 1` show compared to the `Wash & Wear` brand marketed by ICI Dulux in the statistics which were provided by the plaintiffs and defendants and which have been set out earlier. The plaintiffs had since the launch in any case, acquired goodwill in the name `3 in 1` and that name had become distinctive of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs averred that in October 1999 the defendants introduced a new interior wall paint calling it `Supreme 3 in 1`. This mark was a colourable imitation of the plaintiffs` `3 in 1` mark and since its introduction and to the date of hearing the defendants in the course of trade passed or attempted to pass off or assisted others to pass off `Supreme 3 in 1` product not being the paint product of the plaintiffs, as a paint product associated with the plaintiffs and caused damage to the plaintiffs` business by reducing their market share of the `3 in 1` paint. Plaintiffs` counsel also submitted that although the defendants` `Supreme 3 in 1` brand was calling its paint `3 in 1`, it in fact listed out eight attributes of the paint on the can and their representation of their paint as `3 in 1` was part of the colourable device to pass off their paint for that of the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs` counsel further submitted that damage to them was also caused by a `creeping` passing off which the defendants brought about from September 1996 when they had also affixed on their `Wash & Wear` paint cans the additional mark `3 in 1`, first in a small 
 roundel 
 and in the following year in 1997 by juxta-positioning the `3 in 1` just below and next to the words `Wash & Wear` to make it more prominent.
Counsel submitted that based on the evidence of the plaintiffs` Managing Director Philip William Medway (`Medway`), the defendants` conduct in introducing the `Supreme 3 in 1` mark was according to para 10(d) of the plaintiffs` amended statement of claim calculated to cause both confusion and deception and was intended to mislead the paint buying customers because the defendants saw that their `Wash & Wear` brand had lost its market share and lost the competition to the plaintiffs` `3 in 1`. This intention of the defendants could be discerned from the defendants` conduct of first disparaging the plaintiffs` `3 in 1` paint after it first appeared by cautioning customers not to be susceptible to the claims of multi-purpose paints and soon afterwards introducing multi-purpose paints themselves with the `3 in 1` concept. In short, the defendants` conduct amounted to a fraud on the public. It was further averred by the plaintiffs that by October 1999 when the defendants launched their `Supreme 3 in 1` interior wall paint, the plaintiffs` `3 in 1` was already a distinctive mark and had acquired a secondary meaning on which they had spent from 1995 to 1999 and as at October 1999 a total of $9,840,000 in promotional and advertising expenditure. Counsel for the plaintiffs further submitted that even assuming as the defendants contended that it was only a descriptive mark it had nevertheless become a distinctive mark having a secondary meaning.
It was also the submission of the plaintiffs that the disclaimer of the plaintiffs dated 21 January 1999 to the use of the letter and numerals `3 in 1` and the letter `n` by them on their paint cans was not a bar to an action of passing off based on its use of its `3 in 1` mark as the mark had assumed a secondary meaning.
The plaintiffs (through Medway`s evidence) claimed damages of $967,022 basing it on an extrapolated percentage loss of plaintiffs` loss of market share occasioned by the launch of `Supreme 3 in 1` in October 1999. Before the launch, the plaintiffs` market share was 56.64%. After the launch period, ie up to August 2000 the period up to when the internal management accounts were available, the plaintiffs` market share had been reduced to 42.16%. All this was evident according to Medway in exh P4 (columns A-M) the comparative sales chart (1999-2000). The percentage difference or market loss was put by Medway at 14.48% for the period. Medway expressed the percentage loss of 14.48% as amounting to the sales figure loss of $967,022 for the plaintiffs on the plaintiffs` and defendants` combined sales of their brands (`Nippon 3 in 1` and Nippon`s newly introduced `3 in 1 MEDIfresh` plus ICI`s Wash & Wear 3 in 1` and `Supreme 3 in 1`) which amounted to $6,780,326.
 The defendants` case 
 
 
 
The pitch of the defendants` case was that the plaintiffs distributed and sold their interior wall paint not by reference to the mark `3 in 1` but by the name `Nippon Paint 3 in 1`; that the numerals and letter whether in the phrase `Nippon 3 in 1` or `3 in 1` by itself were used in a descriptive or generic sense to describe the properties or qualities of the paint (three main properties) and not in a trade mark sense. In the circumstances, the plaintiffs could not have acquired goodwill and reputation in the above terms to the exclusion of use by others notwithstanding how extensive or substantial the plaintiffs` use of the term may have been. Further, the defendants sold or referred to their interior wall paint under their own corporate name as `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1`, `Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` or `Supreme 3 in 1` from ICI Dulux. Further, the plaintiffs` paint can bearing the marks `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear` and `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` had a colourful and completely distinct and different get up and livery on its above paint cans all of which was incapable of causing any confusion between the defendants` brand of paints and that of the plaintiffs and in the light of all the market conditions in Singapore.
The defendants further averred in their evidence and submitted that whenever they reformatted paints or re-launched them it was done as a result of their continuously monitoring the market for customers` wants in paints and as a result of extensive surveys by their independent surveyors and market feedback from customers. They had only thereafter introduced and positioned their various brands `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear` brand (in 1994) that with the additional `3 in 1` roundel (in 1995), without the roundel but their words `3 in 1` being given more emphasis by being placed next to the words `Wash & Wear` (in 1996) and `Supreme 3 in 1` (in October 1999). The plaintiffs denied they had disparaged multipurpose paints in their advertisements after `Nippon 3 in 1` multi-purpose paint was introduced. They had merely placed advertisements with a humorous `tongue in cheek` touch (as was conceded by the defendants in court) hinting to the public that they should be cautious in reacting to messages carried by multipurpose paints that claimed to do more or performed better than they actually could. The advertisements ended in late 1996. The defendants` own survey results had soon afterwards shown that multiple attributes as a marketing platform was gaining popularity amongst consumers whether it be paints or other products. The defendants began then to adopt a multi-attribute platform for their paints to address the needs of customers. The end result was that the defendants` `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` paint was a new product superior to and distinct from their `Dulux Wash & Wear` product and the product was superior to the plaintiffs` `Nippon paint 3 in 1` being the best multi-attribute product in the market and was priced slightly higher than the plaintiffs` `Nippon paint 3 in 1`. The defendants had made a decision in June 1999 to manufacture and sell the paint which was then manufactured and sold from October 1999. Defendants` counsel further submitted that they themselves had introduced the mark `3 in 1` in 1996 on their can for their interior wall paints which the plaintiffs admitted they knew of. As for the eight attributes listed on the can, D1, the others were subsidiary to the main three properties and were listed under the word `PLUS`.
Defendants` counsel took strong issue with the plaintiffs` counsel on his submission of a `creeping` passing off since September 1996 when they began using the `3 in 1` mark alongside their `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear 3 in 1` paint to October 1999 when they introduced `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` paint. Defence counsel stressed that the usage by ICI of the label `3 in 1` on their `Wash & Wear` brand as passing off had never been the subject of any complaint nor pleaded in the statement of claim by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs` claim was restricted to the introduction of the `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` brand. The plaintiffs had therefore acquiesced to the use by the defendants of the mark `3 in 1` on their cans from October 1996 and were now estopped from raising any issue thereon. The defendants had built up their own goodwill on the use of the `3 in 1` mark. Defendants` counsel submitted that the plaintiffs were not the ones to coin the expression `3 in 1` nor was it a fancy concept as could be discerned from enquiries on the internet which showed that some 80,000 products were being sold with `3 in 1` attributes one of which was the `Hammerite` paint being sold in Scandinavia. The plaintiffs had, to say the least, acquiesced in the plaintiffs` usage of such numerals and letters quite apart from the legal position that the defendants had no exclusive rights to such usage themselves and could not nor raise their heckles over the introduction of their new mark `Supreme 3 in 1` (which was marketed under their corporate name). One of the three (most washable, covers hairline cracks, better coverage) properties of `Supreme 3 in 1` was in any case different from the properties canvassed by the plaintiffs` `Nippon 3 in 1` (covers cracks, washable, waterproof), namely, that `Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` gave `Better Coverage`. `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear 3 in 1` had earlier expressed the three attributes as most washable, covers hairline cracks, covers twice the wall area.
As for the defendants` improved market share, the defendants averred that their market share had been doing badly in 1995 because of internal problems. It had to change its management twice that year. They had brought in a new management by 1996 and employed a large team thereafter to build up its market share. The defendants` market share showed positive growth by their better marketing and their market share had much improved by 1999 and even before the `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` paint was introduced as shown by the statistics. `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` was the best interior wall paint introduced and that the brand sold more of their paint to discerning buyers. The defendants had further been advertising both their `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear 3 in 1` mark as well as their `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` mark.
Defendants` counsel denied any damage to the plaintiffs` business as such.
 Decision 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Issues
 
The following main issues therefore arose for determination of the case: 
(i) Whether the mark `3 in 1` was a descriptive term of ordinary usage, if it was descriptive whether the plaintiffs had shown the mark to have acquired a secondary meaning namely that the mark was recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiffs` interior wall paint or put in other words, the term `3 in 1` had become well-known in the trade and to the general public as Nippon`s paint exclusively or a paint that was connected or associated with Nippon as such. 
(ii) Whether Nippon had by reason of acquiring a secondary meaning acquired goodwill in the said term or name `3 in 1` by 17 October 1999 when the defendants launched their `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` interior wall paint. 
(iii) Whether the defendants` use of the mark `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` was a misrepresentation to paint consumers that the said paint was that of or connected with Nippon`s paint product or was in any way connected with Nippon or their business. 
(iv) Whether there was acquiescence and/or a disclaimer on the part of the plaintiffs touching and concerning the mark `3 in 1` in respect of which they are now estopped from asserting otherwise. 
(v) If there was passing off, whether damage resulted to plaintiffs and if so what was the quantum.
 Law 
 
 
 
Generally, the law has a discountenance for a descriptive mark or name to operate as trade mark or name and it jealously guards the usage of ordinary words or numerals from being monopolised by traders for sale of either their goods or services. Any plaintiff claiming that such a trade name is his as such has an onerous burden to discharge in establishing the same. As was put by Lord Herschell in the classic case of 
Frank Reddaway & Co v George Banham & Co
 
[1896] AC 199
 at 210
; 13 RPC 218 at 228: 
 
The name of a person or words forming part of the common stock of language, may become so far associated with the goods of a particular maker that it is capable of proof that the use of them by themselves, without explanation or qualification by another manufacturer, would deceive a purchaser into the belief that he was getting the goods of A, when he was really getting the goods of B. In a case of this description, the mere proof by the plaintiff that the defendant was using a name, word, or device which he had adopted to distinguish his goods would not entitle him to any relief. He could only obtain it by proving further, that the defendant was using it under such circumstances or in such manner as to put off his goods as the goods of the plaintiff. If he could succeed in proving this, I think he would, on well-established principles, be entitled to an injunction.
 
 
 
It may be instructive to refer to some guiding principles stated by the Court of Appeal in 
Super Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte & Anor
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 145
  and other relevant cases as illustrations in relation to a claim of passing off. The brief facts in the above case were that the appellants since 1987 sold a `3 in 1` instant coffee mix under the mark `SUPER COFFEEMIX` comprising of coffee, sugar and a creamer and when mixed with hot water the mixture produced an instant coffee drink. The revenues of the product rose from just over half a million dollars to some $8.2m in 1997 on the back of aggressive promotional and advertising which by 1997 had cost about $6m. The respondents were in the coffee business selling INDOCAFE coffee products since 1990. In 1993 they had begun a similar `3 in 1` mixture which bore the name INDOCAFE and an additional style `Coffeemix` (ie `INDOCAFE Coffeemix`). The appellants sued the respondents for, amongst other things, a restraining order and damages for passing off their goods as the appellants` product `SUPER COFFEEMIX`. The appellants` action was dismissed both by the trial judge and on appeal by the Court of Appeal. In dismissing the appeal the Court of Appeal held that whilst the appellants had acquired goodwill in the mark `SUPER COFFEEMIX` there was hardly sufficient evidence to show that the public had regarded `COFFEEMIX` exclusively as the mark which linked the product to the respondents. The Court of Appeal noted that the two products had a different design and packaging. The evidence of sales and advertising related to the entire mark `SUPER COFFEEMIX` and not `COFFEEMIX`. The appellants had not sold or promoted their products as `COFFEEMIX`. Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) in giving the opinion of the court went on to state: 
 
 
60 ... The plaintiffs [appellants] must show that part of the mark alone `COFFEEMIX`, which is descriptive in nature had become distinctive of the plaintiffs[appellants] product. Distinctiveness is a term of art in the law of passing off. 
 Wadlow on the Law of Passing Off 
 (2nd Ed) explains it in this way at para 6.02: 
 
`Matter such as a name, mark or get-up is said to be distinctive if it denotes the goods of the plaintiff to the exclusion of other traders. It is the significance which the relevant public attaches to the supposed mark which is all important. Matter which is not relied on by the public in this way is not in law distinctive, irrespective of how novel, striking or different it may be.` 
 
61 As mentioned before, the word `Coffeemix` is clearly descriptive. Unlike an inventive word it would be harder to acquire distinctiveness in relation to a descriptive word. The evidencial burden placed on a plaintiff in such a case would be high, but it would not be impossible to establish it: 
 CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac Marina 
 [1998] 2SLR 550 and 
Lifestyle 1.99 Pte Ltd v S$1.99 Pte Ltd
 
 
[2000] 2 SLR 766
  at [para ] 34-46 pp 159I-160F.
  
 
 
Chao J then went on to hold that no evidence was shown that customers were deceived and that there was no misrepresentation over the respondents` mark. The learned judge observed that where a mark is descriptive, a minor difference would be held to be sufficient to distinguish one mark or name from another as was held in 
 Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminster Office Cleaning Association 
 63 RPC 39.
 Horlicks Malted Milk Co v Summerkill 
 34 RPC 63 is another pertinent case in point. The plaintiffs manufactured a food preparation and sold it as `Horlicks Malted Milk`. The defendants subsequently made and sold a similar preparation but under the name of `Hedleys Malted Milk` and having done that they were sued by the plaintiffs in a passing off action, the plaintiffs claiming that the plaintiffs` preparation had been a trade secret and they had invented and given the preparation the distinctive name of `Malted Milk` and the same product had been extensively advertised and persons who asked for `Malted Milk` intended and expected to receive the plaintiffs` product. The plaintiffs` action was dismissed at first instance, then in the Court of Appeal and finally in the House of Lords, the Law Lords being of the opinion that the expression `Malted Milk` was merely descriptive of milk which is combined or prepared with malt or with extract of malt. Earl Loreburn had this to say: 
 
The claim really is for a part of a designation which the plaintiffs have been in the habit of using. They have been in the habit of using the term `
 Horlick`s
 Malted Milk`. They now eliminate the word `
 Horlick
` and ask that the remainder of their description shall be prohibited to the defendant. On the ground that they are descriptive words, I do not think that that can be done. The question with which I have been dealing is, of course, the question which lies at the bottom of the rights of the plaintiffs and the defendant; but the real point in issue is this: Ought the House to say that we should expect the public to be misled by the use of the terms Hedley`s Malted Milk into buying it as and for 
 Horlick`s
 Malted Milk? I do not think so;
 
 
 
In 
Canadian Shredded Wheat Co Ltd v Kellog Co of Canada, Ltd
 
[1938] 1 All ER 618
 and 
McCain International Ltd v Country Fair Foods Ltd & Anor
 
[1981] RPC 69
 `shredded wheat` products in the former case and `oven chips` in the latter case made by the respective respondents were held to be descriptive although the manufacturers had intended for the public to be able to tell from the particular name the nature of the novel product. Further, in 
Woodward`s TM; Woodward v Boulton Macro Ltd
 
[1915] 87 LJ Ch 27
, 32 RPC 173 it was held that notwithstanding that the plaintiffs were the first persons to offer the proprietary remedy called `Gripe Water` (on which several generations of children have grown up), the term was to be properly regarded as descriptive as the term `gripe water` was applied by pharmacies to preparations made up extemporaneously.
As for misrepresentation, the general considerations to be borne in mind by the court are the possible deception and confusion of a plaintiff`s own customers or the eventual consumers of the goods in question. It is sufficient to show that there will be a likelihood of confusion amongst a substantial proportion of purchasers of the goods. For this purpose careless and indifferent buyers who disregard the get-up and livery on labels of products may be disregarded as customers must `treat the label fairly`: Lord Halsbury LC in 
Schweppes v Gibbens
 
[1905] 22 RPC 601
 at 606.
 Assessment of evidence: Plaintiffs` mark `3 in 1` - whether descriptive 
 
 
 
I return now to the present case. The plaintiffs` pleaded case was an infringement and passing off of their mark `3 in 1` which mark was prominently displayed in a large format on their interior wall paint can (exh P1) since its introduction in February 1995. The defendants had according to the plaintiffs, caused the infringement in October 1999 by labelling their rival paint can as `Supreme 3 in 1` (exh D1) wherein the portion of the mark `3 in 1` after the word `Supreme` was the offending portion. It had been submitted that the offending portion was intended to cause and caused confusion and deception in the market as it was passing off the defendants` product as that of the plaintiffs` `3 in 1` interior wall paint of which mark the plaintiffs were the originators in the paint market in Singapore and the distinctive mark had assumed a secondary meaning, namely, that it had become distinctive of the plaintiffs` business with goodwill attached to it. The defendants` forceful contention, on the other hand, was that the plaintiffs` case was misleading as the plaintiffs` paints were being marketed as `Nippon Paint 3 in 1` and not just `3 in 1`. The get up and livery on the cans of paint of `Nippon Paint 3 in 1` and `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` was so different that there was no possibility of any confusion in the minds of the paint buying public.
It was plain to me from the outset that the plaintiffs were severing or eliminating the words `Nippon Paint` just as the plaintiffs had severed the word `Malted Milk` from 
 Horlicks 
 in 
 Horlicks Malted Milk Co v Summerkill 
professing then to have goodwill in the remaining words `Malted Milk` which two words were held in that case to be descriptive words as I have stated earlier. The plaintiffs in the present case had similarly pressed that the defendants be prohibited from using `3 in 1` being the remainder of the mark and that they also be compensated for trade losses.
I am of the opinion that the `3 in 1` concept is not really in any form, a mark that can identify meaningfully a product by that expression alone without the manufacturer also linking to that expression either his corporate name or other unique or distinct name so that the composite of the two can identify the product or its source. There is no inherently identifiable characteristic or source in a product simply called `3 in 1` or for that matter `2 in 1` as that mark appears alongside some other 
 proper 
 trading marks. Clearly, the expression `3 in 1` is a generic one, a descriptor and the `3 in 1` mark on the plaintiffs` interior wall paint can, in my opinion, was an indicia or reference to the inherent qualities of the paint which were boldly spelled out across the can three times as `Covers Crack, Washable, Waterproof`. Indeed, when questioned, Medway made this admission: 
 
 
Q: The name `3 in 1` describes your product? 
 
A: Yes. The 3 main attributes are described.
  
 
 
[NE p 24 line 8.]
Counsel for the defendants had submitted that a search for the tag `3 in 1` on the Internet today reveals some 80,000 `hits` on the `3 in 1` tag for products. I had no reason to doubt him as plaintiffs` counsel took no issue on this. Thus, shampoos (Herbalife 3 in 1 Shampoo (cleanse, condition and rinse), WD-40 oil (lubricates, cleans, prevents rust) and Hewlett-Packard `3 in 1` (print, fax and scan) are a few examples of `3 in 1` products. Defendants` counsel submitted that the plaintiffs were submitting their case within a paint and not a shampoo context and were the first to use the term `3 in 1` as such. Also, the plaintiffs were using the term `3 in 1` as a fanciful term within a paint context in Singapore.
I reject the submission. The term `3 in 1` is too generic that it should be arrogated for any one particular usage for a particular type of product in Singapore to the exclusion of others. The Christian Bible, if I might say so, when it refers to the word `Trinity` which represents God in its plural form, may well be the first and earliest connotation of the concept of `3 in 1`. Presently, the term has become a common expression used to describe various properties of a product offered for sale highlighting three main properties within a product as indicating its multi-purpose multi-attribute content or use. The number `3` in the expression `3 in 1` is probably used by market makers as representing and thereafter describing an optimum number of properties that the general public has a memory for spontaneous recall.
It was drawn to my attention that in the field of paints, `Hammerite paints` in Scandinavia also expressed itself on its can as a `3 in 1` paint and lists the three outstanding qualities of that paint. In 
 Super Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte & Anor 
 (discussed earlier) the plaintiffs and the defendants` respective brands both carried the `3 in 1` mark or sub-mark. The plaintiffs wisely had not sued the defendants for passing off that mark or sub-mark although they had introduced it six years earlier than the defendants. No issue was raised there by the plaintiffs on the adoption of such a mark by the respondents.
This is not to say that letters and numbers alone or in combination would always remain common and therefore descriptive. They can be accepted as distinctive or having a reputation attached to them, over long user such as the notorious cologne `4711` and perfume `Chanel No 5`. To my mind, however, there is nothing inventive, novel, conjured or unique in the mere expression `3 in 1`.
The term `3 in 1` is, therefore, in my opinion, a descriptor. A mere descriptor name cannot have goodwill attached to it unless the descriptive term or name becomes distinctive and acquired a secondary meaning with long user.
 Whether `3 in 1` mark as descriptor, acquired secondary meaning and goodwill 
 
 
 
The question then is as to whether the plaintiffs` 3 in 1` paint had taken on a secondary meaning because it had become known in the trade and to the general public as `Nippon`s paint distinctively or a paint that was connected or associated with Nippon and had as such, acquired goodwill. As stated earlier, unlike an inventive word, it is harder to acquire distinctiveness in relation to a descriptive word. The word `distinctive` in the law of passing off does not, I might emphasise bear an everyday meaning. It denotes the goods of the plaintiffs to the exclusion of other trades.
Had therefore the descriptive name or words `3 in 1` become distinctive of the plaintiffs` goods? If it did, the plaintiffs failed to prove the same on a balance of probabilities. The plaintiffs had, in my opinion, failed to surmount a number of hurdles, in proving the same. `3 in 1` name was not used in isolation but was a composite of words `Nippon Paint` so that the product that was marketed by the plaintiffs was `Nippon Paint 3 in 1`. The goodwill that the plaintiffs acquired was in the composite name `Nippon Paint 3 in 1` with the corporate name `Nippon` being the significant mark which linked the product to the term `3 in 1`. In other words, `3 in 1` on the plaintiffs` cans was not a stand alone mark. The plaintiffs did not sell their interior wall paint nor advertised or sold it simply as `3 in 1`. The publicity, promotional material and advertisements always referred to the paint as `Nippon Paint 3 in 1`. Medway had admitted to this in the following evidence: 
 
 
Q: Look at Core 22/23. In all your publicity and promotional material plaintiffs describe their paint as `Nippon 3 in 1`? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: Also in TV advertising reference is to `Nippon 3 in 1`? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: All the marketing and promotional material use term`Nippon 3 in 1`? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
[NE p 24 lines 20-26 and p 25 line 4.]
Plaintiffs` counsel made reference to one write-up in a Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) in-house journal. In one of the lines of a brief article the paint was referred to as `3 in 1` but having read the article, I was satisfied that in the earlier paragraphs the words `Nippon Paint` had been used and the `3 in 1` expression later was a short-hand way of referring to it as Nippon`s paint. The short article must be read as a whole not in parts. It appeared to me as if the plaintiffs were clutching straws to build goodwill on an obscure article where the paint was referred to as `3 in 1` in the particular sense.
Medway also admitted in cross-examination that the plaintiffs` amended statement of claim containing the references that the plaintiffs sold and marketed paints by reference to the name `3 in 1` was `strictly not correct`: [NE25 lines 23-24.]
The plaintiffs had attempted to show that the `3 in 1` mark had become associated or connected with Nippon and therefore had become exclusive or distinctive in view of the evidence of some seven surveys done between 12 October 1995 and 27 December 1999 by Liew Lee Sah @ Chong Lee Sah, PW2 (`Ms Chong`), the plaintiffs` independent market researcher and surveyor and Managing Director of CLS Research Solutions. The plaintiffs also relied on some of the survey evidence of the defendants` witness Kenneth Chih-Sien Tan, DW3 (`Kenneth Chih`), the Managing Director of Acorn Marketing Research Consultants (`Acorn`). The results of some ten surveys done between March 1999 and April 2000 were tendered in evidence as conducted by the plaintiffs.
I am unable to place any sufficient weight on the accuracy of the survey results. I agree with defendant counsel`s submission that formulation of the questions in the surveys leave much to be desired. The totality of the answers given were not produced or recorded nor the exact answers recorded or answer sheets made available. Moreover, Ms Chong retracted in cross-examination important aspects of the evidence which she had stated in favour of the plaintiffs as follows: 
(i) Paragraph 14: `Based on the survey results, my conclusion is that the name and mark `3 in 1` has therefore become very well known in the trade and to the general public as the plaintiffs paint exclusively or a paint associated with or connected with the plaintiffs.`Ms Chong was asked if she will now withdraw the said para 14, agreed to withdraw her said paragraph after being asked and replying as follows to questions: 
 
 
Q: Paragraph 12c of your affidavit: When you asked respondents: `If you ask your painter to use ""3 in 1"" there was no exclusive association of ""3 in 1"" with Nippon? 
 
A: Yes because there is another `3 in 1` in the market. 
 
Q: Paragraph 12c(ii) - of 302 consumers only 12% or 36 consumers knew `3 in 1` as belonging to Nippon? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
... 
 
Q: There is never a survey that shows `3 in 1` refers to Nippon exclusively? 
 
A: None.
  
 
 
In this regard, it is pertinent to recall the conceding evidence of Medway in cross-examination as follows [at NE35 lines 11-13]: 
 
 
Q: Based on the figures there is no exclusivity in sub-brand recognition for `Nippon 3 in 1`? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: The public did not think that `3 in 1` was a name connected with Nippon and none other? 
 
A: Correct.
  
 
 
These answers were telling. 
(ii) Further admission by Ms Chong were made when she gave these answers: 
 
 
Q: So `Nippon 3 in 1` has a much higher brand awareness over `Dulux Wash & Wear`? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Awareness of customers lies in the word `Nippon`? 
 
A: That`s natural. Yes. Nippon has been the parent brand. It is so the way it is marketed `3 in 1`.[NE63 line 20-25.] 
 
Earlier she had stated: 
 
Q: Look at 1PBAEC pp 90-91 ... 
 
On the face of documents, the 1% of respondents replied `Nippon 3 in 1` and under column `Total unaided`, 18% of respondents also on face of documents said `Nippon 3 in 1`. On face of this survey not one single respondent replied `3 in 1`? 
 
A: Nobody said `3 in 1`. They also referred to it as `Nippon 3 in 1`. I am quite sure that`s what the respondents said. [NE61 lines 8 and 18-25.]
  
 
 
Indeed on the face of Ms Chong`s survey documents that were exhibited, the respondents` answers reflect that the answers were `Nippon 3 in 1` rather than `3 in 1`.
In my opinion, the evidence in court of Ms Chong and Medway showed unequivocably that it was not the term `3 in 1` simpliciter that Nippon was marketing but the composite `Nippon Paint 3 in 1` brand. It was in that composite name that the plaintiffs` goodwill lay.
Faced with Ms Chong`s retractions the plaintiffs` counsel relied on the defendants` surveys which they had asked for and conducted by Acorn to establish exclusivity and hence goodwill but the surveys did not help the plaintiffs as they were no more satisfactorily conducted. The plaintiffs relied on Acorn`s survey report of 23 September 1999 conducted for the defendants where the surveyor had made these statements amongst other things: 
(i) `Conclusions & Recommendations ""3 in 1"" is now associated with Nippon` (p 1405). 
(ii) `Brand Awareness...Nippon has established some ownership of ""3 in 1"" idea (50% respondents are aware at prompted level` (p 1417). 
(iii) `Association of Brands with Different Variants` - 
 see column that shows 51% interviewed recalled ""3 in 1"" (when asked to think of paints).
The 50% figure above is no doubt an approximation of the 51% figure in the survey documented at 4AB1416. The document also shows 12% identified the mark `3 in 1` with ICI, and 8% with other brands. Whilst 29% were not able to make an association, defendants` counsel`s submission was that the 50% or 51% itself did not show exclusivity even if the survey was accurate. Counsel for the plaintiffs stressed that the 51% figure was sufficient to establish distinctiveness and exclusivity for the mark `3 in 1` as the public could recall `3 in 1` which was the mark that Nippon employed. Indeed, I observed that Ms Chong, the plaintiffs` surveyor, had stated in her cross-examination that there was no exclusive association of `3 in 1` with Nippon because there is another `3 in 1` in the market. Ms Chong no doubt had in mind the defendants `ICI Dulux Wash & Wear 3 in 1` paint which had come into the market in 1996 - just 18 months after the plaintiffs had introduced their `Nippon Paint 3 in 1`. Medway himself when questioned on the survey statistics at 4AB1416 answered: 
 
 
Q: Based on these figures there is no exclusivity in sub-brand recognition for `Nippon 3 in 1`? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: The public did not think that `3 in 1` was a name connected with Nippon and none others? 
 
A: Correct.
  
 
 
In fact exh 4AB1415 shows a `Top of Mind Awareness for a ""3 in 1""` paint simply described as such at 7%, but an awareness of 50% for ICI brand and 34 for Nippon brand. To my mind, this tended to show that the respective paints are bought predominantly on the recognition of the corporate names rather than their sub-names. Ms Chong herself agreed in 
 cross-examination 
 for instance it was natural that awareness of customers lies in the word `Nippon` as it was the parent brand. Anyway, the actual survey documents were not before the court, only the keyed in results and they were therefore not sufficiently intelligible. The full basis of statistical information could not be substantiated to the court whether the surveys were conducted by the plaintiffs or defendants. Again, the defendants` surveyor Kenneth Chih on whose results the plaintiffs were relying, had also stated that in the same survey 19% of respondents identified the `Wash & Wear` brand with Nippon although Nippon did not sell such a paint: [NE147 lines 19-24]. This hardly spoke well of the accuracy of the recall by respondents of the products of the plaintiffs and the defendants. In the circumstances, I placed little weight on the surveys.
In any case, I am further satisfied that the 50% or 51% result even if it was accurate does not establish exclusive association of the `3 in 1` mark with Nippon in a paint mark which Nippon and ICI were the dominant players having cornered the paint market between their competing brands. Medway himself admitted that the public did not think that `3 in 1` was a name connected with Nippon exclusively. Fifty one per cent constituted therefore, only a slim majority not exclusivity. There was, as such, no secondary meaning to the mark `3 in 1` as that of Nippon`s and consequently no secondary meaning with goodwill attached to it was proved by the plaintiffs having regard primarily (as well) to the incontestable fact that the plaintiffs manufactured and sold their paint under the composite name `Nippon Paint 3 in 1` in which composite name the true goodwill was built up as shown by the advertising, the brochures and the cans of paint themselves and in which composite name the true goodwill resided.
As for plaintiffs` counsel`s submission that damage had also been caused to Nippon`s `3 in 1` brand by the defendants by attaching the term `3 in 1` on their `Wash & Wear` brand in October 1996 and that there had since been a `creeping` passing off of the `Wash & Wear` brand for the plaintiffs` `3 in 1` paint, I agree with the submission of defence counsel that this had never been the subject of any complaint by the plaintiffs and that the defendants had built up their recognisable `Wash & Wear 3 in 1` brand over the subsequent three years before introducing their `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` paint. Only the defendants `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` brand was the subject of the plaintiffs` claim and the plaintiffs` pleaded case only asked for damages against the said `Supreme 3 in 1` brand.
It is significant to note that the `Wash & Wear 3 in 1` brand continues to sell even after the introduction of the `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` brand and alongside it without objection by the plaintiffs to the brand. The defendants had therefore built up their own reputation on the mark `3 in 1` as used on their `Wash & Wear` label and they were a 
 fortiori 
 entitled to use and exploit the mark as their top-end grade of interior wall paint when they introduced the `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1`.
 Acquiescence, disclaimer, estoppel 
 
 
 
I further noted that the Registry of Trade Marks had in 1995 rejected the plaintiffs` application for the numbers and letters in `3 in 1` `n` for registration alongside the brand mark `Nippon Paint` no doubt because of their generic or descriptive nature rather than distinctive nature. The plaintiffs had therefore probably acquiesced when the defendants adopted and used the `3 in 1` mark on their `Wash & Wear` brand from October 1996 that they had no exclusivity in the numbers and letters `3 in 1`. The plaintiffs were estopped now from asserting otherwise.
The plaintiffs` renewed their application in 1997. The plaintiffs` full mark `Nippon Paint 3 in 1 `n` ` was listed as a pending mark by the Registrar as one belonging to them only after the plaintiffs had 
 disclaimed 
 exclusivity to the mark `3 in 1` and the letter `n` (exh D7(1-2)) as requested by the said Registrar. Whilst a disclaimer is not necessarily a bar to an action of passing off, I found however that the plaintiffs did not have the necessary ingredients in place to establish exclusivity and goodwill arising therefrom as stated earlier.
 Misrepresentation 
 
 
 
I next come to the question of misrepresentation which ground in my assessment of the evidence also fails.
The gist of the plaintiffs` submission was that the defendants copied their marketing strategy of adopting the `3 in 1` mark. The defendants added the word `Supreme` before it to read `Supreme 3 in 1`. It was insufficient for the defendants to distinguish `Supreme 3 in 1` from the plaintiffs` brand name `3 in 1` and the defendants` use of the `3 in 1` mark coupled with the word `Supreme` was intended to cause and had caused confusion in the market among paint buyers. The `3 in 1` sales of Nippon had dropped by 14.48% from the time of the introduction of `Supreme 3 in 1` to August 2000 and had cost them a market loss of $967,022 as put by the plaintiffs earlier.
No evidence was adduced before me except for the hearsay evidence of a number of plaintiffs` witnesses (which I disregarded) that the plaintiffs had intended to deceive or had caused deception through confusion or otherwise in gaining a market share of 14% for themselves on their `Supreme 3 in 1` over the plaintiffs` `3 in 1`. The plaintiffs` allegation in their pleaded case and affidavit evidence was that the defendants had up to October 1999 been losing and had lost market share on their `Wash & Wear 3 in 1` brand. Defendants` counsel pointed out by referring to the sales figures in exh P3(B) (Amended) that this was incorrect. I accepted counsel`s submission. Medway had admitted the plaintiffs` allegation was flawed and that the plaintiffs had been working on the defendants` figures as a `guesswork`. The defendants` figures were only made available at the trial. The defendants` `Wash & Wear 3 in 1` brand in fact after the defendants had revamped their management by appointing new managers, had begun to increase from $2.4m in 1995 to $4.007 m in 1996 and from $4.0007 to $4.439m in 1998 and thereafter to $5.31m in 1999 before the launch of their `Supreme 3 in 1` paint. The defendants had been narrowing the gap between their two respective dominant competing brands of paint with the new management and had been resorting to increased advertising. Indeed it was the case of both the plaintiffs and defendants that their sales from the end of 1999 (when the defendants` `ICI Dulux Supreme 3 in 1` paint was introduced and the plaintiffs had brought out their new paint at the same time with the mark `Nippon Paint 3 in 1 MEDIfresh`) to August 2000 had been adversely affected by the Housing & Development Board`s (HDB) announcement at about the same time that for the year 2000, HDB would be reducing the building of new flats from 24,000 to 10,000. In my opinion, that is a significant reduction in public housing and has impacted on both the plaintiffs` and defendants` paint sales especially to a greater extent on the party that supplied more paint for use on HDB flats. No statistics were placed before me on this aspect. The burden was, however, on the plaintiffs which they did not discharge that they had not lost their market share due to the implementation by HDB of their new housing policy and at that not lost a greater proportion of the market share than the defendants had lost.
I could not in any way see the possibility of a confusion arising between Nippon `3 in 1` and ICI Dulux `Supreme 3 in 1`. The get up, make up or livery of the two brands was totally different as can be seen from the description of the cans I have given earlier and more significantly if one views the cans. ICI`s livery of all its brand is very colourful and vibrant. Nippon`s cans have pastel appearance and the livery is very different. To put it shortly, the difference in the cans between that of `Nippon Paint 3 in 1` and `ICI Dulux 3 in 1` are discernable at first glance by anyone. The real selling names are the corporate names `Nippon` and `ICI` as I have already stated. The word `Supreme` on the `ICI` can before the mark `3 in 1` also constituted a differentiation between the two brands. Then again the witnesses of both sides were agreed that the paint market in Singapore was a sophisticated one. The buyers were a literate lot. About 80% of the sales were through contractors. Contractors were in my opinion unlikely ever to make a mistake of one brand for another being habitual users. About 20% of the users were walk-in customers. The evidence from both plaintiffs and defendants show that these customers make at least two visits to a retailer and would be shown charts and colourful brochures of paints and it was only then that they make up their minds. Both plaintiffs and defendants introduced colourful brochures every year. Purchasing paints was not an impulse buying. Then again there was the brand loyalty factor. In view of all these circumstances I was of the opinion that the defendants could not have intended to cause any deception or confusion hoping to sell ICI Dulux paint for that of Nippon whatever sub-mark was put on the paint cans. Confusion was highly unlikely to have occurred in the circumstances. There was no evidence of confusion.
 Findings 
 
 
 
For all the reasons given, I hold that the plaintiffs have failed to establish a claim of passing off and no issue of ensuing damages as computed by the plaintiffs or otherwise arises. The plaintiffs` claim is therefore dismissed with costs to be taxed or agreed.

: This was an appeal against the decision of district judge Siva Shanmugam, where he acquitted the respondent, Koh Beng Oon (`Mr Koh`), of 12 charges of criminal breach of trust. The 12 charges are similar to one another. The first of them reads: 
 
You, Koh Beng Oon, are charged that you, between 5 July 1999 and 7 July 1999, in Singapore, committed criminal breach of trust, in that you, whilst being the Managing Director of Auto Asia (S) Pte Ltd (`the Company`), and in the way of your business as an agent of the company being entrusted with dominion over property, namely, Preferential Additional Registration Fee Certificate for vehicle number SBH 1295T belonging to one Lie Halim@Freddy Tjoe, did dishonestly misappropriate the said property and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Ed).
 
 
 
 
 
 The facts 
 
 
 
 
 
Mr Koh was the managing director of Auto Asia (S) Pte Ltd (`Auto Asia`). The company was incorporated on 2 April 1991 and was involved in the business of selling cars. Mr Koh was the majority shareholder, holding 600,000 shares in the company. The remaining 450,000 shares were held by his wife, Mdm Constance Tan Gek Suan.
Sometime in early 1998, Auto Asia secured the exclusive right to sell Kia cars in Singapore. Actual sales began sometime around June 1998, and Auto Asia managed to sell about 130 cars by year-end. In January 1999, Auto Asia launched a sales promotion for Kia Mentor cars, priced at $59,900, inclusive of the Certificate of Entitlement (`COE`). The COE price for the relevant category of vehicle at that time was $34,508. A second promotion for Kia Mentor cars was launched in March 1999, at the price of $66,800.
A large number of orders were received pursuant to the promotions. All customers who placed an order with Auto Asia were required to pay a booking fee of $2,000 and a COE deposit of $8,000. Among these customers, were the 12 named in the charges. They did not pay the full $10,000 in cash. Instead, they made a cash payment of between $2,000 to $5,000 for the booking fee and as partial payment for the COE deposit, and in addition, deposited either the log-card or the Preferential Additional Registration Fee (`PARF`) certificate for their existing vehicle with Auto Asia. The log-cards and PARF certificates will be referred to collectively as `the vehicle documents`. Each of these 12 customers signed the following form (`the form`): 
 
 
 Re: Pledge of Vehicle Log-Card/Parf Cert as Part Payment for COE Bidding Deposit
 
 
 
 
I, [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar], NRIC No [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar] of [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar] confirmed and agreed to pledge my used car/PARF cert number [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar] log-card/PARF cert, NRIC, transfer and early settlement forms duly signed with AUTO ASIA (S) Pte Ltd as part of the COE deposit for the purchase of [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar] unit of [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar] under vehicle order agreement no. [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar] for name [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar] NRIC No [lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar][lowbar] Upon successful COE bidding and time of registration, I shall allow Auto Asia (S) Pte Ltd to sell or scrap my car/PARF cert and to redeem the amount they have paid for the COE bidding. Also, I must settle all the balance payment before registration of the new vehicle. Failure to this Auto Asia (S) Pte Ltd have all rights to sell or scrap my car and to claim the difference on the full COE amount bidded and other miscellaneous cost incurred for the COE bidding and booking fee will be non-refundable. [NB: Original form was drafted in full caps.]
 
 
 
The COE bidding process mentioned in the form, was introduced in May 1990 as a means of controlling the growth of vehicle population in Singapore. Under the COE system, a COE must be obtained through a process of competitive bidding before a vehicle can be registered. When making a bid, 50% of the bid amount is deducted from the applicant`s bank account as deposit for the application. This deposit is refunded if the bid is unsuccessful. The bidding is usually conducted by the Land Transport Authority (`LTA`) from the 1st to the 7th of each month. Bidding usually closes at 4pm on the 7th of the same month, whereupon the LTA will announce the lowest successful bid for each category. A successful bidder needs only pay the lowest successful price (`strike price`), and not the amount that was actually bid.
Auto Asia`s practice was to secure the COE for its customers, either by bidding for it on its own or through an agent. This required Auto Asia to pay the required COE deposit to the LTA. Auto Asia had since July 1994, obtained a COE financing facility from a finance company called DP Financial Associates Pte Ltd (`DP`). DP was the sole managing agent for Hitachi Leasing (S) Pte Ltd (`Hitachi Leasing`) in relation to loans provided by Hitachi Leasing. Under the facility, Auto Asia would submit a list of customers to DP for whom COEs were required, and Hitachi Leasing would extend the necessary funding for the COE deposits through DP.
Sometime in early July 1999, Mr Koh submitted to DP a list of 120 customers who needed COE bidding. The total amount of credit required for the bidding was $3,010,050. DP was initially willing to extend only $775,000. When Mr Koh asked DP for additional financing, they replied that they would do so only if Mr Koh could provide some security.
Consequently, on 5 July 1999, Mr Koh delivered to DP ten vehicle documents. Eight of these documents belonged to persons named in the charges. On the security of these documents, DP sent Mr Koh a cheque for $141,600 on 6 July 1999 made out in Mr Koh`s name.
On 7 July 1999, Mr Koh delivered another six vehicle documents to DP. Four of these documents belonged to persons named in the charges. DP granted further credit of $80,000 to Auto Asia on the security of these documents. Mr Koh requested DP to use this $80,000 to finance COE bidding for three persons.
In the July 1999 COE bidding exercise, DP bid for 58 COEs on behalf of Auto Asia at the bid price of $50,000. The strike price for that bidding exercise was $45,876. On 15 July 1999, the LTA issued 58 temporary COEs to DP. Auto Asia was unable to redeem the COEs from DP due to insufficient funds. Auto Asia has since August 1999, entered into receivership.
The prosecution brought forth 32 charges of criminal breach of trust and 15 charges of cheating against Mr Koh. At the trial, the prosecution proceeded with 12 charges of criminal breach of trust. The remaining charges were stood down pending the outcome of the trial.
 Decision of the judge 
 
 
 
At the end of the prosecution`s case, the judge found that a prima facie case had been made out in respect of all the charges, and called for the defence. Mr Koh elected not to give any evidence and did not call for any witnesses.
The judge found that the vehicle documents had been pledged and that there were no restrictions against a sub-pledge. There was consequently no misappropriation. Neither did the judge find any dishonest intent in Mr Koh`s conduct. The judge was also of the view that the circumstances of the case did not compel the drawing of an adverse inference against him under s 196(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). He was accordingly acquitted.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Against this decision, the prosecution appealed. Section 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) provides that: 
 
Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, in his capacity of a public servant, or in the way of his business as a banker, merchant, factor, broker, attorney or agent, commits criminal breach of trust in respect of that property, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
 
 
 
Section 405 defines `criminal breach of trust` in the following way: 
 
Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person to do so, commits `criminal breach of trust`.
 
 
 
An offence under s 409 of the Penal Code contains three elements. First, an entrustment of property. Second, misappropriation of the property entrusted. Third, misappropriation of that property with dishonest intent. The only elements in dispute were the second and third.
 Misappropriation of property 
 
 
 
The first issue in the appeal then was whether there was misappropriation of the vehicle documents. A key point of contention on this issue between Mr Wong, who appeared for the Public Prosecutor, and Mr Shanmugam SC, counsel for Mr Koh, was whether the deposit of the vehicle documents with Auto Asia amounted to a pledge, and if so, whether Mr Koh had the right to in turn sub-pledge these documents to DP. If as Mr Shanmugam contended, the deposit of vehicle documents with Auto Asia amounted to a pledge without any restrictions on a further sub-pledge, the element of misappropriation would not be satisfied.
 Existence of a pledge 
 
 
 
Mr Wong`s arguments on this issue were built around the fact that when the vehicle documents were handed over to Auto Asia, there was at the time no debt owing by the customers, since no COE had been successfully secured by Auto Asia on the customers` behalf. In his submission, there cannot be a pledge for a contingent debt.
In making this argument, he was met by a decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in 
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Curlett Cannon and Galbell Pty Ltd
 (Unreported) where Ormiston J said at p 103 after a review of the authorities that: 
 
... a pledge may be constituted by a security for a debt which shall or may arise in the future or which has arisen at a time other than that of the delivery.
 
 
 
Mr Wong sought to narrow the propositions laid down by this case, arguing that it was not authority for the proposition that there can be a pledge for a contingent debt, and that all that was decided was that where there is a pledge of a contingent debt, the time of reckoning of priorities may be taken as the time the goods were deposited, and not the time when the debt subsequently arose.
With respect to Mr Wong, my reading of 
 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group v Curlett Cannon 
 did not bear him out. In that case, the plaintiff bank had a registered mortgage over the assets of the debtor company Najee Nominees Pty Ltd (`Najee`). In March 1991, Najee defaulted and the bank appointed a receiver to take possession of the charged property. The receiver sought from the defendant customs agent release of three consignments of clothing. The customs agent refused, claiming that they had a right in priority by virtue of a pledge, which arose when the bills of lading for the consignments were delivered to them sometime in February 1991.
Although the bank`s registered mortgage had been granted on 3 September 1985, it was common ground that the bank`s charge crystallised only upon the appointment of the receiver on 28 March 1991. It was also undisputed that the customs agent`s pledge, if it could be so characterised, would have priority since it came earlier in time. The bank sought to counter this by arguing that they had priority, because their charge had been registered for the purposes of the Corporations Law, while the customs agent`s right, which they argued was a registrable charge, had not been registered. Under the relevant law, the right would not be a registrable charge if it could be characterised as a pledge. Therefore, the nature of a pledge was very much at the heart of the decision, contrary to Mr Wong`s suggestion.
It was in this context that Ormiston J made his ruling. It was argued before him that each transaction did not constitute a pledge because no debt existed at the time the bills of lading were deposited; 
 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group v Curlett Cannon 
 at p 102. This was his response at p 103: 
 
The wide class of obligation which can be secured by a pledge is later stated by Story J as follows (para 300) [from 
 The Law of Bailments
 (1878) 9th Ed]:
 
 
 
`
 It may be delivered as security for a future debt or engagement
, as well as for a past debt; for one or for many debts and engagements; upon condition, or absolutely; for a limited time, or for an indefinite period. It matters not what is the nature of the debt or the engagement. The contract of pledge is not confined to an engagement for the payment of money; but it is susceptible of being applied to any other lawful contract whatever.`
 
 
 
See to the same effect 
 Cotte on Mortgages
, op cit, Vol II p 1459, 
 Fisher and Lightwood
, op cit, p 108, and 
Paton on Bailments
 
[1952] p 358
.
 
 
 
 
 These authorities sufficiently show that a pledge may be constituted by a security for a debt which shall or may arise in the future
 or which has arisen at a time other than that of the delivery. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
He went on at p 103 to apply this statement of law to the facts on hand: 
 
Here, 
 when the bills of lading came into the hands of the customs agent, possession of the goods was constructively delivered to them for the purposes of a pledge
 (as set out in cl 22) and there was either an immediate liability and debt created for services thereafter to be performed or, 
 at the least, as soon as those services were performed a debt would arise which was of a kind which would support a pledge. The fact that the bills were delivered before the debt arose could not deprive the customs agents of their agreed rights as pledgee
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It is clear from the above that Ormiston J undertook a considered and extensive review of the authorities in arriving at his conclusion that there can be a pledge for a contingent debt. There seems little reason to disagree with this. The earliest statement of a pledge dates back three centuries, when Sir John Holt CJ said in 
Coggs v Bernard
 
[1703] 2 Ld Raym 909
 at 913 that: 
 
... when goods or chattels are delivered to one another as a pawn, to be a security to him for money borrowed of him by the bailor; and this is called in Latin vadium, and in English a pawn or a pledge.
 
 
 
As Professor Goode observed in 
 Commercial Law 
 (2nd Ed) at pp 643-644: 
 
... in the early days of the common law, the taking of possession by the creditor was almost a 
 sine qua non
 of a valid security interest ... With the development of documentary intangibles the scope of the pledge increased. It could now be applied not only to goods but also to documents of title to goods and to instruments embodying a money obligation. Further it was not necessary for the creditor to take or retain physical possession; it sufficed that he had constructive possession through a third party or even through the debtor himself, a particularly useful rule for banks financing the import of goods against a pledge of shipping documents, for these could safely be released to the buyer against a trust receipt.
 
 
 
The scope of a pledge has therefore expanded through the centuries, thereby ensuring the retention of its utility as a security device with changing times. The underlying rationale for security interests such as pledges, as well as liens and mortgages, is to facilitate commerce, and if a pledge for a contingent debt can serve a useful commercial purpose, and there is no denying its utility in the COE bidding context for both Auto Asia and their customers, there seems no reason to unduly confine the pledge to being a security device for existing debts.
In any event, even if a pledge should be so confined, the vehicle documents, being deposited as security for the unpaid portion of the required COE deposit of $8,000 in cash, is a pledge for an existing debt. Thus, Mr Wong`s argument that there is no pledge for a contingent debt fell either way.
 Right to sub-pledge 
 
 
 
In the Court of Queen`s Bench`s decision in 
Donald v Suckling
 
[1866] LR 1 QB 585
, Mellor J had held that there is no authority for implying a general term against a sub-pledge to the extent of the pledgee`s interest, unless prohibited by an express term of the contract. Mr Wong therefore argued that even if there was a pledge, Mr Koh was prevented from sub-pledging the vehicle documents to DP because of the restrictive wording of the form. This point can be dealt with quickly. The form has been reproduced above at [para ] 4. What Mr Wong relied on was the phrase towards the end of the form which states: 
 
Upon successful COE bidding and time of registration, I shall allow Auto Asia (S) Pte Ltd to sell or scrap my car/PARF cert and to redeem the amount they have paid for the COE bidding.
 
 
 
However, what this prohibits is the sale of the vehicle document before successful COE bidding and registration. It does not prohibit a sub-pledge of the vehicle document before the described event. Mr Wong`s reliance on 
Jaswantrai v State of Bombay
 (Unreported) was for this reason misplaced. In that case, it was clear from the cited portion of the agreement and from Sinha J`s explanation at p 581 that there were specific prohibitions in the agreement against dealing with the security until the occurrence of certain contingencies, namely, failure to maintain the proper margin or default in repayment. Since none of those contingencies had arisen, the pledgee bank had no right to deal with the securities by way of a pledge, sub-pledge or assignment. In sharp contrast with 
 Jaswantrai v State of Bombay 
, the form does not contain any prohibition against sub-pledging.
Mr Wong`s response was to argue that, in any event, the court should not look only to the express wording of the form, but at the contemplation of the parties, and that both the customers and the sales staff were of the view that Auto Asia was not authorised to sub-pledge the vehicle documents. In this, however, he was confronted by ss 93 and 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). Section 93 provides that: 
 
When the terms of a contract or of a grant or of any other disposition of property have been reduced by or by consent of the parties to the form of a document ... no evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract, grant or other disposition of property or of such matter except the document itself, or secondary evidence of its contents in cases in which secondary evidence is admissible under the provisions of this Act.
 
 
 
Section 94 goes on to state: 
 
When the terms of any such contract, grant or other disposition of property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have been proved according to section 93, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument or their representatives in interest for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms subject to the following provisions ...
 
 
 
None of the provisos to s 94 applied to the facts of this case. The application of s 94 has been considered by the Court of Appeal in 
Ng Lay Choo Marion v Lok Lai Oi
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 221
 . There, the court held that where the alleged terms of the oral agreement are in addition to and therefore inconsistent with the written contract, that evidence is inadmissible.
Mr Wong sought to strengthen his attempt to bring in parol evidence by arguing that the court should take a wide approach in criminal proceedings, and look beyond the true interpretation of the form from a commercial point of view, and look instead at what the parties understood as the terms of entrustment. I did not find this argument compelling. The purpose of the general rule against parol evidence is to ensure that there is at least some modicum of certainty in commercial transactions. Where criminal liability is involved, there is an even stronger argument that the legality of parties` actions must be based on what is certain, as set out in the document, as opposed to being based on the subjective intention of each party.
It is clear from the above that there was a pledge of the vehicle documents by the customers with Auto Asia, without any restriction on sub-pledging. Mr Koh therefore could not be said to be misappropriating the vehicle documents when he sub-pledged them to DP for financing. Having failed to establish a key element of the offence, the appeal fell on this ground alone.
 Dishonest misappropriation 
 
 
 
The second issue in this appeal, that of dishonest misappropriation, would have arisen only if there was, in the first place, misappropriation of the vehicle documents. Having found that there was no misappropriation, I did not find it necessary to go into the question of whether there was any dishonest misappropriation.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In light of the above reasons, I dismissed the appeal without calling on Mr Shanmugam to present the case for Mr Koh.

 Introduction 
Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in the seminal case of 
Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan (Philip Kok Ming)
 
[1995] 2 AC 378
 at p 392 laid down the rule that `(a) liability in equity to make good resulting loss attaches to a person who dishonestly procures or assists in a breach of trust or fiduciary obligation.` This case raises issues generally about the elements of this rule. In particular, the specific question of law raised in this case is whether a third party, without receiving and mishandling any trust property, is liable to account for a loss sustained by a principal as a result of a third party inducing or assisting a fiduciary in the commission of a breach of fiduciary duty. In the factual context of this case, which initially involved share transactions and later foreign exchange contracts, three important issues of fact are raised, namely, (1) whether the two third parties in question had `assisted` the fiduciary in breaches of his fiduciary obligations; (2) if so, whether the assistance caused the losses in question; and (3) subject to the answers to questions (1) and (2) being in the affirmative, whether they had assisted the fiduciary dishonestly. There are, however, other causes of action and they raise important issues of fact and law which will later emerge in this judgment.
The plaintiff is a multinational bank incorporated in France. At all material times, it carried out banking business but was restricted to operate only a branch in Singapore. It has a substantial presence in Singapore. Its Private Banking Department (`PBD`) was staffed by private banking officers or OICs, who were all headed at the material time by Mr Pierre Michel Hamery (`Hamery`). He was posted out of Singapore long before the hearing of this case and though still in its employ he was not called to give evidence on behalf of the bank.
The first defendant, Gary Hew Keong Chan (`Hew`) was an employee of the plaintiff from 23 May 1988 until his dismissal in the latter part of October 1998. Prior to his dismissal he was holding the position of an Assistant Vice President in the plaintiff`s PBD. Hew was not called by any of the three parties in these proceedings to give evidence.
The second and third defendants named in this action were not in any way concerned with the matters in issue in this case. Judgment has been entered by the plaintiffs against them on entirely separate transactions. Though they were the private banking clients of the plaintiff and were attended to by Hew, it was common ground that they did not know and had nothing to do with either the fourth or fifth defendant in relation to the transactions in question in this case.
In 1991 Hew married the fourth defendant (`Nancy`) but to all intents and purposes they ceased living as husband and wife from 1995. At all material times, they did not live together and, apart from interacting with each other over private banking transactions from 26 December 1996, they were not in communication with each other. They led separate lives. Nancy, 37 years old, is a university graduate with a degree of Bachelor of Science (Estates Management) from the National University of Singapore. Since her graduation in 1986 she has been working in the property management line of business. She is a senior manager with a property developer`s section on Corporate Affairs. An executive and a secretary work under her.
The fifth defendant (`Tan`) is 40 years old and is the elder brother of Nancy. He was at all material times a businessman. From 1995 to 1998 he made many trips to Hong Kong, running the business of a printing company known as Oriental Sincere Printing Ltd in which he had invested HK$10m. That business and another company, known as Panasia Holdings Limited which was registered in the British Virgin Islands, suffered considerable losses. He was therefore no longer actively involved in the affairs of either company. When he gave evidence before me, he was employed by a company owned by his cousin to perform general clerical and messenger duties. His salary was $1,200 per month. He is married with 3 children whose ages ranged from 8 months to 5 years.
Tan became a customer of the plaintiff on 9 May 1994. Initially, he carried out some ordinary banking transactions. I will come to the controversial and hotly disputed transactions later on. On 26 December 1996 Nancy also opened her Singapore dollar current account with the plaintiff at the request of Hew. Hew had also informed Nancy that the purpose was to use the account and the securities she had placed in her account as a third party pledge for her brother, Tan`s account. It should be pointed out that by the end of September 1998 Hew had handled the accounts of both Nancy and Tan so badly that they were owing the plaintiff substantial sums of money. Tan`s liabilities, without taking into account his assets, was US$1,253,854.46. Nancy`s `contingent` liabilities on forward foreign exchange was quite high: see 5AB1209.
In the first week of October 1998 Hew entered into speculative foreign exchange transactions amounting to US$9m in the names of the second defendant, third defendant, Nancy and Tan in the respective amounts of US$2m, US$2m and US$5m respectively. In the belief, which was popularly held at the material times, that the Japanese Yen would weaken, Hew sold JYP short against the US$9m. He therefore anticipated that a huge profit would be made by entering into nine contracts to reverse the earlier contracts when the Japanese Yen weakened. Obviously, and here admittedly I am inferring that Hew thought that this was an opportunity not to be missed to recoup the losses sustained in the accounts of both Nancy and Tan. Hew entered into those highly volatile exchange transactions without the authorisation of Nancy and Tan. In fact, Tan was completely unaware of the disputed transactions until after Hew informed him on the evening of 8 October 1998 that substantial losses had been incurred and the plaintiff was about to close out the positions. Hew had also informed Nancy about the disputed transactions.
A dramatic strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the US dollar took place starting on 6 October 1998 when the average rate was JPY 132. By 8 October 1998 it took only JPY 116 to exchange for US$1. At about 6:43pm on 8 October 1998 the plaintiff closed out all positions taken out by Hew regarding the US$9m disputed transactions. In consequence, the heavy losses incurred in the names of the second to fifth defendants were crystallised.
On 15 October 1998 Nancy faxed a letter to the plaintiff formally informing it that she was not aware and had not authorised Hew to enter into the disputed transactions in her name. Two days later, she lodged a report to the police.
Following investigations by the Commercial Affairs Department (`CAD`) Hew was charged with seven offences relating to his authorised trading in breach of s 102(b) of the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289) and s 54(b) of the Futures Trading Act (Cap 116). The prosecution proceeded with three charges, and four others were taken into consideration for sentencing.
On 8 July 1999 Hew pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a term of 12 months` imprisonment. The statement of facts admitted by him included summaries of the three types of unauthorised transactions he had entered into. They were (1) authorised securities transactions in the name of Tan, (the second charge); (2) unauthorised forex transactions in the name of Tan, (the fifth charge); and (3) unauthorised Forex transactions in the name of Nancy (the seventh charge). Hew in open court admitted to the sentencing district judge that he had entered into the disputed transactions in the names of Tan and Nancy without their authorisations.
 The plaintiff`s claims 
 
 
 
According to the plaintiff`s re-amended statement of claim and the plaintiff`s opening, the plaintiff claims that Nancy and Tan had given express and specific authority or general authority to Hew to enter into the forex transactions and that Tan had done so in respect of the share transactions. Alternatively, it claims that they had by their respective conduct ratified or adopted Hew`s unauthorised acts in respect of the disputed transactions.
It should be noted that the plaintiff by paras 17 to 19 of the re-amended statement of claim has pleaded together the tort of procuring a breach of contract and the equitable wrong of dishonest assistance. Those paragraphs were preceded by the caption `Procuring breach of contract/Accessory Liability`. In short, it asserts that Nancy and Tan had procured Hew to breach the term in his contract of employment with the plaintiff under which that he, Hew, was not permitted to enter into foreign exchange transactions in the name and for the account of a customer of the plaintiff without authorisation from the customer. By those paragraphs, the plaintiff also avers that both Nancy and Tan knew that Hew could not transact for his own purposes and benefit using the name of a customer as it would breach his fiduciary duties of good faith and fidelity owed to the plaintiff. At the commencement of the hearing, counsel for the plaintiff focussed on the specific allegation that Nancy and Tan dishonestly assisted Hew in breaches of his fiduciary obligations owed to the plaintiff.
Alternatively, by para 20 of the re-amended statement of claim the plaintiff avers that `from in or about the period between 26 January 1996 to 8 October 1998 and/or thereafter each of ... (Nancy) and (Tan) unlawfully conspired with (Hew) separately or alternatively together to injure the plaintiff by unlawful means ...`. The unlawful means relied on are the alleged procurement of a breach of contract and dishonest assisting a fiduciary in breaching his fiduciary duties. The plaintiff alleges that Nancy and Tan did the following overt acts. The first act was allowing Hew to conduct foreign exchange transactions or enter into purchase and sale transactions of shares (in the case of Tan) in their respective names and on their respective accounts `when they knew that they would not assume liability for these transactions in the event of loss and when they knew or ought reasonably to have known that (Hew) by doing so was in breach of his duty of good faith and fidelity to the (plaintiff) or fiduciary obligation owned to the (plaintiff).` Their second act relied on by the plaintiff was in permitting Hew to use their respective accounts with the plaintiff to remit and/or to receive funds from various accounts, including the accounts of the other defendants. The next two overt acts were really acts of omissions. The plaintiff says that they failed to inform it that Hew entered into the transactions without their authority. They further failed to inform the plaintiff that Hew was entering into the relevant transactions nominally in their respective names but they were contracted for Hew`s `own purpose`. Finally, the plaintiff relies on the attempts of both Nancy and Tan to evade liability incurred `in relation to certain transactions purportedly on the ground that (Hew) had not been authorised by them to enter into the said transactions. The `certain` transactions were not identified but the case proceeded on the basis that all disputed transactions were meant to be referred to.
By para 24 of the re-amended statement of claim, the plaintiff further alleges that Nancy and Tan owed the plaintiff a duty to notify it of any unauthorised transactions of which they had become aware. It goes on to assert that both of them knew about the relevant transactions listed in Sch 2 to the statement of claim. In this connection, the plaintiff relies on the following matters. First, it refers to the confirmations of foreign exchange transactions, of the debit and credit notices and the periodic statements of the accounts which Nancy and Tan received or which were, at any rate, sent to their address, which was one and the same. Secondly, Hew informed them of the transactions. Thirdly, Nancy gave written instructions to Hew to remit profits arising from the foreign exchange transactions to the accounts of various parties. Lastly, Tan acknowledged through telephone messages in the voice-mail of the plaintiff`s representative, Hammery, on 8 October 1998 that he agreed to close out the USD-JYP positions for the relevant exchange transactions.
So far as Tan is concerned, and in relation only to the share transactions, the plaintiff asserts that he knew of those transactions. First, confirmations of the share transactions, confirmations of the debits or credits of his account and periodic statements of his account were sent to him at his Singapore address which he shared with Nancy. Secondly, Hew did inform him of those share transactions.
The plaintiff asserts that Nancy and Tan failed to inform it that they had not authorised the transactions. If they had, the October 1998 forex transactions could have been avoided. The loss of Japanese Yen 156,392,000 (or US$1,309,487.00 at the then prevailing exchange rate of Japanese Yen 119.43 to US$1 as at 14 October 1998) would have been averted.
I now come to the plaintiff`s claim under the credit facilities agreement which was agreed by Tan. By a letter of 13 August 1997 the plaintiff increased the credit facilities granted to Tan on 20 June and 9 December 1994 respectively upon the terms and conditions which Tan indisputably had signed in writing on 20 October 1997 [lcub ]`the facility`). This was nearly a year before the October 1998 forex transaction disaster carried out by Hew. The material terms of the facility are now set out. The credit facilities granted a multi-currency short term loan and/or overdraft up to US$2m (or its equivalent in other currencies) for general investment purposes. The rate of interest shall be at the rate of the plaintiff`s prime rate plus 0.5% per annum for the overdraft and at the rate of the plaintiff`s cost of fund plus 1% per annum for short term loan. The facility was secured by a charge over cash dated 30 May 1994 and a memorandum of charge/deposit dated 30 May 1996 both executed by Tan and the memorandum of charge/deposit dated 26 December 1996 which was executed by Nancy. She also executed a charge on cash amounts dated 26 December 1996 to secure the liability of Tan to the plaintiff. That these documents were all executed were proved by those documents. Both Tan and Nancy offered their explanations. To those I will turn in due course. As at 31 March 1999, there has been owing by Tan under the facility substantially in respect of the cost of the shares purchased, losses incurred in respect of the trading in shares, foreign exchange losses in respect of the conversion of the currency of the loans and accrued interest. Despite a demand,
Accordingly, the plaintiff`s claims against both Nancy and Tan are based on five causes of action. They are (1) accessory liability for dishonestly assisting Hew`s breaches of his fiduciary duties; (2) breach of the duty to inform the plaintiff of Hew`s unauthorised transactions; (3) express or general authorisation of Hew`s activities; (4) procuring a breach of Hew`s employment contract with the plaintiff; and (5) conspiracy with Hew. The plaintiff claims from Tan the outstanding amount due and payable under the facility.
The plaintiff claims JYP90,662,000 against Tan in relation to losses incurred on the October 1998 disputed forex transactions. It is also claiming JYP 161,033,593 from Tan under certain credit facilities. It is not disputed before me that the balance on Tan`s loan account with the plaintiff largely arose in respect of share transactions and forex exchange losses on conversion of the loans. Tan claims that these earlier transactions were entered into solely by Hew for his own benefit and account and without his authorisation. He explained to me that he had allowed them to stand as debits in his account and had done a number of things, which I will elaborate, because he did not want to expose Hew and cause him to lose his job.
The plaintiff claims JPY32,365,000 against Nancy as losses incurred in her account with it as a result of the two October 98 forex transaction entered into by Hew in her name. In the alternative, it claims against each of the five defendants for the total sum of JYP156,392,000 and JYP161,033,593 notwithstanding that not all the transactions were booked into their accounts as the plaintiff alleges that the defendants and each of them had conspired by unlawful means to procure Hew to breach his contract of employment with it.
The plaintiff further avers that Nancy and Tan, by reason of their failure to inform the plaintiff that the previous transactions were unauthorised and having taken a number of actions which will be set out later, they are now estopped from asserting that they had not authorised the subsequent disputed forex transactions which Hew entered into in October 1998.
 Nancy`s counterclaims 
 
 
 
Nancy asserts three counterclaim against the plaintiff. She avers that there is in the contract for private banking services an implied term that the plaintiff would exercise all due professional skill and care in handling her accounts with it.
Alternatively, she asserts that the plaintiff owed her a duty of care in the law of tort. She says that the plaintiff was in breach of the implied term or duty of care and the particulars are set out in paras 33 and 34 of her re-amended defence and counterclaim. Thirdly, she avers that the plaintiff was in breach of its fiduciary duties owed to her as a private banking customer. She therefore claims for (1) restoration of her collateral placed with the plaintiff in the form of 37,588 UOB Ltd local shares and 10,000 UIC Ltd shares; (2) a declaration that the plaintiff is not entitled to claim from her losses arising from the unauthorised transactions amounting to Japanese Yen32,365,000 or its equivalent as at 14 October 1998; and costs.
 Tan`s counterclaims 
 
 
 
Similarly, Tan like his sister claims that the plaintiff has committed breaches of its contractual duty to exercise professional skill and its duty of care in tort. He also alleges that the plaintiff had breached its fiduciaries duties. The particulars of those averments are set out in paras 46 to 48 of Tan`s amended defence and counterclaim. He therefore asks for the following relief: (1) restoration of collateral in the form of 234,613 UOB shares and fixed deposit of US$50,000 as at 4 November 1997, including all accrued dividends and interest thereto; (2) a declaration that the plaintiff is not entitled to claim from him losses arising from the unauthorised transactions amounting to JY90,662,000 as at 14 October 1998; (3) a declaration that the plaintiff is not entitled to claim from him the alleged loan facility in the sum of JY161,033,593 as at 31 March 1999; and a declaration that the plaintiff is not entitled to claim from him damages of US$1,309,487 as pleaded in paras 17 to 19 and 23 to 28 of the re-amended statement of claim.
 The background 
 
 
 
I return to the PBD of the plaintiff. For the purposes of this case, it is necessary to set out briefly the structure of its private banking business and the documented control procedures. The OICs of PBD, who are employees of the plaintiff, provide customised services to clients on a one on one basis. They advise clients on financial matters, investment decisions and/or portfolio management. In the usual course of business they would call a dealer in forex with the dealing room in the Treasury Department to place the orders of the trades on behalf of clients. The dealer would then key in the order into the plaintiff`s system. Mr Raymond Goh (PW2) was one such PBD dealer, who accepted instructions from PBD OICs. The procedures required the OICs to give, and the dealers to be informed, of the name of the client at the time the order was placed with the dealing room.
The trades done by the dealers were captured by the plaintiff`s electronic information system. Prior to May 1998, dealers would fill in deal tickets to be passed to Treasury Operations (`TOPS`). After May 1998, dealers and their assistants would key into the system the relevant particulars of the contract deals. The details would be contained in a form or dealing slip. Ms Carol Oehlers (PW3), the Operations Manager, was at all material times in charge of the back office. Where the dealing slips contained the names of the clients these documents would confirm that the procedure of receiving trades with clients` names had been complied with by Treasury Department. If the dealing slips arrived on a `no-name` basis, the backroom should become aware that the prescribed procedure had not been complied with.
The plaintiff`s system also generated a confirmation notice which was shortly thereafter sent to customers in the usual way. These confirmations were supposed to be signed and returned by the customer to the plaintiff to confirm and acknowledge the trade. Its system provided for the despatch of a further confirmation to the customer if that customer failed to acknowledge the trade. However, its system took no further step thereafter to obtain confirmation from customers.
According to the evidence led, the PBD at all material times had a Risk Manager who was a senior management position. His job was to monitor and review the PBD portfolio, identify irregular accounts and ensure that all such irregular accounts are regularised. He had access to current information on a daily basis. According to normal procedure, he would in the first instance request the OIC concerned to deal with any irregularity. If any irregularity was not dealt with to his satisfaction, he had to inform the Head of PBD or report it to the Chief Controller. At the material times, the Risk Manager was Mr Chong Tjang Shing. In the wake of the events which led to this piece of litigation he was dismissed from the service of the plaintiff. His dismissal was the consequence of an adverse report by the plaintiff`s external auditors. The Chief Controller was and is Mr Colin Meyer (PW9).
The plaintiff had in place periodic internal and external audits. Internal audits were conducted on the PBD and the Treasury Department.
In relation to foreign exchange contracts, the court was told that clients could be granted extensions. The effect of such extensions was to postpone the maturity or settlement date of the contract. The plaintiff allowed extensions on either the historical rate (ie the rate at which the first contract was transacted) or the current market rate. However, extensions of forward contracts at historical rates wee regarded as irregular and these were accordingly highlighted in a weekly Summary prepared by the Treasury Department. The Summary was inspected, or supposed to be inspected, by many officers, including, among others, the Chief Controller and the Head of PBD. They had the discretion to investigate any account which suggested a pattern of extensions at historical rates or the postponement of a problem account. It was an important piece of internal control.
 The banking transactions of Tan and Nancy 
 
 
 
I should now outline the banking transactions which were booked in the names of both Tan and Nancy. They could be broadly divided into three phases, namely (1) the initial, uneventful phase during which minor banking business was done; (2) the controversial phase during which both Tan and Nancy learnt of Hew`s unauthorised share transactions, their reticence and, significantly (at least from the perspective of the plaintiff, their provisions of `topping up` securities to enable Hew to comply with the plaintiff`s margin calls; and (3) the October 1998 forex transactions which turned out so disastrously. On 9 May 1994 Tan opened a Singapore dollar current account with the plaintiff through Hew. He placed a fixed deposit of S$250,000 with the plaintiff. Using his fixed deposit as security, he obtained a bank guarantee from the plaintiff in favour of the Controller of Immigration for $125,000 to enable his 12-year-old nephew, who was liable to perform national service in Singapore, to live with his parents in Hong Kong. The guarantee would be called if his nephew failed to return to Singapore to perform his national service duties.
In opening his current accounts, Tan signed a document headed `Specimen Signature Card-Individuals`. He did not fill in his personal particulars because Hew offered to fill in the necessary details for him.
In November 1994 Tan needed to finance the activities of his two companies, one of which was the printing company in Hong Kong. On Hew`s advice, he applied for and was granted personal overdraft facilities up to $123,000 which were secured against the balance of his fixed deposit with the plaintiff. He signed the letter of application drafted by Hew and a document entitled `Irrevocable Letter of Authority` dated 28 November 1994. In due course, he operated the overdraft account and kept it within the limit. Tan told the court that Hew habitually asked him to sign a number of documents at one time. On such occasions Hew would put crosses where he was required to sign. Tan said he used to sign as Hew turned the pages rapidly.
In preparing for this trial, Tan had read para 6 in the document and it stated: 
 
The maximum amount which the Bank shall be entitled to act in accordance with any single instruction given by me/us and by telephone and/or telex and/or fax shall be ... and in default of any specified sum United States Dollars Five Hundred Thousand (US$500,000/[equals]) or its equivalent in my/our currrency.
 
 
 
In January 1996 Hew was promoted to the position of Assistant Vice President, Private Banking. In February that year, Tan applied to convert his overdraft into a term loan. He claims that Hew had advised him to do so as interest would be cheaper and less hassle of having to deposit money into the overdraft account. He claimed that Hew drafted the letter for him. Having heard him in court I accept that Hew did draft the letter for him.
On 1 March 1996 the S$100,000 loan was credited to Tan`s account No 01-012617-001-41. The account (`Account 1`) was used mainly to remit money in Hong Kong dollars to Panasia Holdings Limited. Tan entered into several foreign exchange (`fx` ) transactions to purchase HKD. The spot sales of Hong Kong dollars and the plaintiff`s purchase of Singapore dollars were confirmed by the plaintiffs confirmation printouts which were despatched to the residence of Tan at Toh Tuck Place, Singapore.
By a letter of 16 April 1996 which Tan signed he instructed the plaintiff to open a BNP Nominees Account and a new SGD current account for the purpose of settlement of share transactions, and to appoint Nancy as the power of attorney to operate these two new accounts. The new Singapore dollar current account opened could be refered to as `Account 2`. Documents in the plaintiff also showed that Tan had entered into an agreement with BNP Nominees Singapore Pte Ltd.
Although Hew did not give evidence on behalf of the plaintiff, suffice it to say that the averments in its statement of claims, which referred to the establishment of the facility, the share transactions and the conversions into different currencies were all proved by the contemporaneous documents. Between 17 April 1996 and 9 January 1998, there were 116 share purchases and 120 share sales done in the name of the account of Tan. Every transaction had at least a confirmation sent out to Tan. The last share transaction of Tan took place on 9 January 1998. That they did take place was not in dispute. Tan said in evidence that he knew as early as July 1996 upon receipt of an advice from the plaintiff that Hew was using his account for unauthorised share transactions. He knew he could have reported to the authorities and knew that Hew could have lost his job. Tan says that he decided against reporting. He decided not to report Hew as Hew had promised to sell the shares. He says he trusted him. Instead of keeping his word, Hew bought more shares. Those transactions are denied by Tan. He says he did not know. However, in April 1997 Tan was again told by Hew that there was a need to top up his account by additional collateral. Although he claims that he was shocked yet he allowed about 219,613 UOB shares (which were worth about S$1.88m) to be mortgaged as additional securities to meet the margin call. The issue is whether both Tan and Nancy are still bound by their mortgages of their respective tranches of shares.
I turn now to the forex transactions. It was on 13 February 1998 that the forex transactions booked under the account of Tan first started. They were mainly JYP-USD deals. They continued until end of September, 1998 and they culminated in the October 1998 deals. The usual confirmations, confirmations for debits or credits and periodic statement of accounts were sent to Tan at his address.
On 5 March 1998 Hew was recorded in the plaintiff`s automatic voice recording system, which was in place to record conversations and instructions of clients and all other conversations, to have telephoned Tan at about 7.47pm. They talked for about 13 minutes. They began by talking generally about the banking scene in Hong Kong, about banks having to make provisions. Tan said his bank was calling in the banking lines. This was in the wake of the Asian financial crisis which began in July 1997. Then Hew informed Tan that he had entered into two forex transactions in the name of Tan. Hew `opened two contracts, which (he) closed, both today`. That was because the dollar rallied very quickly against the Ringgit. In one contract, there was a `small` loss of RM62,000 whereas the other had a profit of RM153,000. The net profit was about RM91,000. Tan was interested in the profit. When Hew mentioned that it was noticed that Tan did not have a line with the plaintiff Tan immediately observed that he did have a line, to which the profit presumably could be channelled. But Hew told him that the line in question was only for the financing of shares. As required by the plaintiff`s risk control people, Hew said that Tan had to sign and return the Risks Disclosure Form .
On the following day the plaintiff wrote to Tan informing him of the net profit from the forex contracts done between 13 February and 5 March 1998 and enclosing the confirmation and the risk disclosure statement for Tan`s signature. He signed and returned the confirmation and risk disclosure statement duly signed. Tan therefore knew of the two forex contracts, that Hew entered into them without reference to him and he did not protest. There was of course the net profit which Tan was anxious to keep. From the tone, tenor and terms of the telephonic conversation, it was clear that this was the first occasion that Tan was apprised of the entry into forex transaction without his approval.
In July 1997 Nancy sold several lots of UOB shares to raise funds to buy a property in the UK and to meet various cheque payments. She bought British Pound to effect payments on two occasions for her property in the UK. Apart from those, there were no foreign exchange transactions until April 1998. From then until October 1998 there were forex transactions. They were mainly JPY-USD. In the usual way, the plaintiff despatched its requests for confirmations to her and the off-setting confirmations. As reflected in the monthly current account statements despatched to her, profits and losses from the forex transactions were credited to or debited from her relevant current accounts.
As I will revert to later in greater detail, Nancy maintains that she had authorised Hew to open only one SGD account and had not authorised him to open the other two JYP and RM accounts in her name. As she had not authorised the opening of the JYP account, and as she knew nothing about the two October 1998 JYP forex transactions, she denies responsibility for them. She maintains that she was deceived by Hew into signing a booklet shortly after 15 July 1998. She thought her signing of the booklet was to `update` her records, as stated in the plaintiff`s accompanying letter, signed by the plaintiff`s Head, Credit & Customer Services, Private Banking and Hew in his capacity as Assistant Vice President, Private Banking. Hew, she claims, had after her signature filled in the booklet to open accounts in JYP and MYR currencies without her authorisation at all.
On 23 April 1998 Hew and Nancy had a brief telephone conversation. The plaintiff produced the transcript after Tan had sworn her affidavit evidence in chief. Hew informed her that there was a contra profit of JYP3.5m which would be credited into her account and he said he would prepare a note for her to sign to transfer the profits to her brother`s account. I heard the recording.
Four days later, they had another brief conversation. Hew had made JYP1.3m and he arranged again for her to sign the transfer of the profit to Tan`s account. Nancy signed three letters dated 23 April, 98, 24 April 1998 and 27 April 1998, which were prepared by Hew for the transfers of profits to Tan`s account.
The plaintiff produced a transcript of a telephone conversation between Hew and Tan. Hew called Tan who was in Hong Kong on 29 July 1998 and their conversation lasted between 4.17pm and 4.27pm. After the usual preliminaries, Hew mentioned that the plaintiff`s management wanted a written commitment from Tan to reduce his loan to the plaintiff. Hew suggested that they try to pay US$20,000 per month. Tan exclaimed: `Wah, how am I going to do that?`. Hew, quite solicitously responded: `We have to, you know, eh eh eh, do some you know currency trading to ... to ... earn it lah ... on a conservative basis, ah? So try to ... its not a, a, a big sum lah, ...`. Hew said that he had told the plaintiff`s management that Tan would try to, starting from August 1998. He said he had drafted a letter. Tan cautioned against giving too firm a commitment and suggested to Hew to draft the letter saying that Tan would `attempt` to pay. Tan was obviously hesitant and a little earlier in the conversation he adverted to Hew`s ability to make that much of profit from currency trading by asking him: `... how`s your confidence (laugh) in doing it main? Aiyah ...` Hew assured Tan by saying: `So anyway there`s no firm commitment, you know I`m sure we`ll try to ... raise this sum, and ... we`ll try to raise more lah ...`
Following the conversation, Hew sent him the draft letter. Tan signed it and faxed it to the plaintiff for the attention of Hew. The letter referred to his two accounts and his loan from the plaintiff. He stated that he was `aware that the utilisation margin is in excess of the agreed ratio of 60% of the market valuation of the pledged shares` and that because of cashflow in the wake of the `ongoing economic crisis affecting Asia`, he requested for a grace period. As a starter, he stated that he would attempt to reduce his loan by about US$20,0000 per month starting next month.
We now come to the events on the eve of the highly disputed forex transactions effected by Hew in October 1998. He called Nancy at about 6.09pm on Tuesday 29 September 1998. He has not been in touch with her for quite sometime. He asked her: `Where are you working now, by the way?`. He then proceeded to assure Nancy that her account was `completely regularised already`, that there was `no more overdraft in her account`. He then went on to say that there was a credit of `200 over thousand Yen ... almost 300,000 ... credit` in her account. He also told her that he had a `over 2m dollar Yen going into your account`. In the next breath, he told her that `there was a 2m over Yen contract ... which you know we put under your name, lah, ... so what happen is that tomorrow I will ... prepare a letter` which Nancy was asked to sign and fax back to him. The whole exercise was to effect payment out of her account. Nancy did not object and she did not ask for any particulars. We will come to her explanation later.
In relation to the loans of Tan, the loan which was designated Loan 5b was repaid through the drawdown of two new JPY loans for JPY100,000 (`loan 5c`) and JPY60,000 (`Loan 5d`). As reflected in the consolidated statements as at 31 March 1999 the total of the loans unpaid was JPY161,033,593: see AB1891.
Hew went on leave on 7 October 1998. Though he was on leave he gave instructions over the telephone. Between 30 September and 8 October 1998 he had either contracted or extended the maturity dates of ten forex contracts. Three of them were purportedly for the account of the second and third defendants. As they did not take part in these proceedings, we are not concerned with those transactions. Hew placed two orders in the name of Nancy. In each of them, she sold to the plaintiff US$1m and sold to it JPY at 133.33 with maturity date on 6 October 1998. That contract was extended by another at the rate of 133.18 with the maturity date on 14 October 1998. The other order was placed 6 October 1998 at 128.03 with maturity date on 9 October 1998. Hew had placed the orders for the contracts on a `no-name` basis, and the dealers had accepted and acted on them, contrary to established and prescribed procedures of the plaintiffs. Such a practice exposed customers of the plaintiff to very real abuses by the PBD OICs.
The other five forex contracts were all placed in the name of Tan by Hew. According to the evidence, the first deal bearing reference 10106926 was put in the name of Tan at about 3.49pm on 6 October 1998: see Vol 10(ii) AB2863. The second deal was placed on 1 Oct 1998 at 9.19am and Hew gave the name of Tan at 4.42pm. The third deal was placed on the morning of 1 October 1998 and Hew gave Tan`s name the following morning. In the morning of 7 October 1998 Hew sent to his assistant, Ms Harnin Sim, a fax showing the three deals as `BOT` (short for `Bought`) and this evidence (Vol 11AB3120) did not support the plaintiff`s assertion that in fact the apportionment of the three contracts to Tan was done before Hew knew they were confirmed done. It was conceded by Raymond Goh (PW2) that Tan`s name was only provided for the fourth deal at 9.30am on 7 October; the deal was placed with one Kok Chee on 6 October 1998 at 5.20pm. It should be noted, as will emerge later, the Japanese Yen strengthened to the average of 132.75 on 6 October and to 125.82 on 7 October 1998: see Vol 2AB590. The Yen reached the exceptional high of 116.2 average on 8 October 1998. It was plain that a loss had already occurred in respect of the fourth deal before it was confirmed in the name of Tan. The fifth and last forex deal was placed on a `no-name` basis by Hew on 6 October 1998 at 5.20pm with the dealer Kok Chee. The order was confirmed prior to 9.30am on 7 October 1998.
In the face of the cross over rise of JPY 19 for every US$, Treasury rooms the world over went into full alert, noting any big Yen positions. Mr Hammery telephoned Hew and told him that the plaintiff would close the ten forex contracts entered into under the accounts of the second to fifth defendants to cut losses. Mr Hammery noted at about 6pm on 8 October 1998 that there was a loss `of about $350,000`. He noted that the plaintiff already had `trouble with these people` (meaning the second and third defendants, Nancy and Tan). He told Hew to tell them that the plaintiff was closing out the Yen positions and that they were to bring in cash to cover the loss the next day.
On 8 October 1998 Hew informed Nancy and Tan, who was in Malaysia, of the forex deals which he had conducted in their name and which had incurred huge losses. According to both Nancy and Tan, Hew asked them to speak to Billy Au-Yeung and Mr Hammery respectively. According to Tan, Hew was crying over the telephone and requested him to telephone Mr Hammery to agree to the closing out of his positions. He said he agreed, just in case matters got worse, although he had no prior knowledge of the relevant forex deals in his name. They also say that Hew drafted two letters for them to send to the plaintiff. The gists of the drafts were to confirm that they, Nancy and Tan, had been apprised of the transactions and had agreed to Hew engaging in forex deals in an attempt to reduce the liabilities incurred in the account of Tan. The draft letters also included a plea to the plaintiff to give them time to pay off their liabilities arising out of the October 1998 forex deals. Those letters were not sent to the plaintiff.
On 8 October 1998 the plaintiff closed out the forex positions. Nancy`s account was debited with the loss of JPY32,365,000 and Tan`s account was debited with the loss of JPY90,662,000. Mr Hammery tried to contact Nancy and Tan and failing to do so he instructed Billy Au-Yeung (PW10), the Marketing/Account Manager of the plaintiff who was Head of PBD marketing and the immediate superior of Hew, to get in touch with them. On the same day, Tan, who was in Malaysia, left two voice messages in the voice-mail system of Mr Hammery. First, he left the message that Hew had told him about closing the forex positions. He said he would call again. Twenty minutes later, Tan called again. He said that he had heard from Hew that the plaintiff proposed to close his Yen positions and he said he `basically agreed` with the suggestion and he asked Mr Hammery politely to do so. He did not protest at all.
On 9 October 98 (Friday), Billy Au-Yeung spoke to Nancy over the telephone at 3.47pm. He told her that her two forex contracts had been closed out and the loss was about JPY32.4m. Billy Au-Yeung said that the plaintiff would like to know how she was going to settle these losses. In response, Nancy said: `Oh, I see. What are the various ways to be done?`. She said she was in a meeting and later she said she was driving at that time. She did not express any surprise and did not raise any objection.
After Hew returned from his leave on 9 October 1998 Mr Hammery and Ms Carol Oehlers (PW3) met him in the evening. Ms Oehlers made a note of the meeting at about 1pm the following day. She did not e-mail them, as its text suggested, but had rather sent hard copies to both the addressees, namely, Mr Hammery and Mr Yves Drieux. She recorded that Hew had told them that Tan had agreed with the US$5m forex contracts and that Tan`s sister had also agreed to the deals. It was not clear whether the approvals were `before or after` the deals: see Vol 2AB581 and the fourth and fifth paragraphs of Ms Oehlers affidavit evidence in chief.
On 12 October 1998 Nancy met Hew at the Westin Stamford lounge shortly before midnight. Hew`s brother, Michael Hew, was present. A friend of Nancy, Samantha Tan, was also present. Hew confessed to those present that he had carried out the two forex deals in Nancy`s name without her authorisation. He also admitted that he had not been authorised by Tan to enter into the five forex deals in October 1998.
On 13 October 1998 the plaintiff wrote to Nancy and Tan for their confirmations of the forex contracts in their names. On the following day, Tan wrote to the plaintiff and denied knowledge of or having authorised the five forex contracts.
On Wednesday, 14 October 1998 Mr Hammery, Carol Lau and Billy Au-Yeung met with Hew for his explanation regarding Tan`s denials. Hew told them for the first time that Nancy was his wife and Tan was his brother-in-law. He said he was separated from his wife for the past three to four years and that they did not speak to each other. He said he was still legally married to Nancy although each one was waiting for the other to start divorce proceedings. Hew said he had no family life which was why he spent so much time in the plaintiff bank.
Hew further told those present that the JPY loan outstanding in Tan`s account was due to his (Hew`s) own trading in shares for himself. He accepted full responsibility for the loan, saying that the account for Tan was originally opened for some facilities, like a bank guarantee, for Tan`s own requirements in respect of which Tan had deposited cash and shares as collateral. Subsequently, Tan cleared his outstandings with the plaintiff but left his shares as collateral to continue to secure the credit facility. Hew said he used the credit line to trade in shares for himself, which was why he felt he was responsible for the account.
Hew further explained that when utilisation went into excess of collateral sometime ago, Nancy pledged her shares as additional security to the plaintiff, for her brother`s account. Hew said that Nancy did this to help her brother, not to help him (Hew). Hew said she would not do anything to help him at all.
Hew had at the earlier meeting said that his research and analysis showed that the Japanese Yen would weaken against the US$. He decided to enter into those unauthorised October 1998 forex transactions to repay the loan outstanding in Tan`s account. Hew admitted that he had done wrong and confirmed that no one in the plaintiff bank had colluded with him on those transactions. Hew was reminded of the seriousness of his acts and told to speak to his family and find a solution. Hew signed the record of the meeting on 16 October 1998: see AB454.
On 15 October 1998 Nancy wrote to the plaintiff and denied any knowledge of or having authorised the transactions. ON 17 October 1998 both Nancy and Tan filed police reports. Nancy reported that Hew had told her on 8 October 1998 of two forex contracts. She reported that she had not instructed Hew to enter into any of the two transactions. Tan in his police report stated that Hew had traded in shares and forex transactions in his name without his authorisation. He said the losses were about US$750,000.
On 20 October 1998 Ms Oehlers on behalf of the plaintiff also filed their police report. On 28 October 1998 the plaintiff instituted this action against Hew. On the same day, it obtained a Mareva injunction against Hew.
On 16 April 1998 the plaintiff obtained an order of court granting leave to include in this action the second to fifth defendants as additional defendants. As stated earlier, Nancy is the fourth defendant and Tan is the fifth defendant.
As stated earlier, Hew pleaded guilty to three charges for unauthorised trading and was sentenced to 12 months` imprisonment.
 Hew`s evidence 
 
 
 
Hew was not called by any party to give evidence in court. It does not follow that no evidence may be led of what he had said or admitted in open court when he pleaded guilty. I will shortly set out those parts of his evidence which are admissible. Those admissible evidence, which have to be evaluated since Hew was not cross examined, will help resolve the question of fact whether Hew in fact had carried out unauthorised transactions, without the consent and authorisation of Nancy and Tan, or did they assist him dishonestly in his breaches of his fiduciary duties. The plaintiff alleges that Hew was taking the fall himself and was covering up and protecting both Nancy and Tan. That was the effect of the evidence of Ms Oehlers who alleges that Hew was lying to prevent the plaintiff from pursuing Nancy and Tan. She says that he had shifted from what he first told her and Mr Hammery. All the evidence will have to be carefully evaluated. On the question whether both Nancy and Tan had dishonestly assisted Hew, both the legal and the evidentiary burden of proof rests of course on the plaintiff.
Before I set out Hew`s admissible evidence I should describe him briefly. He is 39 years old and a Malaysian. He joined the plaintiff on 23 May 1988 and was employed by the plaintiff until his dismissal on 30 October 1998. He was suspended from 14 October 1998. He first joined as an Organisation & Methods Officer with the Data Processing/Organisation & Methods Department of the plaintiff. His functions were the development and improvement of systems and procedures within the plaintiff. He remained in that department until at his request he joined the plaintiff`s Private Banking Division from 1 April 1994. In September/October 1998, there were a total of 24 OICs in PBD. Hew was one of the six Assistant Vice Presidents. Following the closing out of the forex transactions on 8 October 1998 Hew met Mr Hammery and Ms Oehlers on 9 October and 14 October 1998.
As Hew had made statements against his interest during the second meeting, and which would expose him to a criminal prosecution or to a suit for damages, those statements are admissible under s 32(c) of the Evidence Act. He was recorded to have stated and he confirmed having stated: 
 
Gary [Hew] said that the JPY loan outstanding in Mr Tan`s account was due to Gary`s own trading in shares for himself. He claimed full responsibility for the loan, saying that the account for Mr Tan was originally opened for some facilities, like a B/G, for Mr Tan`s own requirements in respect of which, Mr Tan deposited cash and shares as collateral. Subsequently, Mr Tan cleared his outstanding account with the bank but left his shares as collateral with the bank to continue to secure the credit facility. Gary said that he used the credit line to trade in shares for himself, which is why he feels responsible for the remaining loan in Mr Tan`s account.
 
 
 
When the utilisation on Mr Tan`s account went into excess of collateral sometime ago, Ms Nancy Tan pledged her shares as additional security to the bank for her brother`s account. Gary said that his wife did this to help her brother, not to help him (Gary) as he said she would not do anything to help him at all.
 
 
 
Gary admitted that he had made the unauthorised JPY deals against USD for the three clients, viz USD5m for Mr Tan Shee Chin`s account, USD2m for Ms Nancy Tan`s account and USD2m for Mr Chan`s account.
 
 
 
After the matter had been reported to the Commercial Affairs Department, Nancy telephoned Hew in the evening of 20 October 1998. She had by then consulted her lawyers. She taped the conversation. Hew confirmed that he had initially traded in shares using Tan`s account. He incurred losses and he engaged in multi-currency trading in the hope of making a profit and paying off the liabilities. These admissions were clearly made and there was no indication, as suggested by counsel for the plaintiff, that the telephonic conversation was contrived. Hew also told Nancy that CAD officers had raided his office and his home earlier that day.
The important evidence elicited from Hew came from the admissions he made to the district judge in his statement of facts. He made the admissions in open court and their reliability is underscored by the fact that there could not be any suggestion of any coercion or mistake. Under s 45A of the Evidence Act the document containing the details of the charges, agreed statement of facts and the record of proceedings , where relevant, are admissible in evidence. These were all produced at the hearing.
Hew volunteered that, apart from the banking account known as SGD 41 account of Tan, he (Hew) gave instructions to the plaintiff`s officers to open other accounts in Tan`s name without Tan`s knowledge or consent. He was able to do this as the plaintiff`s procedure allowed customers to open additional accounts on the basis that they had signed the initial account opening form. Hew deceived the plaintiff`s officers by fraudulently misrepresenting that Tan had given the instructions to open the additional accounts. By these deceptions, Hew opened a Singapore dollar account and a Japanese Yen account in the name of Tan. Hew said he used these two accounts for the purposes of recording the transactions carried out by him but which `were not authorised by him`. By para 9 of the statement of facts, it was admitted by Hew that he `carried out his own share and foreign exchange trading in the other accounts of (Tan), which were kept separate from Tan`s own transactions carried out in Tan`s SGD 41 account`.
According to Hew, and as stated in para 12 of the statement of facts, Tan `subsequently became aware that (Hew) had opened other accounts in his name, which (Hew) was using for trading. (Tan) then confronted (Hew), who assured him that he would sell off the shares and close the accounts. (Hew) also took the responsibility for all the unauthorised trades at that time. Therefore (Tan) allowed (Hew) to continue trading in his accounts, in order to recover some of the losses incurred, and eventually to close out all the positions`.
Hew admitted that there was no profit-sharing between Hew and Tan from the unauthorised trades carried out in Tan`s accounts. Profits from Hew`s trades were used to repay personal loans taken by Hew, or to meet payments for Hew`s property in Malaysia. Some of the profits were also used to offset Hew`s trading losses in Tan`s accounts. The net losses incurred was about S$977,709.
In relation to Nancy`s account, Hew had without her knowledge and consent opened a Japanese Yen which Hew used to trade in Japanese Yen against the US dollar. Contrary to what was stated in para 21 of the statement of facts, Nancy in evidence denied any knowledge that Hew was using her account and disputed the fact that Hew had assured her that he (Hew) would be responsible for his transactions. She was asked if she had told the CAD officers that piece of information. She denied it. The plaintiff issued a writ of subpoena duces tecum to compel the CAD to produce Nancy`s statements given to CAD in official confidence. The CAD certified that it would be against the public interest to disclose those statements. Mr David Chong on behalf of the Attorney General applied to set aside the Writ under s 126 of the Evidence Act. In the end, I decided to read the statements of Nancy and finally decided that they were indeed given in official confidence pursuant to s 126 of the Evidence Act. Since the statements were excluded, there was no admissible evidence of Nancy to contradict Nancy`s evidence in court and the plaintiff cannot rely on para 21 of the statement of facts in the absence of Hew, who was there making a self-serving statement. The plaintiff, however, rely on the inference which must be drawn from the fact that confirmations had been systematically sent to Nancy following each forex deal and she must have read them and appreciated their import in view of her education and work experience. The plaintiff further relies on the fact that Hew had phoned her a few times and obtained her agreement to transfer funds to the account of Tan out of the profits from the forex deals. I will set out Nancy`s evidence, the submissions and my findings later in this judgment.
 Nancy`s evidence 
 
 
 
Although Nancy and Hew were separated and she was about to initiate divorce proceedings, they maintained a polite relationship with each other. She still trusted his professional competence and integrity, having known him as a hardworking and meticulous person. I gathered the distinct impression that she trusted him.
In December 1996, nearly two years before the October 1998 forex deals, Hew informed Nancy that Tan`s account was `irregular` and had to be topped up. She understood that to mean that her brother`s account had incurred losses. Hew did not inform her `as to why or how the (Tan`s) account had become ""irregular""`. That suppression of the material facts from Nancy was both unfair and dishonest. The omission calls into question whether her agreement to help her brother could be held against her. Nancy was aware that Tan had an account with the plaintiff through Hew. She remembers having signed a document sometime in 1996 giving her a power of attorney for Tan. She was merely informed by Hew that he had discussed the matter with Tan and that Tan had agreed to give Nancy the power of attorney. However, she never exercised her power under the power of attorney.
Nancy asserts in evidence that she and Tan never discussed financial matters at home. Tan lived in the same house with her when he was in Singapore but he was constantly overseas attending to his business in Hong Kong or spending time with his family in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
She persuaded me that she was willing to help her brother financially if she could do so. In connection with her agreement to help the `irregular` account of Tan, she signed several documents given to her by Hew. However, the details in all those documents were all left blank. She was merely asked by Hew to sign on the areas indicated by him. She did not read the documents as Hew said he would fill in the details for him. She was never challenged on this aspect of the evidence. She says that she trusted Hew to complete the details accurately.
At Hew`s request, she provided security in the form of 10,000 UIC shares and 40,000 UOB shares. Since the commencement of this litigation, she has been shown a folder entitled `Account Opening File`. She had not filled in the details. But that was the only account she had mandated to be opened.
Sometime in April 1997 she was told that Tan`s account had incurred further losses. She was shown plaintiff`s letter to Tan. It stated that Tan`s account had utilised 90% of the share values of the collateral provided. Again Hew did not inform her of how or why the loses were incurred. Hew asked Nancy to help. Hew expressly informed her that the securities would not be used for any other purpose. She provided additional UOB shares, which she could not even remember at the time she swore her affidavit evidence on 6 January 2000.
She came across as a person who had inherited her shares from her parents, just like Tan, her brother. They are children of a banker of a local bank and they were amply provided for by their late father, who founded a local bank. As between them, they were quite willing and ready to give each other financial assistance so long as they were able. Money did not really matter to her very much. Her entire working experience did not involve the financial markets. She did not trade in shares. She sold her own inherited shares whenever she needed money. She had no experience in any currency trading. Her knowledge of it was rudimentary.
As for the statements, confirmations and advices which were sent to her by the plaintiff, she tells me that she had no knowledge of the material ones. She had only read the initial monthly statements provided by the plaintiff in 1997. This was because she had bought British pounds to pay for her purchase of a property in London. Apart form those, she just left the other communications from the plaintiff unopened. CAD seized many of them and they were found un-opened. She was pressed during her cross-examination over the fact that she must have received substantial amount of communications from the plaintiff in June and July 1998. She said she did not monitor them. She just put it one side. If she had opened them, she took a cursory look and put in on one side. The purport of the transactions did not register.
She explained that she did not read the communications with any care because she thought that Hew, who was such a meticulous person, would draw her attention to anything significant. As Hew did not highlight anything, she assumed that there was really nothing very much for her to look at. I asked myself if she did not want to look at them because she did not want to know; that she was in a state of denial, having seen the level of liabilities which her brother had incurred. I do not think she thought about it. She simply put them aside and proceeded on the basis that if there was anything important Hew would highlight it to her. She relied on Hew, far too much as it turned out. She was also busy with her own life and often came home late. She furnished the collaterals and she did not bother herself with the transactions between her brother and Hew.
The plaintiff relies on seven letters signed by Nancy, five of which contained instructions to the plaintiff authorising the transfers of profits arising from forex trades and two dealt with matters relating to Nancy`s Singapore dollar account. Those letters were signed over the period from April to September 1998. It is a central contention of the plaintiff that by signing those letters Nancy had actual knowledge of Hew`s forex trades carried out in her account. She explained that she really did not know the implication of the letter she was signing. They were prepared by Hew `someone I (had) known for many years` and at the time of signing them Nancy said she had no reason to have any doubts on his integrity. That she did not take any care in the matter was shown in an example. In one letter she had not signed her full signature or the signature reflected in her specimen signature card. She had to re-sign it.
Whether her evidence is credible depended on a number of factors. The fact that the plaintiff had sent her many confirmations about the forex trades and the fact that she had signed letters authorising the transfers of profits from forex trades to her brother are substantial evidence which strongly suggest that she knew that Hew was engaging in forex trades in her name. On the other hand, she came across as a witness who was quite forthright in her answers. I was sceptical about her denials of not registering the documents from the plaintiffs after she `scanned` them but considering her unquestioning trust of Hew, Hew`s purposeful manipulations, her own state of disorganisation over her personal matters, like keeping on one side those documents, which were not opened and found by the CAD as not having been opened, and the entire evidence as a whole, I accepted her evidence that it did not register at all. After all, she stood to gain nothing. She had offered her own shares to top up the margin, just to regularise Tan`s account. Nobody told her candidly how much Tan had lost. She just wanted to help her sibling tide over a difficult time, which was experienced by many in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. Is she telling the truth when she says that she really did not think about it and that she trusted Hew entirely when she signed?
There was a tell tale telephonic conversation between Hew and Nancy on 23 April 1998. Hew was recorded to have told Nancy that there was a profit of two million which would be credited to Nancy`s account on next Monday, 27 April 1998 and a profit of one and a half million Yen which would be credited on 30 October. It`s instructive to listen to the transcript recorded in the voice recording system of the plaintiff, which the plaintiff had not disclosed until after Nancy had sworn her affidavit in chief. I set out the transcript:
 
 
Gary:
 
Ah, ha, ah ha, I see ok. Erm, alright, basically what`s happened is this, er ... they ... there is going to be a two million Yen ah ...
 
 
 
NT:
 
Mmmh.
 
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
Gary:
 
Profit ah?
 
 
 
NT:
 
Yah.
 
 
 
Gary:
 
Er ... er ... in your account, ok?
 
 
 
NT:
 
Mmmh.
 
 
 
Gary:
 
That will be paid to you ah, on the 27th ah, which is next Monday.
 
 
 
NT:
 
Mmmh.
 
 
 
Gary:
 
Alright? And then there will be a one and a half million Yen profit that will be paid to you on the 30th ah ...
 
 
 
NT:
 
Mmmh.
 
 
 
Gary:
 
So I will er ... prepare a ... a ... a ... note ah, to transfer this profit ah, to Ah Chin`s (ie Tan`s) account.
 
 
 
NT:
 
You want me to sign it is it?
 
 
 
Gary:
 
Yes. I need you to sign for the transfer of the funds ah, er ... er ... er from your account to Ah Chin`s account.
 
 
 
NT:
 
Ok lah, probably in the morning ah.
 
 
 
 
In para 20(ii) and (iii) of her affidavit evidence in chief, which was sworn before the disclosure of the above transcript by the plaintiff, Nancy stated as follows: 
 
 
ii I can also remember a few occasions in or around April/May and September 1998 when (Hew) called me on separate occasions to inform me that he would be faxing over letters that he had prepared for me to sign. He informed me that these were standard letters and he did not explain these letters to me. As I had no reason to doubt his integrity at that point of time, I simply signed the letters without reading them. (The seven letters are annexed as exh NT5 pp 68-74.) 
 
iii Having now examined the letters as exhibited herein ... and upon the advice of my solicitors, I now realise that (Hew) had traded in foreign exchange contracts purportedly in my name and without my authorisation. Any profits received upon settlement of the foreign exchange contracts were transferred to other accounts. I wish to state that I did not have any knowledge of the transactions stated in the letters, nor had I consented to such transactions. (Hew) had clearly abused my trust and confidence in him by deceiving me into signing these letters and therefore facilitating such transfers.
  
 
 
For the plaintiff, it was strenuously pointed out that according to the telephonic conversation and the letters which Nancy had signed, it was quite clear that Hew had explained to Nancy what he had done. He had explained to her the forex contracts he had entered into in her accounts and the profits made, and that he intended to transfer them to Tan`s accounts. She was repeatedly told that the profits were in her account. The plaintiff submits that this meant that the forex trades were done in her account. In any event, the forex contracts referred to in the fax instructions would have confirmed this. The plaintiff also referred to another telephonic conversation between Hew and Nancy on 27 April 1998. Hew told Nancy that he had made 1.3m Yen and `it`s going through your account`. Hew then mentioned that Nancy was to do the same thing they did the last time. He concluded by saying that he would sort out the details and the rest later. The plaintiff also relies on Hew`s telephone conversation with Nancy on 29 September 1998, nearly on the eve of the momentous October 1998 forex deals, that her overdraft account had been regularised and that there was a credit of two million over Yen which was being paid into her account. He said part of the money had to be remitted out. As the fax instructions had confirmed, there were instructions to the plaintiff to pay the `profits` to a number of parties. Nancy signed it without so much as asking why other parties should be paid.
I heard the recordings. The tone and tenor, and not only what was recorded as having been said, came through in the course of the opportunity to hear the recordings. She was not only disinterested; her answers were far too brief. She was impatient with Hew who tended to be both solicitous and long-winded, beating about the bush. He was engaged in several turns of disassembling and disarming his interlocutor. Obviously, Hew adopted those tones and postures because he was manipulating Nancy. He would at most times go into great details and at times he was strategically economic in his description of what had happened. Nancy`s impatience was evidenced by the fact that she rather pointedly, and impatiently, asked him: `You want me to sign is it?`. It was as if to tell him to get to the point. The next notable feature was her disinterest in any profit for herself or, even in some cases, for her brother. She never profited at all. She trusted Hew so much that she allowed him to direct where the `profits` were to be channelled. He did not seek her consent; he only wanted her to sign and put through the transactions he and he only had decided. In my view, she was not told enough to know that Hew had used her account to engage in forex trades. I find on the evidence that Hew had deceived her and had abused her trust in him.
In fact, she had opened a Sing dollar account for the sole purpose of mortgaging her shares against her brother`s account. She did so in the hope, which was far too innocent, that Hew would in due course get the brother out of the mess Hew had created for the brother. She was, in my judgment, unaware that Hew had entered into forex trades on her account until 8 October 1998 when Hew for the first time came clean. She never signed any confirmations of the forex trades. She never adverted to the possibility of Hew trading in her name as it never occurred to her. From beginning to the end, there was not an iota of evidence that she had agreed to any forex deal; Hew confessed to having traded without her authorisation. She did not have the level of knowledge and she did not draw any inference that Hew was engaged in forex trading in her name. One could not quadrate the fact that she knew there were profits to be transferred out that she must have known of the forex deals in her name.
 Tan`s evidence 
 
 
 
Tan was actively engaged in the business of Oriental Sincere Printing (`OSP`) in which he had invested about HK$10m. He was a majority shareholder of OSP by virtue of his ownership of OSP`s parent company. From 1995 to 1998 he made many trips to Hong Kong although he had no expertise in the company`s business of printing. Among the wealth he inherited from his late father was a company called Grand Victory Trading Pte Ltd. Although he was the `manager`, he in fact had no duties to perform. By the time he was giving evidence, he was employed by his cousin and was performing clerical and messenger duties. He earns $1,200 per month.
In contrast, Hew, his brother in law, holds a degree from the National University of Singapore. Tan was no match for his brother-in-law in intellect or in business acumen. Tan struck me as the son of a very rich father who left him some wealth but, unfortunately, no training and equipment for the vicissitudes of life, and in particular business life. For his usual banking needs, he started an account with the plaintiff on the advice of Hew. He signed the plaintiff`s documents such as the irrevocable letter of authority dated 28 November 1994 at the places indicated by Hew. This document contained para 6, the contents of which had been set out earlier, regarding the limit of a single instruction to US$500,000. At the suggestion of Hew, he replaced his overdraft with the plaintiff, which was fully secured, into a term loan. From about February 1996 Tan spent about one third of each month in Singapore. The rest of the time was spent in Hong Kong or in Kuala Lumpur.
Hew was aware that Tan had a substantial holding of quoted securities inherited from the latter`s late father. Tan`s father was one of the original shareholders of the ICB Bank, which was later acquired by United Overseas Bank Ltd (`UOB`) in exchange for UOB shares. Hew advised Tan to mortgage some of these shares as collateral for any future loans which he might require for his Hong Kong investments. Hew also arranged for him to open a BNP Nominees Account and a new current account for the settlement of share transactions. As far as he knew, the only `share transactions` involved his sales of UOB shares to raise finance for his Hong Kong investments. At Hew`s suggestion, Tan appointed his sister, Nancy, as his Attorney to act for him in his absence. In the event, he mortgaged 50,000 UOB shares as collateral for his accounts. He was advised by the plaintiff that he was granted a second loan of $100,000.
In connection with the mortgage of his UOB shares, Tan was asked by Hew to sign a memorandum of charge/deposit of securities (`Memorandum`) dated 30 May 1996. Since the break of the trouble, Tan was shown a list of share transactions dated 30 May 1996 which was inserted after p 34 of the Memorandum. Tan says that the signature on this list was not his and this list was not drawn to his attention at the time he signed the Memorandum. Tan`s evidence in this respect was unchallenged.
Tan says that he had never authorised or mandated Hew to speculate in shares at his own discretion. Sometime in July 1996 he received a debit advice form dated 11 July 1996 from the plaintiff which was mailed to his Singapore address. It related to an application he was said to have made for 20,000 shares of an Initial Public Offering of PT Kedwaung Setia Industrial Ltd. Tan knew nothing about this application. He was very disappointed and considered Hew`s conduct disgraceful. He confronted him and it transpired that Hew had purchased a number of Malaysian securities in Tan`s name without Tan`s consent or knowledge. Tan scolded him for his actions and Hew pleaded for time to sell off all the shares bought in Tan`s name. Hew said the sale should be done gradually to minimise the loss. He said Hew promised him that when all the shares had been disposed of he would close the account through which he had traded.
Tan explains that he was faced with a very difficult decision. He could either give Hew a chance to keep his word and wind-down the outstanding share positions, or he could report Hew`s actions to the authorities. The latter course would result in Hew losing his job with the plaintiff and the possibility of penal sanctions. His primary consideration was that Hew was his sister`s husband and he did not want to get him into trouble.
At the end of a very acrimonious conversation with Hew, Hew promised Tan to sell the shares as soon as possible. During the period from July 1996 to April 1997, Tan continued to travel for most of the time. When subsequently Hew left documents at his house in Singapore, or when mail arrived from the plaintiff, Tan assumed that they related to Hew`s closing of the positions he had taken.
Tan referred to Hew`s internal memorandum dated 21 March 1997 purporting to give instructions to the plaintiff to credit `all Singapore dollar dividends except UOB` to the share trading account while the UOB dividends should be credited to his SD A/c No 41.
In April 1997 Hew disclosed to Tan that he had not reduced the unauthorised share positions and had, contrary to his promises, continued to trade under his name. In view of the deteriorating share market, he had incurred huge losses in and under Tan`s account. Hew said that the plaintiff would make a margin call on him unless he deposited more UOB shares as additional collateral. After `continual pleading` by Hew, Tan agreed to pledge his remaining 219,613 UOB shares to the plaintiff. Hew told him that someone else working at the plaintiff was involved with him in the unauthorised trade which had occurred. This was a lie.
On one occasion Hew talked to Tan on the phone and informed him that they had made some money from Natsteel Electronics, but the money would come in on 28 October 1997. In the meantime, he asked to borrow $13,000 from Tan`s account on a temporary basis pending the arrival of the proceeds.
Towards the end of 1997 Hew told Tan that he had sold most of the unauthorised shares they had purchased, albeit at a loss. But Hew said that he had converted the losses into loans so that his UOB shares would not have to be sold at an immediate loss to settle with the plaintiff. Hew told Tan that he had procured the loans in `weak` currencies which were expected to fall, thereby making it easier to pay the loans.
Tan says that he continued to receive documents from the plaintiff but he was advised by Hew not to attempt to understand them. Hew told him that he would take care of everything.
Tan then explains how he was tricked by Hew into signing the Risks Disclosure Form and the plaintiff`s request for confirmations both dated 6 March 1998. Hew gave him the impression that without his signature Hew would not be able to transfer the profits that had been made to reduce the losses which Hew had incurred.
On 29 July 1998 Tan was in Hong Kong on OSP business. Hew called him. The conversation was taped by the plaintiff`s voice recording system. Tan was recorded to have remarked to Hew:` I thought you have been paying down the loan` to which Hew agreed and said he had been `trying, ... bit by bit.` This confirmed Hew`s confession during his trial that he had carried out the unauthorised share transactions. Hew was obviously stringing along Tan, hoping for his unauthorised activities to take a turn for the better. In the same conversation, he asked Tan to agree to sign a letter to the plaintiff indicating that he (Tan) would reduce the loan by monthly payments of US$20,000. In the course of the conversation, Hew did mention that he would try to switch to currency trading to earn some money. Tan points out that there was, however, no mention of Hew using his (Tan`s) account in that connection, and Hew did not go into details. Tan signed the letter, which Hew had drafted and faxed it to the plaintiff.
Tan then explains to the court how Hew tricked him into signing both the new `Specimen Signature Card` and the `Account Information Form`. He signed with blank spaces for Hew to fill. However, the key document headed `Mandate for Account(s) (Individuals)` (`the mandate`) was completed by Hew in his own handwriting making reference to accounts denominated in no less than eight different currencies. These were Singapore dollars, US dollars, Indonesian Rupiah, Malaysian Ringgit, Hong Kong dollars, French Francs, Japanese Yen and Deutschmarks. Tan maintained that all the details were left blank. He was sure that he did not authorise Hew to open accounts in those currencies. He said Hew had tricked him to go to plaintiff`s office to sign the documents on the fraudulent misrepresentation that he had to renew his account.
Tan says that on 5 October 1998 he was in Kuala Lumpur to spend some time with his wife and children. He did not know that Hew had between that date and 8 October 1998 entered into the five forex contracts purchasing US dollars against the Japanese Yen.
Sometime between 6.30 and 7.30 on the evening of 8 October 1998 Tan received a telephone call at his wife`s family home in Kuala Lumpur. He could hear Hew crying over the telephone. Hew told him that he had lost over US$1m in FX dealings relating to Japanese Yen. It soon became clear to him that Hew had taken those loss-making positions in his name without his authorisation. Hew said that his superior, Mr Hammery, had decided to close the Yen positions. Hew asked him to telephone Mr Hammery to say that those positions should be closed. Surprisingly, Tan agreed to call Mr Hammery. He called twice and not getting him he left short messages to the effect that Mr Hammery should go ahead to close the positions.
Tan remained in his wife`s family home in Kuala Lumpur from 8 October to 12 October 1998. On 10 October 1998 Hew telephoned him. He said his superiors had told him to resign because he had not followed internal procedures and that his activities might even involve criminal prosecution.
Hew begged Tan to corroborate his version of the events to save him. Tan gathered that he had been told to accept responsibility for losses on two accounts through which Hew had carried out unauthorised trades. Those were the accounts of Nancy and Tan. Tan told Hew to reduce what he wanted him to say into writing. On his return to his Singapore home on 12 October 1998 he found an envelope from Hew addressed to him. He found a two-page document with the heading `Events leading up to the USD/JPY Losses` dated 9 October 1998. There were also statements of accounts from the plaintiff which he had never seen before. Tan says that Hew had made up a completely fictitious account of the events, which he hoped Tan would adopt or corroborate. On 12 October 1998 Hew called him and asked him if he would corroborate his story. Tan told him that he would not lie to save him and that he must tell the truth. Later, Hew called again and pleaded with him. But Nancy stepped in and stopped the communication, fearing that Tan might agree to corroborate his story out of pity.
On 14 October 1998 Tan wrote to the plaintiff stating that he had no knowledge of the transactions detailed in their fax of 13 October 1998. He also stressed that the transactions were not authorised by him. On 17 October 1998 he lodged a police report about Hew`s unauthorised trading in both shares and forex trades by using his name.
 Causes of the losses 
 
 
 
Both Nancy and Tan are submitting that Hew`s `rogue trading` activities and a series of control weakness and judgmental failures which occurred at various levels of management of the plaintiff were primarily the causes of the plaintiff`s losses as a result of the unauthorised shares and forex trading. I have set out the unauthorised activities of Hew, a senior personnel of the plaintiff. I will now set out the internal control failures and other breaches of the plaintiff`s procedures.
Nancy`s account was operated in an irregular fashion from the very first trade on 13 April 1998. Its trade ran foul of MAS`s ruling. No forex line had been established for such forex transactions. No security had been pleaded by Nancy to secure the account. The plaintiff`s Chief Controller, Mr Colin Meyer (PW9) said in evidence that the plaintiff`s PBD Risk Manager Chong Tjang Shing (`Chong`) would, in the course of his daily duties checking the daily report known as AAP3600, would have known of the irregularity from the very first trade. In fact, Chong rather belatedly by his memo of 6 July 1998 reminded Hew about this infraction. He should have taken a firmer stand and stopped all future transactions until the matter was properly regularised with Nancy. If he had done it, Nancy`s unauthorised forex trades would not have happened.
According to the plaintiff`s rules, Chong was required to have reported to Mr Hammery. In spite of the irregularity, Hew was allowed to trade in the name of Nancy for another three months, without a forex line, credit facility or any security.
I now come to the eve of the October 1998 unauthorised forex transactions. On 30 September 1998 Chong sent a further e-mail to Hew stating as follows: 
 
Client does not have any credit facility or fx/option trading facility. Moreover, she does not have any assets with us other than the UOB shares which are pledged to secure the account of Tan Shee Chin.
 
 
 
As such, it is not advisable to allow her to trade fx/option contracts unless she have some deposits. By allowing her to do fx/option trading, we may have violate(sic) MAS ruling which require all clients to have fx/option trading and for the purposes of hedging she must have credit facility or deposits place (sic) with us.
 
 
 
Mr Colin Meyer obviously tried to play down the error of Chong. He speculated that Chong would have spoken to Hew and obtained an explanation. He went on to make the further speculation that Chong would have evaluated Hew`s explanation and made an independent evaluation of the situation and decided that Hew would do what was necessary to regularise the account. He drew attention or alluded to other problematic accounts which had to be monitored more closely. In my view, Chong`s failure to take a more decisive step and his failure to get Mr Hammery to put a stop to Hew`s trading just before the unauthorised October 1998 forex deals in the name of Nancy was as unfortunate as it was the most causative of the web of causes, of which Hew`s rogue behaviour was the other main contributory factor.
I am fortified in my view by the plaintiff`s Auditor Long Form Report for the year ended 31 December 1998. The report stated: 
 
The Internal Audit Department of the Branch has carried out an investigation and submitted investigation reports to the management. The private banking officer allegedly put through FX deals since March 1998, possibly with the customers` knowledge. The customers concerned did not have any approved FX trading lines with the Branch. 
 The unauthorised deals would have been detected earlier if the Risk Manager for private banking had performed documented control procedures as soon as they occurred. It is clear that he failed to perform these controls and the unauthorised FX transactions continued until October 1998.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
I would like to underline the fact that the investigation reports were produced in court. It did not shed more light as to what had happened.
The plaintiff was also aware, through its Chief Controller, Mr Colin Meyer, that irregular extensions of forward contracts at historical rates were also conducted through Nancy`s account. The particulars in the spreadsheet were gone over during the trial. Such historical rate transactions were seriously discouraged by MAS as well as the plaintiff`s own top management. The reasons are that such practices might be used to hide losses or perpetrate fraud, such as the unauthorised trading of Hew using the name of a customer. MAS Guidelines dated 4 April 1995 stated very clearly thus: 
 
Merchant banks should also note that the Authority strongly discourages the use of non-current rates for the extension or roll-over of maturing forward exchange contracts and other derivative contracts, 
 as they may be used to conceal losses or to perpetuate fraud
. Where customers have genuine trade-related needs for rollover of maturing contracts using non-current rates, such roll-overs should only be done using the express approval of senior management of both the merchant bank 
 and that of the customer
. The express approval of the senior management of Head Office should be obtained for the merchant bank in Singapore to engage in such rollover transactions. 
 Credit exposures and funding costs must be recognised and unrealised losses must be booked as part of the credit facilities provided by the merchant bank to the customer, and they must be within approved credit limits of the merchant bank as well as the Authority`s prudential limits on credit facilities. These guidelines should be clearly established and adhered to.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It was accepted that these guidelines applied with equal force to a restricted bank such as the plaintiff as they apply to merchant banks. Contrary to assertions of the plaintiff`s witnesses, the infraction of these guidelines led to fraud and concealment of losses in the case of Nancy`s account.
The top management of the plaintiff, including Mr Hammery, strongly discouraged the placing of orders by OICs without names of customers and the provision of names after the deal was done. Surprisingly, Raymond Goh, one of the plaintiff`s dealers in the Treasury Department, says in evidence that it was standard procedure to place an order and provide the name after the deal is done. I reject his evidence, as unsupported by Mr Hammery`s three written instructions issued by him in February, July and September 1998. In the last memo, he stated in the clearest possible terms: `It is strictly forbidden to give order to the dealing room without specifying the name of the client. In the case of pooled order you have to supply the list of names. Dealers on their side will be reminded not to accept incomplete orders.`
It is undisputed that the two forex deals in the name of Nancy and the five forex deals in the name of Tan were placed first without their names being provided. They were provided after the deals were done. Where it appeared that he had assigned Tan`s names to his Assistant, Ms Harni Sim, at 9.17am on 7 October 1998 ( see vol 11AB3129) I was satisfied that Hew must have known that the two forex deals had been done at JPY 130.50 and JPY 129.50). It was left entirely to Hew to assign the deals to whichever party he chose. One shudders to imagine what he would have done if the US dollar had strengthened against the Japanese Yen instead by the same extent.
According to the internal control procedures of the plaintiff in relation to the return of confirmations sent out to customers, it is provided that `the acknowledgement of FX transactions by customers is compulsory and must be followed.` Nancy did not acknowledge any of the confirmation advices sent to her. From April until September 1998 the plaintiff knew that Nancy had not signed the Risks Disclosure Form. In addition, the transactions exceeded the express limit of US$500,000 of any single instruction. This limit was not restricted to money transfers only.
In relation to Tan, he says that he did not render any assistance to Hew to breach his fiduciary duties. He points to other acts and omissions of the plaintiff and its officers which directly caused the losses combined with the `rogue` activities of Hew, as he confessed before the sentencing District Judge.
To begin with, Hew deceived Tan time and time again as recited above. Hew then lied to his employer, the plaintiff, by fraudulent and blatant misrepresentations about the net worth of Tan. As set out in AB221, the details he gave to the plaintiff showed his mendacious capacity.
As required by MAS circular 612, the plaintiff ought to have conducted independent checks on the financing standing and assets of Tan. If they had done so, they would have found out that he had a very modest yearly income: see his income tax assessments for the years 1997 to 1999. Tan was never asked any question nor asked to produce any documentary proof of his net worth.
It was noteworthy that for a period of nine months from January to early October 1998, Tan had a substantial and steadily increasing net deficit on his overall position with the plaintiff. The plaintiff`s prudential margin of 60% was completely ignored. This enabled Hew, on a frolic of his own, to have entered into 113 speculative forex trades, with a total value of US$150m, in the name of Tan. No officer other than Hew had any contact with Tan at all material times. It was obvious that the plaintiff trusted Hew who proved to be a capable officer.
Tan did not sign any type of Risk Disclosure Statement till 6 March 1998. By that time, Hew using his account had accumulated a loss of MYR1,278,123.62. As noted earlier, the taped conversation between Hew and Tan on 5 March 1998 that Hew confirmed that they `had never talked of foreign exchange so that`s why you (Tan) did not sign the Risk Disclosure Form.`
In any event, the Risk Disclosure Statement in question was not relied upon by the plaintiff in any way. It was retained in the residence of Hew, where it was subsequently seized by CAD officers. The statement could not have `assisted` Hew in any breach of his duties, contractual or fiduciary.
Furthermore, Tan signed only one confirmation dated 5 March 1998. He did not return duly signed about 200 computer-generated confirmations of the plaintiff. In any case, that solitary signed confirmation could not have `assisted` Hew in the breach of any of his duties as he kept it in his own residence and was not filed by anyone in the plaintiff`s office.
I should finally note that in the closing out of the seven forex deals in question, nothing that Nancy or Tan could have done would have influenced the decision of Mr Hammery. Mr Hammery had made a firm decision. Nothing that Tan had said or left behind in the voice-mails of Mr Hammery would have made a scintilla of difference.
Tan`s counsel therefore submits that the plaintiff`s own actions and omissions, culminating in Hew`s rogue behaviour in effecting the October 1998 forex deals, constituted a `novus actus interveniens`. The acts of the plaintiff`s own trusted senior officer, viz Hew, and the errors and dereliction of duties of the other officers, constituted fresh and independent causes of the plaintiff`s own losses.
I now deal with the various causes of action which I had referred to earlier. The plaintiff concentrated on establishing accessory liability on the part of Nancy and Tan for dishonestly assisting Hew`s breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff did not abandon the other causes of action on which, however, it did not place anything like the degree of reliance on asserting that Nancy and Tan are secondarily liable, having dishonestly assisted Hew in the breaches of his fiduciary duties to the plaintiff.
 Dishonest accessory liability 
 
 
 
The elements to prove dishonest accessory liability are: 
(a) existence of a trust or fiduciary obligation; 
(b) existence of a breach of the trust or fiduciary obligation; 
(c) accessory to the breach; and 
(d) dishonestly assisting the fiduciary in his breach of his fiduciary duties.
The leading case is 
Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan (Philip Kok Ming)
 
[1995] 2 AC 378
. The plaintiff airline appointed a travel company, BLT, to act as its agent. Under the agreement BLT was required to account to the airline for all the amounts received from the sale of the tickets. It was expressly constituted trustee of the moneys subject to the right to deduct commission. In fact, the airline did not pay airline moneys into a separate account. On the instructions of the managing director, they were paid into their current account and were utilised in the ordinary course of business. When BLT became insolvent, the airline sued the managing director and principal shareholder of BLT on the ground of knowing assistance. Roberts C.J. upheld the claim. But he was reversed by the Court of Appeal of Brunei on the ground that although BLT had been badly mismanaged, it had not been guilty of fraud or dishonesty. A further appeal to the Privy Council was allowed and it was held that BLT was in breach of trust, that the managing director assisted in that breach of trust and that both BLT and the managing director had acted dishonestly.
Dealing with the state of mind of the accessory, the Privy Council accepted the majority judicial view that dishonesty or want of probity was required.
The Privy Council went on to point out that honesty was an an 
 objective 
 standard (at p 389): 
 
Honesty, indeed, does have a strong subjective element in that it is a description of a type of conduct assessed in the light of what a person actually knew at the time, as distinct from what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated. Further, honesty and its counterpart, dishonesty, are mostly concerned with advertent conduct, not inadvertent conduct. Carelessness is not dishonesty. Thus for the most part dishonesty is to be equated with conscious impropriety. However, these subjective characteristics of honesty do not mean that individuals are free to set their own standards of honesty in particular circumstances. Honesty is not an optional scale, with higher or lower values according to the moral standards of each individual.
 
 
 
The Privy Council therefore considered that the basis for the imposition of accessory liability was fault on the part of the third party. Whether there was dishonesty in many cases should be clear. Intentionally deceiving someone thereby causing him harm, deliberately participating in a misapplication of trust asset or turning a blind eye to misconduct, are clearly acts of dishonesty. Undoubtedly, there would be difficult cases. Generally, however, as pointed out by the Privy Council an honest person `should have little difficulty in knowing whether a proposed transaction, or his participation in it, would offend the normally accepted standards of honest conduct.`
When an honest person knows there is a doubt, what does honesty require him to do? Lord Nicholls elaborated thus (pp 390-391): 
 
The only answer to these questions lies in keeping in mind that honesty is an objective standard. The individual is expected to attain the standard which would be observed by an honest person placed in those circumstances. It is impossible to be more specific. Knox J captured the flavour of this, in a case with a commercial setting, when he referred to a person who is `guilty of commercially unacceptable conduct in the particular context involved`: see 
Cowan de Groot Properties Ltd v Eagle Trust plc
 
[1942] 4 All ER 700
, 761. Acting in reckless disregard of others` rights or possible rights can be a tell-tale sign of dishonesty. An honest person would have regard to the circumstances known to him, including the nature and importance of the proposed transaction, the nature and importance of his role, the ordinary course of business, the degree of doubt, the practicability of the trustee or the third party proceeding otherwise and the seriousness of the adverse consequences to the beneficiaries. The circumstances will dictate which one or more of the possible courses should be taken by an honest person. He might, for instance, flatly decline to become involved. He might ask further questions. He might seek advice, or insist on further advice being obtained. He might advise the trustee of the risks but then proceed with his role in the transaction. He might do many things. Ultimately, in most cases, an honest person should have little difficulty in knowing whether a proposed transaction, or his participation in it, would offend the normally accepted standards of honest conduct.
 
 
 
There are in the realms of human affairs and commercial activities, not only complex and very difficult issues of morality and ties of kinship and sentiments but there are also the inevitable vagaries, vicissitudes and multitudinous chances and changes of commercial transactions. Transactions in forex and share trading, especially the former, involve high risks. Many lay people, like Nancy and Tan, in contrast to professionals, like Hew the rogue trader, do not even understand the complexities and volatility of forex deals. Hence, many private banking departments of multi-national banks the world over boast of their indispensable high order professional expertise, recommending `stop losses` mechanisms and other prudential measures and analyses before an investment or a position is undertaken by a lay customer. In such situations, the position is not always so straightforward when a participant in such transactions is a trusting novice or tyro who happens to have a `rogue` relative working in a private banking department and finds himself, most unfortunately, in a moral bind at the wrong time. It is also in this connection that one must always and punctiliously guard against the illogical flaw of judging any conduct of such tyros with the benefit of hind sight. If a person is imprudently optimistic, especially when he is not motivated by any personal pecuniary gain, directly or indirectly, I do not think that such imprudence is dishonesty. As Lord Nicholls helpfully stated in the context of taking risks: `All investment involves risks. Imprudence is not dishonesty, although imprudence may be carried recklessly to lengths which call into question the honesty of the person making the decision. This is especially so if the transaction serves another purpose in which that person has an interest of his own` (p 389H). His Lordship is there pointing obviously to the motive or motivation which drives or lies behind the acts or omissions of the alleged accessory. If he stands to gain something, the `touchstone` of dishonesty is probably triggered as an ingredient constituting the equitable wrong of a dishonest accessory. On the other hand, if he is driven by ties of kinship, compassion, altruism or an exaggeratedly credulous or trusting nature or disposition, I do not think that such traits or shortcomings, however lamentable, amount to dishonesty in the context of accessory liability.
His Lordship has this piece of advice for a trial judge, which should lighten a trial judge`s tasks in reaching a correct and appropriate finding of facts in his application of the law of accessory liability: `Likewise, when called upon to decide whether a person was acting honestly, a court will look at all the circumstances known to the third party at the time. The court will also have regard to personal attributes of the third party, such as his experience and intelligence, and the reason why he acted as he did` (p 391B).
The Privy Council also pointed out that it was no part of the test of dishonesty that the third party should `knowingly` participate in the breach of trust. Knowledge, it was pointed out, was an inappropriate criterion to adopt where `the difference are of degree rather than of kind`. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead made the point that the now notorious five-point scale of degrees of knowledge put forward in 
Baden v Societe General
 
[1992] 4 All ER 161
[1993] 1 WLR 509
 at pp 575-576 were, in the context of dishonest accessory liability, `best forgotten`.
Lord Nicholls concluded (at p 392): 
 
Drawing the threads together, their Lordships` overall conclusion is that dishonesty is a necessary ingredient of accessory liability. It is also a sufficient ingredient. A liability in equity to make good resulting loss attaches to a person who dishonestly procures or assists in a breach of trust or fiduciary obligation. It is not necessary that, in addition, the trustee or fiduciary was acting dishonestly, although this will usually be so where the third party who is assisting him is acting dishonestly. `Knowingly` is better avoided as a defining ingredient of the principle, and in the context of this principle the 
Baden
 
[1993] 1 WLR 509
 scale of knowledge is best forgotten.
 
 
 
Five years earlier, an instructive case where dishonest accessory liability was imposed was decided by Millet J (as he then was) in 
Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson
 
[1990] Ch 265
. The defendant firm of accountants assisted by means of shell bank accounts and `cut outs` in the laundering and concealment of funds misappropriated from the plaintiff company. The judge pointed out that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant had received any part of the trust property. He identified the essence of this equitable wrong by saying: `The basis of the stranger`s liability is not receipt of trust property but participation in a fraud`: p 292. The Court of Appeal affirmed his finding that the defendants were professional men and that they obviously knew that there were laundering money and that `(t)hey must have realised at least that their clients might be involved in a fraud on the plaintiffs`: p 294.
For our present purposes, I need to draw attention to the point made that for liability to attach the defendant does not need to know exactly what is going on, so long as he suspects that something dishonest might be going on. Millet J in 
 Agip (Africa) v Jackson 
 stated at p 295: 
 
... it is no answer for a man charged with having knowingly assisted in a fraudulent and dishonest scheme to say that he thought it was `only` a breach of exchange control or `only` a case of tax evasion. It is not necessary that he should have been aware of the precise nature of the fraud or even of the identity of its victim. A man who consciously assists others by making arrangements which he knows are calculated to conceal what is happening from a third party takes the risk that they are part of a fraud practised on that party.
 
 
 
Referring to the defendant firm of accountants, Millet J found that they `were at best indifferent to the possibility of fraud. They made no inquiries of the plaintiffs because they thought it was none of their business. That is not honest behaviour. The sooner that those who provide services of nominee companies for the purpose of enabling their clients to keep their activities secret realise it the better. In my judgment it is quite enough to make them liable to account as constructive trustees`: p 295.
A few months after the judgment in 
Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan
 (Unreported) it was considered in 
Brinks v Abu-Saleh (No 3)
 (Unreported) . A security guard of the plaintiff (indisputably a fiduciary) facilitated the robbery of gold and other valuables worth Â£26m from its Heathrow warehouse to his accomplices in the robbery. He provided the keys to, and internal photographs of, the warehouse. The plaintiffs sued a number of dishonest accessories. One of them was the defendant who accompanied her husband in the car which was driven to Zurich and which transported the proceeds of the robbery in the sum of over Â£3m to Zurich. She accompanied him in four trips during which various sums of money were transported to Zurich. She was sued for dishonestly assisting the laundering the money. Her husband, who was also sued, had reached a settlement with the plaintiff.
Rimer J found as a fact that the defendant and her husband had believed that the money was derived from one of the robber`s business empire and that they were helping to transport it for the purpose of tax evasion. Rimer J further found as a fact that the defendant had accompanied her husband as his wife, and in her spousal capacity her presence did not constitute the relevant `assistance` in furtherance of the breach of the constructive trust imposed in respect of the proceeds of the robbery, which was traceable in equity. The trial judge relied on a number of facts. First, he found that the robber`s couriering arrangements were made exclusively with the husband and she was not a party to it. Secondly, it was the husband who carried out all the elements of the couriering operation. Thirdly, there was no evidence justifying the conclusion that the robber had imposed a condition, or even made a request, to the effect that the defendant should accompany her husband on the trips with a view to provide some cover that they were going to shop in Zurich. It was also a fact that the husband had gone on two trips alone.
 Existence of trust property 
 
 
 
 
 
Counsel for both defendants raise the preliminary question of law whether the cause of action now known as dishonest accessory liability applies to cases where an alleged accessory has not assisted in any breach of trust property. They point out that the plaintiff is asking the court to extend this equitable wrong to cases where a breach of fiduciary duty is alleged but where there is no property which is impressed with a trust (express, implied, resulting or constructive. Counsel for Nancy relies on 
Satnam Investments Ltd v Dunlop Heywood & Co Ltd
 
[1999] 3 All ER 652
, a decision of the English Court of Appeal. A firm of surveyors, who had acted for the plaintiffs, in the course of which they obtained confidential information of commercial importance, disclosed the information to a competitor of the plaintiffs. The competitor subsequently bought the property in question. Consequently, the plaintiffs alleged that the competitor had been aware of the surveyors` breach of fiduciary duty and that it held the property upon constructive trust for the plaintiffs. The trial judge upheld that contention, even though he made no finding that the competitor had acted dishonestly or participated in the surveyors` breach of fiduciary duty.
The English Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. Mere knowledge of a breach of fiduciary duty and making use of it to buy the property, without more, did not make the competitor a constructive trustee of the property.
The Court of Appeal went on further to say that the competitor could not be held liable for having been a dishonest accessory for the simple reason that the trial judge had not made any finding that the competitor had acted dishonestly.
However, counsel relied on what the Court of Appeal stated at p 671a: `Before a case can fall into either category [knowing receipt or knowing assistance] there must be trust property or traceable proceeds of trust property.` This sentence has been described in a later case as `compressed` and I will shortly advert to it. Counsel also quoted, quite properly and for completeness, what Lord Nourse delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal went on to say at p 671b-c: `... As for knowing assistance, of which dishonesty on the part of the accessory is a necessary ingredient ... we would not have wanted to shut out the possibility of such a claim`s being successful if the judge had made a finding of dishonesty against (the surveyors), dishonesty for this purpose having been equated, for most part, with conscious impropriety: see 
 Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan 
 ...`.
The issue and these dicta came up for consideration in 
 Goose v Wilson Sandford & Co 
, a decision delivered by the English Court of Appeal (Civil Division) on 14 March 2000: see Tab 49 of plaintiff`s supplementary bundle of authorities PSBA at p 646. In that case, the plaintiff who farmed his own land in Lincolnshire, UK, wished to acquire further agricultural land in France. For that purpose, he had an arrangement with one Peter Bray (`Bray`) who also wanted to buy a similar property. He turned out to be a `crook` He breached his fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiff. Bray retained the defendants, a firm of accountants, who arranged the intended purchases by both plaintiff and Bray. The accountants were alleged to have assisted Bray in his breaches of fiduciary duties. The Court of Appeal found on the facts that there did not subsist any fiduciary relationship at the relevant time and that the partner concerned in the defendant accountants firm `played no part in the breach of duty which then arose.`
The Court of Appeal referred to the `compressed` statement and stated at PSBA 678, though in fairness to Lord Nourse, it has to be pointed out the judgment read as a whole, which should always be done, would remove any misunderstanding: 
 
However we feel that the statement quoted above may be so compressed as to admit of misunderstanding. It applies to both the alternatives recognised by Lord Selborne in 
 Barnes v Addy
. In the case of the first, `knowing receipt` there must, by definition, be or have been trust property or its traceable proceeds of sale. But it is not a prerequisite of liability that it is still in existence at the time the claim form is issued. In the case of the second, `knowing assistance`, it is not a requirement of liability that any property should have been received or handled by the defendant. The issue is whether the dishonest breach of trust in which the defendant assisted must have involved the misapplication of trust property or its proceeds of sale. The formulation of the principle by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead (para 80 above) does not embrace such a requirement. Whether or not such a requirement is an essential feature of this head of liability is not a point we have to decide and, like the Court of Appeal in that case, we would not like to shut out the possibility of such a claim in its absence.
 
 
 
In my view, the head of claim under dishonest accessory liability (a description which has been preferred by Lord Nicholls to `knowing assistance`) can in principle be maintained even if there is no mishandling of any trust property or its traceable proceeds of sale provided the assistance causes the loss in question. It has been explicitly made clear in 
 Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan 
 that `(a) liability in equity to make good resulting loss attaches to a person who dishonestly procures or assists in a breach of trust or fiduciary obligation.` That statement of the cause of action is plain and unambiguous. This liability has been emphatically and firmly segregated from the rules of subtractive unjust enrichment. Professor Peter Birks has been at the forefront of this clarification more than a decade ago. He pointed out that whereas knowing receipt is a cause of action in unjust enrichment, knowing assistance is a cause of action in the law of wrongs. He concludes ([1989] LMCLQ 296, at 334: `The equitable liability for assisting fraud is virtually unintelligible without fault.` The touchstone is dishonesty. Accordingly, the plaintiff in the absence of any mishandling of trust property may recover if it makes good the ingredients required to found liability under this head of claim.
 Conclusions 
 
 
 
I now come to my findings. In relation to the plaintiff`s claims against Nancy and Tan for full equitable compensation because they had dishonestly assisted Hew in the breaches of his duties, there are two central questions of fact, viz did they assist Hew in the breaches of his fiduciary duties; and, if so, were they dishonest.That Hew was a fiduciary of the plaintiff is plainly made out. It is also beyond dispute that he owed the plaintiff duties of fidelity as he was entrusted to conduct the financial transactions with the utmost probity. He did not and breached one of the basic tenets of a fiduciary. He placed his interest above those of his principal. He betrayed its trust.
 Assistance 
 
 
 
As has been recited, the facts which emerged during the trial point to the stark reality that Hew was the sole person responsible for each and every one of the unauthorised share or forex transaction which were booked in the names of Nancy and Tan. He alone decided what shares to buy and to sell and at what price. He placed the orders for each forex trade and often, most certainly the 7 October 1998 forex contracts for which the plaintiff seeks to attach dishonest accessory liability on Nancy and Tan, the orders for the forex trades were placed at first on a `no-name basis` with the plaintiff`s dealers who, contrary to very firm and clear control documented procedures, accepted those orders and effected the deals. Hew entered into those unauthorised share transactions solely for his own benefit and he engaged in the unauthorised forex transactions in the vain hope that he could earn enough profits and trade Tan`s account out of the woods.
I turn to the seven unauthorised forex deals done in October 1998. I am satisfied that Hew thought, erroneously as it turned out, that the popular forecast of a weakening Japanese Yen, a view popularly held within the plaintiff`s PBD towards the end of September 1998, was an excellent opportunity to earn a substantial profit. Events, unfortunately, proved him wrong and it was his unravelling. His career was ruined and he went to jail.
Hew, amazingly, had a free hand in his management of the accounts of Nancy and Tan within the plaintiff`s PBD. He flouted every material control procedure with impunity. He did not even get a wrap on the knuckle. He was allowed to extend the maturity of forex contracts at historical rates, contrary to clear MAS directions, and this facilitated in the concealment of the losses. Payments for the losses were postponed and rolled over into so-called `loans`. He could open accounts in both names without any reference to them and on the few occasions he had to get them to sign, he deceived them by a litany of lies. Incredibly, whatever was signed by Tan, was retained by Hew in his residence! The consequence must be that the plaintiff was not misled in any way by any of those documents signed by Tan. It was incredibly coincidental that just before the disastrous October 1998 forex deals the Risks Manager had sent Hew a strong request that he should refrain from any further infraction. If firmer action had been taken to stop him from any forex deals on Nancy`s account, which did not have any forex trading facility, then the two forex deals contracted in her name would not have happened.
Neither Nancy nor Tan was really aware of the misfeasance committed by Hew. Tan especially allowed his sentiments to get the better of him. He should have been less sympathetic. Both of them provided additional collaterals just to give Hew more time and opportunity to trade out of the deficit that he had accumulated. It never occurred to them that there could potentially be a downside and further losses. The reasons were clear. They were taken in hook, line and sinker by Hew who took advantage of their trust and confidence in his professional expertise. They never thought that he would drag them further into the financial quagmire. It never occurred to them at any time that they were `assisting` him in his acts of misfeasance against the plaintiff. Nancy certainly was a tyro and novice; she was not even an investor or trader in shares, let alone the more exoteric but more volatile forex trades. I would not be far wrong to describe her as a person who hardly thought about the material importance of preserving her inheritance. I was at first sceptical about her evidence that Nancy never really bothered about the many confirmations and statements of accounts which the plaintiff had routinely sent to her after each forex trade. That she had put them aside and did not bother about them was quite credible. She was that sort of person. She had decided to help her brother and she trusted Hew to extricate him in due course. That was why even if she had scanned any document from the plaintiff bank, it did not `register`.
As for Tan, he could not resist the entreaties of Hew who by his solicitous manipulations could ultimately get him to do what he wanted him to do. It is incredible that he could be persuaded to part with his last batch of inherited UOB shares as additional collaterals to be mortgaged with the plaintiff. That was because Hew was a skilful deceiver. He told him a number of very serious lies. Unfortunately, Tan was not astute to see through him. As far as Tan was concerned, I think he had read the confirmations and statements during those periods that he was in Singapore. They did not raise any concern to him because he had decided to help Hew and he was taken in completely by him.
I am driven to the conclusion that both Nancy and Tan were grievously sinned against by Hew, and ill served by the plaintiff as a private banker, rather than sinning at all. The last thing they wanted to do was to assist Hew in committing any acts of betrayal or infidelity against the interest of the plaintiff.
In my judgment, Hew`s fraudulent conduct was the primary cause of the losses sustained by the plaintiff. His fraudulent conduct and his breaches of his fiduciary duties led to the losses. The next web of material causative factors which was responsible for the plaintiff`s losses were the plaintiff`s systemic internal failures and serious lapses of controls. As Hew committed all those acts in the course of his employment with the plaintiff, the plaintiff must be vicariously responsible. It is, in the final analysis, responsible for its dishonest servant and, to the extent that it had breached the contractual and tortuous duties of care, it was the author of its own misfortune.
 Were Nancy and Tan dishonest? 
 
 
 
That is indeed the central and most crucial question over which I had agonised hard and long in my review of the evidence in its totality. Bearing in mind the helpful guidance from the principles and dicta emanating from the many cases dealing with dishonest accessory liability, I have come to the conclusion that neither of them were dishonest in any assistance, if at all, which they had unwittingly rendered. The first point to highlight is the crucial fact that they stood to gain not a cent. They found themselves in a dilemma. Influenced by their background, their upbringing and values, and compounded by their credulous, naÃ¯ve and trusting pre-dispositions they (particularly Tan, and to a much lesser degree Nancy on whom the implications simply did not `register`) imprudently refrained from reporting Hew to the plaintiff and to the authorities. Nancy unquestioningly left it to him to direct any funds in her account to whomever he directed. They were foolish and woefully imprudent to have provided the additional collaterals. But foolishness, credulity and imprudence, which unfortunately were the besetting flaws of both Nancy and Tan, are not the same as dishonesty. They were both, in my opinion, and if I may say so of them, more fools than knaves. They were victims of the purposeful manipulations of Hew rather than his fellow participants in his frauds perpetrated against the plaintiff.
After Tan was assured by Hew that he (Hew) would try and recoup the losses, did his suspect any misfeasance on the part of Hew. Did Nancy suspect anything untoward on the part of Hew when he asked her to provide the third party collateral for the brother? On the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that they did not. They had confidence in him; they thought he was a smart professional, on top of the trades, and would get Tan out of the loss. They over-estimated both his abilities and his standards of integrity.
 Conspiracy 
 
 
 
This part of the plaintiff`s claim, which was not pursued with any vigour, is that Nancy and Tan together with Tan, and strangely enough at one stage even the second and third defendants were roped in, conspired to injure the plaintiff. It relies on the same material facts and submissions, which it asserts in support of their claims against them as dishonest accessories. That it is doing so is because the elements of both the civil wrongs of dishonest assistance and conspiracy overlap and they involve dishonesty and hostile intentions respectively. They are in that sense analogous wrongs in equity and in the law of torts. To establish the tort of conspiracy to injure the plaintiff, it has to prove that there was an agreement between them to injure it by unlawful means. On my conclusions, neither Nancy nor Tan was a party to any agreement. Hew was the villain of the piece and he deceived the plaintiff as well as Nancy and Tan. The existence of an agreement must be proved: see 
Seagate Technology (S) Pte Ltd v Heng Eng Li
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 534
 .
 Procuring breach of duty 
 
 
 
The plaintiff alleges that Nancy and Tan had tortiously procured Hew`s breaches his contractual, for instance. that he would serve the plaintiff in good faith and fidelity, that he would look after the plaintiff`s interest rather than his own and that he would honestly and faithfully serve the plaintiff. One of the elements completing this tort is the element of procurement or inducement. In 
DC Thomson & Co Ltd v Deakin
 
[1952] Ch 646
, Upjohn J identified three forms of interference which could give rise to this tort at p 647: `The intervener knowing of the existence of a contract between A and B and acting with the object of procuring its breach by A to the damage of B will be liable not only (1) if he directly intervenes by persuading A to break it, but also (2) if he intervenes by the commission of some act wrongful in itself so as to prevent A from in fact performing his contract and also (3) if he persuades a third party to do an act in itself wrongful or not legitimate (as committing a breach of a contract of service with A) so as to render, as was intended, impossible A`s performance of his contract with B`.
In my judgment, it would be highly artificial and inconsistent with the picture that emerges to say that Tan and Nancy had procured Hew`s breaches of the basic implied terms of his employment contract. Tan was responding to Hew`s unauthorised acts and, wrongly as it turned out, he provided the additional collaterals on two occasions with the sole intention of preventing Hew`s exposure. There was no evidence whatsoever that he intended to gain anything out of the whole salvaging exercise. In relation to Nancy, it is clear beyond any peradventure that she was only helping her brother, as Hew himself acknowledged to both Ms Oehlers and Mr Hammery, and that she, like her brother, with unusual, but yet very real and self-sacrificial credulousness, not only provided further collaterals but signed whatever disposal instructions which Hew placed before her in respect of any profits or surplus in her account. Hew`s skills of deception and acts of disassembly proved to be effective and mesmerising where both of them were concerned. From beginning to end, Hew was the initiator of every move, culminating in the 7 October 1998 forex deals which he signed in their names entirely on a frolic of his own.
 Breach of duty 
 
 
 
By paras 24, 27 and 28 of its re-amended statement of claim, the plaintiff avers that Nancy and Tan `owed a duty to the plaintiff in relation to the current accounts in their names with the plaintiff to notify the plaintiff immediately of any unauthorised transactions of which they became aware`. It is further pleaded that Nancy and Tan had breached their duty to notify immediately and that had the plaintiff been informed, the 7 October 1998 forex deals could have been avoided and `the plaintiff would not have suffered the loss and damage in respect of the foreign exchange losses of Japanese Yen 156,392,000 ...`. Note the specificity of the implied duty pleaded; there is no other duty pleaded and I therefore having regard to the content of the pleadings did not have to consider any other duty.
The plaintiff points to cases of forged cheques such as 
Greenwood v Martins Bank
 
[1933] AC 51
 and 
Tai Hing Cotton Mill v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd
 
[1986] AC 80
 and to the Singapore case of 
Kodrat Suradji v Banque Nationale de Paris
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 676
  and the Hong Kong case of 
Fung Kai Sun v Chang Fui Hing & Ors
 
[1951] AC 489
 which dealt with forgeries of the charge over cash documents and mortgaged document. It was admitted by the plaintiff that these were all cases involving the operation of the equitable doctrine of estoppel. But it was pointed out on behalf of the plaintiff that in 
Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd
 
[1992] 4 All ER 409
[1989] 1 WLR 1340
 May LJ opined that the first two named cases in this paragraph made it clear that it is an implied term of the relationship between a banker and his customer at least in relation to the operation of a current account that the latter will notify the former as soon as he learns that the account is being operated by a dishonest person.
In my view, there is in principle considerable conceptual difficulty in erecting an implied duty of care in contracts involving private banking activities such as share transactions and forex deals. Unlike the payment by a bank under a mandate evidenced in a cheque or some other document, with the right of reimbursement, and which of necessity and good conscience require, a duty of care on the part of the counter party, contractual arrangements between a bank and customer for share transactions or forex transactions do not as readily give rise to any implied. Why must it be necessarily so for the efficacious working of the contract? The private investment bank may invoke the doctrine of estoppel in the appropriate circumstances. But to imply a duty to notify any unauthorised transaction is another proposition for which no authority has been cited.

Under this defence, the plaintiff relies heavily on Tan`s provision of additional securities after being told by Hew about the unauthorised share transactions and the conversation between Tan and Hew on 5 March 1998 when Hew mentioned for the first time that he had done some speculative foreign exchange deals for Tan`s account and that there was a net profit. Tan asked how the repayment was progressing. Hew`s response was a studied piece of disarming misinformation. He gave Tan the idea that he was not working alone in the plaintiff bank to reduce the debt level of Tan`s account and that he had been trying to use other funds to pay off the interest because he wanted to reduce the debt to `as low as possible`. It is a significant fact that Tan had later asked: `It`s not getting bigger, is it?` If he had read the confirmations, debit advices and statements of accounts from the plaintiff up to that conversation, why did he ask this question. He ought to have known! Tan`s casual attitude also betrayed the fact that his financial plight had not come home to him in any meaningful sense. He even tried to be clever with the benefit of hindsight and joked that Hew should have asked former President Suharto of Indonesia, then convert to Rupiah and get to pay off the debt with ease! The fact of the matter was that he left it to Hew to sort it out, content to play the role of a kind-hearted soul in not having reported Hew.
In view of my conclusions set out in this judgment, it is hardly tenable to suggest that both Nancy and Tan had given either specific or general authority. They did no such thing.
 Estoppel 
 
 
 
The plaintiff invokes the doctrine of estoppel against Tan in respect his liabilities under the loan account, as distinct from the October 1998 forex transactions. His silence after learning about the unauthorised share transactions amounted to a misrepresentation. Even for forex transactions, the plaintiff maintains that Tan`s provision of additional collateral for the continuation of the forex transaction, inter alia, induced the plaintiff to believe that there was nothing irregular about Tan`s account.
For estoppel to operate, the plaintiff has to establish: (a) a representation or conduct amounting to a representation intended to induce a course of conduct on the part of the person to whom the representation is made; (b) an omission resulting from the representation, whether actual or by conduct, by the person to whom the representation is made; (c) detriment to such person as a consequence of the act or omission; and (d) mere silence cannot amount to a representation, but when there is a duty to disclose, deliberate silence may become significant and amount to a representation. In connection with item (d) the plaintiff relies on 
 Greenwood v Martins Bank 
, 
 Kodrat v BNP 
 and 
 Fung Kai Sun v Chan Fui Heng 
.
On the facts as found on the evidence, I am of the view that Tan did not intend to induce the plaintiff to continue to allow Hew to trade in shares in his account. He was told by Hew that those share transactions would be stopped. By the time he was asked to provide his last batch of his inherited UOB shares, totalling 219,613 shares, the losses had been accumulated and the damage was done by Hew. The losses had been crystallised. In those circumstances, it would be wholly inequitable to tell Tan that he must keep his silence and be precluded by an equitable doctrine to raise and rely on the indisputable fact that none of the share and forex transactions was authorised by him as a defence.
I refer to the five forex trades put in Tan`s name in October 1998 without his authorisation. Hew had acted entirely on a frolic of his own, thinking that he could take advantage of the market perception that Japanese Yen would weaken. He kept the deals away from Tan who was out of Singapore during the material period. Tan had not made any representation to lead the plaintiff to think that he would have authorised the placing of the five forex trades of US$1 million each.
So far as Nancy is concerned, on the facts it is plainly unsustainable to invoke estoppel against her.
 Nancy`s and Tan`s counterclaims 
 
 
 
In view of my conclusions , it is unnecessary to deal with those counterclaims.
All the transactions were unauthorised and the losses remaining in the accounts of both Nancy and Tan have to be borne by the plaintiffs. The unauthorised debits and credits in those accounts have to be reversed accordingly. All securities and collateral furnished by both Nancy and Tan must be returned to them freed from all encumbrances. The plaintiff`s claims are accordingly dismissed with costs. Parties are directed to settle the draft order. They have liberty to appear, if necessary, to settle the draft order.
Outcome:
Plaintiff`s claim dismissed; fourth and fifth defendants` counterclaim allowed.",2000-11-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This is a cross-appeal against the decision of Chan Seng Onn JC, with respect to a defamation suit instituted by Mr C Arul against Mr Victor Chew. The judicial commissioner held that Mr Chew defamed Mr Arul and awarded the latter $150,000 in damages. In CA 92/2000, Mr Chew appealed against the judicial commissioner`s finding that he defamed Mr Arul and against the quantum of damages, which was, in his view, too high. In CA 93/2000, Mr Arul, who thought that he was entitled to more damages than the sum awarded, appealed against the judicial commissioner`s award of damages. We dismissed all the respective appeals with costs and now set out the reasons for our decision.
 Background 
Mr Arul, a lawyer, and Mr Chew, an architect, are both members of the Tanglin Club (hereinafter referred to as the `club`). Shortly before the annual general meeting (hereinafter referred to as the `AGM`) of the club on 25 May 1998, at which the office-bearers of the club were to be elected, Mr Chew, who was campaigning on behalf of a number of candidates including his son, circulated a flyer entitled `A Layman`s Guide to the AGM`. In it, the respondent stated as follows: 
 
... Is this the Club you want? Is this the Committee you want? ...
 
 
 
If you want them to stay on to lead the Club to further disrepute the following have offered their services to continue the ruin of the Club - John Rasmussen, C Arul, Kenneth Chew, KT Chan, Patrick Garez, Vince Khoo and Mok Yew Fun.
 
 
 
Otherwise there are Graeme McGuire, KP Swee, Sidney Rolt, Andre Bouvron, Chew Kei Jin, Chim Hou Yan, Donald Grant, Bill Gartshore and Colin Taylor, level headed sensible people who are going to put things right and return us the Club we knew before all this acrimonious mud-slinging and racial bickering descended upon us.
 
 
 
Despite Mr Chew`s campaign, five of the seven incumbent members of the club committee were re-elected. Among them was Mr Arul, who was elected as Vice-President. One day after the AGM, Mr Arul saw a copy of the respondent`s flyer. The flyer was not signed but it bore the respondent`s club membership number, which is `C642`.
Mr Arul, who noted that the flyer contained personal attacks against him and other members of the club committee, wrote to Mr Chew on 27 May 1998 to find out whether or not the latter was the author of the flyer. He sent a reminder to the respondent on 2 June 1998.
In his reply dated 5 June 1998, Mr Chew stated as follows: 
 
There are two Arul Chandrans in the Telephone Book - one with his address at 23 Balmoral Rd, [num ]14-23, and the other at Block 121 Yuan Chuan Rd [num ]10-405.
 
 
 
Are you the Arul referred to in the newspaper cutting reproduced below as the Singapore lawyer who was sentenced to two years jail for fraud and breach of trust against an housewife in Johore?
 
 
 
I ask this because if you are the other Arul, I do not intend to reply to his letter as I do not know him ...
 
 
 
Mr Chew attached a newspaper cutting to his letter of 5 June 1998. The newspaper reported that in the High Court in Johore, Abdul Razak J sentenced three lawyers, including Mr Arul, to jail for two years for contempt of court after passing judgment against them for fraud in relation to the purchase of a property in Johore. As Mr Arul`s defamation suit concerned Mr Chew`s repeated references to the judgment of Abdul Razak J in 
Tara Rajaratnam v Datuk Jagindar Singh & Ors
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 127
 , it would be appropriate at this juncture to discuss the said Malaysian proceedings in greater detail.
 The Malaysian proceedings
Legal proceedings were instituted in Malaysia in 1979 by Madam Tara Rajaratnam against two lawyers, Mr Jagindar Singh and Mr P Suppiah, for defrauding her with respect to the purchase of a property in Johore. Mr Arul was subsequently named as the third defendant in the suit on the ground that he colluded with the first and second defendants to defraud the plaintiff. Abdul Razak J entered interlocutory judgment against all the defendants and sentenced them to imprisonment for two years for contempt of court. In his judgment, the judge called Mr Arul a `most vicious and dangerous fraud`.
The three defendants succeeded in their appeal against the sentence of imprisonment for contempt of court. However, their appeal against the interlocutory judgment was dismissed by the Malaysian Federal Court of Civil Appeal.
All three defendants then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. During the course of those proceedings, the Privy Council was informed that Madam Tara Rajaratnam had withdrawn all her allegations of fraud against Mr Arul and had consented to his appeal being allowed on the understanding that each party was to bear his or her own costs. What is significant is that when allowing Mr Arul`s appeal on the basis of the consent order, the Privy Council offered its views on his role in the alleged fraud in the following terms: 
 
As regards the third appellant, their Lordships were informed in the course of the hearing before them that his counsel and that for the respondent were agreed that his appeal should be allowed by consent, upon the terms that all allegations of fraud against the third appellant were withdrawn, and also any claim against him as allegedly a constructive trustee, and that as between him and the respondent there should be no order for costs here or in the courts below. Their Lordships consider it proper in the circumstances that the third appellant`s appeal should be allowed upon these terms. 
 It is abundantly plain that he had no hand whatever in the events of 30 March 1974, which form the basis of the respondent`s case of fraud against the other appellants
. [See 
[1986] 1 MLJ 105
, 112; emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Although the Privy Council clearly did not share Abdul Razak J`s view of Mr Arul`s role in the defrauding of Madam Tara Rajaratnam, this fact was not mentioned by Mr Chew when he referred to Abdul Razak J`s judgment in his numerous letters to Mr Arul and to the president of the club.
 The first publication
After receiving Mr Chew`s letter of 5 June 1998, Mr Arul replied on 12 June 1998, saying that he was `the very same Arul Chandran referred to in the newspaper cutting enclosed` and asking Mr Chew to reply to his question.
Mr Chew did not reply to the question posed to him. Instead, on 24 June 1998, he wrote to Mr Arul as follows: 
 
I was merely being meticulously careful on establishing the right identity to avoid offending the wrong person and I fail to understand why you took such exception to an address in Yuan Ching Road. I will have you know that there are many respectable, law abiding, honest citizens residing there - unless you now fancy yourself a class above these people.
 
 
 
Moreover, by the vexatious tone of your letter, it would seem that you expect the answer to my enquiry to be common knowledge. Am I supposed to believe then that the Members who voted for you in the last elections knew of the report of your conviction for fraud and breach of trust against the housewife in Johore?
 
 
 
A reply in due course will be much appreciated.
 
 
 
For convenience, the allegedly defamatory words in the above letter are underlined. After receiving the above letter, Mr Arul replied on 26 June 1998, asking Mr Chew not to avoid the issue and to answer the simple question as to whether he was the author of the flyer.
Mr Chew replied with a letter dated 10 July 1998, which contained the following paragraphs. 
 
According to a newspaper report, `three lawyers, including a Singaporean, were sentenced to two year`s jail each for contempt ... The lawyers were found to have committed fraud and breach of trust against ... a defenseless housewife ...`
 
 
 
In your letter dated 12 June 1998 you said `I am the very same Arul Chandran referred to in the newspaper cutting ... as you no doubt already know`.
 
 
 
I then asked whether the Members who voted for you in the last elections were aware of this, to which your solicitors, C Arul & Partners, answered that it was irrelevant to the issue.
 
 
 
Are you saying that someone who has been called `a most vicious and dangerous fraud` by a High Court Judge ... is now the Vice-President of the Club is something of no relevance to the Members? I wonder how you had the nerve to offer yourself for office in the first place.
 
 
 
Come next year you will expect to be the President and, if the Members are still in the dark about your past involvement, you might well be the President, even by default, as happens so often in this club. Are you aware what you are doing to the club? Or is all this quite irrelevant and you do not care?
 
 
 
Have you prepared how to deal with the situation when someone `leaks` it out to the Press ... again a not uncommon thing with this Club?
 
 
 
Even now, how can all the other self respecting members sit in the committee with you; and, when the word gets down, how are you to face the staff - let alone try to tell them what to do?
 
 
 
In the circumstances, what would you have in mind as relevant? I shall be pleased to hear it from you.`
 
 
 
[ast ][ast ] If you wish to know my source, I have copies of the written judgment by Justice Abdul Razak which I shall be pleased to supply you on request.
 
 
 
The alleged defamatory words in the above letter are underlined. On the same day that he sent the letter to Mr Arul, Mr Chew wrote to the president and committee of the club, enclosing all the previous correspondence between Mr Arul and himself, including his own letters to Mr Arul dated 24 June 1998 and 10 July 1998. In the covering letter, Mr Chew stated as follows: 
 
The enclosed are copies of correspondence between Mr C Arul and me to which I refer hereunder.
 
 
 
You will see that the earliest letter was from C Arul himself followed by one signed on his behalf and the latest now comes from the firm of C Arul and Partners and signed as such.
 
 
 
What I seek from the Committee is a confirmation as to whether C Arul is acting in his own private capacity or is he now under instructions from you to pursue the matter with me.
 
 
 
This letter to the president and committee of the club and its enclosures will be referred to in this judgment as the `first publication`.
 The second publication
The president of the club wrote to Mr Chew on 20 July 1998 to inform him that Mr Arul was acting in his own private capacity and that the committee was not involved in the matter.
On 4 August 1998, Mr Chew wrote to the president of the club and sent a copy of the letter to the members of the committee. The letter stated as follows: 
 
Thank you for your letter of 20 July 1998 in response to my enquiry as to whether C Arul is harassing me on the instructions of the Committee or in his own private capacity.
 
 
 
Now that we know he is not on Club business has it occurred to you to enquire from him what his personal motives are? What Arul is doing will only lead me finally to seek the courts for the protection of my rights and that will take us back to where we were four months ago - just when we were led to believe that all that was now behind us.
 
 
 
You can be given the benefit of the doubt that at the time when you appointed him Chairman & Convenor of the Rules and Membership Committee you were unaware of his Curriculum Vitae but then, now with the knowledge that you have, do you still consider him the best choice over the nine other members of the Committee to serve in that position?
 
 
 
Would you say that leaving us 5,000 members at the mercy of whom a High Court Judge described as `a most vicious and dangerous fraud` to administer Club Justice is your way of keeping faith with the Membership who elected you President?
 
 
 
The alleged defamatory words in the above letter are underlined. This letter to the president of the club will be referred to as the `second publication` in this judgment.
 The third publication
On 6 August 1998, Mr Arul responded to Mr Chew`s letter of 4 August 1998 to the president of the club. In his letter, Mr Arul said that he wanted to know what was in his curriculum vitae which made him less of a fit person to chair the membership and rules committee of the club. On 18 August 1998, Mr Chew replied as follows: 
 
I can hardly believe after all the correspondence that has been exchanged between us you now ask me to `set out what I allege is (your) ""curriculum vitae"" that makes (you) less of a fit person to chair the M & R sub committee`.
 
 
 
Where do you want me to begin - shall I go back to square one and ask `are you the Arul referred to in the newspaper cutting ... the Singapore Lawyer who was sentenced to two years jail ... for contempt ... together with two other lawyers found to have committed fraud and breach of trust against ... a defenseless housewife`?
 
 
 
And shall I go on to quote the Judge ... `is he really now saying he is at last a lamb not a wolf under the lamb`s wool. To me that he is not a lamb but a fraud. He is a most vicious and dangerous fraud ...`
 
 
 
And to be described by the same High Court Judge ... who heard the appeal as `an imposter`, `plainly dishonest`, `a liar` and `a chameleon changing his colour as suits him` ... what else do you want me to add to your curriculum vitae? I could go on for another three pages ...
 
 
 
And you say that it is only my subjective opinion that you are unfit to chair the M & R sub-committee. Well then, let us put it to the General Membership. Very easily done through the Club Magazine. It could be in a very simple form of a poll - a `Yes` or a `No` for Arul - I put the facts before them and you render unto them your version.
 
 
 
Do you agree to that?
 
 
 
[ast ] Encl: To answer your question and to refresh your frail memory, attached herewith is an extract of the written judgement of Justice Abdul Razak - no point for you to pretend any more, Arul.
 
 
 
The alleged defamatory words in the above letter are underlined. Mr Chew also wrote to the president of the club on 18 August 1998, enclosing the letter he had written to Mr Arul on that same day. In this letter, Mr Chew stated as follows: 
 
There is a letter I wrote to you dated 4 August which remains unanswered and unacknowledged.
 
 
 
The letter refers to the appointment of C Arul as the Chairman and Convenor of the Rules and Membership Committee and questioning why is he still there in spite of what we now know of him.
 
 
 
The question I put to you was whether leaving us 5000 Members at the mercy of a man who has been called by a High Court Judge `a Liar` ... `a wolf in lambs clothing` ... `a Chameleon`, ... in short ... `a most vicious and dangerous fraud` to administer Club Justice, your way of keeping faith with the Members who elected you President?
 
 
 
Please do not hand it down to Arul to answer; we are not interested in what he has to say for himself. Let us hear it from you this one time.
 
 
 
The alleged defamatory parts of the letter to the president of the club are underlined. This letter and its enclosure will be referred to as the `third publication` in this judgment.
Mr Arul subsequently brought an action against Mr Chew for defamation, on the basis of the underlined words in the first, second and third publications.
 Decision of the judicial commissioner 
Chan JC found that the underlined words in the first, second and third publications were defamatory. The sting in the first publication was that Mr Arul is an extremely vicious and dangerous fraud. The second publication contained the same sting, as well as an additional sting that Mr Arul was incapable of discharging his duties as chairman of the Membership and Rules Sub-Committee in a fair and honest manner. The sting in the third publication was no different from that in the first two publications.
The judicial commissioner rejected the defence of justification as none of the defamatory meanings and the sting in the meanings had been justified by Mr Chew to the requisite degree of proof called for in such serious attacks on Mr Arul`s character and reputation.
The judicial commissioner also found that all three publications were predominantly motivated by malice. Consequently, Mr Chew could not rely on the defence of qualified privilege or fair comment. As for the first publication, it was held that Mr Chew was not entitled to rely on the defence of qualified privilege even in the absence of malice.
Chan JC awarded Mr Arul $100,000 as damages and $50,000 as aggravated damages. As such, Mr Arul was awarded a total of $150,000.
 The appeal 
Mr Chew`s appeal against the finding of Chan JC that he defamed Mr Arul will first be considered. His counsel made the following submissions: 
(i) The judicial commissioner erred in finding that the defence of justification failed. 
(ii) The judicial commissioner erred in finding that Mr Arul was not estopped from denying the findings of Abdul Razak J in 
Tara Rajaratnam v Datuk Jagindar Singh & Ors
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 127
 . 
(iii) The judicial commissioner erred in finding that the first publication did not attract the defence of qualified privilege. 
(iv) The judicial commissioner erred in finding that all three publications were actuated by malice.
 Defence of justification
One of the main defences relied upon by Mr Chew was justification. The law of defamation presumes that defamatory words are false and the plaintiff need do no more than prove that the defamatory words have been published by the defendant. The burden is then on the defendant, if he wishes to rely on the defence of justification, to prove that those words are true. (See 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed), at p 235.)
As has been mentioned, the judicial commissioner found that the crucial sting in all three publications is the charge that Mr Arul is an extremely vicious and dangerous fraud. Mr Chew need not prove the truth of every detail of the words published, but the justification must meet the sting of the charge (see 
Edwards v Bell
 
[1824] 1 Bing 403
).
Mr Chew contended that the charge against Mr Arul is justified. To begin with, he relied on the fact that Abdul Razak J had found Mr Arul to be a `a most vicious and dangerous fraud` in 
Tara Rajaratnam v Datuk Jagindar Singh & Ors
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 127
 . After examining ss 42 to 45A of the Evidence Act (Cap 97), Chan JC said in [para ] 141 of his grounds of decision as follows: 
 
[T]he general rule is that the production of a previous judgment merely evidences the fact that there has been a judgment and there are certain legal consequences. But tendering the previous judgment and then quoting parts of the judgment at length in a question to which the witness refuses to accept as being undisputed will not per se amount to evidence proving the correctness or the truth of any of the facts mentioned therein.
 
 
 
Counsel for Mr Chew did not disagree that the tendering of the judgment of Abdul Razak J, did not, by itself, amount to conclusive proof of the truth of the facts mentioned in that judgment. However, he argued that as a result of the findings made by Abdul Razak J, Mr Arul is estopped from alleging that the words complained of are false. He asserted that the consent judgment by the Privy Council in the 
 Tara Rajaratnam 
 case did not affect the findings of the trial judge. This assertion will be considered although it must be noted that whether or not the findings of the Privy Council affected the findings of Abdul Razak J, Mr Chew cannot, for reasons explained by Chan JC, expect to succeed in his defence of justification by relying solely on the findings of Abdul Razak J in that case.
Reference was made to the decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court in 
Saskatoon Credit Union Ltd v Central Park Enterprises Ltd
 (Unreported) where McEachern CJSC held that a consent judgment of the Court of Appeal did not reverse the findings of the trial judge. The facts of that case are however distinguishable. There, the consent order was granted by the Court of Appeal without any hearing or consideration of the merits and without seeing the counsel for the parties. The Court of Appeal acted on the basis of a letter from the solicitor of the defendants, enclosing the consent order. McEachern CJSC was thus able to say that the Court of Appeal had merely discharged an administrative task by disposing of a pending appeal in order to give effect to a settlement which had been disclosed to the court and that the consent order made in this administrative sense did not `undecide the issues solemnly decided` by the court. In contrast, in the case of the consent judgment allowing the appeal in 
Datuk Jagindar Singh & Ors v Tara Rajaratnam
 
 
[1986] 1 MLJ 105
 , the Privy Council took pains to stress that it was abundantly plain that Mr Arul `had no hand whatever in the events of 30 March 1974, which form the basis of the respondent`s case of fraud against the other appellants`. The effect of the consent judgment allowing the appeal, granted in the context of the Privy Council`s view of Mr Arul`s role in the case, must surely be to undo the trial findings of Razak J that Mr Arul was a fraud. If so, there would be nothing for Mr Chew to rest his argument of estoppel on.
For the sake of completeness, it ought to be stated that even if the consent judgment of the Privy Council did not undo Abdul Razak J`s findings, the question of issue estoppel also does not arise. In 
The Sennar (No 2)
 
[1985] 2 All ER 104
[1985] 1 WLR 490
, Lord Brandon pointed out that one of the requirements of issue estoppel is that the parties in the earlier action relied on as creating an estoppel, and those in the later action in which that estoppel is raised as a bar, must be the same. As Mr Chew was not one of the parties in 
Tara Rajaratnam v Datuk Jagindar Singh & Ors
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 127
 , the question of issue estoppel does not arise and Mr Arul is not prevented from challenging the findings of Abdul Razak J in Tara Rajaratnam`s case.
Admittedly, the requirement of privity may be termed the traditional approach to issue estoppel. In 
Saskatoon Credit Union Ltd v Central Park Enterprises Ltd
 (Unreported) , McEachern CJSC took the view that privity is not required, and that the touch stone of applicability of issue estoppel should instead be whether or not there is some overriding question of fairness that requires a rehearing. The Saskatoon approach does not appear to have much support in England. Furthermore, in 
Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police & Ors
 
[1982] AC 529
, a decision of the House of Lords, which was relied upon in Saskatoon`s case, Lord Diplock made it clear at pp 540-541 that the use of the term `issue estoppel` should be restricted to that species of estoppel per rem judicatam that may arise in civil actions between the same parties or their privies.
It may be said that in 
 Hunter 
`s case, the House of Lords showed an inclination towards the use of the abuse of process doctrine. The matters to be taken into account to determine whether or not there is an abuse of process are wide ranging. These include the need to avoid re-litigation of a previously decided issue or action, the need for finality, the need to avoid inconsistent judgments on the same issues, the prevention of wastage of court resources, and also the need to ensure that injustice is not caused by shutting out the litigation of a particular issue or a cause of action. Examined in this light, there is still no basis for saying that allowing Mr Arul to rebut any allegation by Mr Chew would amount to an abuse of process. In fact, it would be absurd and unjust if Mr Chew is entitled to adduce evidence of fraud de novo and Mr Arul is restrained from rebutting such evidence.
Chan JC considered the question of issue estoppel at length. He also explained that a further obstacle which Mr Chew had to overcome was that he was relying on a civil judgment of a foreign court and noted that in 
Carl Ziess Stiftung v Rayner & Keeler Ltd (No 2)
 
[1967] 1 AC 853
, Lord Reid, Lord Guest and Lord Wilberforce had advised that considerable caution should be exercised before allowing any reliance on issue estoppel in the case of a foreign judgment.
In short, for a variety of reasons, the judgment of Abdul Razak J in 
 Tara Rajaratnam 
`s case did not take Mr Chew very far in his attempt to prove that Mr Arul is a fraud. Mr Chew`s attempt to prove the truth of his words by relying on the cross-examination of Mr Arul was also not successful. The judicial commissioner noted in [para ] 178 of his grounds of decision that in the ultimate analysis, Mr Chew`s case rested largely on unsubstantiated assertions of fact, tenuous circumstantial evidence and inferences. In the same paragraph, the judicial commissioner undertook a point by point rebuttal of Mr Chew`s allegations with respect to Mr Arul`s position. In our view, there is nothing to warrant the overturning of the detailed findings of fact made by the judicial commissioner, who had the opportunity to observe the credibility and veracity of the witness for 19 days, and who asked the witness innumerable questions in order to clarify matters to his satisfaction.
 Raking up the past
Even if Mr Arul had been guilty of defrauding Madam Tara Rajaratnam in 1974, all that would show is that he was involved in a fraud some 25 years ago. An allegation that Mr Arul is presently a fraud is another thing altogether. A person who makes such an allegation must be prepared to justify it. In 
Sutherland v Stopes
 
[1924] All ER 19
 at 32, Lord Shaw explained: 
 
... [A] statement of fact or opinion which consists in the raking up of a long-buried past may, without an explanation - and, in cases which are conceivable, even with an explanation - be libellous or slanderous if written or uttered in such circumstances as to suggest that a taint upon character and conduct still subsists, and that the plaintiff is accordingly held up to ridicule, reprobation, and contempt.
 
 
 
It follows that even if Mr Arul had been guilty of fraudulent conduct some 25 years ago, Mr Chew had to do more than refer to Abdul Razak J`s judgment to prove that he remains a vicious and dangerous fraud to this day, which is the sting behind all three publications. Dredging up the past alone would not be sufficient. It is not a matter of whether or not there is a public policy against mud-raking which would defeat a successful justification. It is simply a question of whether there is justification in the first place, and on the evidence, there is none.
 Qualified privilege
The defence of qualified privilege will next be considered. As for when such a defence may be raised, the authors of 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed), explained as follows at p 329: 
 
The occasions [of qualified] privilege can never be catalogued and rendered exact but most privileged occasions under the common law may be very broadly classified into one of two classes: where the maker of the statement has a duty (whether legal, social or moral) to make the statement and the recipient has a corresponding interest to receive it; or where the maker of the statement is acting in pursuance of an interest of his and the recipient has such a corresponding interest or duty in relation to the statement or where he is acting in a matter in which he has a common interest with the recipient.
 
 
 
Mr Chew asserted that he had a civic, moral or social duty to publish the words complained of in the first, second and third publications to the president and committee members of the club. He also asserted that the president and committee members of the club had a corresponding duty to receive the publications complained of. Mr Arul`s suitability to serve in positions in the club was of interest to him and to the president and committee members of the club. Hence, he contended that he was entitled to rely on the defence of qualified privilege in relation to all three publications.
The judicial commissioner, who accepted that the second and third publications were made on occasions of qualified privilege, held that the question of qualified privilege did not arise in the case of the first publication. This was because Mr Chew wrote to the president of the club on 10 July 1998 to find out whether the committee of the club had instructed Mr Arul to question him on the flyer and not to ask whether Mr Arul was fit to hold office.
Mr Chew contended that his letter of 10 July 1998 must be read in the context of its enclosures, and that the thrust of the enclosed letters was to raise the issue of Mr Arul`s suitability for office. This argument had no merit because Mr Chew had clearly stated in his letter and in his own affidavit of evidence-in-chief that his letter of 10 July 1998 to the president and the committee of the club was intended to find out if Mr Arul was writing in a personal capacity. In para 48 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Mr Chew said as follows: 
 
Consequently, I felt that I should find out for sure from the General Committee whether the plaintiff`s pursuit of `A Layman`s Guide to the AGM` was under their instructions. There were two reasons for this. Firstly, I wanted to be assured that I had not contravened any Club Rules and secondly, I had hoped that if the Committee was not involved in the matter, they would at least restrain him from doing something foolish which might have repercussions on the Club. Accordingly, I wrote a letter dated 10 July 1998 to the President and General Committee of the Club enclosing the correspondence the Plaintiff and I had exchanged so far.
 
 
 
We thus saw no merit in Mr Chew`s appeal against the finding of the judicial commissioner that the defence of qualified privilege did not apply in the case of the first publication.
 Whether there was malice
Mr Chew had to appeal against Chan JC`s finding that all three publications were prompted by malice because it is trite law that where a publication is prompted by malice, the defence of qualified privilege cannot be relied upon. Counsel for Mr Chew argued that the judicial commissioner took into account matters not found in Mr Arul`s express plea of malice, as set out in his pleadings. At [para ] 299 of his grounds of decision, the judicial commissioner noted: 
 
Much of the evidence relied on to prove malice is extracted from the defendant`s own affidavit of evidence-in-chief. They amounted to admissions. Although some may not have been included earlier as specific particulars in the plaintiff`s reply to the defendant`s defence of privilege and fair comment, I do not think however that the plaintiff is precluded by the rules of pleadings from relying on them to prove that the defendant`s publications were motivated by actual or express malice.
 
 
 
One of the key reasons for binding parties to their pleadings is to ensure that there is no surprise at trial, allowing parties to concentrate on gathering evidence and preparing arguments in response to what is pleaded. Mr Chew cannot be said to be surprised if much of the evidence relied on by the judicial commissioner to find malice came from his own evidence.
It was also asserted that the judicial commissioner erred because his entire reasoning on malice was premised on a misplaced supposition that Mr Chew launched a pre-emptive attack against Mr Arul because he was afraid of being hauled up before the disciplinary committee. It was argued that if such a fear was indeed the motive for his actions, then the fear would have ceased when the general committee informed him through their letter of 20 July 1998 that they viewed the dispute between him and Mr Arul as a private matter. In view of this, Mr Chew`s publications must have been for the sole purpose of bringing Mr Arul`s lack of suitability for office to the committee`s attention.
It is evident that Mr Chew was also responding to what he perceived to be a witch hunt, and this perception deepened as time went by. At para 39 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he said: 
 
I thought that if the plaintiff had any intention to embark on a `witch-hunt` against me, it might discourage him if he was reminded that he had to first make sure that his own hands were clean before he made any plans to mete out his brand of `Club justice`.
 
 
 
The judicial commissioner accepted that Mr Chew is someone who has taken a keen interest in the club and has written to the club on many occasions. However, he had no doubt that in this case, Mr Chew`s personal spite, ill-will and desire for vengeance got the better of him. In [para ] 309 of his grounds of decision, the judicial commissioner said: 
 
[H]is animosity towards the plaintiff was fuelled by his belief that the plaintiff was going to haul him before the Disciplinary Committee. He hoped that the plaintiff would desist from doing what he believed that the plaintiff was planning to do, by launching pre-emptive attacks against his character and reputation. He also hoped that the GC would restrain the plaintiff as he indicated that what he might want to expose and blow up would also embarrass the GC, if the plaintiff were allowed to continue to hound him. There is no question of self-defence here as Arul never attacked the defendant`s character or reputation. He merely asked if he had published the Layman`s Guide. Obsessed with the belief that Arul was witch-hunting him, he set out single-mindedly to destroy the character and reputation of Arul and to get rid of him from all office in the Club including getting rid of him as a Club member, if he could. Those were his dominant motives actuating his actions to injure the plaintiff. If that is not malice, I do not know what is.
 
 
 
We could find no basis whatsoever for overturning the judicial commissioner`s finding that all three publications were prompted by malice.
 Mr Chew`s appeal against the award of damages
Before considering the respective appeals with respect to the quantum of damages, it would be helpful if it is borne in mind that in 
Associated Newspapers v Dingle
 
[1964] AC 371
, Lord Radcliffe rightly observed that an appellate court will reject a trial judge`s award of damages only in `very special` or `very exceptional` cases, when he has made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage suffered.
In CA 92/2000, Mr Chew appealed against the amount awarded as damages to Mr Arul on the ground that it was excessive. It was submitted that the judicial commissioner should have awarded Mr Arul nominal damages because there was no damage to his reputation. It was also submitted that aggravated damages should not have been awarded.
General damages serve three functions. First, they act as a consolation to the plaintiff for the distress he suffered from the publication of the statement. Secondly, they repair the harm to his reputation. Thirdly, they serve to vindicate his reputation (see 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed), pp 201-202).
In 
Ratcliffe v Evans
 
[1892] 2 QB 524
, Bowen LJ pointed out that `the law presumes that some damage will flow in the ordinary course of things from the mere invasion of his absolute right to reputation`. In this case, Mr Arul testified that he had the impression that the committee members of the club did not think that he had a stained character. Furthermore, Mr Vince Khoo Thiam Siew, the only witness for Mr Arul, testified that he and the other members of the committee accepted Mr Arul`s explanation that he had been acquitted. Admittedly, such evidence shows that Mr Arul`s reputation was not severely damaged, but this does not mean that his reputation did not suffer at all. In any case, damages should also be awarded as compensation for the distress suffered by Mr Arul. The judicial commissioner was fully aware of this. In [para ] 311 of his grounds of decision, he stated as follows: 
 
The plaintiff is a practising advocate and solicitor of more than 30 years and was at the time of the publications the vice-president of the Club ... The plaintiff gave evidence that he was hurt and I have no reason to disbelieve him. Compensatory damages must be given both for his hurt feelings and the reduction in his standing before his social peers in the [committee] The anxiety and uncertainty which the plaintiff is subjected to in the litigation must also be taken into account ...
 
 
 
Mr Chew`s second ground of appeal in relation to damages relates to the award of aggravated damages. The authors of 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
explained the circumstances under which aggravated damages may be awarded in the following terms at pp 212-213: 
 
The conduct of a defendant which may often be regarded as aggravating the injury to the plaintiff`s feelings so as to support a claim for `aggravated` damages includes a failure to make any or any sufficient apology and withdrawal, a repetition of the libel; conduct calculated to deter the plaintiff from proceeding, persistence by way of a prolonged or hostile cross-examination of the plaintiff ..., a plea of justification which is bound to fail; the general conduct either of the preliminaries or of the trial itself calculated to attract wide publicity; and persecution of the plaintiff by other means.
 
 
 
In this case, the award of aggravated damages was based on a number of grounds. First, the judicial commissioner pointed out that Mr Chew had put forth a reckless justification defence that was bound to fail. Secondly, his counsel had put Mr Arul through humiliating and embarrassing `put` questions during cross-examination as a result of the adoption of the defence of justification. Thirdly, an unsubstantiated allegation of bad reputation was made during mitigation. Finally, there was malice on the part of Mr Chew.
It appears that the main reason for the awarding of aggravated damages was that Mr Chew had put forth what the judicial commissioner thought was a reckless plea of justification. In our view, even if Mr Chew had not been reckless in relying on the defence of justification, the award of $50,000 for aggravated damages can be justified in view of the humiliating cross-examination, unsubstantiated allegations of bad reputation during mitigation and the presence of malice. The award of aggravated damages should therefore not be disturbed.
 Mr Arul`s appeal against the award of damages
As for Mr Arul`s appeal against the award of damages, his counsel submitted that his client was not adequately compensated and should be awarded damages in the region of $750,000 to $1.25m. He said that apart from increasing the sum awarded, another 50% of the enhanced sum should be awarded as exemplary damages. In short, Mr Arul expected to be awarded a total of around $1.875m. This is a totally unrealistic figure.
In Suit 1116/96, the Senior Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, was awarded $550,000 as damages for defamation by the trial judge. This was reduced to $400,000 by the Court of Appeal (see 
Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew & Anor and other appeals
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 97
 ). In that case, the Court of Appeal made it clear that while a cap should not be placed on the quantum of damages for defamation, grossly exorbitant awards such as those made by juries in some other jurisdictions are to be avoided. Admittedly, the amount of damages awarded for defamation depends on the circumstances of each case. All the same, in the light of the amount of damages awarded to the Senior Minister in Suit 1116/96, Mr Arul`s assertion that he should be awarded around $1.875m in damages could not be countenanced. This is especially so since his reputation had, by his own admission, not been seriously damaged as a result of the defamation. His appeal against the damages awarded by the judicial commissioner was thus dismissed.
 Whether costs should be on the Subordinate Courts scale 
Mr Chew`s assertion that costs should be fixed with reference to the Subordinate Courts scale of costs will next be considered.
Section 39(1)(a) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) provides that where an action founded on tort to recover a sum of money is commenced in the High Court which could have been commenced in the Subordinate Courts, the plaintiff shall not be entitled to costs on the High Court scale if he recovers a sum not exceeding the District Court limit.
We need not consider whether this is a case which could have been commenced in the Subordinate Courts. This is because s 39(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act is subject to s 39(4) of the Act, which provides that the High Court may, if satisfied that there was sufficient reason for bringing the action in the High Court, make an order allowing the costs or any part thereof to be on the High Court scale or on the subordinate courts scale as it may direct. After taking the circumstances of the case into account, the judicial commissioner ordered that costs be taxed on the High Court scale. As such, there is no basis for the assertion that costs should be taxed as if the trial had been in the District Court.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This was an appeal against the decision of Goh Joon Seng J (the judge) allowing the respondents` (the plaintiffs`) claim for damages on account of the loss of their goods by a fire at the appellant`s warehouse where it was stored. We heard the appeal and dismissed it and now give our reasons.
 The background 
 
 
 
The appellant was the owner and operator of a warehouse at No 5 Defu Avenue 2, Industrial Park, Singapore 539516 (`the warehouse`). Pursuant to an oral contractual arrangement between the appellant and the respondents, goods in the nature of spare parts for trucks and tractors of the respondents were stored in the warehouse. Goods of third parties were also stored there. On 4 June 1996, at around 3am, a fire broke out at the warehouse, which completely destroyed it and the goods stored therein.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (`SCDF`) received a call on the fire at about 3.29am that day. The fire also substantially damaged a neighbouring premises, No 1 Defu Avenue 2 (`the adjoining premises`). The adjoining premises were separated from the warehouse by a boundary fence, which was a steel sheet wall of about ten feet in height (`the boundary fence`).
At the material time, nine of the appellant`s employees were living in the warehouse. Of these, three were Chinese nationals and they resided in the living quarters of the warehouse. The caretaker of the warehouse, Madam Ram Murthi Devi (`Mdm Ram`) and her daughter, Mrs Khantar Devi (`Mrs Khantar`) resided in the guard`s quarters together with Mrs Khantar`s two children. Four Malaysian workers resided directly above the guard`s quarters. Two sketches showing the layout of the warehouse and the adjoining premises are at Annexes A and B.
The respondents claimed against the appellant for the losses on the following alternative bases: 
(a) breach of the contract of storage; and/or 
(b) breach of bailment; and/or 
(c) negligence.
The question of the quantum of the loss was not an issue in the appeal.
At the trial, one of the main issues which confronted the court was as to the location where the fire first originated. On this, the judge found, on the evidence, that it probably started in the kitchen, which was located inside the office block in the warehouse (the judge mistakenly thought the kitchen was outside the office block). He also found that the fire occurred because of the negligence of the appellant.
Five witnesses were called by the plaintiff-respondents, but for our present purposes we need only refer to two: namely, a forensic expert, Mr Andrew Robbins (`Mr Robbins`) and a Civil Defence Force officer, Major Christopher Tan (`Major Tan`). For the defence, five persons gave evidence. Of the appellant`s employees, only Mdm Ram testified. The others were unwilling to return to Singapore to give evidence or could not be traced. Mrs Khantar also testified. The remaining three witnesses were the insurance company`s forensic expert, Mr Barry Ian Dillon (`Mr Dillon`), the loss adjuster, Mr Chan Hwee Seng (`Mr Chan`) and the appellant himself.
 Evidence for the defence 
 
 
 
It will be convenient if we first deal with the evidence of Mdm Ram and Mrs Khantar as they were at the warehouse when the fire broke out. Mdm Ram told the court in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief that on that eventful morning, 4 June 1996, at about 2am, she woke up to go to the toilet. On the way back from the toilet, she played with her dogs for some 10-15 minutes before returning to her quarters to sleep. Everything then was normal. About ten minutes later, while still lying awake in bed, she heard shouts from the outside. When she opened the door, she saw two Chinese nationals shouting and gesticulating excitedly. She could not understand what they were saying but she saw: 
 
a bright glow at the far end of the premises which was the side adjoining the adjoining premises and where the Chinese nationals quarters were located and I realised that the two Chinese nationals were trying to tell us that a fire was in progress in the adjoining premises. I immediately told my daughter that a fire must be in progress in the adjoining premises even though I could not see any actual flames as the boundary fence separating the adjoining premises and the (warehouse) was quite high ... As we were leaving the (warehouse), I could now see the actual flames as the fire had burned right up to the boundary fence. The office block in the (warehouse) which was right by the boundary fence had still not caught fire, although the fire was rapidly burning right up to it.
 
 
 
As regards Mrs Khantar, she confirmed what the mother said and also stated that `the glow from the fire was very bright indeed` but she `could not see any flames` within the warehouse. After her mother (Mdm Ram) and her own two children were safely out of the warehouse, Mrs Khantar went back to see how she could assist to prevent the fire from spreading. She claimed that on seeing a hose-reel at the front of the main building of the warehouse she pulled it to the boundary fence separating the warehouse and the adjoining premises. In cross-examination she modified this and said she pulled it up to the `middle of the plywood factory.`
We must, however, point out that when SCDF officers interviewed her on the same day, Mdm Ram stated, `I saw the fire burning somewhere around the left side of the premises and it was very smoky.` When the lost adjuster, Mr Chan, saw her two days later (ie 6 June 1996), she said `I also saw a bright glow at the far end of our factory.` It would be noted that she was telling of the glow within the warehouse, not the other side. In Mr Chan`s preliminary report dated 14 June 1996 he stated that Mdm Ram and Mdm Khantar were `unable to state with any degree of certainty where the fire was.` That was only two days after the fire. Yet, they came, some three years after the incident, to tell the court that the fire was at the other side of the fence!
Mr Dillon had no first-hand knowledge of the fire. He did not personally interview any of the workers who were present at the warehouse though his assistant, one Ms Ling, had interviewed five of them. However, he did inspect the warehouse premises on 12 June 1996. In her report (made jointly with Mr Dillon), Ms Ling reported that according to the five workers, the fire originated near the boundary of the warehouse and the adjoining premises. But what they said was not entirely consistent. Some thought the fire first started in the adjoining premises, while others indicated that the place where the fire first started was close to the fence, though they were unclear as to which side of the fence. Thus, based on the evidence gathered by Ms Ling, Mr Dillon was not able to say on which side of the boundary fence the fire started.
As for Mr Chan, he, like Mr Dillon, only inspected the warehouse after the fire. He also spoke to some of the appellant`s workers, but not the workers who resided in the adjoining premises. However, based on the information he had gathered, he was unable to say for certain that the fire started at the adjoining premises. In fact, in his preliminary report to Mitsui Marine & Fire Insurance, he stated that `there are no grounds for a recovery action against any third party.` If Mr Chan believed or was satisfied that the fire had started at the adjoining premises, surely he would have advised his principal to go after the owners/occupiers of the adjoining premises.
 Claimants` evidence 
 
 
 
It was not in dispute that the SCDF fire-fighters arrived at the scene of the fire about ten minutes after the call was received. Later, at about 4.30am, Major Tan arrived at the site leading a team of investigators. According to him, the warehouse was completely in flames by then, but as for the adjoining premises, he saw black smoke starting to come out from the rear, indicating that the property had just started to burn. He found most damage at the warehouse premises. A significant aspect which was highlighted by Major Tan was this. The warehouse contained a lot of plywood, and the adjoining premises, a lot of foam. It was common ground that foam would burn faster than plywood. His reasoning was, if the fire had started at the adjoining premises, then that property would have burnt more than the warehouse. But the position, as he saw, was in the reverse. However, it was suggested to Major Tan, based on the opinion of Mr Dillon, that by the time Major Tan arrived, the fire at the adjoining premises had already burnt out and that was why the fire at that point in time was more intense at the warehouse. What he saw was the tail end of the fire as far as the adjoining premises were concerned. Major Tan could not accept that assertion because he saw black smoke emanating from the rear of the adjoining premises, which to him demonstrated that the fire there had just started.
 Our analysis 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the assertion of the appellant, the fact of the matter was that none of the witnesses who testified actually saw where the fire started. Neither was there any evidence on how it started. The evidence of Mdm Ram and Mrs Khantar seemed very doubtful, though both claimed that the fire started from the other side of the boundary fence. Both of them were some distance away from the fence. Putting it at the highest, they thought the fire had its source at the adjoining premises. Of course, Mdm Ram was an interested witness because she was the caretaker and the fire had occurred while she was there. She even sought to lessen her responsibility by saying that she was not obliged to patrol the warehouse premises, but she only did so voluntarily, an assertion contradicted by her employer, the appellant. There were also other instances where she was shown to be unreliable as a witness, for example, she said people would only use the kitchen to make tea and yet there were cooking pots and woks there. For these and other reasons mentioned in [para ] 10 above, we did not think we could place much weight on Mdm Ram`s evidence, and similarly on Mrs Khantar`s evidence.
As for Mr Dillon and Mr Chan, they also could not say with reasonable certainty where the origin of the fire was, though Mr Dillon opined that the fire started in an area straddling both sides of the boundary fence. The court below was thus left very much with only the evidence of Major Tan, who was, of course, not present when the fire broke out. However, the warehouse and part of the adjoining premises were still burning when he arrived, and based on what he saw, and taking into account the activities of the affected areas and the interviews with witnesses, including the first fire-engine crew, he came to the conclusion that the fire had started at the warehouse. This was wholly consistent with the first call received by SCDF on the fire from one Mr Lim Seong Chuan (`Mr Lim`) of Xin Fa Sheng Renovation Contractor (located within the adjoining premises) stating that there was a fire at the warehouse. In making the call, Mr Lim could not have been concerned about liability but about a fact situation. He would have only reported what he saw. There was no reason for him to give any false information.
The experts of the parties were in agreement that foam would burn faster than wood. Following from that, it was argued by the appellant that by the time of Major Tan`s arrival, the foam had already been burnt, leaving the wood to burn. To better understand the situation, it is necessary to refer to the sketches at Annexes A and B, which also showed the goods of various companies stored at the two premises. From Annex B, it would be seen that at the adjoining premises, besides the foam company (`Hua Foam Trading Co`), Xin Fa Sheng Renovation Contractor, Texwood Furniture Company and Leong Kok Contractors were also located there, with Xin Fa and Texwood being at the rear (based on the facing of the warehouse) and Leong Kok at the front. Eventually, the goods of Xin Fa and Texwood were totally destroyed by the fire, while the goods of Leong Kok only sustained minimal damage. As for the warehouse, it was completely destroyed. In the light of this pattern of damage, the views of Major Tan seemed more consistent. If the fire had started at the adjoining premises, the goods in that premises, including those of Leong Kok, would have been burnt. Instead, it was the warehouse which was completely burnt down. The fire at the warehouse probably spread to that part of the adjoining premises where foam goods belonging to Hua Foam were stored and then onto those parts occupied by Xin Fa and Texwood.
Another contention of the appellant was that the fire, having started at the adjoining premises, gutted the foam goods of Hua Foam and then died down. While the adjoining premises were burning, flames from the adjoining side escaped to the warehouse and caused all the destruction. But the fact that the warehouse and the goods therein were completely destroyed and the fact that Major Tan saw black smoke coming from the rear of the adjoining premises would contradict that contention. They showed that the adjoining side started to burn later.
In passing we would observe that Mr Dillon agreed that, from his experience, many fires start in the kitchen. He also stated in a report that it was possible that the fire could have been started by a smouldering mosquito coil, cooking or other kitchen activities. The evidence showed that on the night before, the workers were working until 9.30pm. They could have prepared a meal in the kitchen before retiring. We should mention that there was no kitchen in the adjoining premises.
Considerable emphasis was placed on the fact that the two Chinese nationals had run all the way to the other end of the warehouse, some two hundred feet away, to tell Mdm Ram of the fire and then ran back to the quarters. The appellant argued that if the fire had started at the kitchen area, which was close to the living quarters of the Chinese nationals, the two Chinese nationals, and the third Chinese national, would have run out of the living quarters first instead of running to tell Mdm Ram of the fire. The appellant`s counsel submitted that this was entirely consistent with the fact that the fire was then occurring at the adjoining premises. But from the sketch in Annex A it would be seen that the distance between the kitchen (which was in the office block) and the living quarters and the distance between the area indicated by Mr Dillon as the source of the fire and the living quarters were really quite similar. We did not think too much should be read into this aspect.
Another very interesting discovery at the site was this. Three fire extinguishers were lying at the entrance to the kitchen. Why? One possible explanation given by Mr Dillon was that `sometimes people congregate their fire extinguishers because they do not want them stolen.` With respect, we found this explanation rather strange. Could it be that the Chinese nationals were trying to use the extinguishers to fight the fire in the kitchen without success and had to leave them there, with two of them desperately running to inform the caretaker? We did not wish to speculate further.
Finally, we ought to mention that Major Tan thought, based on the existence of accelerant at two locations of the warehouse, that the fire could have been started intentionally. The judge made no comment on that. The appellant sought thereby to argue this meant that the theory of Major Tan was rejected by the court. We did not think this inference was correct. Obviously, the judge said nothing on it because he did not think it was necessary to make such a finding. So did we.
 Finding of fact 
 
 
 
The determination of the trial judge that the fire started within the warehouse, and not at the adjoining premises, was a finding of fact. It is trite law that an appellate tribunal should not set aside such a finding, based as it is on evidence of witnesses unless the appellant satisfies the appellate tribunal that the trial judge is plainly wrong: 
Clarke v Edinburgh & District Tramways Co
 (Unreported) at 36 and 
Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 305
  at p 310. This reluctance to interfere is due to the recognition of the simple fact that the judge is in a better position to assess the veracity and credibility of witnesses in so far as oral evidence is concerned.
The appellant`s main contention was that the judge had failed to give any or adequate consideration to the evidence of Mdm Ram and Mrs Khantar. But for reasons already indicated, their evidence was not really helpful; nor was it reliable. We repeat: in their affidavits and testimonies in court, they said they saw the glow (from the fire) coming from the boundary fence. In their statements to the SCDF and Ms Ling, they could not say for sure where the fire came from; in fact, those earlier statements of Mdm Ram would suggest that the fire occurred near the boundary fence within the warehouse. Giving due consideration to what Mdm Ram and Mrs Khantar said, and in the light of all the other evidence, we were certainly unable to conclude that the finding of the judge was plainly wrong or was against the weight of the evidence. On the contrary, in the light of the information furnished by Mr Lim to the SCDF in his call to report the fire, we were inclined to think that the finding was probably correct.
 Duty as bailee 
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant, quite correctly, conceded that the appellant was the bailee of the respondents` goods and as such, he had a duty to take reasonable care of the goods. It is settled law that where goods on bailment are lost or destroyed, the burden rests on the bailee to show, on a balance of probabilities, that he had discharged that duty of care. The judge found that the appellant had not discharged that duty. The appellant contended that the judge was wrong in making this finding.
We will now revert to what the judge found. Having determined that the fire had its genesis within the warehouse, and recognising that a bailee was not liable for accidental fire under s 63 of the Insurance Act (Cap 142) (or s 86 of the Metropolitan Fires Act 1774), the judge went on to hold that the appellant had not shown that the fire was caused by accident, and not by negligence. This was what the judge stated in his brief oral judgment - 
 
... there appears to be poor housekeeping. The premises were full of combustible materials, some in close proximity to the kitchen from which ashes or embers could escape through the ventilation holes.
 
 
 
The appellant claimed that he had taken the following measures to prevent any fire occurring or spreading within the warehouse: 
(i) the building of the warehouse was constructed of incombustible material; 
(ii) the warehouse was protected by a fire alarm system, three portable fire extinguishers and a hydraulic fire hose-reel.
The appellant said that the warehouse, which was erected in 1979, met the fire prevention requirements of the relevant authorities at the time.
It was not disputed that the warehouse was constructed of incombustible material. As regards the fire alarm system, the fact that it existed in 1979 did not mean that it existed and remained operational at the time of the fire. None of the witnesses of the appellant testified that they heard any fire alarm. That was significant. A fire-alarm system which is not operational is no better than not having one. So what were left were only these: (i) the warehouse building was built of non-combustible material; and (ii) some fire-fighting equipment: three portable fire extinguishers (which are only good to extinguish small fires and not after the fire has spread) and a hydraulic fire hose-reel.
Those could hardly be sufficient to establish that the appellant had taken all reasonable steps to prevent a fire from occurring within the warehouse, though they would be useful to prevent a fire from spreading from one part of the warehouse to another. Within the warehouse, there were kitchen facilities which were used by the workers living there. The workers also used mosquito coils. There was an open Chinese alter where lighted incense, joss-sticks and candles were placed. There was no evidence that the employees were, in any way, instructed on these things, or of the fire hazards they posed, should there be improper practices adopted by the workers in relation thereto. No training was given to the employees as regards fire safety. These aside, there was also no evidence to show that the appellant had a systematic plan for the storage of goods in the warehouse with the object of ensuring fire safety. What seemed apparent was that the appellant did not address his mind to these things.
In the present case, there was no eye witness account on how the fire actually occurred. To show that a fire occurred accidentally (instead of through the negligence of the owner/occupier or his employees/agents) it would not be adequate to merely say that the cause of the fire was unknown. The legal burden of proof being on the bailee-appellant, he must produce sufficient evidence to persuade the court, on a balance of probabilities, that the fire arose without any negligence on his part or his employee. This, the appellant had failed to do. The rationale for the common law in imposing the burden on the bailee was eloquently explained by Sachs LJ in 
British Road Services Ltd v Arthur V Crutchley & Co Ltd
 
[1968] 1 All ER 811
 at 822 as follows: 
 
The common law has always been vigilant in the interests of bailors whose goods are not returned to them by the bailee for a number of reasons; insofar as that vigilance relates to the onus of proof, one of the reasons stems from the fact that normally it is only the bailee who knows what care was being taken of the goods and another from the number of temptations to which a bailee may succumb. Those temptations may vary in each generation according to the nature of the transaction and in these days of rising costs include that of the bailee wishing to pay as little for security as he can `get away with`, and the complacency that can arise from the feeling `after all, we are insured`. The present case provides a good example of the need to scrutinise closely the claim of a bailee that he has discharged the onus of proof to which reference has been made.
 
 
 
It must be borne in mind that here was a warehouse where nine persons resided and various human activities were carried out, including the use of fire for lighting kitchen stove, joss sticks and candles, etc. There was no `no smoking` sign exhibited in the warehouse. Neither was there any evidence that the employees were instructed not to smoke.
Having regard to all the foregoing, we did not see how we could reasonably say that the judge was wrong not to have been persuaded that the appellant had taken reasonable care to prevent a fire from occurring.
 Insurance Act 
 
 
 
We should at this juncture refer to s 63 of the Insurance Act (Cap 142) which provides that: 
 
No action shall lie against a person in whose house or premises or on whose estate any fire accidentally began except that no contract or agreement made between landlord and tenant shall be hereby defeated or made void.
 
 
 
This provision is derived from the English Fire Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774.
Relying on the decision of Denman CJ in 
Filliter v Phippard
 
[1847] 11 QB 347
 where the word `accidentally` in the provision was interpreted to mean only `a fire produced by mere chance or incapable of being traced to any cause`, the appellant contended that the cause of the present fire was one which could not be traced. This was demonstrated by the fact that the experts of both the appellant and the respondents were not able to determine the cause of the fire. But it is important to see the views of Denman CJ in their context, where he said, 
 
It is true that in strictness, the word accidental may be employed in contradistinction to wilful, and so the same fire might both begin accidentally and be the result of negligence. But it may equally mean a fire produced by mere chance, or incapable to being traced to any cause, and so would stand opposed to the negligence of either servants or masters.
 
 
 
and concluded that this exemption from liability for accidental fires did not apply to fires produced by negligence.
But for the bailee to invoke this exemption he must positively establish the accidental nature of the fire: 
Hyman (Sales) Ltd v Benedyk & Co Ltd
 
[1957] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 601
 at 603-604, a decision of County Court Judge Wright, whose decision was approved by 
Mackenna J in Mason v Levy Auto Parts of England Ltd
 
[1967] 2 QB 530
, as an exception to the Fire Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774, being a case of a bailee`s liability to his bailor. In the present case, for the reasons dealt with above, the appellant had not established that the fire was accidental and not due to negligence.
But that was not all. Even if it could be shown that the cause of the fire was not by negligence, but if it had spread as a result of negligence and caused damage, the defendant could be held liable. Here, the respondents had also based their claim on the ground that the appellant or his servants were negligent in allowing the fire to spread to that part of the warehouse where the goods of the respondents were stored. While the statutory provision conferred protection on a party who was not at fault so far as the origin of the fire was concerned, it did not protect a party who was negligent in letting the fire spread. In 
Musgrove v Pandelis
 
[1919] 2 KB 43
, the plaintiff occupied rooms over a garage and let part of the garage to the defendant who kept a car there. The defendant`s servant, who had little skill as a chauffeur, started the engine of the car and without any fault on his part the petrol in the carburettor caught fire. If he had acted like any chauffeur of reasonable competence, he could have stopped the fire by turning off the tap connecting the petrol tank with the carburettor. He did not do so and the fire spread as a result and damaged the plaintiff`s property. The defendant was held liable, for the fire which did the damage was not that which broke out in the carburettor but that which spread to the car and this second or continuing fire did not `accidentally` begin.
In the present case the judge found `poor housekeeping`. Goods were not stored with fire safety in mind. Combustible material was placed throughout the warehouse. Indeed, such material was also stored near the ventilation holes of the kitchen. This, in the view of Mr Dillon, was not a good practice; we would even say, not a safe practice. According to Major Tan, he did not notice the existence of any fire alarm system. But even if one did exist at the warehouse, it was certainly not in working order. No one heard it. Bearing in mind the sort of goods that were stored there, the employees of the appellant should have been instructed on how to combat fire, if one should occur, but there was no evidence of such instructions having been imparted to them. Lastly, the three portable fire extinguishers were found at the entrance to the kitchen. As mentioned before, Mr Dillon said one possible reason could be that they were placed together to prevent theft. If that was truly the reason, then such an arrangement undermined the very object of the provision of fire extinguishers. As we held earlier, we did not think this could be the reason. Taking all these factors into account, in our judgment, the fire spread and damaged the respondents` goods because of a lack of due care on the part of the appellant and/or his employees.

: The first appellant was charged with abetting, by intentionally aiding, the second appellant in the employment of an immigration offender under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (`the Act`) read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), while the second appellant was charged with the principal offence of employing an immigration offender. At the end of the trial, both appellants were convicted. The trial judge sentenced the first appellant to seven months` imprisonment and ordered the second appellant to pay a fine of $100,000. I dismissed both appellants` appeals against their convictions and affirmed the sentences imposed. I now give my reasons.
 The background facts 
 
 
 
The first appellant worked as a part-time cashier-cum-mamasan in the second appellant company. The second appellant was at all material times the occupier of the premises located at 116 Middle Road [num ]01-01-04, which premises were known as the Golden Crystal Nightclub (`the Nightclub`).
At or around 12.57am on the morning of 5 September 1999, a party of police officers from the Central Police Division conducted a raid on the second appellant`s premises. One Ling Hui Wen (PW1) (`Ling`), a female People`s Republic of China (`PRC`) national, was arrested during the raid.
On 13 September 1999, Ling was convicted under s 6(1)(c) of the Act for illegal entry into Singapore. She was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment and fined a sum of $2,000. At the time of the hearing of the trial of this case, Ling had finished serving her sentence and was waiting to return home to the PRC.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
Ling gave evidence that she entered Singapore illegally by boat on 1 September 1999. One `Xiao Ming`, a PRC national, had arranged for her entry. When she arrived, he gave her a namecard bearing the name and address of the Nightclub and told her that she could work there as a hostess and earn the tips which the customers gave.
On 3 September 1999, Ling visited the Nightclub`s premises at Middle Road to see if there was business. She did not speak with anyone there on this occasion.
The next day on 4 September 1999, Ling went to the Nightclub again at around 11.30pm. Upon entering the premises, she was approached by the first appellant who asked her if she wanted to work. When she replied in the affirmative, the first appellant led her into one of the karaoke rooms in the Nightclub and gestured for her to sit beside one of the male patrons.
Throughout the next two hours or so, the first appellant returned to the room at least twice. Each time, she would sit and chat with the customers for at least five to ten minutes before leaving the room.
In court, Ling positively identified the first appellant as the person who had asked her whether or not she wanted to work and who had brought her into the karaoke room on the night in question. She admitted however that she had not seen the first appellant since the time of her (Ling`s) arrest on 5 September 1999. Thus, at no time between then and the commencement of the trial on 7 April 2000 did Ling see the first appellant again. She further testified that no identification parade was ever conducted by the police and that a photo-identification carried out in the police station was conducted only after Ling had been released from prison. She was certain nevertheless that the appellant was the same woman who had approached her on the night of 4 September 1999 at the Nightclub.
The prosecution also called one Ghor Ah Hock (PW2) (`Ghor`) to testify. Ghor gave evidence that he went to the Nightclub on the night in question with his friends for a karaoke session. The first appellant was the mamasan who attended to them that evening. After they ordered drinks, the first appellant brought in a hostess, whom Ghor identified in court to be Ling, and gestured for her to sit with him which she did. Thereafter, Ghor continued singing with his friends until the police came and arrested Ling.
It was accepted that, as with the case of Ling, no identification parade was carried out for Ghor to identify the first appellant. The only time after 5 September 1999 that Ghor saw the first appellant again was during the trial itself when the first appellant was the only person sitting in the dock. Nevertheless, Ghor maintained that he was very certain that the first appellant was the mamasan who had gestured for Ling to sit with him that evening.
One Ee Bong Lian (PW3) also gave evidence for the prosecution. Her evidence however, added little to the facts in issue. As such, I do not propose to deal with it.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The first appellant gave evidence that the Nightclub employed four mamasans and over ten hostesses. As a mamasan, her job was to ask hostesses to accompany the patrons.
On the night in question, the first appellant was the mamasan on duty. Her job was to check on the patrons in the karaoke rooms regularly to see if hostesses were required. If so, she would return to the counter outside and press the button which bore the number assigned to the relevant hostess. This would inform that particular hostess that her services were required and she would then approach the counter. From here, the mamasan would lead her into one of the karaoke rooms and direct her to sing and chat with the customers.
The first appellant gave evidence that every hostess at the Nightclub had to have a number assigned to her. The assignment of numbers would take place only after the hostess had undergone an interview with the management of the club and no one could just come in and work without first going through the proper procedure.
On the night of 4 September 1999, the first appellant entered the room which Ghor and his friends were in to see how many men there were. As there were already women there, she merely greeted the patrons and left. She denied bringing any hostess into the room. She also claimed that she did not return to the room again as there were already women there.
Under cross-examination, the first appellant was vague when questioned about the salary of the hostesses. She admitted that the girls could keep the tips from customers but did not know if the second appellant paid them a salary. She also denied that she had asked Ling to sit with Ghor. She claimed that, by the time she went to the room to check on the patrons, Ling was already in there.
One Eng Beng Hwee (`Eng`) gave evidence on behalf of the second appellant. She was a director of the second appellant at the time of the incident.
Eng confirmed that four mamasans were employed by the second appellant at the material time. Aside from the mamasans, the second appellant also employed hostesses, all of whom had to first undergo an interview either with the manager or herself before she was employed. During the interview, the girl`s identity cards and other particulars would be checked and she would also have to fill up a form. Thereafter, a number would be assigned to her if she was hired. Those hostesses who were foreigners would be paid a salary by the second appellant while the local ones earned on a per-bottle or per-room commission basis.
The third witness called by the defence was one Lim Kok Siong alias `Ah Xiong` (DW3) who was located only after closing submissions had been directed to be filed.
Ah Xiong`s evidence was that he was the one who had brought Ghor and his party of friends to the Nightclub that evening. According to him, one Ah Cat, whom he knew previously from another karaoke joint, namely the Apollo KTV lounge, had asked him to patronise the second appellant`s Nightclub. When they first arrived at the club, a waiter showed them to a room. Thereafter, the first appellant and another mamasan came in to ask if hostesses were required. Ah Xiong`s party declined. About five minutes later, Ah Cat came into the room and brought with her a Chinese female, whom Ah Xiong alleged to be Ling, and asked the latter to sit with Ghor. Ah Xiong admitted however that he had not seen Ah Cat since the night of 4 September 1999.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The judge accepted the identification evidence of both Ling and Ghor and held that the first appellant had indeed brought Ling into the karaoke room on the night in question. She did not believe Ah Xiong`s story that Ah Cat was the one who had brought Ling into the room as that evidence was uncorroborated and Ah Cat could not in any event be located to verify it.
With respect to the question of employment, the judge held that Ling had indeed served as a hostess to Ghor that evening. As such, it could be said that the second appellant had used and engaged Ling`s services as a hostess. This alone was sufficient to satisfy the definition of `employment` in s 2 of the Act. The judge further found that the first appellant was acting within the scope of her duties when she offered the job to Ling.
As for the question of mens rea, the judge found that the first appellant had reason to believe that Ling was an immigration offender when she offered employment to her. Her failure to conduct any checks or verification was the result of wilful blindness on her part, in that she had deliberately shut her eyes to the obvious for fear of having her suspicions confirmed. The first appellant was thus convicted as charged.
In relation to the second appellant, the judge held that the presumption of employment in s 57(8) of the Act arose which obviated the need for the prosecution to prove mens rea. Instead the duty fell on the second appellant to rebut the presumption that Ling was in its employment or that it had knowledge that she was an immigration offender. After reviewing the evidence, the judge found that the second appellant had failed to rebut the presumption and convicted it accordingly.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Before me, counsel for the appellants raised six broad grounds of appeal. It was not stated clearly by counsel which ground related to which appellant. It appeared therefore that the submissions were intended to apply to both appellants jointly as no clear distinction was made in the arguments between each appellant. I found this to be rather unsatisfactory as the charge against the first appellant was one of abetment while that against the second appellant was for the principal offence of employment itself. The offences were thus distinct and the elements to be proved in respect of each of them not entirely overlapping. In the circumstances, the proper way in which counsel should have conducted the appeal was to have presented his arguments in respect of each appellant separately. Nevertheless, as the joint submissions had already been prepared by the time of the hearing before me, I allowed counsel to proceed with his arguments in respect of both appellants jointly.
Counsel`s first argument was that the district judge had erred in accepting Ling`s identification evidence of the first appellant when no identification parade had been carried out. He contended that the photo-identification which was carried out at the police station should not have been relied upon by the judge as the photographs used in that identification were not tendered in court. Next, counsel submitted that Ah Xiong`s evidence about Ah Cat should have been accepted by the trial judge as it was not impeached. Third, he urged that, even if the first appellant had in fact approached Ling, she did not in any event have the `subjective knowledge` required under the Act nor did she have reason to believe that Ling was an immigration offender. It was next argued that the judge erred in rejecting the evidence of Eng that there was a system in place for the engaging of hostesses by the Nightclub, and that Ling had not been put through that system. To this end, reference was made to a letter from the Ministry of Manpower dated 26 November 1999 (`the MOM letter`) stating that Ling was only a freelance hostess at the Nightclub to support the argument that she was not in the employ of the second appellant at the relevant time. Finally, it was submitted that the first appellant had no authority to engage hostesses on behalf of the second appellant.
 The law 
 
 
 
The provisions in the Act which are relevant to this appeal provide as follows:
 
 
57
 
(1)
 
Any person who -
 
 
 
 
(e)
 
employs any person who has acted in contravention of section 6(1), 15 or 36 or the regulations;
 
 
 
 
shall be guilty of an offence and -
 
 
 
 
(ii)
 
subject to subsection (1A), in the case of an offence under paragraph ... (e), shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $6,000; ...
 
 
 
 
(2A)
 
Where a body corporate is guilty of an offence under this Act for which a period of mandatory imprisonment or mandatory caning is prescribed, the body corporate shall, in lieu of imprisonment or caning, be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $100,000 and not more than $200,000.
 
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
 
(8)
 
Where an immigration offender is found at any premises or place, other than premises used solely for residential purposes, the occupier of the premises or place shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have employed him knowing that he is an immigration offender.
 
 
 
 
(9)
 
In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1)(d) or (e), it shall not be a defence for the defendant to prove that the person harboured or employed by him was in possession of a pass or permit issued to the person under this Act or the regulations unless the defendant further proves that he had exercised due diligence to ascertain that the pass or permit was at the material time valid under this Act or the regulations.
 
 
 
 
The meaning of the term `employ` as used in s 57(1)(e) is in turn set out in s 2 which defines the term as being: 
 
 
 to engage or use the service of any person, whether under a contract of service or otherwise, with or without remuneration
;
 
 
 
This definition came into effect on 1 March 1996, and is also found in s 5(8)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A). With the amendment to the definition of `employ` in the Act, the previous requirement that the prosecution must prove the existence of a contract of service or any payment before the alleged employer can be charged under s 57(1)(e) is no longer necessary: see 
Tamilkodi s/o Pompayan v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 702
 . Nevertheless, several factors will still be taken into consideration by the court when deciding whether or not the test of `employment` has been satisfied in each case. These factors, which I set out in 
 Tamilkodi s/o Pompayan v PP 
 (supra), include the manner of remuneration and the degree of control exercised by the alleged employer over the workers. I made it clear in that case, however, that these factors are non-exhaustive and each case must still be looked at in entirety when determining the existence of an employment relationship.
 Identification 
 
 
 
The main thrust of the defence both before me and at the trial appeared to be one of mistaken identity. The argument was that the first appellant was not the mamasan who had brought Ling into the karaoke room that evening and that both Ling and Ghor were mistaken in their identification of the first appellant. After hearing counsel`s submissions, I found that there was absolutely no basis for this contention by the appellants. Both Ling and Ghor positively identified the first appellant as the woman who had gestured for Ling to sit with Ghor at the Nightclub on the night in question. Admittedly, no identification parade was ever carried out for either of the prosecution witnesses. While the failure to conduct an identification parade may in certain circumstances render the identification evidence of the eyewitness suspect, it is not every failure which adversely affects the probative value of an eyewitness` evidence. Ultimately, the quality of an eyewitness` evidence ought to be assessed in accordance with the guidelines laid down in 
R v Turnbull
 
[1977] QB 224
 which were adopted by the Court of Appeal in 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
  and similarly followed in 
Awtar Singh s/o Margar Singh v PP
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 439
 . Essentially, the material question for the court should be whether or not the identification evidence was of good quality, taking into account the circumstances in which the identification was made. The non-exhaustive list of factors which the court should consider include the length of time that the witness observed the accused, the distance at which the observation was made, the presence of obstructions, the frequency with which the witness saw the accused, the length of time which had elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police. After perusing the record of proceedings in the court below, I was satisfied that there was nothing which seriously cast doubt on the district judge`s reliance on the identification evidence of both Ling and Ghor in this case. Their testimony was generally consistent and any discrepancy was minor and of little consequence. The judge accepted the evidence of both of the prosecution witnesses and found that neither had any reason to implicate the first appellant. Having had the benefit of observing their demeanour in court, I saw no reason to disturb the trial judge`s assessment of the witness` credibility.
Before me, counsel for the appellants also sought to make much of the fact that the first appellant sported longer hair at the time of the incident than she did at the trial and that this somehow cast doubt on the prosecution witnesses` identification evidence. I found this contention to be completely without merit. A perusal of the notes of evidence in the court below showed that the change in the first appellant`s hairstyle was brought up for the first time, unled, by Ling herself, whose observation in the circumstances turned out to be correct. This showed that she was clearly conscious of the fact that the first appellant had cropped her hair since the incident, which in my view rendered her identification evidence even more compelling as it showed that she was fully aware even of the minutest details of the first appellant`s appearance, and this despite the less than ideal lighting in the Nightclub at the relevant time as alleged by the appellants. As such, there was nothing which suggested that Ling`s identification of the first appellant was unsatisfactory. In any event, only seven months had elapsed since the time of Ling`s maiden encounter with the first appellant and her subsequent identification of the latter in the court below. In my view, this time-frame was not so long as to render Ling`s recollection of the first appellant`s appearance unworthy of credit.
In connection with the above matter, the first appellant also applied by way of motion to adduce fresh evidence in the form of copies of the front and back of her National Registration Identity Card (`NRIC`) before the High Court. The purpose for this was to show the court that the photograph on her NRIC showed her with short, cropped hair, the point being that, as this was the photograph shown to Ling during the photo-identification at the police station, Ling could not have been able to identify the first appellant from it as the woman who had approached her at the Nightclub had sported longer hair. I found this submission to be completely ludicrous and rejected it without hesitation. In the first place, under the guidelines on the adduction of fresh evidence on appeal as laid down in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 3 All ER 745
 and followed in 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
 , it must first be shown that the evidence sought to be adduced could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial. Clearly the copies of the first appellant`s NRIC which she sought to admit before me could hardly be said to have been unavailable or unobtainable at the time of the trial, and for this reason alone I was satisfied that the motion ought to be dismissed. In any event, I found it difficult to see what influence, let alone an important one, the photograph on the NRIC could have had on the case, even if it was admitted. Just because the woman who approached Ling on the night in question had since changed her hairstyle did not mean that Ling would or could never be able to recognise her again. Likewise, there was no reason why Ling should not have been able to correctly identify the first appellant from her National Registration Office photograph despite the difference in hairstyles. After all, it was not as if nor was it ever suggested that the first appellant had undergone extensive plastic surgery and changed her appearance completely or drastically. It is not uncommon for persons, and particularly women, to change their hairstyles all the time. Yet this does not mean that they become unrecognisable every time they step out of a hair salon. It is hardly rocket science to realise that a person`s hairstyle is not the only thing which sets him apart from others. Other more distinguishing features on a person`s face, such as his facial structure, eyes, nose and mouth, are equally important where identification and recognition are concerned. In the circumstances, I saw no reason to interfere with the finding of the trial judge on identification.
 Ah Xiong`s evidence 
 
 
 
This point can be disposed of briefly. Apart from Ah Xiong`s bare assertion, there was no other corroborative evidence of the existence of the elusive Ah Cat. Although the defence had ample opportunity to substantiate Ah Xiong`s testimony, they failed to do so. For example, Ah Xiong claimed that Ah Cat used to work at the Apollo KTV Lounge which was where he had first come to know her, yet no one from that Lounge was called to verify that this was the case. Next, it was also not put to Ghor whether or not Ah Cat was in fact one of the ladies who had accompanied them that evening, despite Ah Xiong`s assertion that Ah Cat had come in to sit with them for a while. It was further telling that no question was ever asked either of the first appellant or of Eng as to whether or not Ah Cat was in the employ of the second appellant at the relevant time. In any event, the first appellant herself had admitted that she was the only mamasan on duty at 11pm on the evening of 4 September 1999 and the defence was thus hard put to explain why anyone else should have been introducing hostesses to the customers at that time. Taking all these circumstances into account, the irresistible inference to be drawn was that Ah Cat was merely a fictitious creature spun by the defence in a last-ditch attempt to shift the blame away from themselves.
 Mens rea 
 
 
 
It will be recalled that the charge against the first appellant was one of abetment by intentionally aiding under s 107(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224). In 
PP v Datuk Tan Cheng Swee & Ors
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 166
 , it was said that to constitute the offence of aiding and abetting, the prosecution must prove an intention on the part of the abettor to aid and he must be shown to have known the circumstances constituting the crime at the time when he voluntarily does a positive act of assistance. I cited this case with approval recently in 
 Awtar Singh s/o Margar Singh v PP 
 (supra) in which I added that the burden on the prosecution is to prove that the accused knowingly facilitated in the act of employing illegal workers.
With respect to the first appellant therefore, what needed to be shown was a dominant intention on her part to assist the second appellant in committing the offence of employing illegal workers under s 57(1)(e), with knowledge of the circumstances constituting that offence.
In my view, there was no doubt that the actions of the first appellant - her approaching Ling and offering her work, gesturing for her to sit and drink with the patrons - on the night of 4 September 1999 taken collectively, clearly evinced a dominant intention on her part to aid or to facilitate the second appellant in engaging the services of Ling as one of its hostesses. But that was not the end of the matter. What needed to be determined further was whether or not the first appellant had intended for the second appellant to engage Ling, knowing that the latter was an illegal immigrant. The case against the first appellant was one in which the prosecution did not have the benefit of any presumption of knowledge. As such, the burden was on them to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the circumstances of the case were such that the first appellant ought to have made the necessary enquiries and that by failing to do so, she had wilfully shut her eyes to the obvious - that Ling was an immigration offender.
Turning now to the question of whether the first appellant knew that Ling was an immigration offender. In my view, there was no question that, if she did not know, it was only because she had deliberately shut her eyes from that patent fact. Firstly, it must have been obvious to the first appellant that Ling was almost certainly a foreigner. This, she could have told, not only from the latter`s fair-complexioned skin and other facial features, but presumably also from her accent, which without doubt would have been quite easily distinguishable from the mandarin spoken by local Singaporeans and one that is easily recognisable as being foreign. Next, the circumstances in which Ling was offered the job and her eagerness to accept should also have led the first appellant to inquire further. Having been granted a licence to operate the Nightclub, it was the duty of the first appellant, as an officer of the second appellant, to ensure that the persons whose services the Nightclub engaged held valid work permits. In my view, the first appellant`s lack of curiosity in Ling`s identity and background gave rise to the ineluctable inference that she deliberately refrained from inquiry as she suspected the truth but was wary of having her suspicions confirmed. It is after all not uncommon for foreigners to seek jobs in places like the second appellant`s Nightclub, and both the first appellant and Eng had admitted in any event that the Nightclub did in fact employ foreign hostesses. As such, the first appellant ought to have carried out the necessary checks on Ling`s status before offering work to her. A bare assertion of ignorance alone was not sufficient to excuse the first appellant`s conduct in this case.
Looking at all the evidence in totality, I found that the first appellant was deliberately and wilfully blind to the immigration status of Ling. The problem of illegal immigrants in Singapore is not an uncommon one. It was a problem which is real, rampant and one which has attracted widespread publicity in all the local media. In these circumstances, the first appellant was, to say the least, extremely foolish not to check on the status of the persons to whom she offered work. It is in fact truly amazing that anyone could have offered a job to a complete stranger without making any inquiry whatsoever about her identity or status. Unfortunately, sheer foolishness itself was not a defence in this case, for to accept it would mean that all employers would henceforth be able to circumvent the provisions in the Act relating to the checking of their employees` status with impunity. The law imposes stringent obligations on persons who engage or assist in engaging the services of others to ensure that the person engaged is not an illegal worker. That obligation was clearly not discharged in this case. In my view, the prosecution had more than proven beyond reasonable doubt that the first appellant knowingly abetted the employment of an immigration offender and, for the reasons set out, I dismissed the appeal against the first appellant.
 The remaining heads of appeal 
 
 
 
The remaining grounds of appeal appeared to relate more to the second appellant and can be dealt with together.
With respect to Eng`s evidence on the purported system of recruiting hostesses only after the girls had undergone an interview with the management of the second appellant, this was again uncorroborated by independent witnesses. While both the first appellant and Eng gave similar accounts of such a system of recruitment, it was telling that the defence did not call any other hostess or mamasan employed by the Nightclub at the material time to verify this story. In addition, the forms which every applicant for the job of hostess had to fill out during her interview were also not produced and shown to the court. As a result, the district judge could hardly be faulted for giving little weight to the evidence of Eng with respect to the purported system of recruitment practised by the second appellant.
As for the MOM letter describing the hostesses as freelance, I found that this piece of evidence was also neither here nor there. Clearly it did not alter the fact that Ling was indeed in the employ of the second appellant at the time of her arrest. Firstly, it was not elaborated in the MOM letter what exactly was meant by the term `freelance`. For my part, I would venture to suggest that the term merely means that the hostesses worked at various nightclubs and were not contractually bound to work at any one particular place. While this arrangement may, under the civil law of contract, have the effect of rendering the hostesses independent contractors rather than employees, the new criminal law definition of `employ` as used in s 2 of the Act, which has been set out earlier in this judgment, is nevertheless wide enough to encompass the sort of `freelance` arrangement in place here. Under the current definition of `employ`, the prosecution need no longer prove the existence of a formal contract of service nor any remuneration or payment to the so-called `employee`. This change in the law in 1996 was clearly brought about by social and public policy, and the overriding need to prevent such `loose` or informal forms or schemes of `employment` from cleverly escaping the consequences of the law on mere technicalities. To my mind, there was no doubt that, on the facts here, Ling`s relationship with the second appellant more than amply satisfied the current definition of `employ` in s 2 of the Act. She had essentially carried out all the duties which a hostess was required to carry out, albeit only for a short two hours, such as accompanying the patrons and singing and drinking with them, a fact adverted to by Ghor and even Ah Xiong, a witness for the defence. Further, the first appellant herself never denied that Ling was indeed in the karaoke room entertaining customers that evening, for it will be recalled that her only defence was that she was not the one who had brought Ling into the room. As has been seen however, this defence was disbelieved by the trial judge who found that the first appellant had indeed instructed Ling in her duties that evening, thus subjecting the latter to the control or directions of the second appellant. That there was no discussion on her remuneration or salary was, in my view, inconsequential as firstly, such remuneration or payment is not required under the existing definition of `employ`, and second, the first appellant had herself admitted that hostesses were allowed to earn the tips from the customers, while Eng gave evidence that most of the hostesses were paid on a per-bottle or per-room commission basis. In my view, all these factors taken together showed that Ling`s services had in fact been engaged and used by the second appellant in the running of the Nightclub`s business. Regardless of whatever formal procedure there might have been in place for the recruiting of hostesses, the second appellant clearly qualified as the `employer` of Ling at the material time within the current, extended meaning of the word under the Act.
In any event, the prosecution had in this case, vis-Ã -vis the second appellant, the aid of the presumption laid down in s 57(8) of the Act. This section provides that where an immigration offender is found at any non-residential premises or place, the occupier of those premises shall be presumed to have employed him knowing that he is an immigration offender. The effect of s 57(8) of the Act is to shift the burden of proof onto the defence to disprove, on a balance of probabilities, both the presumption of employment and the presumption of knowledge: see 
Mohamed Lukman bin Amoo v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 292
 . It was conceded in the present case that Ling was indeed within the second appellant`s premises at the time when she was arrested. The presumptions of both employment and knowledge under s 57(8) were thus triggered and the burden shifted to the second appellant to show that it did not employ Ling and that it did not know that Ling was an immigration offender. The fact of employment, as I have shown above, was clearly irrefutable. As for the presumption of knowledge, I was of the view that the second appellant did nothing to rebut it. It was patent in this case that no checks whatsoever were conducted on Ling`s background at the time when she was offered the job of hostess. In fact, an attempt to this end was not even made and the defence itself rightly did not advance its case on this footing. If there was a system in place for the interviewing and screening of applicants, Ling was not put through it at all. This showed that there was obviously a flaw in the system of management adopted at the second appellant`s Nightclub, from which it could not escape responsibility. In my view, the argument that the hiring of Ling by the first appellant was outside the scope of the latter`s authority was also a tenuous one which could not be accepted. Clearly it was the second appellant who had put the first appellant in the position in which she was in, which position enabled her to do as she did on the evening of 4 September 1999. That the first appellant was allowed to simply approach and offer a job to any woman who walked into the Nightclub showed that the second appellant was lax in its control and supervision of its employees who were obviously given a free reign in hiring hostesses to work for the company. If anything, I was inclined to subscribe to the view that this was most probably the practice throughout the Nightclub anyway during the material time, as the purported systematic procedure of recruitment described by the first appellant and Eng was, as shown above, short on credibility and not independently corroborated. In these circumstances, the second appellant should be held as being equally blameworthy and should not be allowed to escape liability simply by claiming that one of its staff had acted without authority. If this seems harsh, then regard need only be had to the policy of the law to combat the rising trend of illegal immigrants together with its concomitant problems to understand the need for such strictness. If the second appellant were allowed to escape criminal liability in this case on the ground advanced by the defence, then no corporate entity could ever be convicted of the offence of employing illegal workers. This is because the hiring of immigration offenders can never legitimately be within the scope of any employee`s duties. As such, adopting the appellants` argument, whenever a company is charged for having employed such offenders, it would be able to escape punishment simply by arguing that the officer who hired the worker acted beyond his authority since that authority did not include the hiring of illegal workers. On this argument, s 57(2A) which provides for the punishment of a body corporate found guilty of hiring illegal workers would then be rendered completely superfluous which surely cannot be the case. In my view, every employer, be it a sole proprietorship or a company should always be diligent in ensuring that no immigration offenders are in its employ. The duty cast is thus one of constant vigilance. If necessary, strict in-house checks should be in place to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that little opportunity is given for the hiring, whether unwitting or otherwise, of illegal workers.
In my view, the presumption of knowledge was clearly not rebutted in this case for the reason that the second appellant had not shown that it could not reasonably have known that Ling was an immigration offender, having failed to conduct any checks on the latter whatsoever.
For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed both appeals accordingly. I affirmed the sentences passed in the court below, but, with the DPP`s consent, allowed the second appellant a time-frame of one month within which to pay the fine of $100,000.

: This was an appeal against the decision of district judge A Rahim Jalil. The trial judge found the appellant guilty of engaging in a conspiracy with one Don Wee to commit the offence of criminal breach of trust by a clerk or servant in respect of a sum of $3,000. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to ten weeks` imprisonment. The appellant filed a petition of appeal on 26 November 1999 against the conviction and sentence. On 3 February 2000, the appellant filed a notice of motion for leave to adduce fresh evidence. The charge against the appellant is set out below: 
 
You Lee Yuen Hong NRIC No S 7122905Z are charged that you sometime on or about 16 February 1996, in Singapore, abetted one Wee Hian Thong, employed by United B&B Italia (Singapore) Pte Ltd and in such capacity entrusted with $3,000 belonging to the said company, to commit criminal breach of trust as a servant, in that you engaged in a conspiracy with Wee Hian Thong to dishonestly misappropriate the said $3,000, and in order to the doing of that thing, on the same day, in Singapore, you received from Wee Hian Thong the said $3,000, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 408 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
 
 
 The background 
 
 
 
 
 
The appellant, Lee Yuen Hong (also known as `Corrine`), and Don Wee Hian Thong (`Don Wee`) were employees of United B&B Italia (Singapore) Pte Ltd (`B&B`). The appellant was a sales executive and Don Wee was her supervisor and the sales marketing manager.
The appellant had sold some furniture to a customer, one Albert Hong. On 16 February 1996, the appellant, Don Wee and another sales and marketing manager by the name of Jeffrey Chiang, went to 48A Chancery Lane to collect the balance of the sale price of the furniture sold to Albert Hong. At 48A Chancery Lane, the appellant was given $35,000 in cash by one Peter Lim who made the payment on behalf of Albert Hong. After receiving the money, the appellant handed the $35,000 to Don Wee. As the sales marketing manager and the appellant`s supervisor, Don Wee was responsible for returning the money to B&B.
After receiving the $35,000, the appellant, Don Wee and Jeffrey Chiang went to a mobile telephone shop where the appellant bought a mobile telephone for $1,287.50. The appellant paid for the mobile telephone with cash that she got from Don Wee. Don Wee subsequently admitted that the cash that he handed over to the appellant was from the $35,000 given to the appellant by Peter Lim earlier in the day. According to the appellant, the amount that she got from Don Wee was $2,000whereas Don Wee maintained that he handed over a sum of $3,000 to the appellant.
Don Wee did not bank in the $35,000 or any part thereof on 17 February 1996, which was the next working day. It was a half working day because of the upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations. As a result of the Chinese New Year celebrations, B&B was in fact closed for a week commencing 19 February 1996, and business only resumed on 26 February 1996. Don Wee had told the appellant on 16 February 1996 that he would bank in a full $35,000 when he returned to work on 26 February 1996. When the appellant checked on 26 February 1996 if her client, Albert Hong, had paid for the furniture, she was told that payment had not been made. This indicated to her that Don Wee had not yet returned the $35,000 to B&B. The balance of the $35,000 that was kept by Don Wee over the Chinese New Year period was in fact used by him for his own purposes. Consequently, the sum of $35,000 was never returned by him to B&B.
Don Wee was subsequently charged with and pleaded guilty to committing criminal breach of trust as a servant in respect of the sum of $35,000. He was sentenced to one year`s imprisonment.
As regards the cash that Don Wee had given the appellant, the appellant claimed that she had repaid the money to Don Wee. After purchasing the mobile phone, the appellant told her boyfriend, Clifford Tan, that she had borrowed over a thousand dollars from Don Wee to purchase the mobile phone. Clifford Tan was displeased at this because he felt that it was inauspicious to be indebted to another person before Chinese New Year. Clifford Tan then wrote a cash cheque for $2,000 and gave it to the appellant so that she could repay Don Wee. The cash cheque was dated 28 February 1996. However, Don Wee denied receiving any part of the $3,000 he allegedly gave the appellant either from the appellant herself or from any other person.
It was against this factual background that the appellant was charged with abetting the commission of criminal breach of trust by a servant in respect of $3,000.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The prosecution contended that the 
 actus reus 
 of the offence had been made out. Don Wee had admitted that the $3,000 that he had given to the appellant originated from the $35,000 that Peter Lim had paid to the appellant on 16 February 1996. As a servant of B&B, and being entrusted with this money in his capacity as such, Don Wee had misappropriated the $3,000 in question.
With regards to the 
 mens rea 
 of the offence, the prosecution had to establish that 
 both 
 the appellant and Don Wee had been dishonest. Whilst the appellant and Don Wee had agreed that the appellant would use part of the cash received from Peter Lim to purchase a mobile phone, this agreement would only have amounted to a conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust as a servant if both Don Wee and the appellant had been dishonest at the time.
The prosecution argued in their closing submissions that Don Wee had been dishonest. Don Wee had testified that he did not have the intention to deprive B&B of $3,000. According to the prosecution, Don Wee`s statement could not be read in isolation. Read in its proper context, Don Wee meant that he intended to eventually return the entire sum of $35,000 to B&B at the time he gave $3,000 to the appellant. The relevant parts of the cross examination of Don Wee (PW3) by defence counsel is set out below: 
 
 
Q: ... If you say you gave her $3,000, the understanding at that time was that you would give her $3,000 first and she would return the $3,000 to you after the Chinese New Year break? 
 
A: That was the assumed understanding because she knew that the money came from the $35,000, and she knew I would be banking in the $35,000 on the next working day which was after the Chinese New Year. 
 
Q: So if that was the case, it was the understanding that when $3,000 was given to the accused, there was no aim or intention to deprive B&B of $3,000 because ultimately the $3,000 would be returned to you and you would bank in the $35,000? 
 
A: Yes ... that was the understanding that she would return the money after Chinese New Year. 
 
Q: You agree there was no intention to deprive B&B of the $3,000 you gave the accused? 
 
A: I don`t understand `deprive`. 
 
Q: You gave $3,0000 to her. There was no intention on your part or on the part of the accused to return B&B $32,000, the intention was to return $35,000? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So when you gave $3,000 to Corrine Lee [the appellant] you honestly intended that she return you $3,000 so that you could return the entire sum of $35,000 to B&B? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
The prosecution submitted that despite his evidence, Don Wee had the intention to cause temporary wrongful loss to B&B 
 at the time he handed over $3,000 to the appellant 
. This was dishonest by virtue of s 24 of the Penal Code which states: 
 
Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.
 
 
 
The prosecution submitted that the appellant had also been dishonest on the basis of the following facts. She had conceded in the course of cross examination that the $35,000 received from Peter Lim belonged to B&B even when it was in Don Wee`s possession. She also knew that the money she had received from Don Wee came from the $35,000 in question. She knew that the money she had received from Don Wee was not meant to be a personal loan to her. She also knew of B&B`s policy not to allow sales personnel to use money collected from clients for personal use. In spite of her knowledge, she accepted the money from Don Wee and used it to purchase a mobile phone for herself. She did not expressly state when she would return the money to Don Wee, and she also kept the balance of the money after purchasing the mobile phone. She also did not reveal the fact of the purchase of the mobile phone to B&B after she discovered that Don Wee had not banked in the $35,000 after the Chinese New Year break. She explained that she did not want to back stab Don Wee, but this only showed that she knew it was wrong to receive the $3,000. She was clearly afraid of telling the truth regarding the $35,000 since this would expose her receipt and use of the $3,000. The prosecution accordingly submitted that the appellant had been dishonest in her treatment of the $3,000 in question.
In any event, the $3,000 was never returned to Don Wee. The prosecution urged the court to draw an adverse inference from the fact that the defence did not call the relevant bank officer who could tell the court into whose account the cash cheque went and from the fact that the defence did not produce the original cash cheque so that Don Wee could be cross examined on whether the alleged handwriting behind the cheque was his, as stated by Clifford Tan.
The prosecution urged the court to prefer Don Wee`s testimony over the appellant`s account of the relevant events. Don Wee was an honest witness who had no reason to falsely incriminate the appellant. He had pleaded guilty to the charge of criminal breach of trust in respect of the $35,000 and was serving a term of imprisonment for that offence. On the other hand, the appellant was an unreliable witness. There were material inconsistencies between her long statement and her testimony in court. She said in her long statement that the money was handed by Don Wee to her before she entered the mobile phone shop. In court, she said that Don Wee gave her the cash just before payment. She also claimed in court that she only received $2,000 as opposed to an amount between $3,000 and $5,000, which she had stated in her long statement. The appellant attributed the inconsistencies to her confusion and trauma after spending a night in remand. However, ASP Chew, the recorder of her statement, indicated that the appellant looked normal and confident during the recording of the statement.
The prosecution also urged the court to give little weight to Clifford Tan`s (DW2) evidence. Clifford Tan was keen to give favourable evidence in support of the appellant. He was protective of the appellant and reiterated that she was a religious person who would not commit such an offence. He was also evasive during cross examination. Initially, he insisted that he had been told by the bank that Don Wee had banked in the cash cheque of $2,000 himself. When it was pointed out to him that there was no such procedure for the bank to find out who had banked in the cheque, he admitted that the bank had not told him so.
The prosecution therefore submitted that the charge had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The appellant offered a different account of the events in her defence. She said that, after collecting the cash of $35,000 from Peter Lim, she had suggested to Don Wee that they proceed to their company head office to deposit the cash. Don Wee disagreed as that was not the normal procedure to take. He added that he did not want the accounts manager to grumble about himself and the appellant upsetting the flow of paper work. Don Wee then said that he would keep the money until after Chinese New Year. The appellant did not disagree with Don Wee over this as he was the senior manager and she felt that she had no right to object to the way Don Wee handled the money. The appellant also felt that after she had handed the money over to Don Wee, her responsibilities were over.
The appellant also said that it was Don Wee who suggested going to the mobile phone shop. At that time, she did not mind looking at mobile phones although she had not yet made up her mind as to the exact model she was interested in. She also did not have money at that time because her money was with Clifford Tan, her boyfriend. At the mobile phone shop, the appellant asked the salesperson several questions. She felt embarrassed that she might walk out without buying a mobile phone. Don Wee told her to go ahead and buy a mobile phone and said that he would pay for it first. She asked him why he was going to pay for it first. Don Wee replied that, as they were there already, she might as well buy the mobile phone and return him the money later. She did not object, because Don Wee reassured her that it was alright for her to accept the money. Don Wee then gave the money to her at about the time of payment for the mobile phone. He gave her $2,000 which she in turn gave the salesperson. Thereafter, the salesperson returned her some change. As the price of the mobile phone was $1,287.50, the change came to $712.50. She wanted to give the change back to Don Wee but he told her to keep it and return it to him the next time she saw him.
The appellant treated the money from Don Wee as a personal loan from him. It was understood as between her and Don Wee that she would return the money to him. According to her, Don Wee had used the word `lent`. From her point of view, she would be returning the money to Don Wee and not to B&B.
The appellant then informed her boyfriend, Clifford Tan, that she had bought a new mobile phone and that Don Wee had lent her some money for the purchase. Clifford Tan was displeased because he felt that it was inauspicious to borrow money before Chinese New Year. He wrote a cheque (exh D1) and gave it to the appellant. The appellant then gave this cheque to Don Wee. After giving Don Wee the cheque, the appellant asked Don Wee many times if he had returned the money to B&B. Don Wee had replied that he would do so.
The appellant denied that the actus reus of the offence had been committed. The 
 actus reus 
 of the offence with which the appellant was charged was not the receipt of money. Rather, the actus reus was the conspiracy between her and Don Wee. According to her, the existence of such a conspiracy had not been proven. There was no agreement between her and Don Wee to receive the money. Although she did not reject the money, the failure to reject the money could not be interpreted as an agreement to receive it.
The appellant also submitted that the prosecution was wrong to contend that Don Wee had the intention to cause temporary wrongful loss to B&B. Don Wee`s evidence was that he did not have the intention to cause wrongful loss to B&B. Even if there was such an intention on Don Wee`s part to cause temporary wrongful loss, it had not been proven that the appellant had abetted Don Wee in this regard.
Clifford Tan had been described as a highly unreliable witness who gave evidence without regard to the truth. Apparently, he had flown all the way back from Vietnam to testify for the appellant. The appellant submitted that it was incorrect to state that he came back to Singapore to give false evidence for her. Clifford Tan was recalled to Singapore on a subpoena issued by the prosecution. When the DPP decided not to call him as a witness, he was offered to the defence as a witness.
As for the non-production of the original cheque by the appellant and the failure to call the relevant bank officer as a witness, it was submitted that an adverse inference should not be drawn by the court as a photocopy of the cheque had been given by Clifford Tan to ASP Chew. The prosecution was aware of this fact and had not sought to deny it.
 The decision of the trial judge 
 
 
 
The trial judge held that the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with Don Wee to accept the money and use it to buy the mobile phone. It did not matter whether the suggestion to use the money from the $35,000 came from Don Wee or from the appellant. Therefore, the evidence of the appellant that she could not possibly have made the suggestion as she was a subordinate of Don Wee was not helpful. Even if Don Wee had made the suggestion, the appellant would still be engaged in a conspiracy with Don Wee if she agreed to Don Wee`s suggestion. Defence counsel`s submission that the appellant`s failure to reject the money could not amount to an agreement to accept the money was without merit. It was open to the appellant to refuse the money as she was clearly not compelled by Don Wee or anyone else to take it. Thus, the trial judge found that there was an agreement on the appellant`s part to accept the money and use it to buy the mobile phone. Accordingly, the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with Don Wee to commit criminal breach of trust.
The trial judge considered Don Wee`s statement that he did not have the intention to deprive B&B of $3,000. According to the trial judge, this simply meant that, at that time, Don Wee intended to return the full $35,000 to B&B eventually. It did not detract from the reality that Don Wee had the intention to cause temporary wrongful loss to B&B. There would still be a dishonest intention even if the loss was temporary. Support for this proposition was derived from explanation 1 to s 403 of the Penal Code which states: 
 
Explanation 1 - A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation within the meaning of this section.

... the mens rea must be held to have been established even though the deprivation may have been only for a short period and there may not have been any intention on the part of the accused to have any permanent gain to himself or cause any permanent loss to the person entitled to the property. It is quite immaterial whether the wrongful deprivation of property to its rightful owner is permanent or temporary, and further, if it is established that the accused had acted with the intention of causing wrongful loss to the owner, it is equally immaterial whether his intention was or was not to make a wrongful personal gain to himself.
 
 
 
Accordingly, the trial judge held that Don Wee`s dishonest intention had been established in this case.
The trial judge rejected the appellant`s submission that she had no control over what Don Wee did with the money after she handed the $35,000 to him. The appellant stated that Don Wee was her supervisor and she had no right to ask him how the money was to be used. Nevertheless, the appellant knew that the money that she had received from Don Wee was B&B`s money and she also knew that she should not have used the money to purchase the mobile phone. The appellant was not compelled to accept the money from Don Wee. In fact, there were alternatives open to her. Clifford Tan, her boyfriend, could have purchased the mobile phone for her at a later date. Alternatively, Jeffrey Chiang or Don Wee could have paid for the mobile phone with their credit cards at the mobile phone shop.
The trial judge did not accept the appellant`s submission that the money was given to her as a loan from Don Wee. This submission was premised on the assumption that the money that was given to her belonged to Don Wee. Yet, the appellant herself admitted that the money given to her to buy the mobile phone was B&B`s money. In any event, Don Wee did not say that the $3,000 which he gave to the appellant was meant as a loan to her. Don Wee had no motive to lie. He was forthcoming about his own wrongdoings and did not try to shift all the blame to the appellant.
The prosecution had applied to impeach the credit of the appellant as there were material discrepancies between her evidence in court and her long statement to the police. In her long statement, the appellant had stated that she had received between $3,000 and $5,000 whereas in court she claimed that she had received only $2,000. She did not allege that the recorder of her statement had threatened, promised or induced her in regard to the making of the statement. She claimed that she was confused and traumatised after spending a night in remand and further, that she had forgotten specific details of the events of 16 February 1996. The trial judge did not accept her explanations. She was well treated during her brief period of remand. Her claims to have been confused and traumatised were somewhat inconsistent with her assertion that she felt confident as she did not think she had committed an offence. In any event, she could have easily qualified her statement by stating that she was not certain of some events as she was a university graduate.
The trial judge took into account the fact that, after giving her statement, the appellant had verified with her family members and Clifford Tan that the amount she had received from Don Wee was $2,000 and not between $3,000 and $5,000. However, the trial judge did not see how she could have verified the amount in this manner when neither her family members nor Clifford Tan were present when Don Wee gave her the money. The appellant had concluded that she had received $2,000 simply because she had received a cash cheque for that amount from Clifford Tan. This was not a reliable method of recollection. The trial judge accepted Don Wee`s statement that the sum handed over to the appellant was $3,000. As stated earlier, Don Wee had no reason to lie. It was significant that, unlike her testimony in court, the appellant`s initial position that she was given between $3,000 and $5,000 was consistent with Don Wee`s testimony that he had given her $3,000. Accordingly, the trial judge held that the appellant`s credit had been impeached.
The appellant and Clifford Tan claimed that the full sum of $2,000 had been returned to Don Wee by way of a cash cheque. However, Don Wee maintained that no part of the $3,000 had been returned to him. The trial judge chose to believe Don Wee`s account for reasons already stated. The defence had not shown into whose account the cash cheque was deposited, neither did the defence produce the original cash cheque in order that Don Wee might be asked whether the alleged handwriting behind the cheque was his. Even if the appellant had returned $2,000, there was still a shortfall of $1,000 that was never returned.
At the end of the case for the defence, the trial judge concluded that no reasonable doubt had been cast on the appellant`s guilt. He accepted the prosecution`s case and was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the requisite dishonest intention had been established. Accordingly, the appellant was convicted.
The offence under s 408 of the Penal Code is punishable with mandatory imprisonment which may extend to seven years and the offender is also liable to a fine. The appellant pleaded in mitigation that as a result of the incident, she had separated from her boyfriend, Clifford Tan. She also tendered some testimonials and character references that attested to her good conduct. The trial judge did not find those references significantly mitigating. As he did not accept the appellant`s testimony that she had returned the $2,000 to Don Wee, he also rejected her mitigation plea that full restitution of the loss had been made. Nevertheless, he sympathised with her over the stress and anguish she must have suffered during the period of about three years from the date of the commission of the offence, ie 16 February 1996, until the date she was charged in court, ie 8 April 1999. He also noted that Don Wee had pleaded guilty to a charge under s 408 of the Penal Code in respect of $35,000. As a result, a short custodial sentence of ten weeks` imprisonment was imposed on the appellant.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
It is settled law that an appellate court will not lightly disturb a trial judge`s findings of fact, even though it may have some doubt as to those findings. To justify appellate intervention on questions of fact, the doubt must be sufficiently strong to render the conviction against the weight of the evidence ( 
Tan Hung Yeoh v PP
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 93
 ; 
PP v Azman bin Abdullah
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
 ). On the other hand, appellate intervention on a question of law requires that an error of law has occurred in the court below ( 
PP v Low Tiong Choon
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 300
 ).
In her petition of appeal dated 26 November 1999, the appellant submitted that the trial judge had erred in law and in fact for the following reasons: 
(a) the trial judge had found that the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with Don Wee to misappropriate $3,000 when the evidence of Don Wee showed that there was no conspiracy and that the appellant did not abet Don Wee; 
(b) the trial judge had found that the appellant and Don Wee had dishonest intentions when this was contrary to the evidence adduced by the prosecution; 
(c) the trial judge had failed to consider the appellant`s evidence that she was given a loan of $2,000 and not $3,000 by Don Wee; 
(d) the trial judge had failed to consider the evidence that the appellant had returned $2,000 to Don Wee by way of a cash cheque issued by Clifford Tan; 
(e) the trial judge had erred in impeaching the credit of the appellant on the basis of inconsistencies that were minor and immaterial; 
(f) the trial judge had erred in holding that the appellant did not produce the original cheque when a photocopy of the cheque had already been handed over to the police. He had also failed to recognise the fact that the prosecution did not deny that the photocopy of the cheque had been given to the police and consequently, did not consider that the police had failed to investigate whether or not the money had been returned when they were duty bound to do so. As a result of this failure, the trial judge did not take into account the fact that the prosecution had failed to produce a vital piece of evidence that would have pointed to the innocence of the appellant; 
(g) the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
 Did the appellant engage in a conspiracy with Don Wee to commit criminal breach of trust in his capacity as a servant of B&B? 
 
 
 
The appellant was charged with abetting Don Wee to commit criminal breach of trust in his capacity as a servant of his company, B&B. The manner of abetment was abetment by conspiracy as defined in s 107(b) of the Penal Code: 
 
 
107 A person abets the doing of a thing who ... 
 
(a) ... 
 
(b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; 
 
(c) ...
  
 
 
On a charge of abetment by conspiracy, the prosecution has to establish the following elements: 
(1) the person abetting must engage, with one or more other persons in a conspiracy; 
(2) the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and 
(3) an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that thing.
In my opinion, the trial judge fell into error when he concluded that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the fact that the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with Don Wee to commit the offence of criminal breach of trust by a servant by dishonestly misappropriating the sum of $2,000 or $3,000 (`the disputed sum`) which belonged to their employer, B&B. I will now set out the reasons for my opinion.
On the issue of abetment by conspiracy, it was stated in 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
 , 873: 
 
... The essence of conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement will take place in private in such circumstances that direct evidence of it will rarely be available ... One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand.
 
 
 
In this case, it has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant and Don Wee had engaged in a conspiracy to commit the offence of criminal breach of trust in respect of the disputed sum. The evidence in court did not reveal an agreement between the two parties to commit the offence in question. Don Wee himself testified that there was no such conspiracy between himself and the appellant to deprive B&B of the disputed sum. The trial judge appeared to think that the appellant`s failure to reject the disputed sum from Don Wee was sufficient to constitute an agreement to use part of the $35,000 belonging to B&B to buy the mobile phone. This conclusion was, with due respect, dubious for the following reasons.
First, it was unclear who made the suggestion to use the disputed sum. Although the trial judge believed Don Wee`s testimony, Don Wee himself could not recall whether it was he or the appellant who made the suggestion. Secondly, the appellant`s failure to reject the disputed sum must be interpreted in the proper context. Whilst the appellant knew that the disputed sum belonged to B&B and that it was not the practice of B&B to lend their employees money, she was a subordinate of Don Wee and truly believed that her responsibility as a sales personnel ceased when she handed the $35,000 to him. She knew, as he did, that he was responsible for the $35,000 that she had handed over to him and that it was his duty to pay the money back to B&B after the Chinese New Year break. In fact, the former General Manager of B&B, Joseph Goy (PW2), stated that the appellant had `no say` in the way the $35,000 was to be treated after the money was given to Don Wee. When the appellant received the disputed sum from Don Wee, she treated it as a personal loan from him. She had intended to repay him after the Chinese New Year break and told him so. Don Wee`s testimony was consistent with the appellant`s in this regard. Although he did not expressly state that the disputed sum was meant to be a loan, he stated that he had presumed that she would return the disputed sum after the Chinese New Year break. In my opinion, Don Wee at least impliedly treated the disputed sum as a loan that he had extended to the appellant. Thirdly, the appellant`s failure to reject the disputed sum must be examined in the light of the circumstances existing at that time. She was in a mobile phone shop and had made many enquiries of the salesperson there. As she was embarrassed about walking out without making a purchase, she felt compelled to buy the mobile phone and did not refuse the disputed sum as a result.
The appellant`s conduct on 16 February 1996 was foolish but it was not criminal. I did not think that the evidence supported a finding that she had engaged in a premeditated scheme with Don Wee to dishonestly misappropriate the disputed sum at that point in time. Accordingly, appellate intervention in this regard was justified as the trial judge`s finding that there was a conspiracy was reached against the weight of evidence (see 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 ) even after considering the advantage the trial judge may have enjoyed by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses (see 
Yau Heng Fang v PP
 
 
[1985] 2 MLJ 335
 ).
 Was there a dishonest intention on the part of Don Wee? 
 
 
 
On this basis I concluded that the appellant`s dishonesty and the existence of a conspiracy had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It was then appropriate to examine whether the trial judge was correct in his finding that there was a dishonest intention on the part of Don Wee to misappropriate the disputed sum at the time it was handed over to the appellant.
The trial judge found that Don Wee had the intention to cause temporary wrongful loss to B&B. According to him, the fact that Don Wee had the intention to return the money after the Chinese New Year break was irrelevant. He relied upon explanation 1 to s 403 of the Penal Code which states: 
 
Explanation 1 - A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation within the meaning of this section.
 
 
 
It is also useful to set out the illustration to explanation 1: 
 
Illustration - A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under [s 403].
 
 
 
The trial judge also relied upon Abdoolcader J`s observations in 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris
 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 180
  that `dishonesty` in the context of criminal breach of trust under s 405 of the Malaysian Penal Code `
 must be held to have been established even though the deprivation may have been only for a short period and there may not have been any intention on the part of the accused to have any permanent gain to himself or cause any permanent loss to the person entitled to the property 
`.
The facts of 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris
 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 180
  were similar to the scenario in the illustration to s 403 of the Penal Code. The accused in that case was in possession of shares and stocks that were entrusted to him in his capacity as a company director. However, he pledged them to a third party prematurely without the sanction of the board of directors and without lawful authority. Although he did not have the intention to permanently deprive the rightful owner of the shares, the court held that the element of dishonesty had been satisfied.
I agreed with the trial judge`s finding in this regard. As stated in 
 Ratanlal & Dhirajlal`s Law of Crimes 
 (24th Ed) at 1949: 
 
A servant, who misappropriates his master`s property with the intention of restoring it after a time ought to be punished. He has no more right to steal his master`s property for a time than for ever.
 
 
 
Employees or servants should not treat the funds or properties belonging to their employers casually. Temporary misappropriations which are seemingly innocuous and do not cause any loss to the employer should not be permitted by the law in any event. Even though Don Wee may have intended to return the disputed sum to B&B 
 at the time the disputed sum was handed over to the appellant 
, he was nevertheless dishonest at law. Accordingly, the finding that Don Wee had been dishonest in his treatment of the disputed sum should not be disturbed.
Despite the fact that a dishonest intention on the part of Don Wee had been established, I was of the view that the appeal against the appellant`s conviction should still be allowed as the crucial ingredients of the charge against her, being the existence of a conspiracy and the appellant`s dishonesty, had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
 Did the learned judge err in finding that the credit of the appellant had been impeached? 
 
 
 
The appellant further submitted in her petition of appeal that the trial judge had erred in finding that her credit had been impeached on the basis of inconsistencies that were minor and immaterial. In view of the conclusions given above, it was unnecessary for the purposes of this appeal to express an opinion on the trial judge`s finding as to the appellant`s credit. For the sake of completeness, I nevertheless addressed some issues raised by his decision in this specific regard.
The trial judge had concluded that the discrepancy between the appellant`s long statement and her testimony in court as regards the amount of cash she received from Don Wee was material. The appellant`s explanation that she was confused and traumatised after one night in remand was rejected by the trial judge. He also felt that the appellant`s claims to be confused and confident on the other hand were inconsistent. He also felt that the appellant, a university graduate, could have qualified her statement by adding that she was not certain of past events. Furthermore, the manner in which she verified the amount given to her by Don Wee was unsatisfactory. Accordingly, he held that the appellant`s credit had been impeached.
In my opinion, the trial judge placed an undue emphasis on the appellant`s apparent inconsistent state of mind. Her claim to be confused and traumatised was reasonable as this reaction was not unexpected of the average person who had just endured one night in remand. Similarly, it was not unreasonable for her to state that she felt confident as she did not think that she had committed an offence. Whilst not exactly compatible, these two states of mind were not completely irreconcilable either. This was a minor inconsistency which to my mind did not necessarily support the conclusion that the appellant`s testimony was unreliable. It was also unfair to hold the fact that the appellant did not qualify her statement, despite being a university graduate, against her. The environment in which statements are given to the police is unfriendly and intimidating. One should not expect persons to behave in the way they do on ordinary occasions.
I did not think it was necessary for the purposes of this appeal to express an opinion on whether the discrepancy as regards the amount of cash received by the appellant was material. In the case of 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
  it was stated that a discrepancy which had `
 no direct bearing on the facts in issue 
` was immaterial. Whilst the amount of cash received by the appellant was an important fact, it must be borne in mind that she did not deny that she had received 
 some 
 cash from Don Wee. She only disagreed with the prosecution as regards the amount received from Don Wee. Due regard must also be had to the fact that she gave her statement to the police about one year and seven months after the incident. Thus, it was possible to attribute the discrepancies to the long lapse of time between 16 February 1996 and the time the long statement was made. Further, the fact that the method of recollection employed by her was unsatisfactory went only to the weight of her testimony in court and did not necessarily mean that she was lying.
If the trial judge was correct in admitting the appellant`s long statement for the truth of the facts stated therein in preference to her testimony in court in accordance with s 147(3) of the Evidence Act and 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
 , it was my view that very little weight should have been attached to the substance of the appellant`s long statement. As stated in 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
, s 147(5) of the Evidence Act provides that the court, in assessing the weight to be accorded to an inconsistent statement, shall have regard to: 
 
... all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement, and in particular, to the question of whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.
 
 
 
The clear absence of contemporaneity in this case was sufficient reason to accord little weight to the appellant`s long statement.
The courts must always exercise caution when admitting a previous inconsistent statement for the truth of its contents. Although the previous statement may have been made voluntarily, the weight to be accorded to such a statement should still be carefully considered. In this regard, the observation of Abdul Hamid J in 
Chean Siong Guat v PP
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
  is particularly instructive: 
 
Absolute truth is, I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common occurrence. In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court.
 
 
 
 
 
 The motion to adduce fresh evidence 
 
 
 
 
 
The appellant applied for leave to adduce her affidavit together with the exhibits referred to therein and the affidavit of Clifford Tan in support of her application to adduce fresh evidence.
The principles to be followed in deciding if additional evidence should be taken were first applied in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 3 All ER 745
. They were applied by the Court of Appeal in 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
 . The principles are as follows: 
(1) firstly, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; 
(2) secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given at trial, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case; and 
(3) thirdly, the evidence must be apparently credible although it need not be incontrovertible.
It was also stated in 
 Juma`at bin Samad v PP 
 that exceptionally the court might allow fresh evidence to be adduced even if it could not strictly be said that the evidence was not available at the time of the trial, if it could be shown that a miscarriage of justice had occurred. This is consistent with the core principle in s 257 of the Criminal Procedure Code that fresh evidence may be taken if it is necessary in the interests of justice.
Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that the circumstances in which an application to adduce fresh evidence will be allowed are extremely limited. As stated in 
Chung Tuck Kwai v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 693
 , a liberal approach to such applications is contrary to the adversarial system as it is tantamount to `
 allowing lacunae in the case of any party to be filled in by afterthoughts or reconstruction of any case after it has failed at trial 
`.
The fresh evidence that the appellant sought to adduce was that the cash cheque written by Clifford Tan had been deposited into the DBS account number 033-14571-3, and that the holder of that account was Don Wee. Alternatively, the appellant asked to be granted leave for the defence to call one Ms Jessie Yip, assistant branch manager of DBS Bank, Clementi branch, to give evidence that the cash cheque written by Clifford Tan had been deposited into the DBS account number 003-14571-3 and that the holder of that account was Wee Hian Thong, ie Don Wee.
 Could the evidence that the appellant sought to adduce have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial? 
 
 
 
The appellant`s position was that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for the trial below. Clifford Tan had given a photocopy of the cash cheque to ASP Chew. He subsequently went to Vietnam to work and could not be reached as a result. He returned only to give evidence at the trial. The appellant and Clifford Tan had also separated. Thus, the appellant was not able to obtain the original copy of the cheque. Due to banking secrecy, she could not check the matter with the bank as the account from which the cheque was issued belonged to Clifford Tan and not to her. The appellant simply assumed that, when the photocopy of the cheque was handed to the police, they would investigate the cheque and the account into which it was deposited, since this issue was important in the trial.
On the other hand, the prosecution submitted that the evidence could have been made available for the trial below. A photocopy of the cash cheque was shown to Don Wee in the course of his cross-examination by the defence. Don Wee was asked if he remembered being given the cheque. He was also asked if the figure `033-14571-3` written on the reverse side of the cheque was his DBS account number. Don Wee answered both questions in the negative. The prosecution suggested that Don Wee should have been asked by the defence if the handwriting on the reverse side of the cheque was his handwriting. Further, it was not sufficient for the defence to state that Clifford Tan had information that the cheque was deposited into Don Wee`s account. Clifford Tan had stated that he had made enquiries with the bank vis-Ã -vis the cheque and into whose account it had been deposited. However, everything that he allegedly heard from officers of the bank was hearsay. The prosecution contended that the defence should have stood down the matter to make the necessary confirmation with the prosecution or requested for further investigations. By seeking to adduce fresh evidence at the appellate stage, the appellant was effectively depriving Don Wee of any opportunity to explain any inconsistencies that might arise in his own evidence as a result of the new evidence.
In my opinion, the evidence that the appellant sought to adduce in the criminal motion could have been obtained with reasonable diligence for purposes of the trial. I agreed with the prosecution that the defence should have asked Don Wee if he had written the figures on the reverse side of the cheque. A handwriting expert could also have been called. If it was found that Don Wee had indeed written the figures, this would have supported the inference that the cheque was received and subsequently banked in by Don Wee.
Further, no good explanation was furnished by the defence as to why Jessie Yap was not called as a defence witness for the trial below. If she was allowed to give evidence at this stage, the prosecution would be allowed to cross-examine her. It would therefore be necessary for the appellate court to take such evidence or to order that such evidence be taken again by the trial court. This might be unjust as the trial judge`s recollection of the case would have been affected by the lapse of time. In addition, ordering a re-trial for the purposes of taking fresh evidence in this case would be tantamount to allowing the defence to take advantage of its own default (see 
Fazal Din v PP
 
 
[1949] MLJ 123
 ).
Finally, I did not think that the appellant`s assumption that ASP Chew would carry out investigations on whether or not the money had been returned to Don Wee was a legitimate assumption. The prosecution was under no obligation to negative any defence or explanation until it was raised by the appellant. The appellant had to raise sufficient evidence of her defence before it fell on the prosecution to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt (see 
R v Lobell
 
[1957] 1 QB 547
). It was an essential part of the appellant`s defence that 
 she had repaid Don Wee by way of a cash cheque 
. On the other hand, the prosecution merely had to prove the that the appellant conspired with Don Wee to dishonestly misappropriate the sum in question. It was not essential for the prosecution to prove that the appellant did not return the money since the prosecution`s case was that the appellant`s acceptance of the money and her knowledge of B&B`s policy against lending money to employees were sufficient to establish the conspiracy and the appellant`s dishonesty. It was clearly open to the appellant`s lawyers to seek an adjournment during the trial for the purpose of obtaining more evidence to support a critical part of the appellant`s defence.
In view of my conclusions above, it was not necessary to examine whether the other two requirements of 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  were satisfied. Accordingly, the appellant`s motion to adduce fresh evidence was not granted. For the sake of completeness, I will briefly analyse whether the exception in 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  could have been invoked by the appellant in any event.
 Will the rejection of fresh evidence in this case result in a miscarriage of justice? 
 
 
 
The exception in 
 Juma`at bin Samad v PP 
 is invoked where a rejection of the fresh evidence would result in a miscarriage of justice. The exception applies even if the fresh evidence could have been made available at the trial. Nonetheless, it is a narrow exception and should only be invoked when the circumstances are extenuating. Such circumstances `
 may include the fact that the offence is a serious one attracting grave consequences and the fact that the additional evidence sought to be adduced is highly cogent and pertinent and the strength of which renders the conviction unsafe 
` (see 
Chan Chun Yee v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 638
 , 641).
If there was sufficient evidence that $2,000 had been deposited into Don Wee`s bank account, the outcome of the case might have been affected in several ways. First, such evidence would have supported the appellant`s statement that she had given a cheque for $2,000 to Don Wee. Secondly, there would have been stronger support for the appellant`s submission that she had treated the $2,000 as a loan and that she had intended to repay Don Wee. Thirdly, the trial judge might have formed a more positive view on the reliability of the testimony of the appellant and Clifford Tan, since the fresh evidence would have corroborated their testimony that the $2,000 had been returned to Don Wee. Accordingly, the evidence that the appellant sought to adduce would probably have strengthened her defence at the trial.
However, it remained my view that the interests of justice did not require such evidence to be adduced at this late stage. It was unclear whether the specific evidence that the appellant intended to adduce in this motion would sufficiently establish the fact that the cash cheque had been deposited into Don Wee`s account. In her submissions, the appellant stated that she intended to adduce the evidence contained in her affidavit and the affidavit of Clifford Tan, together with two letters from the bank that were referred to in Clifford Tan`s affidavit, in order to establish the fact that the cash cheque had been deposited into Don Wee`s account. Alternatively, the appellant stated that she intended to call Jessie Yap to give evidence to that effect.
I did not think that Clifford Tan`s affidavit evidence was reliable in view of its hearsay character. Paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 of his affidavit simply set out his version of what the bank officer, Jessie Yap, had told him as regards the cash cheque and into whose account it was deposited. As regards Jessie Yap, no good reason was furnished by the defence as to why she was not called as a witness. It would not be fair to give the defence another bite of the cherry at this late stage. The injustice and inconvenience of a retrial also militate against allowing Ms Yap to give evidence. Although it is unfortunate that the appellant should be disadvantaged by the poor judgment of her counsel, it would be unwise to condone a practice whereby counsel`s mistakes in the lower courts can be remedied at the appellate stage of the proceedings.
Therefore, the exception in 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  could not be invoked by the appellant. Accordingly, the criminal motion should be denied.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
The trial judge erred in fact and law when he found that the elements of the charge against the appellant had been made out by the prosecution. In my opinion, the prosecution had failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt a conspiracy between the appellant and Don Wee and a dishonest intention on the part of the appellant. Accordingly, I allowed the appeal against the conviction, and quashed the sentence of ten weeks` imprisonment.
Outcome:
Appeal against conviction allowed; sentence of ten weeks` imprisonment set aside.",2000-03-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

: This was a motion by the applicant, Ng Ai Tiong, purportedly made under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (`SCJA`). The motion arose from my decision in MA 113/99 
PP v Ng Ai Tiong
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 454
  in which I allowed the prosecution`s appeal against the acquittal of the applicant by the trial judge. The applicant was convicted of an offence punishable under s 116 read with s 193 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and was sentenced to a term of one year`s imprisonment.
The detailed facts of the case, and my determination thereon, are set out in my judgment in MA 113/99 and I do not propose to repeat them in full here. Briefly, the applicant was charged with the offence of abetting one Roger Ong Soon Chye (`Roger Ong`), by instigating him to commit an offence of giving false evidence in a stage of a judicial proceeding. The charge was brought against the applicant as a result of the statements made and questions asked by the applicant to Roger Ong during a short encounter that took place between them on the evening of 24 March 1999. At the district court level, the trial judge acquitted the applicant, having found that the element of `instigation` had not been established on the facts. The appeal by the Public Prosecutor came before me on 18 November 1999 and I allowed the appeal after hearing the arguments from both sides.
 Procedural error in application 
 
 
 
At the outset, I am compelled to point out a critical procedural error made by counsel for the applicant in bringing this motion. In the title of the motion paper filed, counsel for the applicant had stated that this motion was `in the matter of s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322)`. However, counsel failed to elaborate in his prayer what exactly was the court order that was being sought. What was stated in the prayer was merely the following: `... counsel for the applicant moves this Honourable Court for the following order`, which was then followed by four questions. But what is the court to order with respect to the four stated questions?
I was of course able to deduce that an application made pursuant to s 60 of the SCJA would be one seeking a reference to the Court of Appeal on certain questions of law arising from a criminal appeal heard in the High Court. However, the request of the applicant for a specific order that the questions framed be reserved for determination by the Court of Appeal must still be clearly articulated in the prayer sought. It is a fundamental requirement in applications made to the court that the court receives proper notice of what exactly is being asked from it. This necessitates that counsel enunciates clearly in the relevant court papers, such as in the motion paper in this case, the precise order that is being requested.
In the present case, this basic requirement was evidently not satisfied. A careful perusal of both the motion paper as well as the notice of motion filed showed that nowhere in either of the documents was it stated that the applicant was seeking to refer the four questions to the Court of Appeal for consideration. This blatant oversight by counsel for the applicant would have been sufficient reason for me to dismiss this application. However, as no objections were raised by the prosecution on this matter, I decided to allow counsel the opportunity to canvass his arguments before me with respect to the motion brought.
 Questions posed by the applicant 
 
 
 
The following four questions were stated in the motion paper:
 
 
(1)
 
(a)
 
Whether the word `instigates` in s 107(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) requires the prosecution to show that `there had been active suggestion, support, stimulation or encouragement ...` [as pronounced in 
PP v Lim Tee Hian
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 45
 ] or a `mere intention`.
 
 
 
 
(b)
 
Whether the words `... thing ...` in s 107 and `... that thing ...` in s 107(a) of the Penal Code require the prosecution to show that at the time of the `instigation` the abetted knew or can be said to have reasonably known what `thing` the abettor was referring to at that point of time as opposed to what the abettor subsequently discerns.
 
 
 
 
(c)
 
Whether, when the word `thing` in s 107 of the Penal Code as spoken or uttered or done by the abettor is capable in law of two interpretations, one legal and the other illegal, must the prosecution prove that the abettor was only referring to the `thing` illegal or is it sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the abetted understood or thought that it is an illegal thing. Additionally, whether the courts can or should scrutinise by an objective or subjective test the `thing` done, uttered or said by the abettor to determine its legality.
 
 
 
(2)
 
 
Whether the appellate court hearing an appeal from a district court can be said to have passed a sentence `... according to law ...` [as laid down in s 108(n)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)] or `... save in accordance with law ...` [as required under art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution] when it reverses the order of acquittal, and imposes a jail term of one year without hearing or affording an opportunity for counsel for the applicant or the applicant to tender the plea in mitigation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Section 60, SCJA - Applicable principles 
 
 
 
 
 
Before moving on to examine the principles of law relating to an application under s 60 of the SCJA, it is useful to first set out the relevant part of the section: 
 
 
(1) When a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court in the exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction, the Judge may on the application of any party, and shall on the application of the Public Prosecutor, reserve for the decision of the Court of Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the matter and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the case.
  
 
 
The law governing a s 60 application is well-established and the relevant principles have been extensively dealt with by our courts (see 
Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP
 
 
[1990] SLR 301
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 275
 , affirmed 
[1991] SLR 235
; 
[1991] 3 MLJ 280
; 
Chan Hiang Leng Colin v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 687
 ; 
PP v Bridges Christopher
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 217
  and 
Zeng Guoyuan v PP (No 2)
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 883
 ). Although s 60 of the SCJA was repealed and re-enacted by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 1998 (No 43 of 1998), it is obvious that the essence of s 60(1) has remained unchanged and therefore the principles laid down in the previous authorities should nevertheless remain applicable to the present case.
The requirements which must be satisfied before a s 60 application can be allowed are set out clearly in the words of the section itself. These requirements can be summarised as follows: 
(i) There must be a question of law. 
(ii) This question of law must be one of public interest and not of mere personal importance to the parties alone. 
(iii) The question must have arisen in the matter dealt with by the High Court in the exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction. 
(iv) The determination of the question by the High Court must have affected the outcome of the case.
It should be borne in mind that where the application is brought by any party other than the Public Prosecutor, the power of the High Court under s 60 is discretionary in nature. This means that, even if all the above requirements have been satisfied, the court still retains the discretion to disallow a reference to the Court of Appeal.
The above listed conditions have been extensively interpreted and examined by previous local judicial authorities. In all these cases, it has been the common emphasis that the discretion under s 60, SCJA, must be exercised sparingly by the High Court. This is to give recognition and effect to Parliament`s intention for the High Court to be the final appellate court for criminal cases commenced in the subordinate courts. The importance of maintaining finality in such proceedings must not be seen to be easily compromised through the use of such a statutory device. In 
Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP
 
 
[1990] SLR 301
 , 311; 
[1990] 3 MLJ 275
, 280, Chan Sek Keong J [as he then was] had cautioned aptly that: 
 
[Section 60, SCJA] is not an ordinary appeal provision to argue points of law which are settled or novel points which can be decided by the application or extension of established principles of law or the application of statutory provisions which have been authoritatively construed by higher courts.
 
 
 
Hence, it is imperative that s 60 of the SCJA is utilised only in exceptional cases so as to ensure that the proper purpose of the section is not abused to serve as a form of `backdoor appeal`.
I now turn to consider the questions that were raised by the applicant.
 Question (1)(a) 
 
 
 
Question (1)(a) was an issue which never arose in the appeal. The test on what constitutes `instigation`, as set out in 
PP v Lim Tee Hian
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 45
 , was the very test that I had followed and applied in deciding the appeal. The principle that there must be some `active suggestion, support, stimulation or encouragement to make good the offence of abetment by instigation` was not disputed by either the prosecution or the defence (applicant). I had found on the facts of the case that the conduct of the applicant clearly went beyond `active suggestion` and there was no doubt that the element of `instigation` had been established according to the test laid down in 
 PP v Lim Tee Hian 
 (supra). This question clearly did not warrant reference to the Court of Appeal as there was no real issue of law arising from it.
 Question (1)(b) 
 
 
 
Although not expressed directly as such, question 1(b) was in fact a question that dealt with the requisite intention or knowledge of the person abetted and/or that of the abettor, which the prosecution must prove to establish abetment by instigation. This was an issue which I had already addressed and determined when deciding the appeal. In my judgment delivered for the appeal, it was unambiguously stated that it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove that the person abetted had the requisite knowledge or intention for the commission of the principal offence. Neither was it necessary for the abettor to express directly his criminal intention to the person abetted. As was pointed out in my earlier judgment, the answer to this issue could be found by a reference to the plain words of Explanation 3 of s 108 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
Given the clear wording of the relevant portions of s 108, this was an issue which was free from difficulty or uncertainty and which could be determined by a straightforward application of the statutory provision. There was no reason for me to refer this question to the Court of Appeal for its consideration.
 Question 1(c) 
 
 
 
This question was rather confusing and it was unclear what the applicant meant exactly in asking `whether the word ""
 thing 
"" in s 107 of the Penal Code as spoken or uttered or done by the abettor is capable in law of two interpretations, one legal and the other illegal`. No clarification was given as to what is the `legal` and `illegal` distinction that is being drawn. In any event, it should be apparent, through simple logical reasoning, that a person can only be guilty of abetment under s 107 of the Penal Code if he is abetting another to do a `
 thing 
` that is illegal and which would constitute an offence. A person cannot be guilty of abetment if he is `abetting` another to do a `thing` which is perfectly legal. Therefore, the word `thing` in s 107 must necessarily refer to an act which is illegal. Accordingly, there was no issue at all on the legality of the `thing` done, uttered or said by the abettor. For this reason, I was of the view that this question should not be reserved for the Court of Appeal`s consideration.
 Question 2 
 
 
 
What the applicant was seeking to suggest in asking this question was effectively that, before passing a sentence a court is duty bound to invite the convicted person to present his mitigating plea. Such a contention must be strenuously rejected. In any case being heard before the court, it is the defence counsel who has a duty to defend the accused, his client. The court has no duty to defend the accused and neither is it obliged to assist the accused in presenting his case. The authorities that were cited by counsel for the applicant were not relevant and in none of them was the proposition suggested by the applicant endorsed. At the conclusion of the hearing of a criminal matter, the impetus is upon the counsel for the accused to bring to the attention of the court all the mitigating factors and circumstances.
In the present case, the question of mitigation did not arise at all in the course of the appeal. At the end of the hearing of the appeal, I had convicted the applicant of the charge proceeded against him. At that juncture, the prosecution had applied for an outstanding charge [DAC 28312/98] to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing the applicant. The applicant`s consent for the outstanding charge to be considered was duly obtained and the charge was taken into account by the court in passing the sentence on the applicant. I will emphasize that at no point in time did the applicant or his counsel make any attempt to raise any mitigating circumstances in favour of the applicant. Neither was there any objection to the sentence imposed on the applicant. If counsel had required more time to receive further instructions before tendering a plea in mitigation, then such a request should have been made to the court. There was, however, no request at all to present any plea in mitigation on behalf of the applicant. I cannot see how this was a situation whereby the applicant was deprived of an opportunity to tender a mitigating plea. As this issue did not arise at all in the appeal, I decided not to refer it to the Court of Appeal.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
After hearing the arguments tendered by counsel for the applicant, I was of the view that there was absolutely no merit in this criminal motion. Instead of focusing on the issues to be addressed in a s 60 application, counsel for the applicant had merely sought to argue the appeal against my decision in the Magistrate`s Appeal. I must reiterate here that the purpose of a criminal motion brought pursuant to s 60 of the SCJA is not to enable a party to bring a `backdoor appeal`. A party`s failure to lodge a notice of appeal within the requisite period does not allow him to then resort to s 60 as a means of bringing the matter further to the Court of Appeal. As the legal requirements of s 60, SCJA, had not been satisfied in the present case, I ordered the motion to be dismissed.

 Synopsis 
The second defendants are a ship owning and operating company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The plaintiff entered their employ in 1982 as a junior radio officer. By 1996, the plaintiff had attained the rank of second officer (radio) and in April 1996, the second defendants assigned him to take up this position aboard their vessel `Cardigan Bay`.
In May 1996, the vessel was dry-docked at Sembawang Shipyard Ltd, Singapore, for the purpose of modifying the main mast in order to qualify the vessel to undertake the American trade. The main contractors for the works were Sembawang Shipyard Ltd (`Sembawang`) and they in turn employed the first defendants, another Singapore company, as sub-contractors to carry out various portions of the works.
The works included the removal of all aerials, lighting and equipment (including the radar) from the main mast, the subsequent modification of that mast and the re-siting and re-fitting of the objects removed onto the modified mast. The plaintiff had been asked by the second defendants` superintendent, Mr Alan Turtle, to `oversee` the mast modifications. His job was to ensure that the equipment was not damaged by the first defendants in the course of removal or re-siting.
One of the items which had to be taken off the mast was a radar antenna. This work was undertaken on 27 May 1996. The first stage of the work was the removal of the nuts and bolts of the antenna. This was done by two of the first defendants` workers, Lim and Letchumanan (`Letchu`). They then attached strops to the antenna and attached it to a dock-side crane. The plaintiff provided a guide rope for the lowering operation and directions to the shore crane were given by the first defendants` foreman, one Ramasamy (also known as Raja), who was at the starboard bridge wing.
The radar antenna was lowered onto the starboard bridge wing by the crane. It then had to be moved into the wheelhouse for storage while the mast modification works were undertaken. It was a long narrow piece of equipment but heavy, weighing approximately 186 kg. Its heaviest portion was the middle where the motor was attached.
The only way of moving the antenna into the wheelhouse was to physically carry it in. It was generally agreed that four men were needed for this job. The plaintiff`s story is that the first defendants had only three workers available at the time and that he stood in as the fourth man and assisted them in the lift. He also directed the operation. It took two lifts to get the antenna into the wheelhouse. At the end of the second lift, the antenna was placed next to the chart table. The plaintiff then initiated a third lift in order to reposition the antenna slightly. According to him, on this final lift, two of the first defendants` workers failed to lift or take any of the weight. Upon lowering the equipment back to the deck, the plaintiff felt a severe pain in his lower back.
The plaintiff`s pain continued over the next few days. On 1 June 1996, he visited the shipyard clinic and was given some painkillers and a deep heat rub by the doctor in charge. The plaintiff continued to work on board the vessel throughout the period that it remained in dry-dock and during its post dry-dock voyage to New York. This was despite his severe back pain, discomfort and worsening sciatic pain from the time of the accident. On 5 August 1996, the plaintiff left the ship and was flown home to the United Kingdom from New York.
The day after he arrived home, the plaintiff saw his general practitioner who thought he was suffering from a hamstring pain. The pain persisted, however, and on 23 August 1996, the plaintiff was declared unfit for duty. Subsequently, he was referred for physiotherapy. The physiotherapy started in October 1996 but did not relieve the plaintiff`s pain. In November and December 1996, he was given lumbar epidural injections. Thereafter he had physiotherapy and, by March 1997, he had improved sufficiently to be declared fit for work.
On 8 April 1997, the plaintiff rejoined Cardigan Bay. He worked on board Cardigan Bay until July 1997 and then joined another vessel belonging to the second defendants. On 24 March 1998, whilst he was on leave from the subsequent vessel he was involved in a road accident. This caused a flare up of his previous symptoms and over the ensuing months he was unable to go back to work and underwent a great deal of medical treatment. On 9 November 1998, the plaintiff was found permanently unable to meet medical fitness standards for the Merchant Marine due to recurrent lower back pain. The plaintiff retired from the Merchant Marine from 1 December 1998.
The plaintiff instituted this action on 15 March 1999. He alleges that his back injury was caused by the negligence of the first defendants and/or of that of the second defendants. As regards the first defendants, he relies on the negligence of their workers in the lifting procedure which resulted in his injury. As for the second defendants, his contention is that they were negligent in failing to devise or operate a safe system of work and thereby exposed him to the foreseeable risk of injury from the carrying operation.
 Issues 
 
 
 
There are both factual and legal issues to be decided. The factual findings I have to make relate to what actually happened on 27 May 1996 and whether, and if so, how, these events led to an injury to the plaintiff`s back. The legal issues arise more in relation to the second defendants and revolve around the question of whether they were in breach of their duty to provide the plaintiff with a safe system of work.
The starting point is the fact that the vessel was placed in dry-dock for the purpose of mast modification works to be effected by Sembawang and their sub-contractors, the first defendants. Among the jobs sub-contracted to the first defendants was job No 1841 which required them to mark and remove all the electrical fittings and cables on the main mast so as to facilitate the renewal of the main mast. On completion of the mast renewal, the first defendants were to re-locate all the electrical fittings and cables on the mast. The plaintiff was not shown this work order but he was aware of the first defendants` role. To quote his own affidavit: `the first defendants and their servants or agents were off-shore contractors appointed to make various modifications that had to be effected on the main mast involving the removal of all aerials, lighting and equipment (including radars) and the re-siting and fitting of the same onto the new mast`.
As for the plaintiff`s own role, in his affidavit he stated that he had been instructed to oversee the main mast modification at dry-dock by Mr Alan Turtle (dry-dock superintendent) and Mr Brian Mullan (electrical superintendent) both employees of the second defendants. There was a lot of important work to do in the dry-dock involving all the electrical equipment on the main mast and Mr Mullan had personally selected him for the dry-dock voyage. In court, the plaintiff added that he had been told that his job was a hands-on job and that he should `get stuck-in`. He also agreed that his role was to ensure that the equipment was not damaged by the first defendants` workers during the operations.
 Did the second defendants instruct the plaintiff to lift the equipment? 
The first factual issue that arises is whether the plaintiff was instructed by the second defendants to participate in the lifting of the equipment. The plaintiff`s affidavit did not make such a direct allegation. There he said that the master of the vessel, Captain Lax, and himself, had agreed that the antenna must be placed in the wheelhouse so that it would not be damaged by general dry-dock activities. He said that the overall distance that the antenna had to be moved was approximately 20 feet and that it had to be lifted over the sill and through the wheelhouse door. While the antenna itself was not particularly heavy, the attached motor/turning mechanism was considerably heavier and the shape and length of the equipment made it difficult to manoeuvre. He then went on to state that three workers of the first defendants had assisted him in the lifts and to describe the procedure adopted in the lifts. The affidavit did not mention of exactly how he had come to participate in the lifting exercise.
The plaintiff amplified this evidence considerably during cross-examination. He asserted in court that the issue of placing the antenna in the wheelhouse had been raised by him again with the master and had been discussed three times in all: the first time when the decision to put it in the wheelhouse was made and the next two times on 27 May itself, both before and after the antenna was brought down from the mast. He was asked when the agreement referred to in his affidavit on the placing of the antenna had first been made. His reply was that Captain Lax had spoken to him shortly after the vessel arrived in dry-dock, maybe around 17 May, to say that the antenna should be stowed in the wheelhouse.
The plaintiff went on to say that this instruction to stow the equipment in the wheelhouse had been repeated to him on the morning of the lift by Captain Lax. He had spoken to the captain on the bridge wing at the time when the strops were being attached to the antenna in order to bring it down onto the deck. At that point he asked the master whether the antenna could go ashore to be stored in a warehouse. The answer was no. Then, once the antenna had been placed on the bridge wing, he had gone to look for the captain to discuss its stowage. When he found the captain in the wheelhouse five minutes later, the captain said that the first defendants` workers would give him a hand to move the equipment into the wheelhouse, thus implying that the master had already spoken to the workers whilst the plaintiff had been looking for him.
The master`s evidence was different. He was not sure whether he had informed the plaintiff in the first place that the equipment was to be installed in the wheelhouse. He said that this instruction would have been given to the plaintiff either by himself or by Mr Turtle or by the chief engineer, Mr McLean. He was, however, certain that he did not speak with the plaintiff again on this issue on 27 May 1996 or that on that day the plaintiff had made any suggestion to him to have the equipment brought ashore or sent to Kelvin Hughes, the manufacturer, for an overhaul.
Both the defendants submitted that the plaintiff`s evidence on the two conversations with the master on 27 May including the instruction to participate in the lift should not be believed. They pointed out that neither of these alleged conversations had been mentioned in the statement of claim, his affidavit of evidence in chief or in the opening statement even though he had been thinking of taking legal action against the second defendants from as early as the end of 1996 when his memory of what had happened would have been much fresher and his recollections could have been noted down for later use. Further, before he went into the witness-box, the plaintiff`s case was that as the second officer (radio), it was part of his duty to ensure that the equipment was not damaged by dry-dock activities and, as it was put in his opening statement, at all material times he was directed by his employer to ensure that their expensive equipment was safe and undamaged by dry-dock activities. In view of what the plaintiff was suing for, it was significant that there was no mention of the alleged direct instruction that he should carry the antenna into the wheelhouse with the assistance of the first defendants` workers. Neither did he in his correspondence with the second defendants before starting the action, mention that he had been injured because he had complied with the master`s instructions to carry the equipment.
I had difficulty believing the plaintiff on this aspect of his evidence. Quite apart from the fact that his responses could have sprung from his realisation that I found factual deficiencies in the formulation of his case (as I pointed out to his counsel during her presentation of the plaintiff`s opening statement), the plaintiff`s account of what had happened on 27 May and why he had found it necessary to speak to the master twice that day on the movement of the antenna was not coherent or probable.
The plaintiff was not able to explain why he needed to speak with Captain Lax twice that morning on the storage of the equipment in the wheelhouse when such instruction had already been given to him around 17 May 1996. The plaintiff had agreed that once the captain had made a decision it was not open to him to question that decision. As a good officer (a description both he and the second defendants would agree applied to the plaintiff) it was improbable that he should thereafter have continued to press the point about taking the equipment ashore. He was not able to offer any satisfactory explanation, either, as to why he needed to seek Captain Lax`s instruction for the third time after the equipment was brought down onto the bridge wing. The plaintiff`s explanation for this third conversation was that he was not re-opening the issue of the storage area but simply seeking the captain`s direction on how the antenna was to be moved into the allotted room. This was an improbable explanation. The plaintiff clearly knew that it was the job of the first defendants to dismantle the equipment and move it from the main mast onto the bridge wing. Yet he claimed that he had no understanding at all as to who was to move the equipment from the bridge wing into the wheelhouse. As Mr Khong for the first defendants pointed out, if the plaintiff had had any doubts on this issue, he would have asked Captain Lax about it on 17 May or, at the latest, when he allegedly had the second conversation on the bridge wing whilst waiting for the dockside crane to lower the antenna from the mast. Thus even if I accept the second conversation took place, the third was completely unnecessary and cannot have happened.
It also seemed to me unlikely that the master, knowing that contractors had been employed by the second defendants for the specific purpose of doing the modification works, would have told the plaintiff, a specialist officer, to assist the contractors` workers in such a manual operation. As Captain Lax testified, the plaintiff was not expected to lift the equipment by himself as it was too large. Neither would he be expected to lift it with assistance. In the context of the works and the existing contractual situation it was the contractors only who would be expected to do the lifting as the shifting of the antenna was an integral part of their job specification. The fact that the master did not specifically tell the plaintiff not to do the lifting himself is irrelevant. I agree with the submission that the plaintiff had invented this third conversation with Captain Lax in order to support his case that he had participated in the lift on the master`s instructions.
I therefore find that no direct instructions were given to the plaintiff by the second defendants to physically participate in the lift. His job, as he was well aware, was to oversee the work of the first defendants` workers in order to ensure that the equipment was not damaged. This might have involved him in giving directions or assistance from time to time (as he did when he provided the workers with a guideline to be attached to the antenna for the lowering from the mast) or in stopping them from doing anything that he could anticipate might lead to damage to the equipment but it would not have required him to take an active part in moving the equipment from place to place.
 Did the plaintiff participate in the lift? 
There is a direct conflict of evidence between the plaintiff and the first defendants on what happened during the actual movement of the equipment.
The plaintiff`s account was contained in paras 6 to 8 of his affidavit. He said that three workers of the first defendants assisted him to lift the equipment on his signal. He would say `one, two, three, lift` and the operation would commence. However, there was no direct order for the lift to cease. Any one of the party taking part would indicate the strain and the others would lower the equipment back to the deck. Two lifts were done in this manner: the first from the bridge wing to the wheelhouse door and the second was through the wheelhouse door up to the chart table.
The third lift, the one that caused the plaintiff`s injury, was when the equipment was re-positioned slightly so that it caused the least obstruction. According to the plaintiff, at all times he used the correct lifting posture, having the knees bent with his back straight and keeping the load as close to his body as possible. However, on the final lift, two of the first defendants` workers failed to lift or take any of the weight. Upon lowering the equipment back to the deck, the plaintiff felt a severe pain in his lower back. The workers then slapped their friend (who lifted) on his back with big smiles on their faces as though they found something amusing.
In cross-examination, the plaintiff gave a more detailed account of the lifting operation. He said that the antenna was taken into the wheelhouse immediately after he had spoken to the captain on the third occasion. When he left the wheelhouse, he saw Raja and his two workers waiting around the antenna. They were getting ready to lift, taking up their positions and flexing their muscles and the plaintiff came along and took up his position, at one corner of the equipment with his back to the wheelhouse. Next to him was, most probably, Letchu and opposite him at the far end was Mr Lim. The plaintiff then said `We will put it in the wheelhouse, next to the chart table`. He did not give them instructions on the method of lifting as they appeared ready and simply waiting for him. He then said `One, two, three, lift`.
The men lifted the equipment by its four corners. Once lifted, the base of the equipment was about six inches off the ground but the plaintiff was not able to see it because the antenna blocked his view. On the first lift, the equipment was moved about 7 or 8 feet and then lowered to the deck. The plaintiff was halfway through the door at that point and he and the worker on his left-hand side were the first to enter the wheelhouse door.
The third lift was undertaken completely within the wheelhouse and it was a small movement of the equipment so that the pedestal was closer to the electrical cabinet. For this third lift, the four men were still position at the respective ends of the antenna. As far as the plaintiff could recall, Lim, the old balding Chinese man was at the other end and Letchu (whom he described as not being Chinese but possibly Malaysian) was next to him. The plaintiff identified Lim as being the only worker who had lifted with him on the third lift. He was asked whether the two workers who failed to lift were Raja and Letchu and his reply was that as far as he remembered the other two were Letchu and Raja but he could not recall whether Ah Tai, another Chinese man employed by the first defendants, was one of the two workers who failed to lift on the third lift.
During the third lift, the equipment was moved approximately 6 inches to the right of the plaintiff. The plaintiff said that, this time, it appeared to him by the increased load that the person on his left and one of the workers at the other end had failed to take some of the load or all of the load. He was not able to see whether these persons had not lifted at all or whether they had tried to lift but had not taken the load. After the equipment was lowered, the person on the plaintiff`s left walked along the length of the antenna and he and other worker slapped Lim on the back. The plaintiff took a moment to catch his breath and then went to speak to Raja. By this time some of the workers who had lifted were at the wheelhouse door putting on their work shoes. Raja informed the plaintiff that the men would return the next day. The plaintiff did not say much as he was in pain and he did not complain to Raja about the two workers having failed to take on any weight. This was because he was embarrassed.
The first defendants` position was that the plaintiff did not participate in any of the three lifts. In his first affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Raja stated that as the foreman of the first defendants, he had full control and supervision of the first defendants` workers and the manner in which the work were carried out. He said that the first defendants used a dockside crane to bring the antenna down from the mast on to the starboard bridge wing. He was then instructed by one of the ship`s staff to move the antenna into the wheelhouse. This was done by his workers and himself without the assistance of the plaintiff. There was no reason for the plaintiff to assist since the four of them were then able to move the radar antenna themselves over the short distance of 15 metres. Neither he nor his workers requested the plaintiff to help them with the move.
At para 11 of his first affidavit, Raja stated that the first defendants were not aware of the existence of the plaintiff until the writ of summons for this action was served on them. In a subsequent affidavit however, Raja corrected that statement. He said that he was in court on the first day of the trial when the plaintiff took the stand. Having had sight of the plaintiff, he recalled that the plaintiff was on board the vessel when she was dry-docked and when he and his workers were on board carrying out the works.
On the stand, Raja gave more details on how the lifting operation was undertaken. He said that he was the one who gave directions for the lifting operation. He described the positions of the four men as follows: two of his workers were holding on to the centre near the turning mechanism, the heaviest place. The other worker and Raja himself were facing the first two at the opposite side of the centre. All of them were holding on to the metal bracket that was bolted on to the scanner of the antenna.
Raja testified that he and his workers did not have a system for lifting but that they had practised lifting together. When they were tired they would put down the object. No one would give an order to start lifting. In this case there were three lifts. During the first lift the antenna was brought close to the wheelhouse door. It was put down because it could not go through the door. Part of the scanner was in the wheelhouse and the mechanism was resting on the sill. Two of the workers then went into the wheelhouse and picked up the antenna from there. Then they all lifted it into the wheelhouse and put it down. Then they lifted it up again and put it in front of the chart table and slowly two of the men adjusted one side of the antenna and then the two at the other end adjusted their end. When the adjustments were done the men were no longer standing at the middle of the antenna but were standing at the two opposite ends.
During cross-examination, Raja was told that it had been suggested in court that two persons at each end could lift the antenna at either end. His response was that to his knowledge, this could not be done. It was not possible because the scanner was made of fibreglass, a very light material, and the heavy motor mechanism was located in the centre of the scanner. The antenna could not be lifted by its ends and had to be lifted at the point where the weight was located, otherwise the wings of the scanner might crack.
 The first two lifts 
When assessing which of the two conflicting versions is the true one, the first point to be decided is how many workers of the first defendants were available to do the job that morning. It is not disputed that generally in relation to the works the plaintiff worked on a daily basis with four workers from the first defendants. These were the foreman (whom the plaintiff identified as Raja), Lim (whom the plaintiff described as an older, balding Chinese man), Letchu (whom the plaintiff thought was possibly Malay but definitely not Chinese) and Ah Tai (whom the plaintiff knew to be Chinese and a welder).
Raja`s evidence is that all four members of the team were available for the shifting operation. At the beginning, Letchu and Lim were on the mast, undoing the nuts and bolts, while Ah Tai and Raja were at the starboard bridge wing waiting for the radar to come down. Raja was directing the operation and Ah Tai was welding some brackets at the side of the bridge wing. The plaintiff recalled the situation slightly differently. He remembered that Raja and Lim were on the mast to remove the nuts and bolts. At that time he himself was standing on the scaffolding. He also thought there was another worker on the mast, possibly Letchu. He was then asked whether he was aware at the time that the first defendants were carrying out some welding work on the bridge wing. His immediate reply was `Yes. That would have been Ah Tai`. This confirmed Raja`s evidence about Ah Tai`s location although immediately thereafter the plaintiff tried to water down the admission: 
 
 
Q: At the point of time when the antenna was brought down from the main mast, the first defendants` foreman and three workers were on the vessel. 
 
A: I was aware that Raja and Lim and possibly one more were up the mast. With regards to the welding, don`t know if the welding was going on that particular day. In dry-dock there was welding going on around the clock. So with regard to Ah Tai welding, couldn`t say for certain if he was welding at that time.
  
 
 
It would be noted, however, even then the plaintiff was not willing to categorically deny Ah Tai`s presence on the bridge wing.
It was also interesting to note the lengths to which the plaintiff went to explain why he had to take part in the lifting operation rather than get anyone else to replace the missing worker from the first defendants` team. The plaintiff was asked whether he had determined that four people were able to perform the lift. His reply was that he thought that four people were the minimum for the lift and that was the only number that was available to him at the time. He agreed that he would have been able to see the chief engineer or any deck officer to requisition help from other crew members but said that in this case there was no time to do that because he had the impression that the captain wanted the radar moved straightaway as it was then lunch time and the first defendants` workers wanted to go for lunch. When it was put that the move could have been effected after lunch, his reply was that it could not because the first defendants were not coming back after lunch and some of the Filipino crew members were working only half a day, thereby reducing the ship`s staff considerably. When he was asked how many people were left on board, however, his answer was that he did not know. None of this evidence, which would have been material to explain why the plaintiff was doing what on the face of it did not appear to be his task, appeared in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. It was also not put by his counsel to Mr Raja that his workers had wanted to rush off for lunch and would not be back that afternoon. Nor was it put to Captain Lax that there was no one else available from the crew to help in the lift because some crew members were on half a day.
Quite apart from my doubt as to the necessity for the plaintiff`s participation to enable the carrying operation, I find it difficult to accept his description of what had happened during the first two lifts. The plaintiff`s account that the four men including him were positioned at the four corners of the radar seems unlikely. The width of the antenna at each end was one foot and it would be difficult if not impossible for two persons to stand next to each other at either end in order to carry the antenna in the wheelhouse. Moreover, the weight was in the middle, and lifting it up from the ends would have been harder to do than lifting it up from the centre and would also have exposed the antenna to the risk of cracking at the ends. Further, there was a two and half inch sill that had to be traversed at the doorway and if the men had been located at either end they would not have been able to see the base of the antenna which would have made traversing the sill harder.
The plaintiff was asked how two persons could stand next to each other and lift the antenna up by the foot-long end. His answer was that they would have to be on each corner and that in his description of where people had been lifting, he was trying to get across to the court that the people at the ends were looking down the length of the radar and that each person lifting had one hand under the end of the radar and the other along the length. It was put to him that if that was correct, there would be a twist to the back and that could not be the correct lifting procedure since the back would have to be straight in any lifting operation. His answer was that the back would be straight with the hands in that position. He was then asked questions about manoeuvring through the doorway which was, as he recalled, only about 30 inches wide. He disagreed that to get such awkward equipment through such a narrow a doorway one person had to be free to direct the manoeuvre through the doorway and into the wheelhouse. The plaintiff asserted that in the lifting manner that he had described with a man on the corner, with just a short twist of his head he would be able to see where he was going and even the two inch sill would be easily seen by the two people in front with a slight twist of their heads. He denied that there was a fifth person who directed the movement into the wheelhouse and that that fifth person was himself. Instead he said that he helped direct the operation from the right corner of the radar closer to the door. I did not find the plaintiff`s account credible.
The plaintiff`s description of how the operation was performed did not gel with the physical attributes of the equipment, principally its length, narrow ends and substantial weight in the middle or with the narrow passageway which had to be traversed. It is impossible for two persons standing shoulder to shoulder to move together through a 30 inch doorway. This may, however, be done by four persons standing sideways. The account given by Raja of how the equipment was taken from the bridge wing into the wheelhouse was much more plausible bearing in mind the physical characteristics of the equipment and the nature of the area traversed particularly in relation to his description of how it was moved through the doorway and how his workers put it down on the sill and then went into the wheelhouse and picked it up from the portion that was inside the wheelhouse in order to complete the move.
I do not believe that the plaintiff participated in the first two lifts. He did not need to do so since with Raja`s participation the first defendants had sufficient men on site to accomplish the carrying operation without the plaintiff`s assistance. Raja testified that he and his men were practised in carrying radars. No doubt was cast on this testimony by the plaintiff. Indeed he asserted that Raja had told him of this on the morning of the lift itself. Since Raja knew what to do in moving the equipment and since he had sufficient men on hand for the job, there was no reason for him either to ask the plaintiff to be involved or to accept any offer of assistance from the plaintiff.
It is also noteworthy that Raja testified that one of the ship`s officers had directed the movement into the wheelhouse although he did not identify this person as being the plaintiff. It appears to me that such directions would have been required due to the presence of the sill, the small and crowded area of the wheelhouse (other items had already been placed inside it for storage during the works) and the awkward dimensions of the antenna itself. The logical person to undertake the directing would have been the plaintiff who had the responsibility of ensuring that the workers did not damage the equipment and who had already assisted slightly in the lowering operation. I consider that in all probability the plaintiff`s participation in the first 2 lifts consisted of giving directions to the lifting team. The plaintiff`s own evidence did support Raja`s recollection of an officer-director since he did assert that he had directed the lifting operation, only he said he had done so from his position on a corner of the antenna wing rather than from inside the wheelhouse.
 The third lift 
To an extent, whether the plaintiff actually participated in the first two lifts is irrelevant since his allegation was that he was injured on the third lift. Even if he had only participated in this last movement, if it had caused his injury, he might have a case against either or both defendants depending on how the injury was sustained. The defendants deny he participated in the third lift or that his back problems had anything to do with the movement of the radar.
There is not such a glaring contrast between the plaintiff`s description of how the third lift was conducted and that given by Raja. There were, however, some significant differences. Although both men said that for the third movement the four persons involved were located at the ends of the equipment, two to each end, the plaintiff`s description was of an intended simultaneous lift by all four to move the pedestal of the antenna closer to the electrical cabinet. Raja, on the other hand, said that each pair of men adjusted their end of the antenna separately and thus at any one time only two of them were lifting the antenna. The object of this exercise was to put it closer to the chart table so that it would not be an obstruction.
Who is to be believed? On the one hand, the plaintiff was very clear that he first experienced pain after being involved in adjusting the position of the radar within the wheelhouse. This part of his story is supported by almost contemporaneous evidence. There is a documentary record that starts with the plaintiff`s visit to the Sembawang doctor on 1 June 1996. He told that doctor that he had been involved in carrying heavy objects one week before his visit. Then on his visit to his general practitioner in August 1996, the history recorded was that two months previously the plaintiff had lifted a heavy weight while working in dry-dock and had sustained a lumbar sprain and since then had had intermittent twinges of pain in his right thigh. Next, in a letter dated 10 October 1996 to the fleet personnel manager of the second defendants informing the latter of his current medical condition, the plaintiff mentioned that whilst he was on board the Cardigan Bay during her time in dry-dock, his back went into spasm and pains were felt in his right leg after a heavy lift. Two weeks later, in a letter dated 24 October 1996 an orthopaedic surgeon who examined the plaintiff mentioned being told that the plaintiff had had back pain since May 1996.
These documents show that from the beginning of June 1996, the plaintiff was consistent in his account of what had led to his back pain. They are the strongest factor in favour of accepting the plaintiff`s version of events. On the other hand, the plaintiff`s account of how he was injured is somewhat unclear and his own behaviour after the alleged injury was not consistent with any perception on his part that he had been injured by someone else`s negligence or deliberate non-performance of duty.
The plaintiff was closely questioned about his affidavit statement that on the final lift, two of the workers failed to lift or take any of the weight. He was asked to confirm that these two non performing workers were Raja and Letchu. The plaintiff`s reply was that as far as he could remember they were Raja and Letchu but that he could not recall whether Ah Tai was one of the workers who failed to lift. It should be noted here that the plaintiff was clear that Raja was standing opposite him with Lim, who was the only other worker to lift when the plaintiff did. Logically that meant that the person standing next to the plaintiff had to be either Letchu or Ah Tai. The plaintiff was therefore asked why he could not remember whether there were two Chinese persons lifting the equipment with him since the incident left a lasting impression on him. His reply was a feeble `I remember there were three others lifting and to me it doesn`t matter if they were Chinese or another nationality`. He also conceded that he was not 100% certain that the third worker was Letchu. This was an odd lapse of memory since this third person was his immediate neighbour. He should have been able to distinguish whether his neighbour was Chinese or not especially since he was quite clear that Letchu was not Chinese.
Whilst the plaintiff was able to remember that Lim was purportedly an older balding Chinese man and also to describe in some detail the clothing worn by Raja, Lim and Letchu on the day of the lift, he was not able to say for certain who was standing beside him when the third lift was made. The plaintiff`s evasiveness in this respect could have been because he was unsure whom amongst the four of the first defendants` workers who had lifted the equipment, he had to eliminate to replace himself as one of the lifting party in the wheelhouse.
The plaintiff was then pressed to try and recall whether the two workers concerned had failed to lift the equipment at all or whether they had lifted but not taken all the weight. His answer was that it appeared to him that by the increased load that the person on his left and one of the workers at the end other had failed to take some of the load or all of the load. It was put that this was an impression and that he did not know for a fact what had happened. Then he was asked whether when he had made his statement in his affidavit `Two of the workers failed to lift` it had meant that after he and Lim had moved upwards in a controlled manner the other two workers remained in their original positions. His answer was they did. He was then asked whether he was saying that they did not even lift at all. His reply was that he could not tell what they had done or not done from simply looking at them because it had taken place in a fraction of second and it was only a small lift, maybe just an inch. So really the plaintiff was unable to say what had been done or omitted and this inability weakens his case.
The plaintiff`s actions after the lift were not those of a man who had been injured by his co-workers` carelessness or non-co-operation. From what he said in court, Raja was most probably one of those at fault. Yet, after catching his breath when the plaintiff went up to speak to Raja he made no mention to Raja of what had happened. Neither did he confront any of the other workers as to why they did not lift or take any weight thus causing him to suffer a severe pain. His explanation for this was that he was embarrassed about feeling the pain. Yet there was nothing to be embarrassed about if the pain had been inflicted because the workers had been deliberately slack in the lifting exercise. He was asked whether he felt angry or upset with these two workers for causing him this severe pain. The plaintiff`s reply was an evasive `I do now`. When he was pressed as to what he had felt at the time, his answer was `I didn`t know what damage was done to my back. I was glad the radar was finally in position`. If those were his feelings at that time ie relief, he was either not injured or did not feel that he had any cause for complaint in relation to the co-workers` behaviour.
The other point that was peculiar was that the plaintiff mentioned that after the lift and whilst he was catching his breath `some of the workers who had lifted were at the wheelhouse door putting on their work shoes`. He was then asked whether he spoke to Raja as the other two workers were putting on their shoes. In his reply he again said `some of the workers`. When asked why `some`, his answer was that he did not remember how many but he thought it strange that one or two of them had removed their boots to go into the wheelhouse. The word `some` definitely implies more than one person and although the plaintiff had the opportunity to agree that `some` in this context meant two, he refused to take it and repeated that word. He then tried to say that it meant one or two. It seems to me more likely that when he said `some` initially, he had meant two or three and when he realised the implications of this, he tried resile from them by recounting his observation that it was strange that one or two workers had removed their boots.
In addition to failing to take issue with Raja over the bad behaviour of himself and his men, the plaintiff also did not think fit to raise the matter with anyone else either formally or informally. The second defendants had a system for filing of formal accident reports throughout their fleet. Accidents were required to be reported to the vessel`s safety officer. The plaintiff was aware of this procedure and used it subsequently in 1997. The plaintiff did not, however, make any accident report in respect of the incident that took place on 26 May 1996. Not only did he not report it on the day itself when perhaps he might not have taken the matter seriously since he said then that he thought his injury was only a pulled muscle, but he did not report it on the next day when he woke up in what he described as being the most excruciating pain and must have realised that he had suffered a more serious injury than he initially thought. At no time did he mention to the master or any of his shipmates what had been done to him or what had caused his pain. Whilst he might not have wanted to damage his working relationship with Raja by making a complaint over what initially seemed to be a small matter, such considerations would not have inhibited his telling the ship`s crew what had happened had he really felt aggrieved. Neither would they have prevented him from telling his various doctors exactly how the injury had been sustained. Yet none of the medical reports has a word on the matter.
The plaintiff did not appear to me to be a timid or retiring person or to be lacking in gumption. According to his own evidence, he had queried the master`s decision and wisdom in placing the radar antenna in the wheelhouse on at least two further occasions in spite of having been told the very first time by the master that it was to be so placed. He also showed in court that he was capable of looking after his own interests by directing cross-examining counsel on how to phrase his questions. Yet, at no time in May or June 1996 did he complain to anyone about how the first defendants` workers had behaved. Even when he was thinking of taking action for his injury towards the end of the year he did not make any statement about his injury having been caused by negligence of these workers. The first defendants were given no warning of the plaintiff`s position until the writ was issued in March 1999. In my view, the lack of complaint on the part of the plaintiff for nearly three years must be regarded as significant.
The medical evidence was also interesting. It showed that the plaintiff`s injury even if sustained because of his participation in the lift may have occurred even if all the other workers had carried out the lift properly. The second defendants` expert witness, Professor Templeton, stated that he believed that the plaintiff did have significant degenerative change affecting his lower back prior to his accident in May 1996 and that that accident exacerbated that condition and caused it to be painful. He did, however, also testify that if four persons had carried such equipment and all four had adopted the correct lifting posture and lifted the equipment at the same time there was no likelihood of any of the four suffering a back injury unless they had a pre-disposition towards such an injury. Professor Templeton observed that even without a lifting incident, any other lifting activity or acute movement of the back could have precipitated pain in the plaintiff`s back. This evidence was supported by the plaintiff`s expert, Dr Krishnamoorthy, who said that the back is a very fragile region and the prolapse of a disc can also be caused by activities like bending forward to brush your teeth though if you have to lift something the risk of injury is higher.
Undoubtedly, from May 1996 the plaintiff had a problem with his back. The weight of the evidence does not, however, in my opinion, indicate that this problem resulted from any negligence or default on the part of the first defendants` workers. My primary finding is that the plaintiff did not participate in the third lift with them in the way he said he did. Bearing in mind the documentary record, his account of having sustained injury while involved in a lift might reflect his having tried to help them make the slight adjustment of the position of the radar within the wheelhouse and thereby injuring himself. This was an operation in two phases, involving an adjustment at either end, and the plaintiff may have helped move one of the ends in the way Raja described. It was not, however, a concerted lift as described by the plaintiff. In any event even if the plaintiff did participate in the movement, either as the fourth or even a fifth man, it is unlikely that the first defendants` workers defaulted or were neglectful in carrying out the lift in relation to him. It is more probable that his injury was caused by the strain that he unfortunately placed on a back which already had a predisposition towards such an injury.
 Conclusion on first defendants 
 
 
 
The factual findings which I have made are sufficient to absolve the first defendants from any liability to the plaintiff for his injury. They did not breach any duty of care which they had towards him even if he was involved in the antenna shifting operation. The case against them must therefore be dismissed.
 Legal issues involving second defendants 
 
 
 
The position is, however, somewhat different with regard to the second defendants. On the basis that the plaintiff probably lifted the antenna to adjust its position when it was in the wheelhouse and that this led to his injury, the issue is whether legally the second defendants are responsible for that injury. As his employers, they were under a duty of care towards the plaintiff to take reasonable care for his safety in the course of his employment. As pointed out in 
 Employer`s Liability at Common Law 
 (11th Ed) by John Munkman, this duty extends in particular to the safety of the place of work, the plant and machinery and the method and conduct of work though it is not restricted to these matters (see p 125). In this particular case, the plaintiff`s allegation is that the second defendants failed to provide or were negligent in relation to the provision of a proper method and conduct of work. Again, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff.
Various particulars of negligence were pleaded. Most of these were premised on the assertion that it was the plaintiff`s task to manually carry the equipment into the wheelhouse. For example, the plaintiff alleged his employers were negligent in causing or permitting him to carry the equipment, in failing to avoid the need for him to undertake the manual handling of the equipment, in failing to make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the manual handling operation to be undertaken by the plaintiff or to take any appropriate steps to reduce the risk of injury arising out of the lifting operation and failing to give him any adequate instructions in the method of lifting and carrying of the equipment.
I have found that the plaintiff was not specifically ordered to participate in the lifting operation. His instructions were to oversee the move and ensure no damage was caused to the equipment. The persons who were to undertake the move were the first defendants. Thus, many of the particulars pleaded are no longer applicable. The plaintiff recognised this possibility as the case developed and in the closing submissions presented, much more emphasis was laid on the aspect of the second defendants` alleged failure to provide the plaintiff and the first defendants with adequate information about the peculiar characteristics of the equipment and their failure to ensure that there were sufficient workers to handle the operation.
On these submissions, the following questions arise: 
(a) were the second defendants entitled to instruct the plaintiff to oversee the first defendants` work without being more specific on his duties? 
(b) did they have a duty to devise a safe system of work for the performance of the manual lift by the first defendants? 
(c) was the plaintiff acting in the course of his employment when he chose to participate in the manual work contracted to and undertaken by the first defendants?
 Sufficiency of instructions 
Turning to the first question, it was not contended by the plaintiff that the instruction he received from the master to oversee the shifting operation was an unauthorised one outside the scope of his legal duties. His submission was that there was no evidence before the court that he was specifically instructed to supervise only. This submission flew in the face of the master`s statement that in his job as a supervisor, the plaintiff had no reason to lift the equipment. The plaintiff also sought to show that his job had a broader description than the second defendants were willing to admit by pointing out that he was not informed that the lifting of the equipment would be done by the first defendants` workers only or told about the unusual characteristics of the equipment or told that there should be a minimum of four workers to carry out the moving of the equipment. The plaintiff`s basic complaint therefore was that he was simply told to supervise without being given any parameters for this job. In essence, the contention is that the second defendants did not provide a safe system of work because they did not tell the plaintiff precisely what he should and should not do.
As pointed out in 
Winter v Cardiff Rural District Council
 
[1950] 1 All ER 819
 by Lord Oaksey (at p 822), there is a sphere in which the employer must exercise his discretion and there are other spheres in which foremen and workmen must exercise theirs. The point here is whether when it came to supervising the lifting operation, it was for the plaintiff to exercise his discretion or for the second defendants to exercise theirs and lay down a system for the execution of the work. Whilst the employer has the primary obligation of organising work, when an isolated task is involved, whether the obligation of organisation falls on the employer or the employee whom he has designated to do the task depends on whether the operation is so complicated or unusual as to necessitate special organisation outside the scope of that employee`s expertise.
Looking at the facts of this case, at the time of the incident, the plaintiff had had 16 years experience as a radio officer during which he had worked with radar equipment. The plaintiff had qualified in the United Kingdom and, as the master testified, must have been aware of the `Code of Safe Working Practices` which that country enforces for seamen. Five or six copies of that Code were kept on board the Cardigan Bay as vessel had been registered in the United Kingdom up to April 1996. The Code prescribes various matters to be taken account of by both seamen and their employers in relation to manual lifting exercises. The master testified that the plaintiff as an employee of 15 years would have understood the Code and been aware of its contents in his job of supervising the lift. I see no reason not to accept the master`s evidence on this point.
Prior to the vessel docking at the Sembawang dry-dock, the plaintiff had had experience of dry-dock repairs though not in connection with the removal of the radar or the modification of the main mast. Whilst the vessel was in dry-dock and before 27 May, he with the assistance of two crew members, also dismantled and moved a smaller radar which had been attached to the main mast. He also must have had knowledge about the subject antenna. It was clearly visible from the ship`s mast. Plans and details of the equipment were kept on board and were available to the plaintiff. He knew that a shore crane was to be employed to lower it onto the deck from the mast and therefore must have realised that it was a really heavy piece of equipment. He therefore had access to all the information he required about the equipment prior to starting his supervision of the removal operation.
The plaintiff knew that the removal of the antenna had been contracted out to the first defendants and that they were responsible for all phases of the operation. According to his evidence, however, it was he who determined that four persons were sufficient to undertake the movement of the antenna into the wheelhouse and he himself gave the signals and directed the three lifts that took place.
An employer is only required to take reasonable care and to guide against foreseeable risk to his employee. The master did not consider that there was any risk posed to the plaintiff in supervising the operation. He did not foresee that the plaintiff would get himself involved in a physical operation which had been contracted out to independent third party contractors. The plaintiff was an experienced officer and was not shy about his accomplishments and abilities during the trial. He was more than qualified for the role of supervisor of the removal and storage operation (he showed his knowledge of what needed to be done by supplying the guide rope and giving directions and determining how many people were required for the carrying operation). The submissions made on his behalf when condensed to their essence, are that he should have been given extremely detailed instructions on what to do running, by analogy, the gamut of the alphabet from A to Z. I find it impossible to accept those submissions in the light of the facts here. The plaintiff cannot now say that the second defendants were remiss in having assigned the role and manner of supervision to him. The cases of 
Jenner v Allen West & Co Ltd
 
[1959] 2 All ER 115
 and 
Byers v Head Wrightson & Co Ltd
 
[1961] 2 All ER 538
 cited by the plaintiff are not applicable to the facts of this case because the employees involved there had neither experience nor expertise to assist them unlike the plaintiff.
The plaintiff suggested that he needed to be given general safety instructions by the second defendants and quoted Lord Oaksey`s words in 
General Cleaning Contractors v Christmas
 
[1953] AC 180
 to the effect that the employer has a duty to give such general safety instructions as a reasonably careful employer who has considered the problem presented by the nature of the work would give his workmen. He also relied on a local authority, 
 Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 579
 to illustrate the same point. Those situations were somewhat different. In the first case, the injured workman was employed as a window cleaner to work outside high self-locking windows. It was obviously a dangerous situation but he was given no safety instructions or appropriate safety apparatus. In Parno`s case, the workman was injured while trying to repair a loose pin during a piling operation. He was inexperienced but vested with responsibility for minor repairs and confronted with what he thought was an emergency situation. Here, the plaintiff was well equipped to deal with the task of supervising the movement of the antenna and was also aware of safe working procedures including the correct manual lifting procedure. Neither was he put into a situation where he had to make a quick decision without proper consultation with the master or other officers.
The plaintiff cited 
Williams v BALM (NZ) Ltd
 
[1951] NZLR 893
 where it was held that `it is the duty of an employer reasonably to anticipate that the men provided for a job will consider it expected of them to carry on as best they can with the number provided, and that, if a man gets into difficulties, he will make an effort to get out of them himself before he calls on others who have other work to do`. In that case, the employers themselves had designated four workers to move a piece of equipment which on a previous occasion had required five or more persons to move it. It was not the situation here that the plaintiff had no choice but to make do with the number of workers who were available. If there was in fact a shortage of one person to undertake the lift, then the plaintiff could either have directed the first defendants to get an additional worker to help them or alternatively reported the matter to the master or chief engineer. He was neither placed in a dilemma or in a situation of emergency where he had to participate in the physical lift. He was not a casual worker but an officer overseeing the first defendants` manual work and had every right and authority to set out the number of workers required from the first defendants.
 System of work for first defendants 
I have held above that the second defendants were not in breach of duty in simply telling the plaintiff to supervise and not specifying the exact manner in which he should carry out that duty. Since he was supervising the first defendants` work, should they have devised a system of work for the performance by the first defendants of their contracted job? I agree with the submissions made by the second defendants that it was not their role to do this. That role belonged to the first defendants or to their employers Sembawang. These parties had the responsible of planning the operation and ensuring that a safe system of work was in place for the movement of the antenna.
The plaintiff cited various cases including 
McDermid v Nash Dredging & Reclamation Co Ltd
 
[1987] AC 906
, 
Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English
 
[1938] AC 57
 and the 
 Cardiff Rural District Council 
 case, in support of the well known proposition that an employer cannot escape liability for injury to his employees by delegating the responsibility of devising a safe system of work on an independent contractor. That principle has, however, no application to the facts of this case. The plaintiff was designated the task of supervising the first defendants, he was well equipped to do so, he devised the system of work and he in fact executed it by giving directions/signals. The plaintiff was not subjected to danger from a system devised by the first defendants.
 Course of employment 
The final question arises from a plea by the second defendants that they have no responsibility for the injury sustained by the plaintiff because in participating in the lift instead of just overseeing it the plaintiff was acting outside the course of his employment. In this connection, it is worth reproducing some of 
 Munkman 
`s observations on the limits of the employer`s duty. Between pp 103 to 105 of his text, he states: 
 
It is evident that the employer`s duty does not extend to every moment of the workman`s life, and equally evident that it cannot be restricted to the period when the workman is inside the factory or other place of work, since his duties may take him outside ...
 
 
 
The duty is not confined to the actual performance of work, but also applies when the servant is doing something reasonably incidental to work, as where the plaintiff had gone to wash a tea-cup when she slipped on an oily duck-board and injured herself: 
Davidson v Handley Page Ltd
 
[1945] 1 All ER 235
 ...
 
 
 
Difficult questions may arise where a man strays to a part of a factory or ship where his duties do not require him to be, and there encounters some danger. If, however, the workman is doing his employer`s work, he does not cease to be acting in the course of his employment by the fact that he is working at a place where he is forbidden to go, even by statutory orders ... Likewise disobedience to orders does not necessarily mean that the workman has moved out of the course of the employment, even when he arrogates himself duties which he is not employed to perform and is forbidden by statute to perform: 
National Coal Board v England
 
[1954] AC 403
[1954] 1 All ER 546
 (miner coupled with cables, which should be done by shotfirer personally). All these cases have the common feature that the plaintiff, however foolishly or misguidedly, was doing the employer`s work. Probably the reason why the court has taken a broader view of the course of employment in this connection is that the fault of the plaintiff can always be taken into account to reduce the damages.
 
 
 
The second defendants rely on two cases to support their contention that when the plaintiff became involved in the manual lift which was to be undertaken by the first defendants` workers as opposed remaining a supervisor, he was no longer acting in the course of his employment. In 
Forsyth v Manchester Corp
 
[1912] 107 LT 600
, it was held that a gas inspector, whose duty was to inspect and report on the gas meter had no business trying to repair the meter, and that his participatory acts in relation thereto which resulted in an injury to the plaintiff were outside the course of his employment. The facts of that case are, however, far removed from those of the present since the person injured was not the workman himself but a small child who picked up a knife which the inspector had negligently left lying about while he was looking for some other tools. Also the inspector had gone into the house in the first place as a favour and not in the course of his usual duties. I do not think that that case assists the second defendants.
Lowe v Pearson
 
[1899] 1 QB 261
 is a more relevant authority. There, the respondent, whose job was to make balls of clay and to hand them to the woman working at the machine, had hurt his hand while trying to clear the machine. He was held to be acting outside the course of his employment. The respondent had been expressly warned and well knew that he must not meddle with the machinery and the court made much of the fact that he had deliberately and knowingly engaged himself in work which he was not engaged to do, but on the contrary had been forbidden to do and which there was no necessity for his doing.
In my view, 
 Lowe 
`s case is distinguishable in that the respondent there had a very defined job scope which he exceeded. Here the plaintiff was simply instructed to oversee an operation and it was left to his discretion as to how he did it. Although supervising generally involves giving directions only, it is not unknown for supervisors to lend a hand to the persons being supervised if in the course of the work the supervisor thinks it would be practical and convenient and helpful to do so. In such a situation, I do not think that one can categorise the act of assistance of the supervisor as being outside the course of his employment even though the persons he is assisting are the employees of independent contractors. But whilst a supervisor may lend a hand he is not obliged to do so and if he is directing the work of third parties there would be even less pressure on him to get physically involved. The point is, however, that even if the plaintiff was acting within the course of his employment in assisting the workers, that in itself does not make the employer liable.
In this case, the plaintiff`s participation in the lift was purely a matter of his personal choice. It could not be said that his decision to do so and the consequent injury he sustained resulted in any way from any negligence on the part of the second defendants. The task assigned to the plaintiff was that of supervision of the movement of the antenna only. As an experienced officer, he was capable of performing the task. He had in fact, according to him, devised and operated the system of lift. Only the plaintiff was aware of his peculiar back history. According to the plaintiff, he determined that four persons including himself could perform the lift. He did not ask the first defendants to get an additional worker nor seek guidance from the master or assistance from the crew. He chose to be involved in the physical lift. It was unfortunate that this choice resulted in his back injury but liability does not automatically flow from injury except under statute.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
The plaintiff has not been able to prove his allegations of negligence and breach of duty on the part of the second defendants either. Accordingly, this case is dismissed with costs as against both defendants.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellant was charged with and convicted of the crime of murder in causing the death of one Tan Eng Yan @ Tan Ah Leng @ Lily (`the deceased`). He was sentenced to suffer death. The offence was committed on 26 August 1998, sometime between 1pm and 2.30pm at the deceased`s flat at Block 467, Tampines Street 44, [num ]08-140.
We heard the appeal on 24 January 2000 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
 Evidence led by the prosecution 
 
 
 
The deceased and the appellants were friends prior to the killing. They had known each other for some three years. There was no known animosity between them. The deceased worked as a fruit-stall assistant at the market situated at Block 475 Tampines Street 43. Her work for the day would normally end at about 1pm. In the afternoons, she worked as a part-time hairdresser. The appellant was a fishmonger at a neighbouring stall in the same market.
On 26 August 1998, at or about 3.15pm, the deceased`s daughter, one Chen Hui Min, on returning home from school noticed a trail of blood leading to her flat. The iron gate to the flat was wide open, with the padlock hanging from its metal chain. She opened the wooden door and entered the flat. She found the living room in a mess and there were blood stains all over the place. In the toilet adjacent to the kitchen, she saw her mother`s lifeless body lying in a prone position, with her face submerged in a pail of water. The pail was placed under a tap which was still running. She called the police.
Sgt Chua Chee San arrived at the flat some minutes later, at about 3.21pm. Sgt Chua noticed that the deceased had sustained multiple injuries on her head, back and neck. Both her wrists had also been severely injured, with the bones exposed. He also saw that there were bloodstains on the toilet wall and the floor of the flat. A bloodstained chopper lay in the kitchen sink. He further observed that there was a trail of blood which ran from the flat to a parking lot numbered `34` behind Block 469.
The deceased`s husband, one Tan Cheng Guan, upon checking the flat later that evening discovered that a sum of S$6,600 was missing. This amount consisted of S$2,200 in notes and the balance in coins in denominations of 10 cent, 20 cent, 50 cent and S$1.
Dr Wee Keng Poh, a forensic pathologist from the Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine who carried out an autopsy on the deceased, noted that she had sustained a total of 58 injuries. The injuries consisted of fatal slash wounds, multiple cuts, bruises, fractures and a ligature mark around her neck. He certified the cause of death to be acute exsanguination or haemorrhage due to multiple slash wounds. Four of the injuries were identified by Dr Wee to be fatal and each of them were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The four fatal injuries were: 
(i) injury No 4, a deep slash wound on the left posterior lateral lower neck, measuring 10 cm by 0.8 cm; 
(ii) injury No 16, a deep slash wound on the right anterior lateral upper neck, measuring 11 cm by 2.5 cm; 
(iii) injury No 44, comprising a set of multiple deep cuts on the back of the deceased`s left wrist, causing near total amputation of the wrist, leaving only a strand of skin on the front of the left wrist; and 
(iv) injury No 49, comprising a set of multiple slash wounds on the right posteromedial hand and lower third forearm, also causing near total amputation of the right wrist.
In the opinion of Dr Wee, these fatal injuries were all intentionally inflicted and were not caused accidentally. Injury Nos 44 and 49 were caused by multiple blows of moderate to severe force, severely fracturing the underlying bones. These injuries were sustained while the deceased was on the ground trying to ward off those blows. The severity of the blows could be seen from the fact that those blows nearly amputated both her hands. All the injuries the deceased sustained were consistent with having been caused by a knife or a chopper.
The police took blood samples from the flat for examination. Dr Chuah Siew Yeam from the Department of Scientific Services, Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine, who conducted the examination told the court that certain blood samples taken from the flat matched the DNA profile of the appellant. Some blood samples, however, were not his. Nothing turned on that as it was not his defence that he did not kill the deceased.
The appellant was arrested on 31 August 1998. He was referred to the Alexandra Hospital and was examined by one Dr Desmond Choo, who noted, amongst others, that there were lacerations to his right big toe, right hand and foot, right index and middle fingers and a laceration between the index and middle fingers of his right hand. In Dr Choo`s opinion, the wounds were likely to have bled when they were fresh.
On the day of his arrest, the appellant led a party of police officers to his motor pick-up bearing registration plate number GH 5364S which was then parked on the third level of the multi-storey car park at Block 96 Havelock Road. The pick-up was rented from one Chua Siong Huat, who ran a business of hiring motor lorries, pick-ups and vans. Six plastic bags of coins hidden behind the driver`s seat of the pick-up and another plastic bag of coins placed under the air-condition unit of the vehicle were recovered by the police.
On 23 October 1998 at about 11.25am, three police officers recovered two transparent plastic bags of coins from Chua Siong Huat`s flat at Block 286B Toh Guan Road [num ]21-32. The coins in these two plastic bags were payment made by the appellant to Chua on 28 August 1998, being the rental of S$400 for the pick-up.
There was evidence that the deceased was a friendly person and mixed well with others. But she was also fond of showing off by taking out stacks of notes from her pouch and boasting that she had a substantial amount of money in her house. The appellant had heard the deceased saying all these things. There was also clear evidence from several other hawkers that as at the date of the incident, the appellant owed them various sums of money. There was also evidence to suggest that the appellant was in debt because he had lost money in horse-racing.
The account concerning the circumstances surrounding the killing of the deceased was provided by the appellant in six written statements given by him to the police. The first was made to D/SSgt Cher Kwong Chan shortly before his arrest on 31 August 1998 (exh P168). The second was a cautioned statement given on 1 September 1998, under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (`CPC`), to Insp Lim Song Chai of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) (exh P170). Thereafter, on four different occasions between 4 and 10 September 1998 the appellant gave four more statements under s 121 of the CPC (exhs P171 to P174). At the trial, the appellant did not challenge the admissibility of any of the statements given by him. The statements were thus admitted in evidence.
As what were set out in the statements were vital to the charge, as well as the defences raised by the appellant, it is necessary for us to set out the relevant parts of his statements in extenso. They are as follows: 
 
Exhibit P168
 
 
 
Blk 467 Tampines on the 8th floor corner house. This male Chinese is known to me for almost a year and I used to address him as `Ah Meng`. I believe `Ah Meng` is a Malaysian.
 
 
 
Initially, I used a flower vase which was placed at the hall to hit deceased`s head and thereafter I used a chopper taken by me from deceased`s kitchen to attack her. Ah Meng also joined in the attack until she collapsed in the kitchen. Ah Meng pulled her head and forced it into a red-coloured plastic pail and left the tap water running over the deceased`s head.Immediately, both of us went in search for money at the flat. I managed to locate four plastic containers of coins at the store-room. Ah Meng also found some cash at the kitchen.
 
 
 
We fled the scene separately. Ah Meng escaped by the lift and as for me, I fled by going down staircase to the car park nearby. I also held the two containers of coins in my hands. I would like to clarify that two of the containers are metal tins. We escaped by using my pick-up No GH5364S which was earlier parked at Blk 469 Tampines carpark.
 
 
 
Exhibit P170 - cautioned statement
 
 
 
I had no intention of murdering her. I went there with `Ah Meng` to find out the whereabouts of the tontine head. She told me that the address was written on a piece of paper which was at home and invited me to follow her to her house. She did not know `Ah Meng`. We took the lift to the 11th floor and walked to her flat at the 8th floor. She opened the door and we entered the house. `Ah Meng` was following us from a distance away. Once the door was opened, `Ah Meng` dashed into the house and close the door. Lily asked me who `Ah Meng` was? I told her that `Ah Meng` is my friend and asked her not to ask further. She became unhappy. She asked me whether we came to rob her and I denied. I told her to give me `Ah Poh` address. She told me that someone had given her the address on a piece of paper. I saw her started looking for it. Later, she told me that she could not find. I then told her that she was lying. She told me to leave the house or else she would scream for help. `Ah Meng` then placed his arm around her neck and they both fell down. The deceased grabbed a flower vase and I quickly grabbed it from her and placed it on the floor. I was afraid that she might break the vase or she might use it to hit me. Lily ran to the kitchen and `Ah Meng` followed. They struggled at the kitchen. I saw `Ah Meng` used a chopper to slash her. `Ah Meng` did not bring the chopper along. He got it from the kitchen from the washing basin. I presumed he got it from there. I told `Ah Meng` that he cannot slash her. `Ah Meng` told me that he had no choice and asked me to help him. Lily started screaming when they started struggling. After being slashed, Lily fell to the floor. `Ah Meng` used his hand to cover Lily`s mouth or neck. `Ah Meng` asked me to help him. I used the flower vase to hit Lily. Lily caught hold of my hand. I saw the chopper on the floor. I grabbed it and chopped her hand. I became daze and dare not look at her. I told `Ah Meng` not to kill her. `Ah Meng` said that if she survive, I will die. I saw `Ah Meng` pulled her to the bathroom. I had some blood stain on my arm and I washed it at the basin. I do not know what `Ah Meng` was doing with Lily in the bathroom. I knew that he turned on the water tap. I hurried `Ah Meng` to leave the house. `Ah Meng` asked me to look for some money. `Ah Meng` told me to go to the room to search. I just went into the room and opened the drawer and I did not search and take anything. I went to the storeroom. The door of the storeroom was ajar. I saw four tins of coins. `Ah Meng` asked me to take the coins. I went to the kitchen to get the paper bags and put all the coins in the paper bags. We only took the coins without the tins. I again walked to the kitchen and saw a wad of dollar notes and `Ah Meng` took them. I hurried him to leave. We carried the coins and left the place. I walked down the staircase and `Ah Meng` took the lift.
 
 
 
Exhibit P171
 
 
 
 
3 At about 1.15pm, I parked my motor pick-up at the car park behind block 469 Tampines Street 44 ... When I alighted from my pick-up, I saw Lily was walking at the void deck of block 467 Tampines Street 44 and I shouted for her. I walked across and met her at the lift lobby. She asked me why I was late and she told me that she was about to leave ... She asked me how much I was going to pay her. I told her that I was going to pay her three hundred dollars. I then asked her for `Ah Poh`s address and she said that she had left it in her flat. She told me to follow her if I wanted `Ah Poh`s address. 
 
4 ... She invited me to go into the house. I took off my sandals and entered the house. Lily closed the wooden door. She offered me drink and I accepted. ... I hurried her to give me `Ah Poh`s address. Lily told me that she was also in a hurry to go off for a hair cut appointment. I saw Lily searching the bedrooms, the storeroom, kitchen and the hall for Ah Poh`s address. The last place she searched was among few books placed on the telephone table. Lily told me that she could not find Ah Poh`s address. Lily then started searching the black-coloured bag, which she had earlier placed on the floor near to the kitchen entrance. She told me that it was written on a small piece of paper and she do not know where she placed it. I was angry and she told me to leave as she had to go to work. I told her not to keep on lying to me. I scolded her with vulgar words. She scolded me that I was mad. I told her that I am getting mad and I will beat her up. She again told me to leave her house I refused and told her to give me Ah Poh`s address. At that time, we were standing facing each other. I pushed her with both hands and she fell. I also fell as the floor was slippery. We struggled on the floor. While we were struggling, Lily told me to talk things over. I told her that she kept lying and did not give Ah Poh`s address to me. I also accused her of conspiring with Ah Poh to cheat me. She denied and asked me to give her sometime to look for Ah Poh`s address. We stopped struggle and stood up. Lily threatened to call the police if I did not leave her house. I became very angry and told her that she need not call for the police and might as well we die together. We were standing near to the kitchen entrance. Suddenly, I saw her lifting a flower vase with both hands. I thought she might use it to hit me. I quickly grabbed over the flower vase and placed it on the floor. The vase toppled but did not break. 
 
5 I tried to block the blow and the cup dropped and breaks [sic]. At that juncture, I become confused and I lost my head. I noticed that there were two to three knives on top of the washing basin. I took a chopper and swung it at her many times. I stopped when Lily collapsed. I put down the chopper on the floor. I was very nervous and my hands were shivering. I then realised that Lily`s neck was bleeding profusely. She was screaming but I could not make out what she was saying. I set my mind to put her to death and I also wanted to die together with her. I also do not know what I was doing. I was squatting beside her. Suddenly, she grabbed my hand. I took the chopper, which was near me and chopped her hands repeatedly as if I was chopping fishes. Shortly, I realised that Lily was motionless and quiet. I was very frightened. My face, hands and legs were stained with blood. I also realised that my right toe was cut. I went to the toilet and turned on the tap to wash up ... 
 
6 After washing up, I saw Lily lying motionless facing downward outside the toilet entrance. I pulled her into the toilet with my both hands. I lifted her head and placed it into the red-coloured plastic basin, which was full of water from the tap. I then decided to leave the house. I went to the doorsteps and put on my sandals. When I was about to leave, I decided to look for any valuables in the house. I returned to the house with my sandals on. 
 
7 I then walked into the bedroom and searched the cupboard drawer hoping that I could find Ah Poh`s address. I left the bedroom after I failed to find Ah Poh`s address. I then realised that the storeroom door was ajar. I checked the storeroom for Ah Poh`s address, but could not find. I saw some coins in tins and plastic containers at the corner of the storeroom. I carried the two tins out from the store room. When I tried to carry the plastic container, I felt that it was very soft and decided not to carry them. There were total two tins and two or three plastic containers. I went to the kitchen and took two plastic bags. I placed the two tins of coins inside the plastic bag. I placed two plastic bags together as the two tins were very heavy. I took another two plastic bags from the kitchen. I went into the storeroom and poured all the coins from the plastic containers into the plastic bags. I also used two plastic bags as it was very heavy. I then decided to leave the house. After second thought, I found that it was very difficult to carry. I went to the kitchen and took two red-coloured pails. I placed the two bags of coins into the pails. I went to the kitchen basin to wash my hand. When I was leaving the kitchen, I noticed some papers on top of the cabinets near to the entrance. I searched for Ah Poh`s address. I saw some dollar notes wrapped in a transparent plastic bag. I took it and kept in my trouser pocket.
  
 
 
Exhibit P172
 
 
 
 
21 I now remember that after I managed to block off the cup, which Lily threw at me, I was very angry and I took the flower vase near to the kitchen entrance and rushed towards her. Lily was standing in front of the washing basin with her back facing the kitchen window. If I am not wrong, I hold the rim of the flower vase with my right hand and the base with my left hand., I lifted the flower vase up and hit it on Lily`s head and the vase broke. Lily fell backwards and she was still holding a cup. She tried to hit me with the cup she was holding. I tried to grab the cup from her. Finally, the cup fell but I do not know whether the cup broke or not. Lily was shouting. I took a piece of cloth from the floor to cover her mouth to prevent her from shouting. I then realised that there were pieces of porcelain from the vase scattered around. I used the cloth to sweep them away. Few pieces of broken porcelain were swept into the toilet. It was at that juncture, I saw the chopper in the container on the washing basin. I took the chopper and started to slash her at her neck to prevent her from shouting further. Suddenly, Lily grabbed hold of my hand and I started to chop her hands as if I was mad. I wanted to kill myself at that time. Finally, Lily became motionless and I stopped. I knew that Lily was dead. 
 
... 
 
28 The Saturday before the incident, when I was leaving the market, Lily told me that somebody had given her Ah Poh`s address. As I was in a hurry for horse betting, I did not ask further. The next day, I asked her and she told me that she would give me the address later as she was busy. 
 
29 On Tuesday, I met Lily at the stall and asked for Ah Poh`s address and she told me that she had left it in her flat and asked me to go to her flat to collect it. After I closed my stall I had forgotten about the matter and left with `Allan`. 
 
30 The next day (Wednesday) at about 11am, I again asked her for Ah Poh`s address and also told her that I wanted to pay her some money. She told me to meet her at the void deck of her flat between 1.15pm and 1.30pm. 
 
31 I was angry when Lily did not give me Ah Poh`s address. At that time, I felt she had conspired with Ah Poh to cheat me. I started to quarrel with her resulted into a fight and caused her death.

... She ... started to search for Ah Poh`s address among a bundle of documents on top of the cabinet ... She then searched the storeroom. I saw some coins in containers when she opened the storeroom door. At that juncture, the phone rang and she answered the phone in Malay. The conversation was short and Lily told me that she was in a hurry to go off. Lily told me to leave. I refused to leave and told her that unless she give me Ah Poh`s address. We started to quarrel and I was very angry. Lily threatened that if I did not leave, she would call the police. I became angry and scolded her vulgar words. Suddenly, I saw Lily took a flower vase and I grabbed it. I placed the flower vase on the floor but it toppled. However, it did not break. Lily ran to the kitchen and I followed. She grabbed a cup from the cabinet and threw it at me. The cup dropped onto the floor. I fought with her in front of the washing machine. Lily fell onto the floor with her head pointing at the window and her legs pointing at the entrance. I quickly ran to the hall and grabbed the flower vase. I used the flower vase and hit Lily`s head. Lily tried to catch hold of me. I noticed that there were few knives in the holder on top of the basin. I took a chopper and started to slash Lily`s neck. Lily still tried to catch hold of me. I was very angry and chopped her hand. I chopped her both hands. She was motionless. I wanted to go to the toilet to wash my legs. There were many pieces of broken porcelain. I used a piece of cloth to sweep them into the toilet. I then washed my legs and hands in the toilet. There was a red-coloured basin underneath the tap. I turned on the tap and used the water in the basin to wash up. I dragged Lily into the toilet either by pulling her hair or her cloth. I lifted her head and placed it into the red-coloured basin with her face facing down. The tap was still running. I walked out of the toilet and noticed that my right toes was bleeding. I went to the bedrooms to search for Ah Poh`s address. I failed to get Ah Poh`s address. I decided to leave. I went to the doorstep and put on my sandals. I was not satisfied and walked back to the kitchen with my sandals on to look for Ah Poh`s address. I cannot find anything but I took a wad of dollar notes from the kitchen cabinet. I walked to the storeroom and took the coins which I had described in my statement. I then left the house with two pails of coins. I closed the wooden door.
 
 
 
I wish to add that after I placed Lily`s head into the basin in the toilet, I came out and picked up the chopper from the floor and placed it in the washing basin. I washed my hands at the washing basin. That is all.
 
 
 
It should be noted from the statements of the appellant that the whereabouts of one `Ah Poh` played a significant part in the occurrence on that fateful afternoon. Ah Poh`s real name is Phai Sai Poh and she was called by the prosecution to testify. She admitted having started a tontine group in August 1996 comprising some 17 members. The appellant was one of them. She discontinued the group on 1 January 1998 as she was in financial difficulties and was unable to pay out money owed to members who had successfully bid. Because of that she went into hiding at the end of May 1998 and did not tell anyone of her new address. She said she owed the appellant only $4,000.
 Defence 
 
 
 
The appellant did not, at the close of the prosecution`s case, make a submission of no case to answer. He gave evidence in his own defence and did not deny having inflicted those injuries on the deceased. His defence was two-fold. First, he inflicted those injuries under grave and sudden provocation from the deceased. Second, that the deceased`s death arose out of a sudden fight between the parties.
The appellant said that he and the deceased were friends. He had borrowed money from her as well as from others due to his gambling losses. He joined Ah Poh`s tontine group some three years back. He had paid Ah Poh in respect of the tontine a total of about $10,000. She had only repaid him $1,000 after repeated requests. Thereafter, he could not locate her. Five days before the date of the incident, the deceased told him that she had Ah Poh`s address. However, in the next few days for various reasons, he did not manage to meet up with the deceased to get the address from her. It was on 26 August 1998 that he finally met the deceased at the void deck below her flat. The deceased told him that she could not find Ah Poh`s address and invited him to go up to her flat to help search for it if he did not believe her.
After some searching at her flat, she still could not find the address. So she told him in a normal tone `... 
 well, couldn`t find, you can`t find Ah Poh you have lost some money, forget about it. 
` The appellant got angry when the deceased again told him to forget about it. He accused her of being in collusion with Ah Poh to cheat him. It was at this point that the deceased started using abusive and vulgar language on the appellant. 
 
Go home and fuck your mother. You are a man. How come you are cheated by a woman? You are a man being cheated by a woman. Are you a man?
 
 
 
The appellant became extremely angry and told the deceased that no one had ever used such abusive language on his mother. He, in turn, used abusive words on the deceased, whereupon the deceased asked him to leave the flat, failing which she would call the police. He then gave her a push and they both fell down. There was a struggle and blows were exchanged. The deceased grabbed a flower vase from the living room. She wanted to strike the appellant with the vase but he grabbed it from her and put it on the floor outside the kitchen. She ran into the kitchen. She then threw a porcelain cup at the appellant but it missed hitting his head. The appellant took the flower vase from the floor and told her: `
 You want to play? 
` to which she retorted: `
 Don`t come near 
. 
 I have a knife here 
. 
 I will kill you 
.` He then told her that they could both die together. Another cup fell on the floor in the appellant`s direction. He rushed at the deceased and hit her on the head with the vase. He saw her stretching out her right hand and thought that she was going to grab a knife on top of the flat surface next to the kitchen sink. In his mind, it was either his life or her life. But he managed to grab hold of the knife first and started slashing her on the neck. The deceased shouted that she would kill him. She then grabbed hold of a piece of the broken vase and tried to `jab` the appellant with it whereupon he slashed at her hands until she became motionless. He said he was frightened. He then washed his bloody hands. His right thumb and toe were bleeding. He proceeded to immerse the deceased`s face in a pail of water and placed the knife which he had used to slash her into the kitchen sink.
Thereafter, the appellant made an unsuccessful attempt to search for Ah Poh`s address in the flat. Instead he found some currency notes in an envelope and coins of various denominations in containers. He took the currency notes and placed the containers of coins into plastic bags which he took from the kitchen. Upon realising that the coins were too heavy for the plastic bags, he transferred the coins into two plastic pails and took them away with him. He drove off in his pick-up.
It should be noted that the significant difference between what the appellant said to the court in his testimony and what he stated in the various statements made to the Police was the absence in the statements of the abuse and/or threats uttered by the deceased. He explained that this was not mentioned in his statements because he was not questioned about the oral exchanges between them. Neither did he mention in his statements that the deceased had tried to reach for a knife next to the kitchen sink.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The learned trial judge, Amarjeet Singh JC, rejected both the defences raised by the appellant. He disbelieved the appellant`s testimony that the deceased had used abusive or threatening words on him. Furthermore, his allegation that the deceased had reached out for a knife or chopper on top of the kitchen sink and had `jabbed` at him with a piece of broken porcelain were also disregarded by the trial judge as the appellant had failed to mention any of these matters in his six statements to the Police. As these allegations were only raised for the first time at the trial, the trial judge drew the `irresistible inference` that these allegations were afterthoughts, contrived by the appellant for the very purpose of advancing his defence. With these being rejected what remained, even as alleged by the appellant, were clearly insufficient to constitute grave and sudden provocation. In fact, he held that the appellant caused much of the provocation. The appellant was told to leave the flat but did not. He insisted on remaining in the flat against the owner`s wishes. He had also pushed the deceased first, causing her to fall. Her acts of raising the vase and throwing the two cups at the appellant were thus merely retaliatory of the appellant`s own show of violence. The trial judge could not accept Dr Wee`s evidence that the appellant`s acts were those of a person who had lost his self-control and was in a frenzy, as he felt that the pathologist`s opinion `did not condescend on the totality of the evidence adduced in court.`
In any case, the learned trial judge held that even if the abusive and vulgar words were indeed uttered by the deceased, the insults were not so grave as to cause the appellant to lose his self-control to the extent of so viciously and fatally injuring the deceased.
As regards the defence of sudden fight, the trial judge found that there was no evidence of any fight between the appellant and the deceased of such nature or intensity for the appellant to fear for his life. What the evidence showed was a savage attack by the appellant upon the deceased. The appellant had taken undue advantage and had acted in a most cruel manner. Accordingly, the defence of sudden fight was rejected.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Before us, counsel for the appellant pursued only the defence of grave and sudden provocation. The argument advanced was that the learned trial judge placed too much emphasis on the fact that the appellant did not mention about the utterance of the provocative words by the deceased in his statements. Counsel argued that the appellant, being a fishmonger of low intellect, failed to mention the said words because he did not understand the importance of doing so.
 Provocation 
 
 
 
Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) provides that culpable homicide is not murder `if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation ...` The `Explanation` to that Exception provides that `whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.`
How Exception I should be interpreted and applied was recently considered by this court in 
PP v Kwan Cin Cheng
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 345
  where it held (at p 355): 
 
As the law has developed, there are two distinct requirements for the provocation defence to apply: first, a `subjective` requirement that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation; and secondly, an `objective` requirement that the provocation should have been `grave and sudden`. The latter requirement involves the application of the `reasonable man` test accepted in 
Vijayan v PP
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 8
  at p 12; [1975-1977] SLR 100 at p 107 and cited in 
Ithinin bin Kamari v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 245
  at p 250:
 
 
 
 
`In our judgment, under our law, where an accused person charged with murder relies on provocation and claims the benefit of Exception 1 of s 300, the test to be applied is would the act or acts alleged to constitute provocation have deprived a reasonable man of his self-control and induced him to do the act which caused the death of the deceased and in applying this test it is relevant to look at and compare the act of provocation with the act of retaliation.
  
 
 
However, the fact that the second requirement is to be determined objectively does not mean that any characteristics of the accused, including mental infirmities, could not be taken into account if they affected the gravity of the provocation. But individual peculiarities which merely affected the accused`s power of self-control but not the gravity of the provocation should not be taken into account: see 
DPP v Camplin
 
[1978] 2 All ER 168
 at 175 per Lord Diplock and 
Luc Thiet Thuan v R
 
[1997] AC 131
[1996] 3 WLR 45
.
In 
 Kwan Cin Cheng 
, it was held that in determining if the objective requirement was satisfied, the emotional state of mind of the accused at the material time could properly be taken into account as it would affect the gravity of the provocation from the deceased. The purpose of this objective test is really to deny the defence to persons who overreact simply because they are `exceptionally pugnacious, bad-tempered and over-sensitive.`
Some earlier authorities also appear to speak of a separate or distinct requirement of proportionality, over and above the two requirements relating to the defence discussed above. This proportionality test suggests that the retaliation taken must be commensurate with the provocation offered which caused the accused to lose his self-control: 
N Govindasamy v PP
 
 SLR 165 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 49
 ; 
Wo Yok Ling v PP
 
 SLR 78 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 101
  and 
Koh Swee Beng v PP
 
 
[1991] SLR 319
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 401
 . In the light of the discussion in 
 Kwan Cin Cheng, 
 the test of proportionality is probably not a distinct requirement for raising the defence of provocation. It is a factor to be taken into account in determining whether the objective test of gravity and suddenness is fulfilled. Therefore, the fact that the retaliatory acts may have been out of proportion to the provocation offered does not necessarily mean that the defence must fail. This is because where the provocation defence in Exception 1 to s 300 is raised, the accused`s acts of retaliation would ex hypothesi always have been of an extreme degree, resulting in the death of another person. An inquiry into `proportionality` does little to answer the essential question of whether an ordinary person would, upon receiving the provocation in question, have reacted in the same way the accused did.
 Was the appellant deprived of his self-control 
 
 
 
We now turn to determine whether the appellant had, in fact, been deprived of the power of self-control. It is necessary to look at the objective facts. Mere assertion would not suffice. In exh P172, the appellant said that he started to slash at the deceased`s neck in order to silence her and to prevent her from shouting further. This would indicate he knew what he was doing. In exh P171, he categorically said that he set his mind to put the deceased to death. These words show that the appellant had a clear purpose in mind when he attacked a vulnerable part of the deceased`s body, ie her neck. In court, he testified that as the altercation continued, it became a question of either one of them dying. When the deceased attempted to grab him with her hands in order to defend herself, the appellant aimed specifically at her hands and chopped at them repeatedly. As soon as the deceased became motionless, the appellant, despite claiming that he was frightened, nevertheless had the presence of mind to sweep the broken pieces of porcelain into the toilet to protect himself from being cut. Furthermore, instead of running away in panic after the attack, the appellant took his time to wash his hands, placed the chopper back into the sink and went round the flat looking for Ah Poh`s address. He did not find the address but found some money (in notes and in coins) of several thousand dollars, which he took with him. The way he went about taking away the coins showed that he was very conscious at all times of what he was doing. Taking all the foregoing aspects into account, they do not represent the actions of someone who did not appreciate what he was doing. What is just as significant is that, after the incident, he remembered and made it a point to keep his appointments with Lee Hoo Guan (PW13) and Goh Seow Ek (PW15), which were a little later that day. These two persons were the creditors of the appellant. There was no irrational behaviour on his part.
As regards Dr Wee`s opinion that the deceased`s injuries were likely to have been caused by a person who had lost his sense of self-control and was in a frenzy, we agreed with the trial judge that it was obviously a view based purely on the numerous injuries inflicted by the appellant on the deceased. The court was entitled to test and reject it in the light of the objective facts, if that view was not consistent with those facts. In this instance, for the reasons dealt with in the last paragraph, the trial judge was amply justified not to accept that opinion.
On this ground alone, the appellant would have failed in this appeal, as he had not shown that he had met the first requirement necessary to establish the defence of grave and sudden provocation.
 Was the provocation grave and sudden? 
 
 
 
We next turn to consider the second requirement. The alleged provocation lay in his assertion in court that the deceased had abused and insulted his mother and himself with vulgar words. Furthermore, the deceased had attempted to reach out for certain knives which were placed on top of the kitchen sink and had threatened to use them to kill him. But these allegations were, however, not mentioned in any of the six statements which the appellant gave to the police.
Before he gave the cautioned statement (P170), he was, as required under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code, informed that: 
 
If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general.
 
 
 
It is not the appellant`s case that the above warning was not read out or explained to him at the time he gave his s 122(6) statement. In fact, Insp Lim Song Chai who recorded the statement specifically stated at the start of the statement that both the charge and the notice of warning were read out, explained and interpreted to the appellant in the Teochew dialect. The appellant did not challenge that.
In relation to the four statements given by the appellant subsequent to the cautioned statement, s 123(1) of the CPC is pertinent and it reads: 
 
Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for an offence evidence is given that the accused, on being charged with the offence or officially informed that he might be prosecuted for it, 
 failed to mention any such fact, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention when so charged or informed, as the case may be, the court, in determining whether to commit the accused for trial or whether there is a case to answer, and the court, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper
, and the failure may, on the basis of those inferences be treated as, or as capable of amounting to corroboration of any evidence given against the accused in relation to which the failure is material. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant, being a fishmonger of low intellect, could have failed to mention the crucial allegations in his statements because he did not understand the importance of doing so at the relevant time. In our view, this argument was plainly unsustainable. We did not see how this argument could be valid as the caution administered was simple enough. In our view the following observation of the trial judges in 
PP v Tan Boon Tat
 
[1990] SLR 375
 at 388
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 466
  at 474, which was approved on appeal (
[1992] 2 SLR 1
), was on point: 
 
... the warning is couched in very simple language which is easily comprehensible by those who read English. We do not see what else there is and how else one ought to explain the warning; it is certainly unsafe to simplify it or, on the other hand, to elaborate or amplify it; any such attempt may convey a wrong meaning or implication to the accused. It follows 
 that if an accused does not read and speak English, and the charge and the notice of warning are both accurately interpreted to him in a language which he understands, it would, in our opinion, amount to an explanation to him of the charge and the warning; he would have understood from the interpreter the substance of the charge and the implication of the warning.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
There was another reason why we thought the claim that the appellant was of low intellect could not stand. In his first two statements he had the presence of mind to think of `Ah Meng` to bear responsibility for the crime, which person he later admitted did not exist. He tried to explain that it was the way in which the police questioned him that made him think of `Ah Meng`. This was never put to the police officers when they testified. So he was not of such low intellect after all. He was clever enough to think of a fictitious person to bear the brunt of the blame for the killing. And with that kind of a mind, how could he have missed out those alleged abuses or threats uttered by the deceased, or the actions of the deceased in trying to reach out for the knives, if those things did in fact occur?
What inference should ultimately be drawn under s 122(6) and 123(1) of the CPC against an accused for an omission is really a matter of judgment for the trial judge, who would no doubt consider it in the light of the nature of the omitted fact(s) in relation to the charge the accused faced. Another pertinent factor would be whether any challenge has been raised by the accused concerning the adequacy of the explanation given to him. There could also be other factors. But in so far as the present case was concerned, it was not alleged that the explanation given was inadequate. Having heard the appellant`s evidence, the trial judge was certainly entitled, in the circumstances here, to draw an adverse inference against the appellant. There was simply no basis for this appellate court to interfere with that determination.
Therefore, what remained to found provocation were just these: that the deceased had failed to give the appellant Ah Poh`s address; that she told him to leave the house and threatened to call the police if he did not; that, on his refusal, she had lifted a vase intending to throw at him; that on being pursued to the kitchen she threw one or two porcelain cups at him. In the words of the trial judge: 
 
I found that the accused in fact caused much of the provocation. He had no special relationship with the deceased. He was told to leave the flat. He did not. He was told that she would call the police. He still did not leave the flat. She was entitled to ask him to leave the flat and call for the police or eject him from it as it was her home. The accused was wanting to remain there against her wishes. He had also in pushing her and causing her to fall used physical violence on her first. Her raising the porcelain vase after that (which he grabbed from her), her throwing of two cups at him were as far as her acts were concerned objectively not grave acts of provocation. She was only responding to the accused`s laying his hands on her.
 
 
 
Looking at all the circumstances objectively, the only thing one could consider the deceased to be at fault was that she could not find the address of Ah Poh after having made a search. By no stretch of the imagination could that have amounted to a grave and sudden provocation. Indeed thereafter, as the learned trial judge rightly pointed out, it was really the appellant who was creating trouble and the deceased was merely reacting. It was clear to us that the appellant had grossly overreacted to the situation before him. Even accepting that the appellant was angry at the deceased for failing to find Ah Poh`s address, a reasonable person in the position of the appellant would not have reacted to the situation in the way the appellant did with such extreme violence. As mentioned before, the defence of grave and sudden provocation is not to protect those who are exceptionally pugnacious, bad-tempered or over-sensitive.
The question may be asked what was the reason or motive for the killing. The prosecution had not expressly suggested any motive and it was not necessary to do so. Its only burden was to show that the appellant intended to inflict the injuries caused, and this burden it had discharged beyond a reasonable doubt. The fact that the appellant might not have gone to the deceased`s flat with the intention of killing her was immaterial. There is no requirement in law that a premeditated design to kill must be established. If the intention to kill is proved to exist, however sudden such an intention was formed, that would amount to murder: see 
Shaiful Edham bin Adam v PP
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 57
 . In this case the appellant did in fact kill the deceased.
 Judgment 
 
 
 
For the reasons given above, we were satisfied that the defence of grave and sudden provocation was clearly not available to the appellant and we, accordingly, dismissed the appeal.

 Introduction 
Both appellants were convicted in the district court of abetment by conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust (`CBT`), contrary to ss 109 and 409 of the Penal Code Cap 224 (`PC`). The offence was committed in relation to certain goods, valued at about US$301,673. The first appellant (`B1`) was sentenced to four years and six months` imprisonment. The second appellant (`B2`) was sentenced to five years and six months` imprisonment. I allowed B1`s appeal against conviction, acquitted him and set his sentence aside. As for B2, I amended the charge against him, substituted the conviction and dismissed his appeal against conviction. I allowed his appeal against sentence, and reduced that sentence to four years` imprisonment. I now give my reasons.
 Background facts 
 
 
 
B1 was the managing director of a Singapore company of freight forwarders called `World Freight Pte Ltd` (`WF`). B2 was the managing director of a company called `Uncle Sam Apparel Pte Ltd` (`US Apparel`). The complainant was a Filipino businessman called Nari Kishanchand Gidwani (`PW13`).
Sometime in 1997, B2 contracted to purchase from PW13 500,000 pieces of Walt Disney apparel (`the goods`) at US$3 per piece. The total price of the goods amounted to US$1.5m. Initially, it was agreed that the transaction would be financed by letters of credit. Accordingly, in October 1997, B2 opened letters of credit worth US$600,000 in part payment for the goods. Between 2 and 6 November 1997, he went to Manila and met up with PW13. During this trip, they agreed to change the mode of financing for the transaction from letters of credit to `documents against payment` terms (`D/P terms`). Pursuant to the new terms of payment, the bills of lading (`b/ls`) relating to the goods were consigned in favour of the Industrial and Commercial Bank Limited (`ICB`), who were B2`s bankers. It was understood between them that under the new terms of payment, B2 would pay ICB for the goods in order to get b/ls that were duly endorsed. These b/ls would then allow B2 to obtain the goods from the consignees.
B2 needed to ship the goods from the Philippines to Singapore, and he contacted B1 around the end of October 1997 for that purpose. B1 and B2 had business dealings with each other since 1996, and B1`s freight forwarding company, WF, had handled many previous shipments for B2. At B1`s recommendation, a company in the Philippines called `Worldwide Consolidated Freight Corp` (`Worldwide`) was subsequently appointed as the freight forwarding agent in the Philippines to handle the shipment. When Worldwide prepared the ocean b/ls for the shipment, it named WF as the consignees in Singapore.
Following this, PW13 shipped a total of six container loads of Walt Disney apparel to Singapore. This was done in three shipments - the first shipment consisted of two containers, the second consisted of one container and the last shipment consisted of three containers. All six containers were consigned to B1`s company, WF, which collected the three shipments from the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) on 7, 10 and 13 November 1997 respectively.
B1 was meant to release the goods only upon presentation of b/ls that were duly endorsed by ICB. However, he released the goods to B2 without receiving those b/ls. According to him, around 7 November 1997, on the arrival of the first two containers, B2 contacted him and said that he needed the goods urgently for his impending public sale at Seaview Hotel. B2 said that it would take some time for ICB to process the necessary documents, and he asked B1 to release the goods to him first. He assured B1 that he would pay for the goods and obtain the b/ls from ICB later on. He also gave B1 a verbal assurance that he would take responsibility in the event that WF faced any problems for releasing the goods without the duly endorsed b/ls.
Subsequently, on 13 November 1997, B1 delivered the first two containers to B2`s sales outlet at Seaview Hotel. On 15 November 1997, he delivered the third container, and on 26 November 1997 he delivered the last three containers.
From 17 to 30 November 1997 and from 5 to 7 December 1997, B2 conducted public sales of Walt Disney and other brands of apparel at his sales outlet at Seaview Hotel. Around 4 December 1997, PW13 (who was in the Philippines) was alerted by his sources in Singapore as to the public sales organised by B2. PW13 then contacted B1 to ascertain the whereabouts of his six containers of Walt Disney goods. By this time, B1 had already delivered all the goods to B2, but he did not inform PW13 of this. Instead, he assured PW13 that the goods were still in his custody.
PW13 was never paid for the goods, and B1 never received the duly endorsed b/ls from B2. Between 13 to 15 December 1997, B1, with B2`s consent, retook custody of some cartons of Walt Disney apparel from B2`s premises. These were stored by B1 at his own expense at two warehouses at Jalan Terusan and Kallang Place. On 24 January 1998, B1 ceased providing agency services to B2.
Evidently, between 4 December 1997 and 27 February 1998, PW13 contacted B1 several times by telephone and fax, instructing B1 repeatedly not to release the goods to B2 unless he received an authentic `bank endorsement` from B2. On each occasion, B1 lied to PW13 and repeatedly assured him that the goods in the six containers had not left WF`s custody and had never been handed over to B2. He also told PW13 that he had been informed by B2 that the bank endorsement was forthcoming.
Finally, in March 1998, B1 called PW13 and confessed that he had actually released the goods to B2 in November 1997 without first obtaining the duly endorsed b/ls. He apologised, and asked for PW13`s forgiveness and explained the circumstances in which he had released the goods. He told PW13 that the goods had been released to B2 long before he received PW13`s call in December 1997. He said that he had previously lied about the whereabouts of the goods because he had hoped that PW13 and B2 would be able to sort things out between them. He said that he had now engaged a law firm Joseph Tan Jude Benny, to commence a civil action against B2, and was in the process of obtaining a Mareva injunction against the latter.
Thereafter, on or about 30 March 1998, PW13 lodged a complaint with Singapore`s Commercial Crime Division (`CCD`), and CCD commenced investigations against B1 and B2.
A survey of the goods stored by B1 at the two warehouses was carried out by Unispec Adjusters & Surveyors (S) Pte Ltd (Unispec) between 14 to 20 May 1998. This survey was jointly arranged by PW13 and B1. B1 paid for the survey. Based on the quantity that had been shipped (as recorded in the shipping documents and invoices), and taking into account two cartons which had been taken away by the police in the course of the investigations, the inspection revealed that 3,327 cartons containing 94,147 pieces of Walt Disney apparel were missing. The value of the missing goods was estimated to be US$301,673.
In September 1998, CCD brought charges against B1 and B2 for abetting each other in a conspiracy to commit CBT. In essence, the charges against B1 and B2 stated that between 11 and 26 November 1997, they had engaged with each other in a conspiracy to commit breach of trust of goods belonging to GG Sportswear Manufacturing Corporation of the Philippines, and that in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing, they had made the necessary arrangements to take possession and to subsequently sell off 3,327 cartons containing 94,147 pieces of Walt Disney apparel valued at US$301,763. They were charged under s 409 of the Penal Code (`PC`), for an aggravated form of CBT, on the basis that the goods had been entrusted to B1 in his capacity as an agent.
 The proceedings below 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The prosecution`s case
 
Based on PW13`s evidence, the prosecution alleged that B2 had concluded a contract with PW13 in June 1997 for the purchase of 500,000 pieces of assorted Walt Disney apparel at US$3 per piece, and that he had conducted a full inspection of the goods in Manila between 2 and 6 November 1997. Those goods were then shipped by PW13 to Singapore, and were entrusted to B1 in his capacity as the shipping agent in Singapore. B2 was supposed to pay ICB for the value of the goods, in return for b/ls that were duly endorsed by ICB. He could then obtain possession of the goods in the custody of B1. However, the prosecution alleged that B2 and his company were in financial problems at that time, and B2 had no funds to pay for the goods. The prosecution called PW14, the Vice-President of ICB, who testified that B2 and US Apparel were facing a shortage of funds at the relevant time, and had exceeded their credit lines. The prosecution`s case was that B2, not having paid for the goods, conspired with B1 to commit CBT of the goods, and pursuant to that conspiracy, B1 delivered those goods to him. From 17 to 30 November 1997 and from 5 to 7 December 1997, B2 conducted public sales of clothing at his sales outlet at Seaview Hotel. He put up PW13`s goods for sale during those occasions, and sold some 3,327 cartons of the goods, containing 94,147 items of Walt Disney apparel, and pocketed the proceeds of sale. PW1, 2, 3 and 7, who had attended the sales, testified that at least half of the sales space, being about three quarters of the size of a football field, had been devoted to the sale of Walt Disney apparel.
With regard to B1, the prosecution relied on PW13`s evidence to show that B1 had released the goods to B2 with dishonest intent, for the purpose of abetting B2 to commit CBT of the goods. PW13 testified that between December 1997 and February 1998, he corresponded several times with B1 via fax and telephone, repeatedly instructing B1 not to release the goods to B2 unless he received a valid bank endorsement. B1 assured him throughout that time that the goods had never left his custody and would not be released to B2 without the appropriate bank endorsements. In January 1998, PW13 asked for a survey of his goods but B1 did not respond to this request. PW13 also testified that around March 1998, B1 called him and finally admitted hat he had released the goods to B2 in November 1997 without obtaining the duly endorsed b/ls. In the course of the conversation, B1 apologised, and explained the circumstances in which he had released the goods. B1 said that he had relied upon and trusted the word of B2 and had been let down by B2. B1 also tried to explain why he had lied about the whereabouts of the goods to PW13 between December 1997 and February 1998.
The prosecution also called PW4, the Chairman of the Singapore Freight Forwarders Association (`the Association`), to give evidence as to the commercial practice of freight forwarders. By his evidence, the prosecution sought to establish that B1`s release of the goods to B2 without production of the original b/ls was contrary to standard commercial practice, and that there was a conspiracy between B1 and B2 to commit CBT of PW13`s goods. PW4 testified that under the standard terms advocated by the Association, goods could only be released by a freight forwarder against duly endorsed b/ls. The only other alternative, which was not contained in the Association`s standard terms, was to release the goods against a letter of indemnity enjoined by a bank (and not other types of indemnity). PW4 conceded that deviation from the alleged standard practice could not be ruled out, nor could it be controlled by the Association. He also acknowledged that B1`s company, WF, was not a member of the Association and therefore did not operate under the Association`s standard trading conditions.
 B1`s defence 
 
 
 
Before the trial judge, B1`s defence counsel raised a preliminary objection that the charges were flawed, as both B1 and B2 were charged as `abettors` while no one was charged as the principal offender. He submitted that there could not be offences of abetment by conspiracy when no principal offender had been identified as the one whom the defendants had abetted.
Apart from the problem with the charges, B1`s defence was essentially a denial of any conspiracy between himself and B2 to commit CBT of the goods. He conceded that he had knowingly breached the standard commercial practice by releasing the goods without duly endorsed b/ls, and without a letter of indemnity enjoined by a bank. However, he maintained that he had done so because he trusted B2, and had never expected the latter not to pay for the goods. He therefore denied that he had been dishonest when he released those goods. The defence counsel for B1 also pointed out that the other requirements for establishing the aggravated form of CBT under s 409 of the PC, namely, the elements of `entrustment` and `agency`, had not been made out.
 B2`s defence 
 
 
 
B2 also denied that he had engaged in a conspiracy with B1 to commit CBT of the goods. In addition, he went one step further and claimed that there were no missing goods at all, and that the alleged shortfall in quantity was actually due to PW13`s own act of short shipment. B2 said that in June 1997, he had contacted PW13 and asked for samples of goods. He received the samples and upon finding them suitable, he negotiated the price with PW13 over the telephone, and then placed an order for about US$1.5m worth of the goods. He said that this was not a concluded contract, since their oral agreement was subject to his viewing of the styles and samples in Manila. In September 1997, he went to Manila to view the full range of goods available. In October 1997, he opened three letters of credit in favour of PW13. B2 conceded that he was in Manila on 5 and 6 November 1997 and had met up with PW13, but he disputed PW13`s evidence that he had spent two full days conducting a full inspection of the goods that he had ordered. Instead, he said that he had merely spent about two and a half hours on 5 November 1997 looking at samples of the goods.
B2 said that he had planned a massive advertising campaign for his impending public sales, but there was no sign of the documents of title even as late as 12 November 1997. He wrote to ICB requesting the urgent presentation of the documents but to no avail. With the impending public sale drawing nearer and still no sign of the documents of title, he then contacted B1 and asked him to release the goods to him first. He assured B1 that he would give him the relevant b/ls later on. He requested urgent delivery of the goods and this was done. He did not eventually give B1 the relevant b/ls because he discovered that the goods were not in accordance with his orders and therefore he rejected the goods and the documents. Having rejected the goods and the documents, he then tried to cancel the advertisements for the public sales, but could not do so. He claimed that the situation was so desperate that he had been forced to obtain counterfeit and unlicensed Walt Disney goods from another source, one `Manaf`, and that he had sold these counterfeit Walt Disney goods at his public sales. He denied having sold any of PW13`s goods, and he denied responsibility for the missing goods. Furthermore, he claimed that the goods were not missing at all, and that the shortfall in the quantity was actually due to PW13`s own short-shipment.
 The decision of the judge below 
 
 
 
The trial judge did not think that it was necessary to have a principal offender in order for B1 and B2 to be charged with abetment by conspiracy. He considered the evidence adduced by the prosecution, and substantially adopted the prosecution`s version of material facts. In the course of the trial, he found material inconsistencies and discrepancies in B2`s evidence, and impeached B2`s credit. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge found that the evidence supported both the inference that B1 had been engaged with B2 in a conspiracy to commit CBT, and also the inference that B1 had been dishonest when he released the goods to B2. He further agreed with the prosecution that B1 and B2 had abetted to commit an aggravated form of CBT as there had been entrustment of property by PW13 to B1, and a relationship of agency between them. Accordingly, he convicted B1 and B2 as charged.
 Preliminary point of law in the appeal: whether two defendants can be charged under s 107(b) of the Penal Code for abetting each other by conspiracy in the absence of a principal offender 
 
 
 
The first issue raised by both appellants` counsel in the appeal before me was the interesting legal question of whether there can be offences of abetment by conspiracy if no one had been charged as the principal offender. This question arose because, in the present case, both B1 and B2 were charged as `abettors`. Neither one of them was charged as the principal offender, and no one else was alleged to have been involved. Put simply, the rationale behind the arguments submitted by the appellants` counsel was that if no principal offender existed, then there was no one for the appellants to `abet`.
The same question was raised before the trial judge, who adopted the whole of the prosecution`s submissions on the issue. Those submissions stated that two or more persons could be co-principals in an offence. That is a well-established legal principle, but it does not directly answer the question raised in this case, namely, whether there can be offences of abetment by conspiracy when no principal has been charged. To my knowledge, no previous local case law or academic authority has considered this specific issue. Hence, I reverted to first principles.
First of all, it is important to clarify the meaning of the terms `principal offender` and `secondary offender`. The principal offender is the person whose acts fall within the legal definition of the offence - that is, he actually commits the actus reus with the necessary mens rea. For example, he is the one who makes the knife wound which causes the death of the victim with the requisite intention in a crime of murder, or who snatches the bag with the requisite intention for the crime of theft or robbery. The acts of a secondary offender (sometimes called an `accomplice` or `accessory`) do not fall within the legal definition of the substantive offence, but he is someone whom the law punishes for his involvement in the commission of the substantive offence. It does not follow from this that where two or more persons are involved in an offence, one must be the principal and the others the accomplices. Two or more persons can be co-principals, so long as each of them satisfies the definition of the substantive offence, for example, by each inflicting the wounds upon the victim with the required fault.
It should be emphasised that the terms `principal offender` and `secondary offender` are descriptive terms. The issue of the 
 appropriate description 
 of the offenders must not be confused with the issue of the complicity of the offenders. The former issue relates to identifying and describing the precise role that each offender plays in relation to the legal definition of the crime. In contrast, the issue of complicity relates to the level of involvement and the degree to which each offender should be punished. Therefore, the fact that one defendant is labelled the `principal offender`, and the other defendant is labelled the `secondary offender`, does not mean that the latter is automatically guilty to a lesser degree than the former. Indeed, the Penal Code provides that the secondary offender can be punished to the same degree as the principal offender, depending on his level of involvement and culpability.
In English law, the general consensus is that the offence of `abetment` (or `aiding and abetting` as it is more commonly called in English law) is a `secondary offence` and the abettor is a `secondary offender`. The position in English law is that the very nature of the offence of abetment makes the liability of the abettor derivative in nature, in that it is necessary for a principal offender to exist before another person can be found guilty of `abetment`. Put simply, there must be someone for the accused to abet. In some cases, the principal offender may not be charged for various reasons, for example, he may have absconded, or there may be lack of evidence to ascertain his exact identity. Nevertheless, a principal offender must first be ascertained to exist before another person can be accused of abetment. This is because the offence of aiding and abetting, under English law, is understood to constitute some 
 encouragement 
 or 
 help 
 to the principal offender. Between them, the English notions of `aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring` embrace conduct which encourages or influences the principal offender or helps him in the commission of the crime.
In Singapore law, the offence of abetment is contained in s 107 of the PC. This section was derived from the Indian Penal Code, and differs significantly from the wording of English legislation governing the offence of abetment. Section 107 of our Penal Code states: 
 
A person abets the doing of a thing who - (a) instigates any person to do that thing; (b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or (c) intentionally aids by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
 
 
 
In contrast, the relevant English provision, namely, s 8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861, states: 
 
Whosoever shall aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any indictable offence ... shall be liable to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender.
 
 
 
A comparison of these two statutory provisions reveals that, insofar as the offence of `abetment` is concerned, Singapore law has deviated significantly from English law. The concepts of `abetment by instigation` and `abetment by intentional aiding` found in limbs (a) and (c) of s 107 of our Penal Code are well-known in English criminal law. However, the concept of `abetment by conspiracy` in limb (b) of s 107 is alien to English law, and was derived from the Indian Penal Code. Therefore, whereas abetment by instigation and abetment by intentional aiding can be said to involve concepts of encouraging and helping the principal offender, it is not immediately clear that the same can be said of abetment by conspiracy.
It is time that we clarify the distinction between limb (b) of s 107 of our Penal Code and limbs (a) and (c). Unlike abetment by `instigation` or `intentional aiding`, the offence of abetment by `conspiracy` is, in substance, more closely related to the concept of `criminal conspiracy` than the traditional English notion of `abetment` (ie encouraging or helping another). The offence of `abetment by conspiracy`, postulates proof of a criminal conspiracy coupled with proof of some further act which has been done in pursuance of that conspiracy. In the case of 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
 , where I delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, it was stated (at p 60) that: 
 
The distinction between abetment by conspiracy under s 107(b) of the Penal Code and criminal conspiracy under s 120A of the Penal Code was pointed out by the Supreme Court of India in 
NMMY Momin
 
[1971] Cr LJ at p 796
:
 
 
 
 
`Criminal conspiracy postulates an agreement between two or more persons to do, or cause to be done, an illegal act or an act which is not illegal, by illegal means. It differs from other offences in that mere agreement is made an offence even if no step is taken to carry out that agreement. Though there is close association of conspiracy with incitement and abetment the substantive offence of criminal conspiracy is somewhat wider in amplitude than abetment by conspiracy as contemplated by s 107 IPC.` 
 
Unlike criminal conspiracy under s 120A of the Penal Code, abetment by conspiracy requires some further act to be done pursuant to the conspiracy. (See also Explanation 5 to s 108 of the Penal Code.) According to 
Koh Clarkson and Morgan`s Criminal Law in Singapore and Malaysia
 
[1989] at pp 311
-312, the essential elements of abetment by conspiracy are: first, the person abetting must engage, with one or more other persons in a conspiracy; second, the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and third, an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that thing.
  
 
 
Having considered the nature and definition of the offence, I found, as a matter of law, that it is not necessary for a principal offender to exist before someone can be charged under s 107 (b) for abetment by conspiracy - so long as two accused persons agree that they want to effect a substantive offence, and so long as one of them commits an act in pursuance of that conspiracy, there is no reason why they cannot both be charged for abetting each other by conspiracy to commit that substantive offence.
During the hearing of the appeal, B1`s counsel raised a separate but related point. He argued that the prosecution must in every case prove that the principal offence has actually been committed before the abettor is convicted of abetting the commission of that principal offence. It was argued that B1 could not be convicted of abetment by conspiracy to commit CBT in this case as the principal offence of CBT had not been made out. This point can be disposed of simply by referring to my recent dicta in the case of 
Chua Kian Kok v PP
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 542
 . In that case, I considered the issue of whether an abettor could be convicted when the principal offence that he abetted did not take place, and the principal offender was convicted of a different offence from that which the abettor was charged with abetting. I held that since an accessory`s liability was not strictly dependent on the liability of the principal, the fact that the principal offender was convicted of a different offence from that which the appellant was charged with abetting, did not pose any difficulty. In my judgment, I touched on the `derivative nature` of the liability of an accessory. I said (at p 562): 
 
It may perhaps be argued that it is illogical to convict an accessory when an offence has not been committed. 
 This is because the liability of an accessory is derivative in nature
. If the principal is not guilty of the offence that is abetted (as he would only be guilty of another offence, or at most for the attempt of the offence) how can it be said that the accessory, who is even more `removed` from the offence, is guilty of abetting it ? ...
 
 
 
This objection can be dealt with in the following way. 
 The principle that an accessory`s liability is derivative is a common law principle
. Our criminal law is codified in the form of the Penal Code. Sections 107(b), 109, 115 and 116 of the Code clearly state that an accessory can be guilty even though the actual offence is not committed. 
 Applying Bank of England v Vagliano Bros 
[1891] AC 107
, one should look at the natural meaning of the statutory words and not at earlier case law. That being the case, the Penal Code should prevail over the common law notion of an accessory`s liability being derivative
. In fact, even in England, inroads are being made to this notion of derivative liability ... [Emphasis mine.]
 
 
 
The same observations apply in the present case. One should look at the natural meaning of the statutory words and not at earlier case law. By definition, the offence of `abetment by conspiracy`, which was derived from the Indian Penal Code, refers to proof of the existence of a conspiracy and proof of an act done in furtherance of that conspiracy. This does not necessitate the existence of a principal offender, and two accessories can therefore be charged for abetting each other by conspiracy. The Penal Code should prevail over the common law notion of an accessory`s liability being derivative.
It follows, therefore, that the charges against B1 and B2 in this case were not defective for want of a principal offender. Having disposed of the preliminary point of law, I will now turn to the rest of the contentions raised by the appellants. At the outset, I note that for the charges against B1 and B2 to be made out, the prosecution must have proved beyond reasonable doubt: 
(i) first, that B1 and B2 were knowingly engaged in a conspiracy to commit the crime of aggravated CBT as defined under s 409 of the PC; 
(ii) secondly, that B1 had dishonestly released the goods to B2 in pursuance of that conspiracy; and 
(iii) thirdly that the other elements of aggravated CBT under s 409 of the PC had been made out, namely that those goods had been entrusted to B1 in the way of his business as an agent.
I will deal with B1`s appeal before moving on to B2`s appeal.
 The first appellant`s appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The issues
 
The issues arising in B1`s appeal were: 
(i) whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the existence of a conspiracy to commit CBT of the goods; 
(ii) whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that B1 had the requisite dishonest intent when he released the goods to B2; 
(iii) whether the prosecution had proved that the goods were entrusted to B1 in the way of his business as an agent
 Proof of conspiracy to commit CBT 
 
 
 
The essence of conspiracy is the combination and agreement by persons to do some illegal act, or to effect a legal purpose by illegal means. While it is not necessary that all the alleged conspirators should be equally informed as to the details of the conspiracy, it is essential that there is a `meeting of minds` so that they are all aware of the general purpose of the plot. In this case, the general purpose of the alleged plot was to commit CBT of PW13`s goods. Section 405 sets out the requisite mens rea and actus reus elements for the substantive offence of `CBT`, and it states: 
 
Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits `criminal breach of trust`.
 
 
 
So far as proof goes, conspiracy is generally a matter of inference, deduced from certain acts of the accused parties, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose in common between them. Both the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the parties before and after the alleged commission of the crime will be useful in drawing an inference of conspiracy: see 
 Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP 
 (supra). An inference of conspiracy would be justified only if it is inexorable and irresistible, and accounts for all the facts of the case. In the case of 
Vinit Sopon v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 226
  , the Court of Appeal allowed the third appellant`s appeal against his conviction for abetment by conspiracy to traffic in drugs. In delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, I stated at p 241: 
 
Evidence can secure a conviction only if it 
 would inevitably
 and 
 inexorably
 lead to the conclusion that the third appellant had engaged in a conspiracy to traffick drugs ... It was our opinion that no irresistible inference could be drawn at the close of the trial to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the third appellant knew of and participated in the drug sale that was being transacted. ... 
 In other words, the third appellant could be convicted on the strength of circumstantial evidence only if an irresistible inference could be drawn to establish the fact in issue,
 viz the third appellant had abetted by conspiracy the trafficking in of drugs. [Emphasis mine.]
 
 
 
In that case, the evidence which the trial judge relied on to convict the third appellant were some comments made by him during a drug sale between the first appellant and an undercover CNB officer. The third appellant had said in Teochew that `the first meeting between strangers is always difficult ... after we get acquainted with each other, our transaction would be much easier and simpler ...`. He had also said that after they had got acquainted, they could even offer the undercover officer `credit terms`. The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that there were other possible and viable explanations for those comments, including the fact that the third appellant had not been aware that the goods being transacted were drugs. As a result, the evidence did not support an irresistible and inexorable inference that the third appellant knew that he was partaking in a drug transaction.
I will now consider whether the evidence relied on by the trial judge in the present case supported an irresistible and inexorable inference that B1 and B2 had engaged in a criminal conspiracy to commit CBT of the goods. The first set of evidence related to the parties` conduct leading up to the release of the goods. The evidence before the court was as follows: B2 had arranged with B1 to look for a Philippines freight forwarder to ship the goods that he had purchased from PW13. On B1`s nomination, Worldwide was appointed as the agent in the Philippines, and Worldwide prepared the ocean b/ls naming B1`s company, WF, as the consignees. This allowed B1 to collect the six containers shipped by PW13 from PSA by merely producing the ocean b/ls. On the arrival or shortly before the arrival of the first two containers, B2 contacted B1 and told him that he needed the goods urgently and to release the same to him without the duly endorsed b/ls. B1 was aware that the house b/ls in respect of the goods had been consigned to ICB, and he knew that he should not release the goods without having received the original b/ls duly endorsed by ICB. When he told B2 that he needed the duly endorsed b/ls from ICB, B2 told him that the bank had not released the documents to him and that the documents would not be ready in time. B2 assured B1 that he would hand over the endorsed b/ls later. B2 also assured B1 that he would take responsibility for the release of the goods without the b/ls. On that basis, B1 released the goods to B2. At the time when he released the goods, B1 was aware of the public sales that B2 had planned in respect of the goods from PW13. He knew that B2 intended to dispose of the goods during the public sales. During cross-examination, B1 conceded that, as the custodian of the goods, he was supposed to protect PW13`s interest by releasing the goods only upon receipt of the endorsed b/ls.
On its own, the evidence set out above did not support the irresistible and inexorable inference that there was an agreement between B1 and B2 to commit CBT of the goods. The evidence only revealed that B1 had agreed to release goods to B2 without duly endorsed b/ls. The act of releasing goods without having first received duly endorsed b/ls is not, on its own, an offence punishable under the Penal Code. Even if we assume, at this point, that B1`s act of releasing the goods without receiving duly endorsed b/ls did constitute a breach of trust, so that the actus reus element for CBT was made out under s 405 of the PC, the prosecution must still go on to prove the mens rea element. Whereas every breach of trust gives rise to a civil suit for damages, it is only when there is evidence of the mental element of dishonesty (or wilfulness in the appropriate instance) that such breach becomes a penal offence punishable as criminal breach of trust. In every case of criminal breach of trust, a breach of contract is implicit. It is therefore the mental element of dishonesty that clearly demarcates a breach of trust that is a civil wrong or tort, from the offence of criminal breach of trust. Put another way, every offence of criminal breach of trust involves a civil wrong in respect of which the complainant may seek his redress for damages in the civil court, but a breach of trust in the absence of the requisite mens rea cannot legally justify a criminal prosecution. The determining factor in judging whether a case is one of criminal breach of trust or of criminal breach of contract is whether the accused had acted dishonestly. Therefore, B1`s act of releasing the goods would only become punishable as a criminal act if it was coupled with the requisite mens rea.
 Proof of dishonest intent 
 
 
 
Thus, the pivotal consideration in this case was whether B1 had acted `dishonestly` when he released the goods to B2. If dishonest intent could be established, it would also be the basis for the court to draw an inexorable and irresistible inference that B1 had been engaged with B2 to commit CBT of the goods.
The issue of dishonest intent has to be considered with reference to ss 23 and 24 of the Penal Code. Section 24 of the PC states that `whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly`. According to s 23, `wrongful gain` is gain, by unlawful means, of property to which the person gaining it is not legally entitled, and `wrongful loss` is loss, by unlawful means, of property to which the person losing it is legally entitled. An accused person`s dishonest intention cannot be directly proved, and has to be inferred from the conduct of the accused and also from the surrounding circumstances: see 
Amritlal v Bajranglal

 at p 475. In most cases of CBT, where the accused is found to have been dishonest, he would have failed to provide any adequate explanation of his conduct. However there have been other cases involving a bona fide claim, or where there was some other explanation which led the court to conclude that he was not dishonest. In particular, it must be stressed that negligence is insufficient to make out an offence of CBT.
In the context of CBT, a series of cases have shown that negligence or a failure to account for entrusted property does not, without more, constitute dishonesty. In 
PP v Mohamed bin Abdul Jabar
 
 [1949] MLJ 70 
, the accused was entrusted with funds as a government servant. He failed to account for certain expenditure and offered no clear explanation of what happened to the money. However, he was acquitted. The court found that he had little or no accounting experience, and that he had placed great reliance on his clerk. He was not liable for CBT even though he had been `grossly careless`. Another more extreme example is provided by 
Navaratnam v PP
 
 
[1973] 1 MLJ 154
 . In that case, the officer in charge of a prison was found to have taken money belonging to a prisoner whose belongings had been entrusted to him. He claimed that he intended to use the money to retain a lawyer for the prisoner. Since there was nothing in the prosecution`s case to dispute the truth of the appellant`s statement, the appeal was allowed. Ali FJ concluded: 
 
the point as it seemed to us is, if there was any truth in the appellant`s statement of his intention to pay the lawyer, then his taking of the money did not become dishonest even if he did so without the prisoner`s permission.
 
 
 
Similarly, in 
Rangi Lall v King-Emperor
 
[1930] 6 ILR 68
, the court commented on the importance of proving `dishonesty` beyond reasonable doubt to make out an offence of CBT under the relevant section of the Indian Penal Code (which is in pari materia with Singapore`s legislation). It was pointed out that: 
 
T
 he sections dealing with the offence of criminal breach of trust were intended to punish an offence of which dishonesty is the essence
. Any breach of trust is not an offence. It may be intentional without being dishonest or it may appear dishonest without being really so. In such cases, the Magistrate should be slow to move. This caution is all the more necessary since there is a natural desire to secure speedy justice by having recourse to criminal law.
 
 
 
Although transactions which involve civil liabilities may amount to criminal offences, and often do, so that the dividing line between the two in a discussion of the case is almost indistinguishable, the use of the criminal law, not for the purpose of punishing an offender or in the public interest, but as a means of exerting pressure to extract money from an agent, is to be discouraged.
 
 
 
 
 The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies upon the prosecution who must prove the charge substantially as laid. The guilt of the accused must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The gravest suspicion against the accused will not suffice to convict him of a crime, unless evidence established it beyond doubt.
[Emphasis mine.]
 
 
 
In the present case, the trial judge found that the evidence adduced by the prosecution supported an inference that B1 had dishonestly released the goods to B2 for the purposes of committing CBT on those goods. However, having perused the evidence, I was unable to agree with him.
On three separate occasions, B1 released PW13`s goods to B2. This deprived PW13 of his financial security of payment against documents. B1 did this in circumstances where he knew that B2 needed the goods urgently for impending public sales, knowing that B2 had not paid for the goods, and knowing that B2 was going to sell those goods. Essentially, B1`s explanation for his conduct of releasing the goods was that it had never crossed his mind that B2, being a `man of means`, would not pay for the goods. It is clear from the evidence that B1 had been influenced by the urgency of B2`s request for the release of the goods. B1 was told that the public sales had been organised and widely publicised. There was still a lot to be done before the Walt Disney goods could be sold at the public sales - among other things, they had to be unpacked, arranged and price-tagged. B1 was aware of this urgency. He knew that B2 had not obtained the duly endorsed b/ls from ICB and had not paid ICB for the goods. He believed B2, who told him that the documents would not be ready in time for public sales. B2 requested B1 to ensure a quick clearance so that the goods could be sold at the public sales. B1 felt that this was a reasonable request - if B2 failed to get the goods in time for the public sales, he would have lost out on potential sales, or worse, be forced to incur additional costs, effort and publicity by organising more sales.
I found B1`s explanation of his decision to release the goods to B2 to be credible. However, the prosecution sought to discredit this explanation by relying on the fact that B1 had not made any checks to ascertain B2`s financial standing, and therefore had no basis to believe that B2 was `a man of means` who was financially sound and could pay for the shipment, which was worth US$1.5m. The prosecution submitted that, as a result, B1 must have known that B2 did not forward endorsed b/ls because he had no means to pay. The trial judge agreed with the prosecution. However, I disagreed, for it was not a startling concept to me that a man might be `a man of means`, and yet delay in paying for goods. Moreover, B1 had believed B2 when the latter said that the b/ls would not be ready in time. The point that B1 was trying to make was that, in his mind, B2 was a man of means and it never crossed his mind that B2 would ultimately not pay for the goods. After all, B2 had always been such a good customer, and had paid all his past invoices promptly. If B1 had truly held those beliefs at the time he released the goods, then it could not be said that he was dishonest. He had not released the goods with the intention of causing wrongful gain to himself or to B2. Neither had he intended to cause wrongful loss to PW13. He might have been negligent, or even grossly careless to expose his company, and PW13, to such risks, but he was not dishonest.
The prosecution conceded that B1 did not stand to gain financially from B2`s activities. There was no allegation that B1 and B2 agreed to share in any profits made from selling off the goods. The prosecution`s only allegation was that B1 wanted to foster his business relationship with B2, and that he had released the goods to B2 because he wanted to gain B2`s `goodwill`. B1 did testify that he considered B2 to be an important and valuable customer of his company. However, he denied that this had led him to dishonestly release the goods. Instead, he stated that he had felt a duty and an obligation to clear the goods quickly for B2, as it was part of the `good service` which he provided to his customers in times of urgency, especially an important customer like B2. He also testified that he had always considered B2 and not PW13 to be his customer, as the former had retained the services of his freight forwarding company. Again, if there was any truth in B1`s testimony as to his state of mind, then he did not release the goods with the dishonest intention to commit CBT on those goods.
It is worth noting that, by releasing the goods without first receiving the duly endorsed b/ls, B1 had put himself at a very great risk of being sued in the civil court by the holder of the b/ls for the full value of the goods. This was not a situation where the accused was (and knew that he was) immune from civil repercussions and could only be punished by criminal sanctions. B1 admitted that he had no money to pay for the goods if he was sued by the holder of the b/ls, and that he would be bankrupted if a civil suit was brought against him. In my judgment, this factor supported the conclusion that it had never even crossed his mind that B2 would not pay for the goods. It was inconceivable that he would put himself at such great risk just so as to gain B2`s business. In the same vein, it did not cross his mind that he was putting the shipper at risk, simply because he had not expected B2 not to pay.
The prosecution also put a great deal of emphasis on the fact that B1 had knowingly breached standard commercial practice of freight forwarders. It was contended that, by doing so, B1 had not only put himself, but also the shipper of the goods, at great risk. This contention clearly influenced the trial judge`s decision to find that B1 was dishonest. I was however not convinced by this argument - just because B1 took risks with the goods, and such risks were not in the best interests of the shipper, did not show that he was dishonest. The case 
Cheam Tat Pang & Anor v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 541
  is relevant. The facts, briefly, were as follows: the appellants were former directors of IPH. They were convicted in the district court of having conspired with each other to commit criminal breach of trust, contrary to s 409 and s 109 of the Penal Code. They were found to have dishonestly used IPH`s funds for the purchase of shares in a Hong Kong listed company, LMP. The appellants had devised a scheme for IPL to disburse about $8.45m to another company APL, and then for APL to facilitate the purchase of the LMP shares on IPH`s behalf. They then arranged for two other private companies, Lambang Maju and Wartakaya, to purchase the shares from APL at a higher price so that APL made a profit from the sale. The district judge found that the appellants had undisclosed beneficial interests in APL and had acted in conflict of interests. She also found that they had failed to act in IPH`s best interests, having taken dishonest risks with IPH`s funds to make a wrongful gain for themselves in the form of APL`s profit from the sale of the LMP shares. On appeal, the appellants argued, inter alia, that there were genuine commercial reasons for them to minimise disclosure of the LMP acquisition. The appeals against conviction and sentence were allowed. In relation to the question of dishonesty, the appellate court pointed out that: 
 
... the pivotal consideration was whether the appellants had acted `dishonestly`. This had to be considered with reference to s 24 of the Penal Code. It was not enough for the respondent to suggest that the appellants were dishonest in having taken risks with the entrusted funds, such risks not being in the best interests of IPH.
 
 
 
Despite the fact that the appellants in 
 Cheam Tat Pang 
 had clearly taken risks with the entrusted funds, it was held on appeal that there was no cogent evidence that they had acted in the pursuit of a common object or design involving the commission of criminal breach of trust. The appellate court also found little support for the district judge`s finding that the appellants had some undisclosed interest in APL and that they had intended to use IPH`s funds to gain profit in their capacity as APL`s shareholders. There were no `unlawful means` employed in the process of acquiring the LMP shares. Thus, it was held that the nature and degree of dishonesty required under s 405 of the PC had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.
Like in the case of 
 Cheam Tat Pang 
, I found that there were genuine commercial reasons in the present case for B1`s decision to breach standard practice and release the goods to B2. The urgency of the situation, the fact that B2 was a trusted customer, the knowledge that B2 had incurred substantial costs arranging and publicising the impending sales were all genuine commercial reasons. In the light of these reasons, I found that, although B1 had clearly taken risks with the entrusted goods, the nature and degree of dishonesty required under s 409 of the PC had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.
The next piece of evidence related to B1`s acts between 13 to 15 December 1997, when he took back cartons of goods from B2`s premises at Seaview Hotel and stored them at warehouses at Jalan Terusan and Kallang Place. The deputy public prosecutor submitted that, having delivered the goods, there was no reason for B1 to become involved in retaking custody of the goods. He argued before me that B1`s act of taking custody of the remaining goods was an indication of his guilt and his involvement in the conspiracy to commit CBT of the goods. I was unable to agree with him. B1 had already explained in cross-examination that he had retrieved the goods from B2 because he was becoming increasingly worried about the situation. He had repeatedly requested B2 to forward to him the duly endorsed b/ls, but to no avail. By December 1997, B2 had also indicated to B1 that he no longer wanted the goods as they were not up to specifications. B1 was afraid that the shipper would take legal action against him for releasing the goods, and he felt that by taking back the remaining goods, it would reduce his own risk in the event that the shipper sued him. I found this explanation to be acceptable and credible.
The respondent also pointed out to me at the appeal that, although B1 claimed that he had retaken custody of 5,505 cartons of goods in December 1997, only 5,348 cartons were found in his warehouse in May 1998 when the joint survey was carried out by B1 and PW13. He submitted that the fact that B2 had testified that he continued to sell Walt Disney goods at least until April 1998, coupled with the fact that 157 cartons of PW13`s goods went missing between December 1997 and May 1998 while in B1`s custody formed evidence of B1`s dishonesty and his involvement in a conspiracy with B2 to commit CBT of the goods. However, I found that B1 had merely said during cross-examination that his contractors had done a rough count when he retook the goods from B2 in December 1997, and that 
 approximately 
 4,800 to 5,505 cartons of goods were stored in the warehouses. There was no conclusive evidence that 157 cartons of goods had really gone missing whilst in B1`s custody.
 The lies told by the first appellant 
 
 
 
The onus was on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that B1 was engaged in a conspiracy with B2 to commit CBT of the goods, and that B1 had dishonestly released the goods to B2 in pursuance of that conspiracy. On the evidence thus far, I felt that they had not discharged their onus. Indeed, taking the evidence as a whole, I found the most cogent piece of evidence against B1 was the fact that he had lied to PW13 about the whereabouts of the goods. The undisputed evidence was that, between December 1997 and February 1998, he lied to PW13 repeatedly, assuring the latter that the goods were intact in his possession although he had already released the goods to B2. This is what I will consider next.
The relevant authority on the effect of lies told by an accused is the English case of 
R v Lucas (Ruth)
 
[1981] QB 720
[1981] 2 All ER 1008
. There, the English Court of Appeal held that the mere fact that an accused told lies should not be taken as evidence of his guilt, although these lies could, in appropriate circumstances, amount to corroboration because it indicated a consciousness of guilt. Lord Lane CJ held at p 724 that there were four criteria to be satisfied before an accused`s lie could amount to corroboration: 
 
The lie ... must first of all be deliberate. Secondly, it must relate to a 
 material issue
. Thirdly, 
 the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth
. ... Fourthly, the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by [independent] evidence ... [Emphasis mine.]
 
 
 
I found, without much difficulty, that the first and fourth criteria of the `Lucas` test were satisfied in the present case, for B1 conceded at the trial that he had deliberately lied to PW13 as to the whereabouts of the goods. I also found the second criterion of the test to be satisfied, and that B1`s lies related to a material issue. B1 lied to PW13 that he had not released the goods to B2. These lies were told pursuant to enquiries made by PW13, at a time when the goods had already been released. The lies clearly related to a material issue in the appeal, since they went towards determining whether he was covering up the conspiracy to commit CBT.
Thus, in my judgment, the effect of B1`s lies depended on whether the third criterion in the `Lucas` test was satisfied. The task for the court was to determine the motive behind the lies. During cross-examination, B1 explained that he had lied to PW13 because he was hoping that B2 would work out his differences with PW13, so that he would avoid being dragged into the conflict. I found B1`s subsequent conduct to be consistent with his explanations. In March 1998, B1 had called PW13 and apologised for lying to PW13. In the course of that conversation, he had given the same explanation to PW13 that he later repeated at the trial. This was before any complaint was made by PW13 to CCD. Hence, although I found that B1 was `dishonest` in general (because he had told lies), his lies were not sufficient to indicate any consciousness of guilt for releasing the goods dishonestly. He did not lie due to a realisation of `guilt`, but because of an `innocent motive`, namely, to buy time for himself, in hope that PW13 and B2 would work out their differences: see 
R v Goodway
 
[1993] 4 All ER 894
.
In my judgment, having considered the conduct of the parties and the surrounding circumstances, and taking the evidence as a whole, there was insufficient evidence to support the inference that B1 was dishonest when he released the goods to B2. The prosecution failed to show that B1`s explanations for his conduct were not acceptable. The evidence, at best, showed that B1 was negligent. Bearing in mind that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the evidence adduced by the prosecution also did not justify an irresistible inference that B1 had abetted B2 to commit CBT by conspiracy. There was insufficient evidence to support an inference that there was a `meeting of minds`, or agreement as to any general purpose to dishonestly misappropriate and dispose of the goods. The evidence showed only that B1 had agreed to release the goods to B2 in the absence of duly endorsed b/ls. By releasing the goods without having first received duly endorsed b/ls, B1 may very well be found to have been negligent, and be made liable in a civil suit for the full value of the goods. However, the act of releasing the goods without first receiving duly endorsed b/ls was not, in itself, an offence under the Penal Code. Hence, an `agreement` between B1 and B2 to effect such a release bore no significance in criminal law, unless it could be shown that this was done with dishonest intent. These findings were sufficient for me to allow B1`s appeal against his conviction, and there is no need to go on and consider the issues of `entrustment` and agency`.
 The second appellant`s appeal against conviction 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Amendment of the charge against the second appellant
 
In order to establish the offence of abetment by conspiracy, it must be shown that there was agreement to commit the offence in question. An agreement necessarily involves at least two parties. This means that where only two persons are charged for abetment by conspiracy, and if one is acquitted on the basis that there was lack of evidence of any `agreement` or `conspiracy`, then the remaining person cannot be convicted of abetment by conspiracy. Having found, in relation to B1, that there was insufficient evidence to prove the existence of any conspiracy between B1 and B2, it followed that B2 should not have been convicted on the charge of `abetment by conspiracy` to commit CBT, for the element of `conspiracy` would also not have been made out in relation to B2. The nature of the offence dictated that the original charge against B2 was revealed to be improper once B1`s appeal was allowed.
However, the fact that I acquitted B1 did not mean that I had no choice but to also acquit B2. Although the general principle is that an accused should be acquitted if the charge against him has not been made out, this principle must be balanced with the interests of the public, which require that those persons who are evidently guilty of serious crimes be brought to justice. Thus, a combination of case law and statute provides the High Court, sitting in its appellate capacity, with the power to amend a charge: see 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 701
 , and 
Carl Elias Moses v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 748
 . In appropriate cases, the High Court in its appellate capacity could also alter the finding of a subordinate court by convicting on an amended charge: s256(b)(ii) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). The power to amend the charge will be exercised where the record of facts and the record of evidence support the amended charge, and where such amendment does not affect the substance of the evidence given in the lower court. Such power must be exercised judiciously and the court will ensure that the accused is not prejudiced in any way.
In my judgment, this was a proper case for amending the original charge against B2 of `abetment by conspiracy to commit CBT` to one of `cheating` under s 420 of the PC. Section 420 states: 
 
Whoever cheats, and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
 
 
 
Amendment of the charge to one of cheating did not affect the substance of the evidence given in the lower court. The facts of the case, and the record of evidence revealed a classic case of cheating, which is defined in s 415 of the PC as follows: 
 
Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to `cheat`.
 
 
 
The substance of the amended charge against B2 was that he, by deceiving PW13, had dishonestly induced PW13 to deliver goods to him, and had thereafter misappropriated US$301,673 worth of those goods. Without paying for the goods, B2 induced PW13 to deliver those goods to him. Prosecution witnesses who had attended the public sales at B2`s premises at Seaview Hotel testified that over half of the space had been dedicated to sale of Walt Disney apparel. Yet, B2 claimed that he did not sell any of PW13`s goods at the public sales. He would have the court believe that he rejected PW13`s goods because those goods did not meet specifications, yet, he could not point to any specific term of his contract with PW13 that was breached in respect of the goods. Before the trial judge, he merely gave a bare assertion that the goods were not sorted out by size, and that there were very few colours and too much quantity of particular styles. He claimed that the Walt Disney goods that he sold at the public sales were actually counterfeit goods which he had obtained from one `Manaf` out of desperation. He also argued that none of PW13`s goods actually went missing, and that the alleged shortfall in quantity was in fact due to PW13`s short shipment.
 Issues in B2`s appeal 
 
 
 
At the appeal, B2`s counsel raised the following issues: 
(i) the trial judge had erred in making various findings of fact; 
(ii) the trial judge had erred when he preferred PW13`s evidence over B2`s evidence, and he had erred in impeaching B2`s credit without giving adequate consideration to B2`s explanations for the inconsistencies in his evidence at the trial and his previous statement to the police; 
(iii) the trial judge had erred when he ruled that the terms of the inspection certificates did not give B2 the right to take delivery of the goods in the absence of the duly endorsed b/ls.
 The trial judge`s findings of fact 
 
 
 
Counsel for B2 sought to appeal various findings of fact made by the trial judge. First, it was argued that the trial judge was wrong to believe PW13 and to make the finding that B2 had spent 5 and 6 November 1997 in Manila conducting a full inspection of the goods. B2 had testified at the trial that he had only spent two and a half hours on 5 November 1997 looking at samples, and that he had not inspected either the quantity or quality of the goods before they were shipped to him. However, the trial judge disbelieved him as the evidence he gave at the trial was inconsistent with his previous statement to CID. In that previous statement, he had told CID officers that he was in Manila between 5 and 6 November 1997 for the purpose of inspecting the goods, and that he had found the goods to be in order. Moreover, B2 himself conceded that he had signed inspection certificates dated 6 November 1997. These certificates certified that B2 had made a `random check and inspection` of the goods, and had found the goods to be fully compliant in terms of quality, size, general appearance, colour, measurements, workmanship and instructions on the labels and tags.
The second finding of fact which B2`s counsel appealed against was the finding made by the trial judge that B2 and his company, US Apparel, were not in a financially secure position at the relevant times and could not pay for the goods that had been purchased from PW13. At the trial, B2 called DW10 to testify that a company called Vastraco Pte Ltd had paid him the sum of $445,000 for goods purchased from a Hong Kong company affiliated with US Apparel. However, it transpired at the trial that DW10 was not even an officer or employee of Vastraco Pte Ltd. He could not even produce a letter of authority verifying his claim that he managed the affairs of Vastraco Pte Ltd. Moreover, the sum of $445,000 was for goods purchased from a Hong Kong affiliated company and not US Apparel, and B2 did not testify as to how he could utilise these funds to pay off the debts of US Apparel. Added to this, the trial judge found it curious that neither DW10 nor B2 could explain why the sum of $445,000 had been paid in the form of two cheques instead of one cheque. Thus, the trial judge preferred the evidence of PW14, the Vice-President of ICB, who testified that, at the material time, US Apparel had generally exceeded its credit lines and did not have sufficient funds to even pay the two collection bills sent by Citibank, Manila, much less to pay US$1.5m for all the goods purchased from PW13.
Thirdly, B2`s counsel argued that the trial judge had erred in holding that PW13 had not made a short shipment of goods to Singapore. The trial judge had rejected B2`s allegations as `incredible`, since he had not mentioned the fact of PW13`s short shipment in any of his statements to the police. The defence of short shipment had only been entered at the last minute. Moreover, B1 testified that B2 had not complained to him of short shipment.
Fourthly, B2`s counsel argued that the trial judge had erred in holding that the goods that were sold at the public sales originated from PW13 and were not counterfeit goods. The trial judge disbelieved B2`s claim that he had sold counterfeit goods which he had obtained from one `Manaf`. He pointed out that B2 had in his possession six container loads of genuine Walt Disney apparel. It simply defied logic for B2 to claim that he did not sell any of PW13`s genuine goods, out of fear that he would not be able to reject them in a civil suit, and yet say at the same time that he was so desperate that he had to obtain counterfeit Walt Disney apparel for the sales, thereby taking the risk of being indicted for the criminal offence of selling unlicensed goods. The learned judge rejected the evidence of DW7, whom B2 had called as an `expert witness` to testify that the Walt Disney goods sold at the public sales were counterfeit. He found DW7 to be an unreliable, biased and untruthful witness. He also took into account the fact that B2 had not made any attempt to trace `Manaf` and to call him as a witness.
The fifth finding of fact that was appealed against was the trial judge`s finding that B2 had not rejected the goods purchased from PW13. The trial judge found no evidence to substantiate B2`s allegations that the goods had failed to comply with specifications in the contract. He noted that up to April 1998, B2 had never intimated to PW13 that he was rejecting the shipment for non-compliance with his specifications. Moreover, B2 could not, in court, point to any specific term of his contract with PW13 that was breached in respect of the goods. He made a bare assertion that the goods were not sorted out by size, were of very few colours and that too much quantity of particular styles had been shipped. Yet, when asked to verify his assertion, B2 had to concede that there were no written documents showing that he had stipulated the requisite sizes, colours and styles of the goods which he had ordered from PW13. It was therefore not surprising that the trial judge accepted PW13`s evidence that B2 had contracted to purchase half a million pieces of PW13`s inventory of assorted apparel at US$3 per piece, and not on the basis of size, colour or style.
As can be seen, each of the findings of fact that was appealed against was dealt with in great detail by the trial judge in his written judgment. At the appeal, B2`s counsel presented lengthy arguments as to why each of the above findings was wrong. I will not delve into those arguments in detail. It suffices to say that, after carefully scrutinising the reasons given by the trial judge for those findings of fact, I found that they were all findings of primary fact, based on the evidence given by the witnesses in the trial. In relation to each finding of fact which B2 appealed against, the trial judge chose to believe the evidence given by the prosecution`s witnesses, over the evidence given by the witnesses called by B2. It is well-established that an appellate court should not set aside a finding of fact unless the appellant satisfies the court that the trial judge was plainly wrong and that his decision ought to have been the other way. In particular, appellate courts are exceedingly slow to overturn findings of primary fact based on evidence given by witnesses, which the trial judge had the advantage of hearing first hand. Therefore, B2`s appeal in respect the trial judge`s findings of fact failed, for he did not show that the trial judge was plainly wrong, or that these findings were made against the weight of evidence.
 The trial judge`s decision to impeach the second appellant`s credit 
 
 
 
Counsel for B2 also argued before me that the trial judge erred when he impeached B2`s credit at the trial, and preferred PW13`s evidence over that given by B2. However, an appellate court, not having seen or heard the witnesses, is in a less advantageous position than the trial judge to judge the veracity of witnesses. Even when the appellate court is disposed to come to a different conclusion, it should not do so unless it is satisfied that any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge`s conclusion. In 
Chow Yee Wah & Anor v Choo Ah Pat
 
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 41
 , the Privy Council approved of the following statement of principle as to appellate intervention expressed by Lord Shaw in 
 Clarke v Edinburgh & District Tramways Co 
 1919 SC (HL) 35 at p 36: 
 
When a judge hears and sees witnesses and makes a conclusion or inference with regard to what on balance is the weight of their evidence, that judgment is entitled to great respect and that quite irrespective of whether the judge makes any observations with regard to credibility or not. I can of course quite understand a Court of Appeal that says that it will not interfere in the case in which the judge has announced as part of his judgment that he believes one set of witnesses, having seen them and heard them, and does not believe another. But that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a court of justice. In courts of justice in the ordinary case things are much more evenly divided; witnesses without any conscious bias towards a conclusion may have in their demeanour, in their manner, in their hesitation, in the nuance of their expressions, in even the turns of the eyelid, left an impression upon the man who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed page. What, in such circumstances, thus psychologically put, is the duty of an appellate court ? In my opinion, the duty of an appellate court in those circumstances is for each judge of it to put to himself ... the question, Am I - who sit here without those advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privileges of the judge who heard and tried the case - in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that the judge who had them was plainly wrong ? If I cannot be satisfied in my own mind that the judge with those privileges was plainly wrong, then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his judgment.
 
 
 
There was no indication that the trial judge in the present case had failed to take proper advantage of his having seen and heard the witnesses. Thus, there was no basis for me to intervene with his decision to impeach B2`s evidence, or to prefer PW13`s evidence over B2`s. In any event, so much of B2`s evidence was unsubstantiated and inconsistent that it was not at all surprising that the trial judge chose to believe PW13`s evidence.

The last submission which B2`s counsel made before me was that the inspection certificates gave B2 the right to take delivery of the goods prior to payment without duly endorsed b/ls, and that the trial judge had therefore erred when he held otherwise. His argument ran as follows: the inspection certificates provided that the shipper was responsible for the correctness of the goods right up to destination. B2`s evidence was that he had not inspected the goods in Manila before their shipment and hence he wanted to check the goods before making payment. The assurance or indemnity given to WF in the inspection certificates, be it oral or otherwise, gave him the entitlement to clear the cargo in advance, prior to the arrival of the documents.
Even if one disregarded the finding of fact made by the trial judge that B2 had conducted a full inspection of the goods in Manila on 5 and 6 November 1997, the above argument would still have failed. There is no rule in commercial law that gives the buyer the specific right to take possession and delivery of goods via inspection certificates and for the purpose of inspection. The buyer`s right to possession of goods is governed by s 28 of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393) (`SGA`), which makes delivery conditional upon payment of the price, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise. The right to possession is therefore independent of the passing of property and ownership in the goods, and the general rule is that a buyer obtains the right to possession of the goods only upon paying the price. Of course, the parties may specifically contract otherwise, for example, if the seller sees fit to grant him credit. There was no evidence of any contract term in the present case granting B2 the right to take possession and delivery of the goods via the inspection certificates. The only statutory provision providing for the buyer`s right to inspect goods is s 35(2) of the SGA. This section provides that a buyer who has not previously examined the goods, upon obtaining possession of those goods, is accorded a reasonable opportunity to examine them. Even though the buyer has obtained possession of the goods, he is not deemed to have accepted them, and he may reject non-conforming goods within a reasonable time. However, s 35(2) does not circumvent s 28 of the SGA to provide the buyer with the right to possession in order to inspect the goods.
 Substitution of conviction 
 
 
 
Taking the evidence as a whole, and having considered and rejected all of the arguments forwarded by B2`s counsel, I found that B2 had no defences against the amended charge of cheating. Following the Court of Appeal`s decision in 
 Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP 
 (supra), it was open to this court to substitute under s 256(b)(ii) of the CPC a conviction under the original charge to one under the amended charge. In 
Sivalingam v PP
 
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 172
  , it was held that the High Court`s power to substitute a conviction in its appellate capacity must be exercised with great caution bearing in mind the restrictions in ss 172 and 173. The appellate court must be satisfied that there is clear evidence that a case for the substituted offence has been made out against the accused in the court below, and that no prejudice or injustice has been caused to the accused.
The circumstances of this case made it suitable to substitute B2`s conviction under the original charge, to a conviction under the amended charge of `cheating`. For B2 to be guilty of `cheating`, it had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt that he had induced PW13 to deliver the goods to him, and that he had done so with dishonest intent. The facts of this case were such that both the act of inducement and B2`s dishonest intent had been made out on the evidence. Not only did the record of facts and the record of evidence support the amended charge, all the evidence necessary to satisfy the elements to constitute the amended charge of cheating was also available. In particular, I found that B2`s evidence and defence would have been substantially unchanged had the charge of `cheating` been brought against him from the start. Therefore, I amended the charge against B2 to one of `cheating` under s 420 of the Penal Code, and I exercised my powers under s 256(b)(ii) of the CPC and substituted the conviction.
 The second appellant`s appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
In relation to B2`s appeal against sentence, I noted that the maximum term of imprisonment for the amended charge was seven years. This was lower than the maximum term of imprisonment for the original charge under s 409 of the PC, which was ten years. The original term of imprisonment passed by the trial judge of five years and six months was very close to the maximum term of imprisonment provided under s 420 of the PC. In the circumstances, to reflect the fact that the charge against B2 had been amended to one with a lower maximum term of imprisonment, I found it appropriate on the particular facts of this case to reduce his term of imprisonment to four years.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In conclusion, the charge against B1 was not made out, and his appeal against conviction was accordingly allowed, and his sentence set aside. As for B2, the charge against him was amended to one of `cheating` under s 420 of the PC. His conviction was substituted under the amended charge, and his sentence reduced to four years` imprisonment.

: In the District Court, the appellant faced 11 charges of harbouring and 11 charges of employing 11 immigration offenders in his restaurant under ss 57(1)(d) and 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (the `Act`) respectively. The prosecution proceeded on, and the appellant pleaded guilty to, six charges of employing immigration offenders under s 57(1)(e), and six charges of harbouring them under s 57(1)(d) of the Act. The remaining ten charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
Section 57(1)(ii) of the Act provides that an offender under s 57(1)(d) or (e) shall, subject to s 57(1A), be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than six months and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $6,000. The district judge sentenced the appellant to six months` imprisonment on each of the 12 charges to which the appellant pleaded guilty, with six of the sentences to run consecutively and six to run concurrently. In total, the appellant was sentenced to three years` imprisonment.
The appellant appealed against the total sentence imposed on the ground that it was manifestly excessive. I dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentence imposed by the district judge. At the same time, pursuant to CR 7/2000 filed by the prosecution, I added to the appellant`s sentence a fine of $1,000 on each of the appellant`s six convictions of employing immigration offenders under s 57(1)(e) with one month`s imprisonment in default of each fine. I now give my reasons for making such an order.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant`s counsel submitted that the appellant`s total sentence of three years` imprisonment was manifestly excessive because it offended the totality principle recognised by the Court of Appeal in 
Kanagasuntharam v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 81
 . DA Thomas in 
 Principles of Sentencing 
 (2nd Ed) at pp 57-58 stated the totality principle as follows: 
 
The many decisions of the court in which the totality principle has been applied to explain the reduction of a cumulative sentence made up of correctly calculated individual parts suggest that the principle has two limbs. A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender `a crushing sentence` not in keeping with his records and prospects.
 
 
 
The appellant`s counsel argued that the appellant`s sentence offended the totality principle because the maximum sentence which could have been imposed for an individual offence of which the appellant was convicted was two years` imprisonment, whereas the cumulative sentence imposed on the appellant was three years` imprisonment.
In this case, the appellant was convicted of 12 different charges under ss 57(1)(d) and 57(1)(e) of the Act. The district judge, in sentencing the appellant to six months` imprisonment on each charge, had given the appellant the minimum sentence prescribed for each conviction. The district judge ordered six of the sentences to run consecutively and six to run concurrently, resulting in a total cumulative sentence of three years` imprisonment.
To my mind, the appellant`s argument was misconceived. The Court of Appeal in 
 Kanagasuntharam v PP 
 (supra) held that the first limb of the totality principle has to be qualified by s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), which provides that, where at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the court shall order that the sentences for at least two of those offences shall run consecutively. In such a case, the sentencing court is invested with the direction as to which and how many of the sentences ought to run consecutively, and there is no absolute rule precluding the court from making more than two sentences consecutive: 
Maideen Pillai v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 161
  at 165. In the circumstances of the case, as the appellant`s convictions were for employing and harbouring six individual immigration offenders, the district judge had properly exercised his discretion in ordering six of the sentences to run consecutively. Moreover, where, as in this case, all the offences of which the offender is convicted are equally serious and attract the same penalty, there is no `most serious of the individual offences involved` in accordance with the formulation of the totality principle in DA Thomas`s 
 Principle of Sentencing 
. The second limb of the totality principle was also not offended as a cumulative sentence of three years` imprisonment could hardly be considered a `crushing sentence` in the circumstances of the case. I was thus of the view that the appellant`s cumulative sentence did not violate either limb of the totality principle.
 The criminal revision 
 
 
 
In addition to affirming the sentence imposed by the district judge on the appellant, I also imposed a fine of $1,000 for each of the appellant`s six convictions under s 57(1)(e) of the Act. This was pursuant to CR 7/2000 filed by the prosecution. The ground for the criminal revision was that the district judge, in sentencing the appellant, had failed to impose a fine on the appellant in accordance with s 57(1B) of the Act. The learned judge had applied s 57(1A) of the Act, which states: 
 
Where, in the case of any offence under subsection (1)(e), it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant has at the same time employed more than 5 immigration offenders, the defendant shall be punished, subject to section 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), with caning in addition to the punishment prescribed for that offence.
 
 
 
As the appellant is now 56 years old, under s 231 of the CPC, he cannot be punished with caning. The district judge recognised this fact but failed to apply s 57(1B) of the Act, which provides: 
 
Where, by virtue of section 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68), the defendant referred to in subsection (1A) is not punishable with caning, he shall, in lieu of caning, be punished with a fine not exceeding $10,000.
 
 
 
Sections 57(1A) and 57(1B) of the Act are worded in mandatory terms and the court must impose a fine on the appellant under s 57(1B), in addition to his sentence of imprisonment under s 57(1)(ii). I imposed a fine of $1,000 for each of the appellant`s six convictions under s 57(1)(e), or in default of the fine, one month`s imprisonment. This meant that the appellant would have to pay a total fine of $6,000 or serve additional imprisonment of six months in default.
The appellant`s counsel, however, contended that the fine under s 57(1B) should not be imposed on the appellant for each individual offence under s 57(1)(e) but should be imposed as a global punishment for his cumulative offences under s 57(1)(e). The prosecution, however, argued that the fine should be imposed for each of the six charges under s 57(1)(e) on which the appellant was convicted.
 Interpretation of ss 57(1A) and 57(1B) of the Act 
 
 
 
The question of whether the fine imposed under s 57(1B) in lieu of caning applies to each individual offence or to the cumulative offences under s 57(1)(e) necessarily follows from whether s 57(1A) applies to individual or cumulative offences under s 57(1)(e). On the construction of statutory provisions, Elmer A Driedger, in 
 Construction of Statutes 
 (2nd Ed) at p 87, states: 
 
Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.
 
 
 
The words in s 57(1A), `... in the case of any offence under subsection 1(e) ...` and `... shall be punished ... with caning in addition to the 
 punishment prescribed for that offence 
`, suggest that the additional punishment of caning should be imposed for each individual offence under s 57(1)(e). Section 57(1)(ii) prescribes a punishment of mandatory imprisonment for a term of not less than six months and not more than two years and a discretionary fine not exceeding $6,000 for each individual s 57(1)(e) offence. There is no prescribed punishment in respect of cumulative s 57(1)(e) offences. Thus, on a plain and ordinary reading, the caning under s 57(1A) should be imposed in addition to the prescribed punishment for each individual offence under s 57(1)(e) rather than in addition to the punishment for the cumulative offences. Section 57(1A) therefore does not appear to create a new offence but is merely a punishment enhancing provision.
In interpreting ss 57(1A) and 57(1B), Parliament`s intention in enacting these provisions is relevant. The legislative history of the provisions and the relevant parliamentary materials are useful in ascertaining such intention.
Mandatory caning for employers of more than five immigration offenders was first introduced in 1989 via Act No 34 of 1989. The original s 57(1A) of the Act read: 
 
Where, in the case of any offence under subsection (1)(e), it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant has at the same time employed more than 5 persons with the actual knowledge that those persons have acted in contravention of section 6(1), 15 or 36, the defendant shall be punished, subject to section 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code, with caning in addition to the punishment prescribed for that offence.
 
 
 
At the Second Reading of the Bill on 31 August 1989, the then Minister for Home Affairs (Prof S Jayakumar) stated (at col 513-514): 
 
... there is still a hardcore group of employers who will continue to recruit and employ such immigration offenders.
 
 
 
... Introducing caning for these employers should remove any incentive for this group to hire illegal immigrants and overstayers. It will effectively discourage more illegal immigrants from entering Singapore to seek work ...
 
 
 
It is for these reasons, Sir, that the Government has decided to amend the Immigration Act to provide for:
 
 
 
 
(a) mandatory caning for employers who employ more than 5 illegal workers and who had actual knowledge that they were illegal immigrants or overstayers; ...
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
... This latest amendment has been drafted carefully so that the caning applies only in the case of what I would describe as an aggravated offence ...
 
 
 
In 1995, s 57(1A) was amended via Act No 41 of 1995 to remove the requirement of actual knowledge. At the Second Reading of the Bill on 1 November 1995, the then Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng) stated (at col 77-78): 
 
... the penalty for employing more than five immigration offenders is enhanced. This is done through cl 6(b) of the Bill which seeks to re-enact s 57(1A) to remove the requirement that the prosecution must prove that the employer of more than five immigration offenders has `actual knowledge` of their immigration status before he can be caned for employing them. This is necessary because in practice, unless the employer admits that he knew of the status of the immigration offender, it is almost impossible to prove that the employer is aware of the immigration offender`s status. The penalty of caning should deter those employers who employ more than five immigration offenders.
 
 
 
Section 57(1B) was introduced via Act No 34 of 1998. On the rationale for s 57(1B), the then Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng) said at the Second Reading of the Bill on 4 September 1998 (at col 933): 
 
Currently, employers of more than five immigration offenders can be sentenced to between six months and two years` jail, fined not exceeding $6,000 and caned. Clause 11(c) of the Bill amends s 57(1B) of the Act to increase the maximum fine for employers of more than five immigration offenders who cannot be caned because they are females or more than 50 years old from $6,000 to $10,000.
 
 
 
The rationale for s 57(1B), as gathered from the Minister`s speech, supports the interpretation that the fine thereunder should be imposed in respect of each individual offence and not in respect of the cumulative offences under s 57(1)(e). Where, as in the present case, an offender is convicted on multiple charges under s 57(1)(e) and has at the same time employed more than five immigration offenders, he is liable under s 57(1)(ii) to a discretionary fine of up to $6,000 on each charge as well as mandatory caning under s 57(1A). However, where the offender cannot be caned, it appears from the Minister`s speech that the purpose of s 57(1B) is to increase the maximum fine for the offender from $6,000 to $10,000. Under s 57(1)(ii), the maximum fine for each individual s 57(1)(e) offence is $6,000. Where the offender cannot be caned, the increased maximum fine of $10,000 should also apply to each individual s 57(1)(e) offence.
Another relevant consideration in the interpretation of ss 57(1A) and 57(1B) is the general principle that the sentence for an offence must be specific. Generally, if there are separate charges, a separate sentence should be passed on each charge: 
Bujang Johny v PP
 
 [1965] 1 MLJ 72 
. The reason for this is that if separate sentences are not passed, the appellate court would be in a difficulty if the appellant was successful on some of the convictions: Tan Yock Lin, 
 Criminal Procedure 2 
 at p XVIII 3 at para [54]. In this instance, there was nothing to indicate that this general principle of sentencing should be departed from.
One objection against applying ss 57(1A) and s 57(1B) to each individual s 57(1)(e) offence is that the offender would be liable to a much heavier punishment than if just one sentence of caning or fine was imposed for cumulative s 57(1)(e) offences.
From a purposive and policy perspective, the rationale of ss 57(1A) and 57(1B) is to provide for strict penalties in dealing with offenders of immigration laws. Such policy and public interest is clear from the Minister`s speech at the Second Reading of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill on 4 September 1998 (col 930 and 932): 
 
Singapore is a small country with limited resources. The presence of illegal immigrants will pose a serious social and security problem, and compromise the safety and security of Singaporeans. We have therefore taken, and will continue to take, a tough stand against all immigration offenders - be they illegal immigrants, their smugglers, overstayers, or the harbourers and employers of such people - especially given the current regional economic situation.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
These enforcement measures must be backed up by tough laws and strict penalties for those who have committed offences ... the penalties for some offences need to be enhanced to enable us to effectively deal with the illegal immigrant problem ...
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
Employers of immigration offenders should also be severely dealt with. This is because if employers do not offer them jobs, illegal immigrants will not be attracted to come to Singapore.
 
 
 
Therefore, in line with the deterrent purpose of ss 57(1A) and 57(1B), employers of more than five immigration offenders at the same time should expect to face a harsh sentence for their aggravated offence. However, the court, in sentencing, has the discretion to vary the severity of the punishment imposed according to the circumstances of each case. In the case of s 57(1B), there is no minimum fine prescribed. As for s 57(1A), the maximum additional penalty is 24 strokes of caning. The prosecution may also in its discretion proceed on fewer s 57(1)(e) charges against the accused.
For the above reasons, I found that on a plain reading as well as a purposive interpretation of the provisions, ss 57(1A) and 57(1B) of the Act provide a punishment in addition to the sentence imposed on the appellant for each individual offence and not for his cumulative offences under s 57(1)(e). Therefore, in accordance with s 57(1B), I imposed a fine of $1,000 in addition to the appellant`s sentence of six months` imprisonment for each of his six offences under s 57(1)(e) with one month`s imprisonment in default of each fine.

: This appeal arose in relation to a warrant for dispossession obtained by the Collector of Land Revenue against the appellants, Abex Centre Pte Ltd, pursuant to ss 2 and 4(1) of the State Lands Encroachments Act (Cap 315) (the `Act`). The warrant for dispossession was obtained as the appellants were found to be in unlawful occupation of certain State lands, to wit, Lot 65 TS 19, on which stands a three-storey building known as No 2 Adis Road, Singapore 229974 (the `State land`).
The appellants filed a notice of appeal and petition of appeal against the issue of the warrant for dispossession. This appeal, however, was withdrawn on the day of the hearing. The prosecution sought costs under ss 262(1) and 401(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) and I ordered the prosecution`s costs in this appeal and in the court below to be borne by the appellants. I now give my reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The appellants entered into a tenancy agreement (the `agreement`) with the State in respect of the State land on 18 July 1998. Clause 1(1) of the agreement stated that the State land was to be held in accordance with the terms and conditions therein and subject to the provisions of the State Lands Rules 1993 (the `State Lands Rules`), including r 29(1), for a term of three years from 9 May 1998. Rule 29(1) states: 
 
The Collector of Land Revenue may at any time cancel or revoke any licence issued or terminate any tenancy agreement entered under these Rules.
 
 
 
From September 1998 onwards, the appellants fell into arrears of rental. The Collector of Land Revenue sent several letters of demand but the appellants still failed to settle the outstanding amount. On 9 March 1999, the appellants paid $50,000 of the outstanding amount. On the same day, the Collector of Land Revenue proposed an instalment scheme to settle the remaining amount but there was no response from the appellants.
On 22 March 1999, the Collector of Land Revenue issued a letter to the appellants together with a notice to remove. The letter stated: 
 
 
2 Clause 2(1) of the tenancy agreement you entered into with the Government of the Republic of Singapore for the State property at No 2 Adis Road requires you to pay the rental on a monthly basis. You, however, did not comply with this requirement and failed to pay up the rental arrears despite ample time being given to you to do so. 
 
3 I am to inform you that I have terminated the tenancy agreement with immediate effect. Notice is hereby given that you are required to vacate and deliver vacant possession of the premises at No 2 Adis Road to me within 1 month from the date of this letter. If you fail to comply, I will take out summons against you under the State Lands Encroachments Act (Cap 315) thereafter without further notice.
  
 
 
On 4 June 1999, a complaint was filed against the appellants under s 2 of the Act in order to obtain a warrant for dispossession under s 4(1) of the Act. As of 24 August 1999, a site inspection revealed that the appellants were still in occupation of the State land. As at 31 August 1999, the total outstanding amount owed by the appellants was $600,057.49.
On 8 September 1999, district judge Eddy Tham found that the agreement had been validly terminated under r 29(1) of the State Lands Rules. The appellants were thus in unlawful occupation of the State land. The district judge issued a warrant for dispossession against them under s 4(1) of the Act.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
On 17 September 1999, the appellants lodged a notice of appeal against the order of the district judge granting the warrant for dispossession. Thereafter, as the appellants did not apply for a stay of the warrant for dispossession pending the appeal, the State Lands Office obtained the warrant and served it on the appellants with 28 days` notice to vacate the State land. However, on 10 December 1999, just two days before the expiry of the 28 days` grace period, the appellants applied for and obtained a stay of execution of the warrant for dispossession pending the appeal. On 17 January 2000, the appellants filed their petition of appeal.
The appellants` case, essentially, was that in the light of cll 1(2) and 4(2) of the agreement, the district judge erred in holding that the agreement was validly terminated under r 29(1) of the State Lands Rules. The appellants contended that cll 1(2) or 4(2) should have applied instead of r 29(1) and that since the agreement was not validly terminated under cll 1(2) or 4(2), they were not in unlawful occupation of the State land. Clauses 1(2) and 4(2) provide: 
 
 
1(2) The tenancy may be terminated by either party on three (3) calendar months` notice in writing to the other party. Such termination shall be without prejudice to the rights and remedies of the Landlord against the Tenant in respect of any antecedent breach of this Agreement by the Tenant. 
 
4(2) Notwithstanding Clause 1(1) of this Agreement if the rent herein reserved or any part thereof shall remain unpaid for fourteen (14) days after becoming due (whether formally demanded or not) or if any of the conditions or stipulations herein contained on the Tenant`s part to be performed or observed shall not be so performed or observed ... then and in any such cases it shall be lawful for the Landlord at any time thereafter to re-enter upon the said property or any part thereof in the name of the whole and thereupon the tenancy hereby created shall absolutely determine but without prejudice to any right of action accrued to the Landlord in respect of any antecedent breach of this Agreement by the Tenant.
  
 
 
 
 
 Withdrawal of appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
On 11 March 2000, just three days before the hearing of the appeal, the prosecution received news that the appellants` counsel had been instructed to withdraw the appeal at the hearing. At the hearing, the appellants` counsel requested for leave to withdraw the appeal. The prosecution did not object to the appellants` request and I therefore granted leave to withdraw the appeal. The prosecution, however, proceeded to address the court on the issue of costs. After hearing arguments from both sides, I ordered costs of the appeal and costs below to be awarded to the prosecution.
 Costs 
 
 
 
Under s 262(1) of the CPC, this court has the power to order the costs of this appeal to be paid by or to the parties involved. Section 262(1) provides: 
 
The High Court shall have the full power in all proceedings under Part VII to award such costs to be paid by or to the parties thereto as the Court thinks fit.
 
 
 
This appeal falls under Part VII of the CPC.
Apart from the costs of this appeal, this court also has the power and discretion to award to the prosecution their costs incurred in prosecuting the appellants in the court below. Section 401(1) of the CPC provides: 
 
The court before which a person is convicted of any crime or offence may, in its discretion, make either or both of the following orders against him:
 
 
 
 
(a) an order for the payment by him of the costs of his prosecution or such part thereof as the court directs.
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
The principle governing the exercise of the court`s discretion under s 401(1) of the CPC was enunciated by this court in 
Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 930
  and affirmed in the recent case of 
Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 111
 . The principle warrants repetition here. In 
 Arts Niche Distribution Pte Ltd v PP 
 (supra at p 127), it was said: 
 
... The court has a wide discretion to order costs under this section (s 401(1) of the CPC). In exercising its discretion, the court is entitled to take all the circumstances into account, including the strength of the prosecution`s case, the accused`s knowledge of this, and his conduct of his defence. In particular, where the accused loses his case and the court is of the view that his defence has been conducted `extravagantly and unnecessarily`, he may be ordered to pay some of the costs which he has caused the prosecution to incur ( 
Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 930
  at 937). One way of determining whether the accused`s defence has been conducted `extravagantly and unnecessarily` would be to consider whether the line of defence mounted has advanced his case: 
Jasbir Kaur v Mukhtiar Singh
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 349
  ...
 
 
 
As for s 262(1) of the CPC, this court has held in 
Wee Soon Kim Anthony v PP
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 372
  and affirmed in 
 Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP 
 (supra) that the provision has been framed in very wide terms and leaves entirely to the High Court the question of costs of a criminal appeal under the CPC, and the manner in which such costs should be assessed. It was also held in 
 Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP 
(supra at p 127) that the principles governing the court`s exercise of its discretion under s 401(1) of the CPC are equally applicable.
It should be emphasised that although the strength of the defence, whether at trial or on appeal, is a relevant factor to be considered by the court in awarding costs, it is by no means conclusive. The important test is whether the accused had conducted his defence or appeal `extravagantly and unnecessarily`. In applying this test, the facts of the case, the strength of the defence and course of conduct of the defence must be closely scrutinised.
In this case, looking at the appellants` petition of appeal and their defence in the court below, it appears that the dispute turns on a single issue of law, ie whether the Collector of Land Revenue had legitimately exercised his power to terminate the agreement under r 29(1) of the State Lands Rules.
In my view, it was clear that the appellants` case, both in the court below and in this appeal, was devoid of merit. The agreement was expressly stated to be subject to the State Lands Rules and the termination under r 29(1) was thus lawful. It was plain to see that this was a straightforward summons case to which the appellants had no defence.
That was not all. In my mind, there was no doubt that the appellants had conducted their defence and appeal in an `extravagant and unnecessary` manner. In particular, the fact that the appellants instructed their counsel to withdraw the appeal just three days before the hearing showed that they were abusing the appeal system as a means of avoiding payment of rental and delaying eviction from the premises. The appellants had financially benefited from this delay as, pending the appeal, they had continued to stay on the premises as unlawful occupiers without paying rent to the Government. Further, they were sub-letting the premises and collecting rental from sub-tenants. The prosecution showed that the appellants had the financial resources to pay their rental as, at the relevant time, they were still conducting their business and collecting rental from sub-letting the premises.
In the circumstances, it was clear that the appellants were aware that they had no legal basis to justify their continued occupation of the premises. Thus, they should not have proceeded to challenge the prosecution in the first place on such unmeritorious grounds and their conduct of the defence and the appeal was `extravagant and unnecessary`. On the other hand, I was satisfied that the prosecution had, as far as possible, conducted their case in a reasonable and expedient manner.
For the above reasons, I ordered the appellants to pay the prosecution`s costs incurred in the court below under s 401(1) of the CPC and also the prosecution`s costs in this appeal under s 262(1) of the CPC. The parties will proceed to taxation to assess these costs.

(delivering the judgment of the court): These are four appeals against the interlocutory orders made by the High Court in the libel action, Suit 1323/98, taken out by SM Summit Holdings Ltd and its subsidiary, Summit CD Manufacture Pte Ltd, the plaintiffs, against seven defendants, Microsoft Corporation, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Autodesk Inc, Business Software Alliance, Stuart Ong, Lee Cross and Ronald T Eckstrom, the defendants. We shall continue to refer to the parties here as the plaintiffs and the defendants. The appeals arise out of the same facts, and it is convenient to deal with them together in this judgment.
The matters under appeal had their origin in a raid carried out by the defendants at the plaintiffs` premises on 12 August 1997 pursuant to two search warrants obtained by the defendants before a magistrate. These search warrants authorised representatives of the defendants to carry out a search at the plaintiffs` premises for alleged copyright and trade mark offences. In the course of carrying out the raid, the parties representing the defendants found that the two warrants did not authorise them to seize various documents and papers at the premises. For that reason, the fourth defendant, Business Software Alliance (`BSA`), on the same evening applied to a judge of the High Court and obtained a third search warrant, and acting on these warrants they seized and took away a large number of documents (and copies thereof) and other items. Immediately after the raid (`the Summit raid`), the defendants, on 13 August 1997, called a press conference and at the conference they published or caused to be published a press release which now forms the subject of the present libel action.
Soon after the Summit raid, the plaintiffs applied by way of criminal revision to the High Court to quash the search warrants. Almost simultaneously BSA applied by way of criminal motion for an order permitting their solicitors to take copies of the documents and requiring the plaintiffs to deliver further documents. Both the applications were heard before the learned Chief Justice, and at the conclusion of the hearing on 29 September 1997 the learned Chief Justice decided as follows: (i) he upheld the two search warrants issued by the magistrate but quashed the third search warrant granted by the judge of the High Court; (ii) he ordered all the documents (and copies) seized pursuant to the first two search warrants and all items seized pursuant to the third search warrant be returned to the plaintiffs, and (iii) he dismissed the application taken out by BSA: see 
SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 922
 .
Reverting to the present action, Suit 1323/98, the plaintiffs claimed damages against the defendants for libel contained in the press release published or caused to be published by the latter at the press conference held on 13 August 1997. After the commencement of the action, the plaintiffs applied for a determination of the meaning of the words complained of and also for summary judgment. The application was of course opposed by the defendants. Prior to the hearing of the application, the defendants filed their joint defence to the claim and pleaded, inter alia, justification and the meaning they sought to justified. They also filed affidavits in opposing the plaintiffs` application. At the hearing of the application, counsel for the plaintiffs raised a preliminary objection to the reference by the defendants, in the defence and affidavits, to certain documents and information, which were obtained by the defendants as a result of the Summit raid, on the grounds first, that there was an implied undertaking on the part of the defendants not to use those documents and information in unrelated civil proceedings, such as Suit 1323/98, and secondly, that by reason of the order made by the learned Chief Justice on 29 September 1997 (`the Chief Justice`s order`) the use of such documents and copies thereof and information derived therefrom was impermissible. The assistant registrar who heard the application overruled the objection, and determined that the words complained of bore the meaning as pleaded by the plaintiffs and gave leave to the defendants to amend the pleadings. Subsequently, the pleadings were amended. Against the assistant registrar`s decision both the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed to a judge-in-chambers, each appealing against that part of the decision that was against them. Three appeals were filed: one by the plaintiffs and two by the defendants, the defendants being in two groups, namely, the first, second, third and seventh defendants being one group, and the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants being the other group, each group being represented by separate firms of solicitors. The learned judge, after hearing the arguments, on 3 March 1999 affirmed the decision below and dismissed all the three appeals. Again, both the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed against the decision of the learned judge, and three appeals were filed, namely: CA 39/99 filed by the plaintiffs and CA 37 and 38/99 filed by the defendants (`the three appeals`).
While the three appeals were pending, the defendants on 5 July 1999 filed two applications for, inter alia, a further and better list of documents and specific discovery of certain documents from the plaintiffs, namely, Summons for Further Directions Entered 4236 and 4237/99. The two applications were filed by the parties as follows: one application by the first, second, third and seventh defendants, and the other by the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants; and both the applications were identical in all material respects. Among the documents sought were the following five categories of documents: 
(1) all the invoices, sales orders, delivery orders and/or correspondence of the second respondents, Summit CD Manufacture Pte Ltd (`Summit CD`), relating to the following persons or companies: 
(a) Hardware House Computer and Electronic Shop; and/or 
(b) Hardware House Computer Pte Ltd, and/or 
(c) Power Multivision; and/or 
(d) Ivan Yee Multi-vision; and/or 
(e) PLL Computer Trading; and/or 
(f) PT Tomato; and/or 
(g) PT Dynamitra 
(2) all documents generated during Summit CD`s CD ROM manufacturing process, namely: 
(a) sales orders (including those that had been cancelled on the grounds of copyright infringement and/or related problems); 
(b) work orders; 
(c) printouts; 
(d) records of incoming orders; and 
(e) other records maintained during the said manufacturing process, but not limited to: 
(i) order processing; 
(ii) pre-mastering; 
(iii) glass mastering; 
(iv) nickel plating; 
(v) polishing; 
(vi) re-cycling; and 
(vii) quality control checking 
(3) any and all reference documents used during the alleged root directory checks which are purportedly conducted by Summit CD`s personnel; 
(4) all documents relating to debts owed by the following parties, including but not limited to, sales orders and/or work orders and/or invoices and/or all correspondence from the respondents to the following customers requesting that payment of their debts be made and/or records of any payments received from the said customers: 
(a) Hardware House Computer and Electronic Shop; and/or 
(b) Hardware House Computer Pte Ltd, and/or 
(c) Power Multivision; and/or 
(d) Ivan Yee Multi-vision; and/or 
(e) PLL Computer Trading; and/or 
(f) PT Tomato; and/or 
(g) PT Dynamitra 
(5) all documents which support Summit CD`s annual turnover figures for the period 1995 to 1998.
Initially, there were other categories of documents sought to be discovered; however, these categories were later withdrawn pursuant to a court order to expunge all references to those documents from the cause papers in this suit.
Not to be outdone, the plaintiffs a few days later, on 9 July 1999, filed two applications, namely, SIC 4302 and 4303/99, seeking to strike out the defendants` two applications for discovery.
These are the four applications which ultimately give rise to the present appeals. All the four applications came on for hearing before the assistant registrar on 12 July 1999 and he allowed the defendants` applications for discovery and dismissed the plaintiffs` applications for striking out. In his view, the present defamation action was a `distinct and independent` action from the earlier civil suit brought by the BSA to enforce their intellectual property rights (Suit 1596 of 1997). Therefore, whilst the defendants may have been barred from using the improperly seized documents in that earlier suit, they were entitled under the rules governing civil procedure to apply for the necessary documents to defend this action. The applications for discovery were `not a collateral attack on a final decision nor [were they] an abuse of process of the court.` Further, the documents sought to be discovered were relevant, necessary and expedient to ensure a fair disposal of the matter and to save costs.
The plaintiffs appealed from the decision of the assistant registrar on the four applications. When the appeals came on for hearing before a judge in chambers, the three appeals were still pending before the Court of Appeal, and in view of that, the learned judge adjourned the hearing until the disposal of the three appeals. However, he expressed a tentative view that he was in broad agreement with the assistant registrar`s decision.
The three appeals were heard by the Court of Appeal on 18 August 1999, and its judgment was handed down on 21 September 1999. The court held as follows: first, the Chief Justice`s order prohibited the use of all documents and copies thereof obtained in those criminal proceedings, as well as the use of all information extracted from such documents, for any collateral purpose; secondly, aside from the Chief Justice`s order, there was an implied undertaking by the defendants that they would not use the documents or copies thereof obtained by them in those criminal proceedings in unrelated civil proceedings (`the implied undertaking`): see 
Microsoft Corp & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor and other appeals
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 529
 .
This court`s decision sparked off a flurry of activity on the part of the defendants. On 1 October 1999, they filed a number of new applications. First, there were applications to expunge various portions of the cause papers, affidavits, documents and submissions which had been filed in court. These applications were allowed on 13 October 1999 and the expunging exercise was completed on 4 November 1999. Secondly, they filed two applications in CM 6 and 7/99 for a variation of the Chief Justice`s order to the extent that the defendants be allowed to refer to and rely on the documents and information therein solely for the purposes of defending the present defamation action and also for a release from or a variation of the implied undertaking for the same purpose. While these applications were pending before the learned Chief Justice, the applications for discovery and striking out were restored for hearing before the learned judge on 5 October 1999. He allowed all the appeals of the plaintiffs with costs. In other words, he refused discovery and struck out the applications for discovery. In his grounds of decision, he said at [para ] 3: 
 
Learned counsel for the defendants did not submit that the Court of Appeal decision [in CA 37, 38 and 39/99] did not have the effect of binding me in the present matter to a decision in favour of the plaintiffs. For my part, I am satisfied that the effect of the decision of the Court of Appeal is clear, ie that the defendants are bound by an implied undertaking not to use the documents and information seized in the raid for any other purpose including their defence in this action. As the defendants are not permitted to use those documents for the purposes of their defence in the present action, they are not entitled to the order for discovery that they seek ...
 
 
 
Against this decision, the defendants now appeal to this court. Four appeals have been filed, namely, CA 176-179/99. In CA 176 and 178/99, the defendants appeal against the High Court`s decision disallowing the discovery of the documents sought on the ground of the implied undertaking, and in CA 177 and 179, they appeal against the court`s decision striking out their applications for discovery of documents.
In the meanwhile, on 27 October 1999, the defendants` applications in CM 6 and 7/99 for a variation of the Chief Justice`s order and for a release or variation of the implied undertaking were heard before the Chief Justice and were dismissed: 
Microsoft Corp & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 343
 . The defendants appealed and their appeals were dismissed by this court on 9 March 2000, on the ground that there was no appeal against such an order of the High Court and this court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeals: 
Microsoft Corp & Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor
 
 
[2000] 2 SLR 137
 .
 The appeals 
 
 
 
We turn first to the appeals against the decision below refusing the application for discovery, namely, CA 176 and 178/99. These appeals raise two questions: first, whether as a matter of principle the defendants have a right to discovery of any of the documents falling with the ambit of the Chief Justice`s order and/or the implied undertaking; and second, if the answer is in the affirmative, whether the defendants are entitled to the discovery of all or any of the documents sought. As for CA 177 and 179/99 which relate to the striking out applications, the question raised is whether it can be said that the applications for discovery were an abuse of process of the court, scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and that they might prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action. To some extent, the answer to this question depends on the outcome of CA 176 and 178/99.
 The defendants` case 
 
 
 
The defendants` case is that they first acquired information about the documents which they are now seeking discovery before the raid was carried out on the plaintiffs` premises on 12 August 1997. This information came from three sources. First, there was information from Pan Wen Hui (`Pan`), a former employee of the plaintiffs. Pan was employed by Summit CD Manufacture Pte Ltd (`Summit CD`) between 28 July 1995 and 12 September 1996. During this period, he worked at their premises at 45 Ubi Road 1, being engaged at various times in different stages in the manufacture of CD stampers. In his affidavit of 18 September 1998, he deposed to, inter alia, the following at [para ] 24: 
 
I also noticed that some of [Summit CD`s] Order sheets had customers such as `Ivan Yee`, `PLL`, `Power Multivision`, and `Hardware House` listed on them. These were some of the regular customers.
 
 
 
The second source of information came from another former employee of Summit CD, Shi Jian Chuan (`Shi`). Shi was employed by Summit CD from 25 April 1996 to 30 April 1997. He too worked at their premises at 45 Ubi Road 1, however, unlike Pan, Shi was employed in the CD replication division. Through Pan, Shi provided BSA with a list of some of the plaintiffs` customers, together with information about CD masters produced for those customers. According to a statutory declaration sworn by him on 24 July 1997, he had copied a list from a computer in the plaintiffs` premises in or about March 1997, which appeared to be a document comprising approximately 500 printed pages of information about orders made by various customers of the plaintiffs, including references to the following entities or persons: `Hardware House`, `Ivan Yee, `PLL`, `Power Multivision`. The list also provides the titles of various CD-ROMS which the plaintiffs allegedly replicated for these customers.
Finally, there was the information provided by a private investigator, Jimmy Chew Chong Poh. Chew was engaged by the BSA to verify their suspicions about the allegedly illicit activities of the plaintiffs. In a statutory declaration sworn on 30 July 1997, he said he brought eight counterfeit masters of CD-ROMS to the plaintiffs and invited them to replicate those masters, which they did.
Mr Elias, counsel for the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants, points out that the defendants have pleaded the information concerning the documents sought in their re-amended defence filed jointly by the defendants: see [para ] 8(2), 8(3)(i), 8(3)(ix) and 8(7) of the defence (as amended). Given that the defendants had information on the alleged software pirates before the Summit raid, and that the information has been pleaded, Mr Elias argues that the implied undertaking should not diminish or in any way affect the defendants` rights to discovery in these proceedings.
Mr Elias relies on 
Sony Corp v Time Electronics
 
[1981] 3 All ER 376
[1981] 1 WLR 1293
. In that case, the plaintiffs were manufacturers of cassette tapes. On evidence given in camera by the plaintiffs against the intended defendant (no writ had been issued yet), the court ordered the defendant forthwith, on service of the order, to disclose to the person serving the order the names and addresses of the defendant`s suppliers and to produce certain documents and to deliver up to him the apparently improper goods. The order was subject to undertakings by the plaintiffs, including an undertaking not without leave of the court to use any document or information obtained as a result of the execution of the order, save for the purpose of civil proceedings against the defendant in connection with the subject matter of the action. On visiting the defendant`s premises, the solicitor serving the order found out that not only goods of the type to which the order related, but also other goods of a type manufactured by the plaintiffs, which he thought might be counterfeit. The solicitor instructed an employee to make a test purchase of the goods, which was carried out and the goods so purchased turned out to be in fact a counterfeit. The plaintiffs therefore wanted to commence another action against the defendants in respect of these goods, and they applied for a second order similar to the first one. Goulding J held that the proposed new action was founded not on something the court had ordered to be disclosed in the earlier order but on evidence provided by the test purchase of the second type of goods, in respect of which there was only a collateral connection with the disclosure ordered by the court in the first order.
Turning to the Chief Justice`s order, Mr Elias submits that the learned Chief Justice in his judgment (in CM 6 and 7/99) in 
 Microsoft Corp 
 (supra) made it clear that his order does not prohibit the defendants from alluding to the existence of information and items which the raiding party saw or observed in the course of the raid. The learned Chief Justice said at [para ] 44: 
 
The Court of Appeal had held that, under the order of court, it was impermissible for the respondents to use the documents and copies and information derived therefrom in the summary judgment application. It was impermissible to 
 rely on those documents
 falling within the order of court. However the Court of Appeal had also held that the order of court did not prohibit the 
 existence
 of information and items which the raiding party saw or observed in the course of execution of the search warrants, or to what such party heard and said at the raid.
 
 
 
Counsel submits that in this application for discovery of the documents, the defendants are merely 
 alluding to the existence 
 of those documents.
In conclusion, Mr Elias argues that the defendants are, as a matter of principle, not barred from seeking discovery of the documents sought whether by reason of the Chief Justice`s order or the implied undertaking. Mr VK Rajah for the first, second, third and seventh defendants associates himself fully with the submissions of Mr Elias.
 The plaintiffs` case 
 
 
 
The plaintiffs` case is relatively straightforward. Mrs Teh, counsel for the plaintiffs, submits that this court (in CA 37, 38 and 39/99) in 
 Microsoft Corp v Summit Holdings 
 (supra) has confirmed the scope and effect of the Chief Justice`s order, and also held that the implied undertaking existed. In view of the Chief Justice`s order and the implied undertaking, there is no room for the defendants` applications for discovery. The applications are an attempt to circumvent both the Chief Justice`s order and the implied undertaking and therefore an abuse of process. For this reason, the registrar`s appeals were rightly allowed by the High Court.
Mrs Teh cites three cases in support: 
Reichel v Magrath
 
[1889] 14 App Cas 665
, 
Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police
 
[1982] AC 529
[1981] 3 All ER 727
 and 
Wright Norman & Anor v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd & Anor
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 710
 . The first two cases are authority for the proposition that where an issue has been fully litigated in a case, whether civil or criminal, it is an abuse of process to attempt to reopen it in subsequent litigation. This is simply the well known and accepted principle of res judicata. However, this principle has no application here. In particular, the question now before us was expressly left open in this court`s decision in 
 Microsoft Corp v Summit Holdings 
 (supra). We therefore do not find it necessary to consider these cases further.
The third case has but slight relevance. The facts were briefly these. In November 1987, a local newspaper reported on efforts of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd (`OCBC`) in recruiting four top executives. Later that month, one Norman Wright, in his capacity as managing director of an executive search firm, wrote a letter to the newspaper concerning the recruitment efforts of OCBC, which was subsequently published by the newspaper. OCBC complained that the letter was libellous and the newspaper published an apology drafted by the bank. Wright refused to apologise and the bank commenced an action against him (`the 1987 action`). Subsequently, Wright took objection to the published apology and commenced an action for libel against the newspaper and the bank (`the 1988 action`).
In the 1987 action, Wright applied for interrogatories to be served on OCBC, and also a further and better list of documents to be furnished by OCBC. Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was) refused the applications on the basis that they amounted to a fishing expedition. Subsequently, in the 1988 action, Wright applied for further and better particulars and discovery of particular documents. Karthigesu J (as he then was) held that the application for discovery was likewise a fishing expedition. However, he went on further to say that since the appeal in respect of the 1987 proceedings was pending and a similar application had been refused in the 1987 proceedings, it was not desirable to grant the application for discovery due to the close connection between the 1987 and 1988 proceedings. Wright appealed against both the decision of Chao Hick Tin JC and Karthigesu J and when the appeals on both cases came before the Court of Appeal, the court held that since both cases were `inextricably inter-twined`, to allow Wright discovery of the documents sought in the 1988 action would circumvent the order of court made by Chao Hick Tin JC in the 1987 action, and that was not permissible. The purpose of the two applications was identical, and to have allowed the second application would clearly have rendered nugatory the earlier court order refusing the first application. That clearly is not the position here.
The success of these appeals depends on the scope of the Chief Justice`s order and the implied undertaking. We now consider each of these in turn.
 Chief Justice`s order 
 
 
 
We turn first to the Chief Justice`s order. By this order the learned Chief Justice ordered the return to the plaintiffs of (i) all documents (and copies) seized under the third warrant; and (ii) all documents (and copies) seized under the first two warrants, namely, `the two production log-books for the incoming master recording, the log book on process for polishing, all sales orders, invoices, glass master order sheets, seven empty stamper boxes, the checking report book, and the list of Summit CD`s customers allegedly downloaded from the petitioners` computer server`. In 
Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 529
  we said at [para ] 18: 
 
The effect of such order is that all documents and matters falling within its ambit, including copies of such documents or matters, had to be returned to the plaintiffs. The defendants or any of them were prohibited from making copies of such documents or matters; any copies, if made, would come within the terms of the order and would have to be returned to the plaintiffs. It follows from this that, in effect, the defendants were not allowed under that order to use those documents and matters and copies thereof.
 
 
 
Later at [para ] 21 we said: 
 
That order of court, however, has no application to the existence of the information and items which the raiding party saw or observed in the course of the raid at the premises of the plaintiffs: see [para ] 47 of [the learned Chief Justice`s judgment in CM 21/98 [
[1999] 3 SLR 197
]]. Nor does it apply to what such party heard and said at the raid. As to how the defendants propose to prove such information or the items and whether such information and items are relevant are different questions altogether. They relate to admissibility and relevance of the evidence, if any, in relation to the information and items. To this extent, we accept the submission of Mr VK Rajah, counsel for the first, second, third and seventh defendants, that the order does not prohibit the defendants from using information obtained during the enforcement action.
 
 
 
The learned Chief Justice in CM 6 and 7/99 [

] also accepted this position: see [para ] 43 and 44 of his grounds of judgment.
It is important to appreciate that the primary purpose of the Chief Justice`s order was to remedy an improper seizure of documents by restoring to the rightful owner his title, possession and right of control over the documents. The learned Chief Justice in 
Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor v Business Software Alliance
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 197
  said at [para ] 48: 
 
Once there was an order of court ordering the return of the documents (and copies), it must follow that it was not open to BSA or its solicitors to reproduce the documents in their entirety and use them in civil proceedings. The purposes of the order of court were threefold: (1) as a remedy for the improper seizure of documents, the seizure being improper because they were either not covered under the two search warrants or were pursuant to a search warrant that was quashed for want of jurisdiction; (2) to protect the owner`s copyright in the documents; and (3) to restore the true owner`s title, possession and right of control of the documents.
 
 
 
It is implicit here that the reason why the defendants were not allowed to make use of these documents or take copies thereof was that none of them had any right to these documents (and copies thereof), and that the documents (and copies thereof) should not have been in the possession, custody or control of the defendants or any of them in the first place, and therefore the documents (copies thereof) should be restored to the true owner. That is the true purpose and scope of the order, and once this is appreciated, it becomes clear that it is not inconsistent with or in contravention of the Chief Justice`s order to allow discovery of the documents that had been returned to the plaintiffs, assuming of course, they are relevant to this suit. In the circumstances, in our judgment, the Chief Justice`s order does not affect the defendants` right to discovery of documents in this suit.
 Implied undertaking 
 
 
 
The difficulty in the way of the defendants` right to discovery is the implied undertaking which, as will be apparent in a moment, is wider in scope than the Chief Justice`s order. In 
Microsoft Corp v Summit Holdings Ltd
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 529
 , we said at [para ] 34 and 35: 
 
 
34 In this case, however, the documents and information obtained by the defendants pursuant to the search warrants taken out under the Criminal Procedure Code and the Copyright Act are not sought to be used by them in either criminal or civil proceedings in the enforcement of the defendants` intellectual property rights, as in 
 Ransome/Tempil 
. Such documents and information or some of them, at least, are now sought to be used by the defendants in civil proceedings, unrelated to the enforcement of their intellectual property rights. In these circumstances, it seems to us that the same considerations of public interests in the protection of privacy and confidentiality of documents and information and in ensuring full and frank disclosure of documents and information in the administration of justice, which are present in the application of the 
 Riddick 
 principle, should apply. The execution of the search warrants was a clear invasion of privacy and confidentiality and the justification for this was the requirement of full and frank disclosure for the purpose of administration of justice. But such disclosure is to be counterbalanced by the limitation on the use of such documents and information to the proceedings in the enforcement of the intellectual property rights, and this is achieved in the form of the implied undertaking imposed on the recipients. We can see no good reason, in principle, why such implied undertaking should not be imposed with full force on documents and information obtained pursuant to the search warrants issued under the Criminal Procedure Code and/or Copyright Act, as in the present case ... 
 
35 If the defendants had instituted civil proceedings to enforce their intellectual property rights and obtained, by the process of discovery, documents and information from the premises of the plaintiffs, the defendants would undoubtedly be subject to an implied undertaking not to use the documents and information for any purposes other than the proceedings in which the discovery was made. We can see no reason why they should not be subject to such implied undertaking merely because the proceedings they had instituted were criminal proceedings and not civil proceedings. In our opinion, the documents and information obtained by the defendants pursuant to the execution of the search warrants are subject to an implied undertaking analogous to that arising from discovery in civil proceedings, ie not to use the disclosed documents and information other than for the purpose of the proceedings in which the discovery was given.
  
 
 
The implied undertaking clearly affects the defendants` right to use the documents (and copies) and information, which they had obtained in or as a result of the Summit raid for the purposes of the present proceedings. In this connection, the prohibited information would include information gleaned or gathered from the documents disclosed as a result of the raid and also information which the defendants or their representatives gathered from what they had observed and heard at or during the raid. Both categories of information came about or were disclosed under the process of compulsion, ie the Summit raid pursuant to the search warrants. The case of 
Taylor & Anor v Director of the Serious Fraud Office
 
[1998] 4 All ER 801
[1998] 3 WLR 1040
, which we had discussed at great length in 
Microsoft Corp v Summit Holdings
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 529
 , starkly illustrates this fact. In that case, the plaintiffs` action was struck out on the basis of the implied undertaking not to use documents disclosed under compulsion in subsequent proceedings without the permission of the courts.
Mr Elias submits that the implied undertaking did not apply to information and items observed during the course of the Summit raid, presumably relying on what we said in [para ] 21 of our judgment in 
 Microsoft Corp v Summit Holdings 
 (supra), which we have quoted in [para ] 25 above. This submission is misguided. That passage was said with reference to the Chief Justice`s order and not with reference to or in the context of the implied undertaking.
In our opinion, in so far as the defendants had obtained any information as to the existence of any documents on the basis of the documents or information which the defendants obtained pursuant to the search warrants, they are clearly precluded from seeking discovery of those documents. We think that there can be no possibility of an application for their discovery on that basis. In our view, the protection provided by the implied undertaking would be illusory, if the defendants were able on that basis to obtain discovery of the documents. In 
Sybron Corp & Anor v Barclays Bank plc
 
[1985] 1 Ch 299
, 318, Scott J said: 
 
If the [implied] undertaking against improper use were to be limited to the documents themselves it would represent a worthless protection. Plainly, in my judgment, the undertaking must apply to the 
 information derived from the discovered documents
 whether it be information embodied in a copy or stored in the mind. Accordingly, references in this judgment to use of documents should be taken to include use of 
 information derived from the documents
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Hence, the defendants are precluded from seeking discovery of documents or categories of documents merely on the basis they had in the pleadings alluded to the existence of such documents, particularly when such pleadings were filed after the Summit raid. They must go further and show that they came upon these documents or categories of documents through means other than the Summit raid.
It follows that where the documents are sought by the defendants on the basis of information that was acquired independently of the Summit Raid, whether before or after raid, the defendants would clearly be entitled to apply for discovery of such documents. The reliance on such independent information does not in any way infringe the plaintiffs` right to privacy and confidentiality in the documents which the implied undertaking seeks to protect. The case of 
 Sony Corp 
 (supra) illustrates the point. It was there held by Goulding J that the second action against the defendant was not founded on what was disclosed in the first action, but on the test purchase which was made as a result of what the solicitor saw in the course of serving the documents on the defendants pursuant to an order of court in the first action. The learned judge said at p 1295: 
 
In my view I ought not to refuse the plaintiffs the relief they seek. The new action is not founded on something that the court ordered to be disclosed in the earlier order. The real foundation of the present action is the evidence obtained on the test purchase. The observation by the solicitor of suspect goods, of the second class, was a merely collateral matter in the execution of the order of 12 March and did not depend on that order for its justification. In other words a solicitor saw something that was there but it was not something that the court had ordered to be disclosed. He then obtained the evidence, which is sufficient in itself, by a test purchase.
 
 
 
We are therefore of the view that so long as the information as to the existence of any documents was obtained by the defendants independently of the Summit raid, the defendants are entitled to apply for discovery of documents based on such information.
It is part of the case of the defendants that they acquired the information of the documents they now seek discovery independently of the Summit raid. They rely on the evidence of Pan, Shih and Chew and say that they obtained the information from these persons: see [para ] 13-15 above. On the basis of these three sources of information they now seek discovery of the documents. In principle, we think that their case for discovery is well founded, and on that basis, they are entitled to apply for discovery of documents.
 The relevancy 
 
 
 
We now come to the documents the defendants seek from the plaintiffs. The question is whether the documents sought satisfy the test of relevancy. Before us, Mr Elias concedes that categories (2), (3) and (5) set out in [para ] 5 above are far too wide, and accordingly says that the defendants would be content with categories (1) and (4). His case is that the entities listed in these paragraphs were `known software pirates`, and obtaining documents relating to Summit CD`s involvement with them is therefore essential to sustaining their plea of justification. He relies principally on two authorities. First, 
Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Co
 
[1882-83] 11 QBD 55
, where Brett LJ laid down the following test: 
 
What are the documents which are documents relating to any matter in question in the action? ... the documents to be produced are not confined to those, which would be evidence either to prove or to disprove any matter in question in the action ...
 
 
 
It seems to me that every document relates to the matters in question in the action, which not only would be evidence upon any issue, but also which, it is reasonable to suppose, contains information which 
 may
 - not which 
 must
 - either directly or indirectly enable the party requiring the affidavit either to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary. I have put in the words `either directly or indirectly,` because, as it seems to me, a document can properly be said to contain information which may enable the party requiring the affidavit either to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary, if it is a document which may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry, which may have either of these two consequences ...
 
 
 
Mr Elias submits that the documents within categories (1) and (4) clearly satisfy this test.
The second authority is the recent case of 
McDonald`s Corp & Anor v Steel & Anor
 
[1995] 3 All ER 616
. That case concerned a libel action brought by the hamburger giant, McDonald`s, in respect of serious allegations by the defendants about the operation of their fast food restaurants, which allegations had been published in a leaflet and distributed in the United Kingdom. The defendants pleaded justification and fair comment in their statement of defence and in response to a number of interlocutory directions served better and further particulars of their defence. They sought further discovery from the plaintiffs, but their application was adjourned until both parties had served full statements of all witnesses upon whose evidence they intended to rely at trial. After service of the witness statements the plaintiffs applied to strike out certain parts of the defence and particulars of justification and fair comment. The judge ruled that he would decide the striking out application before considering the defendants` application for further discovery, on the basis that it would be an abuse of process to allow the defendants to put forward a plea of justification when they had no clear and sufficient evidence to support it in the hope that discovery would then force the plaintiffs to produce the necessary evidence which the defendants themselves lacked. The judge heard the application and made an order striking out substantial parts of the defendants` pleadings. The defendants appealed. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and held that a plea of justification was not required to be supported by `clear and sufficient` evidence before being properly placed on the record. Such a plea could be included in the defence so long as the following criteria were satisfied: (a) the defendants should believe the words complained of to be true, (b) the defendants should intend to support the plea of justification at the trial, (c) the defendants should have reasonable evidence to support the plea or reasonable grounds for supposing that sufficient evidence to prove the allegation would be available at the trial.
Mr Elias submits that the requirements set out above are satisfied on the facts. The particulars of justification state that Summit CD `habitually accepted, processed and delivered orders for stampers and CD-Roms` from the alleged software pirates. These particulars were pleaded on the basis of the information provided by Pan and Shi and were therefore well grounded. The defendants are therefore entitled to discovery of documents to substantiate what they have pleaded.
We are unable to accept this argument. Whilst the particulars of justification do clearly refer to dealings with the alleged software pirates, this alone does not give the defendants carte blanche to empty the plaintiffs` filing cabinets. In defamation actions, the 
 Peruvian Guano 
 principle is subject to the well established rule that a defendant is not permitted to mount a fishing expedition through the discovery process in the hope of finding something to justify his libellous words. The documents in category (1) are described as `All the invoices, sales orders, delivery orders and/or correspondence` of Summit CD relating to the alleged software pirates. That is a remarkably wide class of documents which would encompass any letter or note on any matter whatsoever between Summit CD and the alleged pirates. The lack of specificity in this regard can only lead us to infer that, in fact, the defendants have no knowledge of any particular transactions which would substantiate their plea of justification. That being the case, they are clearly trying to empty the cupboards in the hope of finding something to substantiate their plea. This amounts to a fishing expedition. We do not read 
 McDonald`s 
 case as saying that by merely pleading that a particular fact is true, a defendant in a libel action is entitled to obtain by discovery all the plaintiff`s documents to see whether there is anything in them to sustain the plea. All that case says is that a plea of justification will not be struck out before the trial on the basis that there is no `clear and sufficient` evidence to sustain it, as some previous authorities seemed to suggest. In any event, that case did not concern the issue of relevancy of the documents sought in discovery and is therefore of limited assistance to the defendants.
The description of the documents sought in category (4) is again far too wide and is susceptible to the same criticism In our judgment, this category of documents too must be disallowed.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
The defendants have a right to seek discovery of documents on the basis of the independent information which they have obtained. To that extent, the defendants succeed in CA 176 and 178/99. But the documents or the categories of documents sought by the defendants are much too wide and on that ground the applications for discovery would fail.
Now, the question is what order we should make. If we dismiss the applications, the defendants are, of course, at liberty to take out fresh applications for discovery and the applications will then traverse the usual path all the way from the assistant registrar level to this court, a process entailing considerable time and costs. We think that, in the circumstances, to save some time and costs below, we make the following orders with reference to the applications for discovery. First, we set aside the order of the assistant registrar, except that part of the order relating to the costs he awarded. We also set aside the order of learned judge below. Secondly, we remit the applications to the learned judge with liberty to the defendants to file: (i) a fresh list of documents or categories of documents (in substitution for the present lists) which they seek from the plaintiffs, and (ii) further affidavits, if they consider necessary, in support of the documents they wish to have discovery, bearing in mind what we have decided in relation to their right of discovery. Hopefully the defendants would in such event provide some specificity in the documents which they seek. The defendants are hereby given 21 days from the date hereof (or such extended time as the learned judge may permit) to file a fresh list, and further affidavits, if any, for consideration by the learned judge, and upon such documents being filed, or in default of such filing within the time sated, the applications for discovery be restored for hearing before the learned judge.
 Civil Appeals 177 and 179/99 
 
 
 
We now turn to CA 177 and 179/99 which are appeals against the order striking out the defendants` applications for discovery. We do not understand why the applications for striking out were made in the first place. First, as of the date when the applications for discovery were filed by the defendants they were clearly entitled as a matter of right to make the applications, as the court below had held that defendants were not precluded from relying on the documents they had obtained at the Summit raid. It may be that the classes or categories of documents which the defendants sought might be too wide but that per se would not warrant an application to be filed for striking out. Secondly, even if the defendants were not entitled to discovery of any of the documents sought, the appropriate stand for the plaintiffs to take was to ask for the applications to be dismissed. In our opinion, the applications for striking out filed by the plaintiffs are wholly unnecessary. A fortiori, since in principle there is no objection to the discovery applications, the striking out applications were clearly misconceived, and CA 177 and 179 are therefore allowed. We set aside the order made below and dismiss the plaintiffs` applications for striking out.
 Costs 
 
 
 
We now come to the question of costs. With regard to CA 176 and 178/99, since the defendants succeed in part, namely, on the issue as to their right to discovery, they should be entitled to some costs here and before the learned judge. We order that they should be awarded two-thirds of the costs before us and before the learned judge, but only one set of costs is allowed to the defendants. The order as to costs before the assistant registrar is to stand. The deposits in court as security for costs are to be refunded to the respective defendants or their solicitors.
Turning to CA 177 and 179/99, we award to the defendants the costs of these appeals and the costs before the learned judge, but only one set of costs is allowed. The deposits in court as security for costs in these appeals are to be refunded to the respective defendants or their solicitors.

(delivering the judgment of the court): This is an appeal against a decision of the High Court granting an injunction restraining the appellants from naming their retail business `Lifestyle 1.99` on the ground that it constituted a passing off of their business as and for the business of the respondents.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The plaintiff-respondents, S$1.99 Pte Ltd, are the owners of a chain of retail shops which operate under the style `ONE.99 Shop`, which name was registered with the Registry of Businesses on 1 December 1995. The respondents opened their first retail outlet with that name on 6 April 1997 at The Heeren, an upmarket shopping centre along Orchard Road. By the time of the trial, the respondents had opened a total of seven such outlets at various shopping centres all over the island, of which one was a franchised outlet. An important characteristic of the respondents` outlets is that all the goods sold in the outlets, ranging from Japanese snacks and other foodstuffs to cosmetics, fashion accessories, stationery, toiletries, common household products, plastic-ware and toys, are priced at a fixed price of $1.99.
The person behind the respondents is one Ms Nanz Chong, the Managing Director. She is a relatively well-known former-model-turned-entrepreneur. According to her, she first conceived the idea of a `one-price store` following her travel to Japan in the mid-nineties in the course of her work as a model when she noticed numerous stores there selling all items at one fixed price. She felt that this kind of a sales concept would catch on and be popular in Singapore. So for three years preceding the opening of the first store, she put in considerable effort sourcing for goods and preparing for the opening. The logo she chose for the shop consisted of the words `ONE.shop` written in black against a stark white background with the numbers `99` appearing in a larger, bold red-coloured font over the word `shop`.
Following the opening of the first ONE.99 outlet at The Hereen, the shop received immense publicity in the media, both in terms of news reports as well as feature articles. It seems to us clear that to a large extent this was due to Ms Chong`s own earlier fame as a fashion model. Another reason was obviously due to the fact that the articles sold at the shop were at a relatively cheap price of $1.99[cent ]. A bargain shop like this at an upmarket location was obviously something the public would be curious about. The shop was variously referred to by the media as the `$1.99 Shop`, the `1.99 Shop` and the `$1.99 Store` .
Ms Chong attributed the success of the shop to two factors: pricing policy and good service by her staff. `Service with a smile` is the respondents` hallmark and the respondents sought to drive home the point that you can obtain good quality goods at an upmarket location without paying for the sky.
From the volume of business done, it was clear that the venture was a success. During the first 11 months of business, from April 1997 to February 1998, the sales turnover amounted to slightly more than $3.5m. In the year ending February 1999, the turnover almost doubled to $6.9m. For advertising in 1997, they spent $23,000 while it was $29,000 for 1998. Although in absolute terms these advertising figures are not very large, they are no doubt significant when one bears in mind that we are here concerned with goods priced at only $1.99.
Turning to the appellants, they were incorporated on 8 September 1998. They are almost a wholly owned subsidiary of Rubber Band Enterprises Pte Ltd (`Rubber Band`), as only 1% of the shares are owned by another party. Rubber Band was itself incorporated in 1992 and has a paid-up capital of $4m. It is a major player in the toy industry, being the licensee or agent for various popular overseas brands of toys including Disney from America, and Sanrio, a toy and gift company from Japan.
In September 1997, Rubber Band started selling Sanrio products at various department stores at $1.99. This move was prompted by the sales strategy of a competitor who was then selling a certain range of Sanrio products at a standard price of $2. To match that, they decided to go for the price of $1.99 and had appointed a manufacturer in Hong Kong to supply them that range of products. According to the appellants, three factors contributed to their choosing the price of $1.99. First, it was then very much the market norm to retail goods at prices ending with 99[cent ] such as $1.99, $2.99 or $9.99. In the case of the Sanrio products in question, $1.99 was the most appropriate price after taking costs and profit margins into account. Secondly, `99` is auspicious because it can be translated to mean `everlasting` or `perpetuity` in Mandarin. Thirdly, the price $1.99 was more competitive than $2, which was the retail price adopted by the appellants` competitor. At the time `100 Yen` shops were very popular in Japan and Rubber Band was encouraged by that.
In 1998, Rubber Band adopted another strategy of holding joint promotional sales of products at $1.99 with the Watson`s retail chain. Between February and October 1998, more than 40 such joint promotions were held at various Watson`s outlets, raking in a total of more than $1m in sales. With the success of the Watson`s promotions, Rubber Band was subsequently approached by major department stores to hold similar `$1.99` sales promotions. Thus a joint promotion was held at Takashimaya`s `Talking Hall` from 31 July to 19 August 1998 and the sales generated came up to some $150,000. Joint promotions were also held with Daimaru, at both Junction 8 and Liang Court Shopping Centres locations. At the sites of these promotions, various posters and placards contained the figure `$1.99`, preceded by a clasped hand with its index finger pointing upwards. At the opposite end were several Japanese characters written vertically, which when translated meant `this is good`.
While promotional sales were successful, because of the low profit margin for retailers, few of them were willing to enter into long-term partnership with Rubber Band. Thus Rubber Band felt it could no longer just concentrate on distribution and wholesale. There was a need for it to actually go into retail. Furthermore, the continued holding of such ad hoc promotional sales with others posed a severe strain on its limited manpower. The appellants were, therefore, incorporated to function as the retail arm of Rubber Band. They decided to start with the $1.99 retail concept as it was something they had been doing with the various department stores since 1997, and for which they had ready products and suppliers.
The appellants also explained why their name bears the word `Lifestyle`. They said that from February 1997 Rubber Band had used the slogan `A leading 
 Lifestyle 
 creator` on posters to promote the toys and household products which they distributed. A director of Rubber Band, one Mr Ong Choon Seng, who coined the slogan, felt that since toys, household items and gifts would always be a part of our lifestyle, by bringing these products into the lives of Singaporeans, Rubber Band was thereby `creating a lifestyle`. As such, it was thought desirable to have the word `lifestyle` as part of the subsidiary`s name in order to give the subsidiary a common identity with the parent company. As it was also important that the name of the new company should be reflective and descriptive of the business of selling products at a fixed price of $1.99, the appellants` retail outlets were and are therefore called `Lifestyle 1.99`. The appellants said the `$` sign was omitted from the name as just `Lifestyle 1.99` was easier to pronounce. The clasped hand with the index finger pointing up was similarly discarded in favour of a simpler new logo which consisted of the word `
 Lifestyle 
` above the number `1.99`, all of which were printed in a distinctive white-coloured font against an oval-shaped cyan-coloured background.
However, not all the goods sold at each `Lifestyle 1.99` outlet were priced at $1.99. This was because in each outlet, there were `Premium Counters` where products were sold at prices other than $1.99, such as $3.99, $4.99 and the like. These premium products were generally products distributed by Rubber Band to other retailers but they cost more than $1.99. As a concession to the customers of `Lifestyle 1.99`, these products were offered to them at highly discounted prices. The appellants said that the number of `premium items` for sale in any outlet was highly insignificant when compared with the number of `$1.99` items and none of the premium items cost more than $10.
On or about 18 February 1999, the respondents` solicitors, M/s Drew & Napier, sent a letter to the appellants stating that the respondents had acquired goodwill in the name `ONE.99` and demanded that the appellants cease the use of the name `Lifestyle 1.99`, as the latter is confusingly similar to the name `ONE.99`. The appellants did not comply. Thus the institution of this action by the respondents.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
At the hearing below, the learned judge granted an order restraining, inter alia, the appellants from passing off their business as and for the business of the respondents, and from misleading the public into thinking that the appellants were in some way connected or associated with the respondents.
The learned judge found that the name `ONE.99` is a fanciful one as it is pronounced as `One Point Nine Nine`, which has nothing to do with the price of the products sold at $1.99. He further found that in the light of the wide extent of media publicity concerning the ONE.99 Shop and the large sales turnover for the period of over one and a half years (until the incorporation of the appellants), the respondents had demonstrated that they had acquired goodwill in the name `ONE.99` and its variants `1.99 Shop` and `$1.99 Store`. He felt that part of the respondents` goodwill came from a combination of factors, namely, selling quality products at the fixed price of $1.99 in a trendy and upmarket setting. In his view, there must inevitably be confusion if both shops were referred to as the `One Point Nine Nine Shop`. He felt that the prefix `Lifestyle` to the appellants` outlets made no difference as the appeal of the name lay in `One Point Nine Nine`. The learned judge further thought that the appellants` choice of `1.99` as part of their name was influenced in part by the success of the respondents` ONE.99 shops.
On the question of damage, the learned judge found that there was sufficient evidence to show that many of Ms Chong`s customers had mistaken the appellants` shop for hers. A survey conducted by Asia Market Intelligence (S) Pte Ltd showed that 48% of the 300 persons sampled thought that `ONE.99` and `Lifestyle 1.99` were connected or associated with each other. While the learned judge recognised that evidence of confusion is not necessarily evidence of damage he held that `in the circumstances of this case ... there were, in all probability, instances of diversion of business, borne from confusion, and that, is clearly damage.`
 The appeal 
 
 
 
It is trite law that for a plaintiff to succeed in an action for passing-off three elements must be proved: (i) goodwill in a business, (ii) misrepresentation, namely, passing off one`s goods or services as the goods or services of another, and (iii) damage: see 
Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc & Ors
 
[1990] 1 All ER 873
 per Lord Oliver at 880. The issues raised in this appeal touch on all three elements and they are: 
(a) whether the respondents had by 9 September 1998, the date on which the appellants commenced trading, acquired sufficient goodwill in their business in association with the use of the name `ONE.99`; 
(b) whether the use by the appellants of the name `Lifestyle 1.99` was a misrepresentation to the public that they were in some way connected with the respondents or their business; and 
(c) whether as a result, damage had been caused to the respondents.
 Goodwill 
 
 
 
What is goodwill? We can do no better than cite the oft-quoted passage of Lord Macnaghten in 
IRC v Muller & Co`s Margarine Ltd
 
[1901] AC 217
 at 223
-224: 
 
It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old-established business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates.
 
 
 
Ordinarily goodwill is acquired by trading. It is inseparable from the business to which the goodwill relates. Again in the words of Lord Macnaughten at p 223: 
 
Goodwill has no independent existence. It cannot subsist by itself. It must be attached to a business. Destroy the business and the goodwill perishes with it though elements remain, which may perhaps be gathered up and be revived again.`
 
 
 
There is common ground between the parties that the respondents must show they had acquired goodwill on the date on which the first `Lifestyle 1.99` shop opened for business, namely, 9 September 1998 (the relevant date). On this issue, the appellants` bone of contention is that the learned judge did not correctly appreciate the term `goodwill` as he used the expression `goodwill in the name` throughout his judgment. The appellants submitted that this is a serious error as it wrongly assumes that the cause of action is based on the protection of a name. To substantiate this criticism, counsel for the appellants cited 
 Wadlow on the Law of Passing Off 
 (at p 45): 
 
The right of property protected by the action for passing-off is the goodwill of the plaintiff`s business as a whole. Passing-off does not directly protect names, marks, get up or other indicia.
 
 
 
However, having perused the judgment as a whole, it seems to us clear that the learned judge was conscious that `goodwill` relates to business even though he had in various places referred to `goodwill in the name`. We think what the learned judge wanted to do, perhaps not entirely accurately, was to use that phrase as a short form to encapsulate the idea of `goodwill in a business as represented by the name ONE.99`. This can be seen from the factors he considered in determining whether the respondents had acquired sufficient goodwill in the business to sustain a passing-off action.
As indicated earlier, during the period of one and a half years of trading before the appellants set up their first outlet, the respondents enjoyed a huge turnover in their business: $3.5m for the first 11 months and $6.9m for the next 12-month period. Bearing in mind that the price of each item was only $1.99, this would represent a very large number of customers who had patronised the respondents` shops. In our view that would be evidence of goodwill. Even the appellants have to admit, and to quote from their case, `the respondents` business turnover is relatively substantial which is indicative of the existence of at least some goodwill in the business.`
The huge customer base which the respondents had built up in that one and a half year period was no doubt due to a combination of factors: the advertising impact, the media coverage, both in terms of news report as well as special articles, the cheap but yet relative good quality goods sold therein and the friendly service rendered by their sales staff. As this court had ruled in 
CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 550
 , advertising and media publication can help a business to acquire goodwill. The results of the survey conducted by Asia Market Intelligence which showed that some 48% of the 300 persons interviewed were aware or had heard of the ONE.99 Shop and at least 40% of the interviewees were aware of the shops` locations demonstrated that the business of ONE.99 was known fairly widely. This is quite understandable bearing in mind that at the time the respondents` outlets were the first and only shops selling goods at the fixed price of $1.99.
In the result we agree with the learned judge that the respondents had on the relevant date acquired goodwill in the business bearing the name `ONE.99`, which was a business of a retailer selling miscellaneous goods at a fixed price.
 Fancy or descriptive? 
 
 
 
We now turn to the second element, the question of misrepresentation. What the respondents` assert to be the distinction of their business is in their name `ONE.99`. They say that the appellants by using the name `Lifestyle 1.99` are representing that the two businesses are related. In this connection, the question of whether the name `ONE.99` is fancy or descriptive is highly critical. It is on this aspect that the appellants argued very strenuously that the learned judge had gone wrong when he held that the name is a fancy one. They contended that the judge applied the wrong test in determining the question when he said: 
 
In my view, the fundamental test to be applied in determining whether a name is a descriptive or fancy name is to see what ostensible meaning the name conjures in the context of its business.
 
 
 
The law treats quite differently the name or mark of a business depending upon whether the name or mark is descriptive or `fancy`. In 
British Vacuum Cleaner Co v New Vacuum Cleaner Co
 
[1907] 2 Ch 312
 at 321, Parker J said: 
 
... I think a distinction must always be drawn between cases in which the word in question, the word which it is proposed to restrain the defendant from using is a word of ordinary use, descriptive of an article, and cases in which the word complained of more or less, partakes of the character of a `fancy word`, or primarily, does not relate to the article but to the person who makes the article.
 
 
 
A name or mark which is prima facie descriptive will only be protected if it can be shown to have acquired a secondary meaning, namely, it has become distinctive of the plaintiff`s business. `Distinctive` is a term of art in the law of passing-off and bears a meaning at variance with that in everyday use. In relation to a name or mark, it denotes the goods of the plaintiffs to the exclusion of other traders. 
 Wadlow on The Law of Passing Off 
 (at pp 391-392) describes how a mark/name is to be categorised, and the consequences flowing therefrom, as follows: 
 
A fancy word is one which has no obvious relevance to the character or quality of the goods or business in relation to which it is used, such as 
 Eureka
 for shirts, 
 Clock
 for an hotel or 
 June
 for toiletries. It is `of an arbitrary and fanciful nature` in that context. Whether a word is fancy or descriptive may depend on how it is used. 
 Health
 may plausibly be called a fancy word in respect of fishing gear but not for cocoa. The significance of the difference is that distinctiveness is very much more easily acquired for fancy words, and it is inappropriate to speak of secondary meaning when the word has no primary meaning to displace. However, the decision to categorise a word as fancy or descriptive is only one part of the wider issue of whether there is a material representation to restrain. Inherent ability to distinguish is always a matter of degree with there being a continuous spectrum between the highly fanciful and the obviously descriptive. Wherever the name may fall on that range, what matters is whether the name is distinctive in fact.
 
 
 
We note that while the learned judge felt that `ONE.99` qualifies as a fancy name, he recognised `there is a connection between ONE.99 and the business of selling goods at $1.99.` But he added that the connection was not straightforward. The reason he came to that conclusion was because he thought there was `sufficient novelty and features in the idea for it to qualify as a fancy name.` He also noted that while numbers may `connect, indicate, and represent ideas, ... it is straining the language to say that they ""describe"".` The judge further said: 
 
The name `ONE Point Nine Nine` as is read and pronounced does not immediately lead one to think of the shop as a $1.99 Shop. The connection becomes obvious after a while and therein lies the sublety that makes it, in my view, a fancy name, ... The omission of the $ sign in both cases is thus significant. In the (respondents`) case it shears the descriptive character from the name.
 
 
 
With respect to the learned judge we think the name `ONE.99` is quite clearly descriptive, bearing in mind the business that is carried out in the respondent`s outlets, namely, the selling of goods at $1.99`. He recognised it as much, though he said that it only becomes obvious `after a while`. Ms Chong tried to explain that she chose the name `ONE.99` because it was `magical`. We are unable to follow that. Furthermore, in court, she added that `99` also meant `everlasting` in Mandarin. This may well be so. But `ONE.99` or `1.99` must obviously have come from the fact that she intended to sell the things in her shop at the price of $1.99. We cannot accept that `ONE.99` was arbitrarily chosen. The link is clear. We also do not think that `ONE.99` or `1.99` will, in oral conversation, be referred to as `One point ninety-nine.` More likely than not, the `dot` will be omitted. Let us illustrate. If one were to buy an article at say $2.99, and if one were to be asked how much it costs, the answer that any person would normally give would be `two ninety-nine`, omitting the dot, as well as the $. It is wholly unreal to suggest that the `dot` would be pronounced.
In this regard, we think the case 
McCain International Ltd v Country Fair Foods Ltd
 
[1981] RPC 69
 is quite instructive. There the plaintiffs had introduced potato chips cooked in an oven and called them `McCain Oven Chips`. The defendants sold `Country Fair Oven Chips` and `Birds Eye Oven Chips`. The Court of Appeal held that there was no arguable case of passing-off against the defendants and that the name `oven chips` was descriptive of the product; it was not a fancy name. The plaintiffs sought to argue that the two words were `an ungrammatical aggregate of two English nouns and that it was nonsensical without an explanation.` This was how Templeman LJ dealt with the argument: 
 
But in my judgment the words `oven chips`, grammatical or not, constitute an expression which is an ingenious and apt description of the contents, namely, potato chips prepared for cooking in the oven; and although the consumer may not have been aware, and could not have been aware of what the expression meant until oven chips came on to the market, once they had come on the market he could recognise a name which is apt and appropriate to describe a produce rather than a manufacturer, the product being potato chips prepared for cooking in the oven. The fact that the name `oven chips` does not indicate that the chips may also be grilled is neither here nor there. The name does inform the consumer of what is inside the package so that he may know what he is purchasing.`
 
 
 
In 
Horlick`s Malted Milk Co v Summerskill
 
[1916] 33 RPC 108
, the plaintiffs manufactured a food preparation which they sold as `Horlick`s Malted Milk`. The defendants sold a food preparation under the name `Headley`s Malted Milk`. The plaintiffs brought a passing off action and sought to restrain the defendants from using the words `Malted Milk`. The Court of Appeal, agreeing with Joyce J, held that those were descriptive words meaning milk to which malt had been added or applied and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to restrain the defendants from using the descriptive words to identify their products.
A case which shows that the court would treat words as descriptive notwithstanding deliberate alterations made to them so that as spelt there are no such words in the English language is 
Ancona Printing Ltd v Kwik-Kopy Corp
 
[1973] CPR (2d) 122
. In 
 Ancona Printing 
 the plaintiff for some 13 years carried on business of copying and duplicating documents under the style `Kopy Kwik Printing` and sought to restrain the defendants who were in the business of printing written material from using the name `Kwik-Kopy Printing`. Both were operating in the same area in Kitchener, Ontario. Notwithstanding evidence of confusion, the High Court refused to continue the ex parte injunction. While `Kopy Kwik` are not English words (presumably intended to be a fanciful expression of `copy` and `quick`), White J held that `Kopy-Kwik Printing` was a descriptive expression.
Reverting to our instant case, we have no doubt that once the public realise that the goods sold in the ONE.99 outlets are all fixed at a price of $1.99, it does not require much imagination to appreciate that the name `ONE.99` is intended to inform all consumers that the goods sold therein are so priced. It, therefore, is descriptive.
 Secondary meaning: distinctiveness 
 
 
 
Of course the fact that a name is descriptive does not mean that it could not become distinctive although it would be difficult. It would appear that the only case which held that a descriptive term had become distinctive of the plaintiffs is the early case of 
Frank Reddaway & Co v George Banham & Co
 
[1896] AC 199
 where the term was held to have acquired a secondary signification. There the plaintiffs succeeded in establishing that between 1879 and 1891 the term `camel-hair belting` had acquired a secondary meaning. Lord Herschell said (at p 213) that the term `did not convey to persons dealing in belting the idea that it was made of camel`s hair, but that it was belting manufactured by the plaintiffs.` It seems to us that the court in 
 Reddaway 
reached that conclusion due in no small part to the fact that there was a letter which on the face of it not only showed a dishonest intent on the part of the person who was proposing to use the term `camel`s hair belting` but also contained an admission that such a secondary or subsidiary meaning did exist.
In contrast, in 
Cellular Clothing Co Ltd v Maxton and Murray
 
[1899] AC 326
, the plaintiffs invented a fashion suitable for shirting and underwear woven in a particular manner and had marketed it for ten years under the name `cellular cloth`. The defendants sold cotton and woollen goods which they recently described as `cellular`. The House of Lords held that the word `cellular` was an ordinary English word which appropriately and conveniently described the cloth of which the goods sold by the plaintiffs were manufactured. Lord Halsbury said, at p 336: 
 
where you are dealing with a name which is properly descriptive of the article the burden is very great to shew that by reason of your using that name descriptive of the article you are selling, you are affecting to sell the goods of somebody else ... under ordinary circumstances it would be very difficult to establish ...
 
 
 
Lord Shand, commenting on 
 Reddaway 
, said at p 340: 
 
Of that case I shall only say, that it no doubt shews it is possible where a descriptive name has been used to prove that so general, I should rather say so universal, has been the use of it as to give it a secondary meaning and so to confer on the person who has so used it a right to its exclusive use or, at all events, to such a use that others employing it must qualify their use by some distinguishing characteristic. But I confess I have always thought, and I still think, that it should be made almost impossible for any one to obtain the exclusive right to the use of a word or term which is in ordinary use in our language and which is descriptive only - and, indeed, were it not for the decision in 
 Reddaway
`s case, I should say this should be made altogether impossible.
 
 
 
As would be apparent from the opinion of their Lordships quoted above, when a descriptive name is used, a very great burden is placed on a plaintiff to prove that the name has acquired a secondary meaning. All the more so where a descriptive name is put to an invented article (or as in the case here of a term to indicate a new sale concept at a fixed price of $1.99), the problem of proving secondary meaning will be further compounded and the reason for that is, and here we will quote Lord Davey in 
 Cellular Clothing Co 
 (at pp 343-344): 
 
... that where a man produces or invents, if you please, a new article and attaches a descriptive name to it - a name which, as the article has not been produced before, has, of course, not been used in connection with the article - and secures for himself either the legal monopoly or a monopoly in fact of the sale of that article for a certain time, the evidence of persons who come forward and say that the name in question suggests to their minds and is associated by them with the plaintiff`s goods alone is of a very slender character; for the simple reason that the plaintiff was the only maker of the goods during the time that his monopoly lasted, and therefore there was nothing to compare with it, and anybody who wanted the goods had no shop to go to, or no merchant or manufacturer to resort to except the plaintiff.
 
 
 
This opinion of Lord Davey expressed in 
 Cellular Clothing Co 
 was applied by Parker J in 
 British Vacuum Cleaning Co Ltd 
 (supra) where he held that no secondary meaning was proved in respect of the descriptive words `vacuum cleaner`. This was how he further elucidated the point (at p 325): 
 
I think that the evidence itself - what there is of it - really points to the fact that the public have understood `vacuum cleaner` and the `vacuum cleaning process` to be a description of a particular kind of cleaner and a particular process, a cleaner, namely, which operates by means of a nozzle applied to the furniture and the suction in the pipes caused by the vacuum created by the machine. As long as the plaintiff company was the only manufacturer who manufactured and dealt with and went from house to house with a machine of that sort, no doubt in the mind of the public there would be a connotation of the fact that the machine was the machine of the plaintiff company. But I do not think that primarily the words have ever been in the mind of the public anything else than descriptive words, and, if that be so, then it appears to me that the case falls for this purpose within what was said by Lord Davey, namely, that no great inference can be drawn from the fact that during the period when the patentee has had a monopoly, or the manufacturer has had a monopoly, either at law or in fact, words primarily descriptive of an article have become associated with the patentee or manufacturer. 
 There is nothing, and there was nothing, as he said, for the public to contrast it with, so that it is impossible to say that the public understood by those words a machine dealt in or brought round by any one person or company as distinguished from any other person or company.
` [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In the light of the authorities above, it is clear that where the name of a business is descriptive and it is the first of such business, it is difficult to show distinctiveness in the sense we have indicated earlier. Furthermore, when descriptive words are used, a slight difference between the names would suffice to distinguish them. This is illustrated in 
Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminster Window & General Cleaners Ltd
 
[1946] 63 RPC 39
 where both the plaintiffs and the defendants carried on the business of office cleaners, the former under the style `Office Cleaning Service` since 1930 and the latter `Westminster Office Cleaning` since 1933, which the defendants changed in 1942 to `Office Cleaning Association`. The plaintiffs sought to restrain the defendants from using the latter style on the ground that it was likely to cause confusion. The plaintiffs admitted that they had no monopoly in the two words `Office Cleaning` and that these two words had not acquired a secondary meaning so as to be distinctive of them. The High Court granted relief to the plaintiffs. This decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal which held that as the words here were clearly descriptive, and in the absence of fraud, a slight difference in the titles of the plaintiffs and the defendants would be a sufficient distinction. The Court of Appeal decision was upheld by the House of Lords. Lord Simmonds who delivered the leading judgment for the House said (at p 43): 
 
It comes in the end, I think, to no more than this, that where a trader adopts words in common use for his trade name, some risk of confusion is inevitable. But that risk must be run unless the first user is allowed unfairly to monopolise the words. The court will accept comparatively small differences as sufficient to avert confusion.
 
 
 
Some other cases where the same principle was applied were 
 British Vacuum Cleaner Co Ltd v New Vacuum Cleaner Co Ltd 
 (supra), 
 McCain International Ltd v Country Fair Foods 
 (supra), 
Burberrys v JC Cording & Co Ltd
 
[1909] 26 RPC 693
 (concerning slip-on coats) and 
Deane v Schofield
 
[1962] RPC 179
 (involving `The Under Six Club` and `The Over-Six Club`).
Reverting to the case in hand, and having considered the evidence, firstly, we do not think there was really any design on the part of the appellants to take an unfair advantage of the name `ONE.99` or `1.99`. As indicated before, the appellants` parent company had been engaging in ad hoc promotional sales of products at $1.99 from September 1997. Secondly, as the name `ONE.99` or `1.99` is in the circumstances descriptive, the measures which the appellants had taken to distinguish the two businesses, `Lifestyle 1.99` compared with `ONE.99 shop`, are adequate. The respondents cannot claim a monopoly to the concept of selling goods at a fixed price of $1.99 which would be the case if no others are allowed to use `1.99`. The additional word `Lifestyle` should suffice to differentiate. And when we take into account the fact that the colour scheme of their outlets, as well as their logo, are clearly different from those of the respondents, all the more so we do not think there could be any reasonable probability of deception.
On the respondents` part they relied on the Canadian case 
Joseph v Lee
 
[1984] 78 CPR (2d) 159
 to argue that a name or mark in figures could acquire distinctiveness. There, the plaintiff was carrying on coin-operated games business as `501 Video`. Subsequently, the defendants commenced a similar business under the style `501 Arcade`. The defendants also selected free game cards of the same colour and conformation as free games cards issued by `501 Video`. An injunction against the defendants was issued by the County Court of Frontenne, Ontario. From the report, it seems to us that the learned judge did not draw any distinction between a fancy name and a descriptive name. He said that `501 Video` constituted `a sufficient descriptive term or trade name as to cause them to be distinguishing words`. None of the issues referred to in 
 Office Cleaning Services 
 were considered. It seems to us that the case could perhaps be justified on the ground that `501` was really fanciful, as it had nothing to do with coin-operated video games. Further, in 
 Joseph v Lee 
 there was clear evidence that the defendants there intended to deceive.
It is not in dispute that `figures` could be distinctive, as decided in 
Hymac Ltd v Priestman Brothers Ltd
 
[1978] RPC 495
 where the plaintiffs who were manufacturers of excavators made excavators known as the `580` series. This figure was derived from the capacity of the particular excavation bucket used on such machines which was five-eights of a cubic yard. The defendants also began to market an excavator using the figure `580` for identification. The defendants claimed that they were only using a number which had descriptive connotation and which anyone could use. The defendants could not show that `580` was derived from the capacity of their bucket. From the reasoning of Walton J what comes across is that he did not think that the figure `580` could be descriptive. We are fortified in this view by the following utterances he made: 
 
... given a number and nothing else it is quite impossible for anybody to deduce if that number refers to weight, bucket capacity or indeed engine power`. [At p 497.]
 
 
 
even if it is known that the number refers to bucket capacity, that bucket capacity may be cubic yards, cubic metres, or litres. Even if that was known that is still not the end of the matter because the various manufacturers use various conventional multipliers. Insley use 1000, Menck use 100, Hitachi use 10 and Poclain use 10. There is absolutely not that kind of consistency which enables one to say from the number what it is about and what it means at all. Even if one does know that it refers to bucket capacity one is just as wise as ever.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
whatever sensible multiplier you use you cannot get five-eighths from 580.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
Once one realises that the interpretation of the number 580 requires the kind of key that it does require, a key to be supplied by the plaintiffs, one wonders, why 580 was used by the defendants at all. I have seen nothing in the case to cause me to cease to wonder at that.` [At p 498.]
 
 
 
Of course 
 Hymac 
 was a case concerning the issue of an interlocutory injunction. As the court held that the plaintiff had shown there was a seriously arguable case for passing off and `conceivably fraud`, relief was granted.
The Scottish case 
PC Products Ltd v Wilfred Doulton
 
[1957] RPC 199
 can also be distinguished on the ground that the mark was clearly fanciful. There the plaintiff manufactured a cleaning preparation known in the trade as `one thousand and one` and sold in bottles bearing a label on which were prominently displayed the figures `1001`. The defendant put on the market another cleaning preparation in bottles, also prominently displaying the figures `1001`. An injunction was granted against the defendant.
Slazenger & Sons v Feltham & Co
 
[1889] 6 RPC 531
 should similarly be distinguished because the use of the words `The Demon` on a tennis racquet must clearly be fanciful.
Perhaps, to the perception of some, what the appellants had done amounted to riding on the favourable publicity generated by Ms Chong and her company on the new sales concept. While the law of passing off is adaptable to changing trading practices, there is no tort of unfair competition. The case 
Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd
 
[1981] 1 All ER 213
[1981] 1 WLR 193
[1981] RPC 429
 provides a useful illustration. There, the plaintiffs launched a lemon drink (`Solo`) with a publicity blitz. The defendants then launched a lemon drink (`Pub Squash`) with a get up and advertising theme closely resembling those for Solo. The Privy Council upheld the decision of the court below which dismissed the plaintiffs` claim for injunction and damages. The Privy Council held that the defendants had sufficiently distinguished their goods from those of the plaintiffs to prevent any likely confusion from arising. While in the court below an argument based on unfair competition was raised, it was not raised before the Privy Council.
In the result, we do not think that the respondents have shown that there has been any misrepresentation. We noted the evidence relating to the survey results show that there were members of the public who thought the two businesses were related. But in the nature of things some such misconception would be inevitable when you have two businesses adopting a similar descriptive term as a part of their names. Given a little time the public will be able to distinguish, now that the two businesses are operating side-by-side. Otherwise, it would amount to granting a monopoly to the person who happens to use that descriptive term first.
In the light of our views above on the second element to establish the tort of passing-off, we do not think it is necessary for us to consider the third element relating to damage.
 Judgment 
 
 
 
In the premises, we would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the court below and dismiss the respondents` claim. The appellants shall have the costs of the action below as well as this appeal. The security for costs shall be refunded to the appellants or their solicitors.

: The appellant was convicted on the following charge in the district court by Kow Keng Siong: 
 
You, Andy Lim Sin Han M/22 yrs NRIC No 7724864/A are charged that you, being a full-time national serviceman in the Singapore Civil Defence Force and subject to the Civil Defence Act (Cap 42), whilst having been notified to report for duty at PSA Pasir Panjang Worksite, Singapore, did from 12 August 1996 to 20 October 1999 fail to attend at your place of duty without leave, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 48(1) of the said Act.
 
 
 
The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The appellant was a full-time national serviceman in the Singapore Civil Defence Force. Accordingly, he was subject to the Civil Defence Act (Cap 42).
On 19 January 1996, the appellant was told to report for his national service duty at the Pasir Panjang Worksite, Jalan Bahar Camp, Singapore, with effect from 19 January 1996 until further notice. The appellant reported for his duty from 19 January 1996 until 11 August 1996. After that, he failed to report for duty at the designated place of duty from 12 August 1996 continuously without leave until the day he surrendered to the police on 21 October 1999.
During the period of absence between 12 August 1996 and 20 October 1999, a period of three years, two months and nine days, the appellant did not have a legitimate reason or any medical exemption to justify his absence.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The trial judge found the appellant guilty on the charge and convicted him accordingly.
The appellant raised several factors in mitigation in the district court. First, he informed the court that he did not have any criminal antecedent. He had also pleaded guilty. Further, he said that, at the time of the offence, he had to work to support his child, who had turned two years old by the time of his conviction. He had also surrendered himself to the authorities and accordingly he pleaded for leniency.
The trial judge did not accord significant weight to the fact that he was a first offender in view of the observations in 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
  and 
Xia Qin Lai v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 343
  at [para ] 27. As stated in 
 PP v Tan Fook Sum 
 at [para ] 32: 
 
... it may be said that the weight to be given [to the fact that the respondent has no previous conviction] would be greater if there were positive evidence as to character rather than the negative inference from the absence of allegations of other convictions. Contrariwise ... being of good character is irrelevant as a mitigating factor but relevant as an aggravating factor in that the offence is so much greater because the offender should have known better.
 
 
 
Accordingly, the fact that the appellant had no previous conviction was not considered a relevant mitigating factor.
However, the trial judge considered the appellant`s plea of guilt and his surrender to the police to be in his favour in determining the sentence as these factors were indicative of genuine remorse on his part.
As regards the appellant`s contention that he had committed the offence to support his child, the trial judge did not think that this was a mitigating consideration at all. National service liability is mandatory for all eligible Singapore citizens. National service is about one`s duty to the country, and about placing the nation`s interests above one`s own. It would be unfair to all national servicemen who diligently perform their national service at a personal sacrifice to themselves and their families if the appellant`s contention was accepted as a valid mitigating factor.
The trial judge also felt that there was a serious public interest involved in this case. At [para ] 8 of his judgment, he said: 
 
[b]eing absent without leave from national service is undeniably a serious offence. By committing an offence under s 48(1) of the Civil Defence Act, the offender has acted irresponsibly, shirking his fundamental obligation to his country, to which he owes his citizenship and allegiance. Such conduct is prejudicial to the interests of the State as the offender`s absence potentially compromises the overall effectiveness and discipline of his unit. The adverse impact of the criminal act is made all the more significant when one considers the fact that the offender is part of a unit that provides an essential public service, in this case the Civil Defence. To treat such an offender leniently would be to send a wrong message to young men about to be enlisted for, or already serving their national service.
 
 
 
Accordingly, the trial judge felt that the public interest required that the appellant should not be treated leniently, especially since his period of absence was substantial.
The trial judge also referred to the case of 
 PP v Chia Kok Hua 
 (MA 531/92/01) in determining the length of the sentence to be imposed on the appellant. In 
 PP v Chia Kok Hua 
, the respondent was convicted of the offence of desertion under s 24 of the Civil Defence Act and the offence of being absent without leave under s 48 of the Act. The respondent was eventually sentenced to one year`s imprisonment and three months` imprisonment respectively. The trial judge felt that 
 PP v Chia Kok Hua 
 was instructive as it demonstrated that a significant custodial sentence would be imposed where an offence under s 48 of the Act had been committed. It was noted that in 
 PP v Chia Kok Hua 
, the respondent was given a custodial sentence that was about half the period of his absence.
Having considered all the above factors, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to 18 months` imprisonment, which was about half the period of his absence.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant filed an appeal against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly excessive.
The appellant stated that the trial judge had failed to take into account the fact that the appellant was a first time offender and the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. He also contended that the trial judge had failed to direct his mind adequately or at all to the fact that the appellant was charged with the offence of failing to attend at the place of duty without leave under s 48(1) of the Civil Defence Act, and not the offence of desertion under s 24 of the Act. Finally, the appellant contended that the trial judge had failed to consider the fact that he stayed away in order that he could work to support his wife and child.
In my opinion, there was no merit in the appellant`s submissions on appeal. It was clear from the decision of the trial judge that the mitigating factors advanced by the appellant had been carefully considered and weighed by him. The fact that the appellant was a first offender was not considered a relevant factor in the light of the observations in 
 PP v Tan Fook Sum 
 (supra) and 
 Xia Qin Lai v PP 
 (supra) at [para ] 27. Further, the trial judge had adequately considered the fact that the appellant was charged with the offence of being absent without leave under s 48(1) of the Act and not the offence of desertion under s 24 of the Act. The trial judge`s decision did not reveal any confusion on his Honour`s part in this respect.
I gave careful consideration to the appellant`s contention that the trial judge failed to consider the fact that he was absent from work because he wanted to work and support his wife and child as this contention raised an issue of public importance.
 Public interest 
 
 
 
The trial judge held that the fact that the appellant stayed away from work to support his family did not carry any weight in mitigation. This was because the public interest involved in national service required that servicemen be prepared to subordinate their personal interests to the interests of the State.
I did not think that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly excessive. National service is vital to the security of Singapore and it necessarily entails sacrifices by national servicemen and their families. In order to safeguard the security interests of the State, everyone who is required by law to do national service must obey and carry out the lawful orders given to him. If the courts were to sympathise with the personal difficulties of every national servicemen, the overall effectiveness and efficiency of civil defence or the Singapore Armed Forces would be severely compromised. The deterrence of the individual offender, and others who might be tempted to commit the offence, is therefore necessary to advance the public interest involved in cases such as the present one.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In my view, the sentence of 18 months` imprisonment imposed by the trial judge was appropriate in the light of the relevant mitigating considerations, the public interest involved and the substantial period of absence during which the appellant failed to attend to his place of duty without leave. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal against sentence.

: This was an appeal by the Public Prosecutor against the decision of District Judge Hoo Sheau Peng acquitting and discharging the respondent on three charges of receiving information communicated in contravention of s 5(2) of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213) (`OSA`) for want of a prima facie case. After hearing the submissions of both the DPP and counsel for the respondent, I allowed the appeals earlier this morning and remitted the case to the district judge for further inquiry. I now give my reasons for my decision.
 The charges 
 
 
 
The respondent was tried on the following three charges: 
 
First charge - DAC 36389/99
 
 
 
You, Heah Lian Khin (Male/42 years/NRIC No S1004602E) are charged that you, on or about 17 October 1998, in Singapore, received from one Tay Boon Hian, a Corporal of the Singapore Police Force and attached to the Secret Society Branch, information relating to raids to be conducted on the 17 October 1998 by the said Secret Society Branch, having reasonable ground to believe that, at the time you received it, such information was communicated to you in contravention of the Official Secrets Act, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(2) and punishable under s 17(2) of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213).
 
 
 
Second charge - DAC 36391/99
 
 
 
You, Heah Lian Khin (Male/42 years/NRIC No S1004602E) are charged that you, on or about 21 November 1998, in Singapore, received from one Tay Boon Hian, a Corporal of the Singapore Police Force and attached to the Secret Society Branch, information relating to raids to be conducted on the 21 November 1998 by the said Secret Society Branch, having reasonable ground to believe that, at the time you received it, such information was communicated to you in contravention of the Official Secrets Act, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(2) and punishable under s 17(2) of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213).
 
 
 
Third charge - DAC 36393/99
 
 
 
You, Heah Lian Khin (Male/42 years/NRIC No S1004602E) are charged that you, on or about 29 November 1998, in Singapore, received from one Tay Boon Hian, a Corporal of the Singapore Police Force and attached to the Secret Society Branch, information relating to raids to be conducted on the 29 November 1998 by the said Secret Society Branch, having reasonable ground to believe that, at the time you received it, such information was communicated to you in contravention of the Official Secrets Act, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(2) and punishable under s 17(2) of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213).
 
 
 
 
 
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
 
 
The prosecution adduced undisputed evidence showing that Cpl Tay Boon Hian (`Cpl Tay`), who was named in the charges in question, was posted to the Secret Society Branch, (`SSB`) at the material time. Since October 1998, SSB had been actively conducting police operations involving raids in Geylang and had been investigating the activities of a loan shark, Chua Tiong Tiong, also known as `Ah San` or `Ah Long San` (`Ah San`).
The prosecution adduced evidence showing that a confidential order would generally be put up by SSB before each operation. The confidential order contained information pertaining to, inter alia, the date and timing, and the objective of the operation. A confidential pre-operation briefing would also be conducted for officers, touching on the contents of the confidential order and the places to be covered during the operation. SSB officers who were not involved in the operation, and members of the public, were not allowed to attend the briefings or to receive information revealed at such briefings. By the same token, officers attending the briefings were not allowed to disclose to any members of the public the contents of the briefings.
On 17 October 1998 and 21 and 29 November 1998, SSB conducted operations in the Geylang area. Cpl Tay participated in the operations on 17 October 1998 and 29 November 1998 and attended the relevant pre-operation briefings. Cpl Tay was not involved in the operation held on 21 November 1998; hence he was not authorised to attend or to receive the information revealed during the pre-operation briefing.
 Evidence of Cpl Tay
Cpl Tay was the principal witness for the prosecution. Cpl Tay testified that the respondent was known to him as `Ah Boy` and was one of his sources. He got to know the respondent in 1996 and 1997 and they subsequently became close friends. At the material time, Cpl Tay was aware that the respondent knew Ah San and that Ah San had business dealings in Geylang.
Cpl Tay testified that he was involved in a night operation conducted by SSB on 17 October 1998 and had attended a pre-operation briefing at about 8.30pm. During the briefing, he was informed of the general area which his team would be covering but he could not recall whether precise locations were mentioned. While travelling in a van after they moved out for the operation at about 8.45pm to 9pm, his team leader informed them of the rough areas which would be covered, including Geylang and Aljunied.
According to Cpl Tay`s testimony, he called the respondent at about 9pm, in response to the latter`s page, after he had moved out of the van. The respondent asked him where he was and enquired if he was free for coffee. He informed the respondent that he could not as he was `having operations`; he also told the respondent that he was `somewhere in Geylang`.
Cpl Tay was not involved in the operation conducted on 21 November 1998. At about noon on that day, he came to know from his colleagues that an operation was to be conducted that night. He could not recall: whether he spoke to or informed the respondent on 21 November 1998 about the operation which was to be conducted that night; and whether Chua or the respondent paged for him that day.
Cpl Tay agreed that he was involved in an SSB operation on 29 November 1998 and attended a pre-operation briefing. He could not recall whether the areas targeted for operation were mentioned at the briefing. His team leader informed them that they were heading for Geylang only after they had moved out for the operation at about 9.15pm. Specifically, Cpl Tay claimed that he could not recall: whether he spoke with the accused after he moved out for the operation; whether he called the respondent before 9.15pm; whether he told the respondent that SSB was conducting a raid that evening; and whether he told the respondent that SSB would be conducting a raid with the anti-vice and Gambling Suppression Branch in the Geylang area that evening.
In addition, Cpl Tay claimed not to be able to recall: whether Ah San called him in October 1998 to find out why there were so many raids by SSB in Geylang; whether he said that SSB was targeting Ah San; whether the respondent asked him if he could provide tip-offs of raids to Ah San; whether he promised to try to do so. Cpl Tay agreed however that it would undermine SSB operations if he informed the respondent of pending operations in the Geylang area.
 Prosecution`s attempts to admit Cpl Tay`s previous statement in writing
Cpl Tay had given a statement to CPIB Senior Special Investigator Tin Yeow Cheng on 25 May 1999 and 26 May 1999 which had been recorded pursuant to s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (`PCA`). In it, Cpl Tay related a detailed account of the surrounding circumstances and the events of 17 October, and 21 and 29 November 1998. These included conversations between Cpl Tay and Ah San and the respondent at the end of October 1998 during which the respondent asked Cpl Tay to provide tip-offs of impending raids in the Geylang area as well as Cpl Tay`s promise to try and provide such tip-offs. The statement also related how Cpl Tay contacted and conveyed information on impending raids to the respondent on the material dates in question. Finally, the statement explained that Cpl Tay provided tip-offs to the respondent because of their friendship.
In light of Cpl Tay`s oral testimony, the prosecution sought to impeach his credit with his previous statement in writing (marked for identification as exh P7I); and to admit it as substantive evidence pursuant to s 147(3) Evidence Act (Cap 97) (`EA`). The DPP later abandoned this application when he was not able to locate authorities supporting his submission that a witness`s inability to recall the material events fell within s 147 EA.
The DPP next sought to refresh Cpl Tay`s memory by referring to this statement pursuant to s 161 EA. Cpl Tay admitted that he gave a statement to the CPIB and confirmed that his signature appeared at the end of the statement exh P7I. Nonetheless, he maintained that he could not recall the events described therein; neither did he affirm that exh P7I was an accurate record of his statement to the CPIB. Subsequently, Cpl Tay claimed that he could not remember giving the statement to the CPIB. In the course of the DPP`s cross-examination, the district judge disallowed questions which sought explanations for the contents of the statement. She held that proceedings under s 161 EA were confined to refreshing the witness`s memory and confirming the matters contained in the statement; these questions were thus a backdoor and improper way of cross-examining Cpl Tay on the statement .
The DPP next applied to admit exh P7I pursuant to s 147(3) EA. The defence objected, arguing that s 147(1) envisaged a situation where the testimony of a witness was clearly opposite to the contents of his previous statement in writing, and not where the witness simply stated that he was unable to recall the material events. As regards Cpl Tay`s oral evidence of the events of 17 October 1998, the defence submitted that this only contained minor differences in phraseology and did not amount to material contradictions. In the event, the district judge disallowed the prosecution`s application.
At this juncture, the DPP resorted to s 45A EA. On 18 November 1998, about one month prior to the trial, Cpl Tay pleaded guilty to and was convicted, inter alia, of one charge of communicating information to the respondent in contravention of s 5(1)(d)(i) OSA (DAC No 35628 of 1999). The subject matter of the charge mirrored the first charge against the respondent. In addition, Cpl Tay consented to two other charges of communicating information to the respondent in contravention of s 5(1)(d)(i) OSA to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (DAC Nos 35629 and 35631 of 1999). The subject matter of those two charges mirrored the second and third charges against the respondent. The district judge allowed the application and admitted the record of proceedings, which included the charges and statement of facts, into evidence (exh P8). The pertinent part of the statement of facts read: 
 
Sometime in October 1998, Chua Tiong Tiong contacted the accused and asked him why the SSB had conducted so many raids against his lounges. The accused then informed him that the SSB were targeting him.
 
 
 
Subsequently, the accused was approached by Heah Lian Khin, an accomplice of Chua Tiong Tiong. Heah asked the accused if he could provide tip-offs regarding impending police raids to Chua Tiong Tiong. The accused agreed to do so, and was told to pass such tip-offs either to Heah or directly to Chua Tiong Tiong.
 
 
 
On 17 October 1998, at about 8.30pm, the accused attended a briefing conducted by one ASP Adrian Quek Sei Wei of SSB, on a raid to be conducted in the Geylang area that evening. However, the accused was not told of the specific place that would be raided.
 
 
 
After the briefing, the accused contacted Heah and informed him that the SSB would be conducting a raid in the Geylang area later that evening.
 
 
 
The information which ASP Quek had given to the accused regarding the raid was information which had been entrusted in confidence to the accused by ASP Quek, who was a person holding office under the Government within the meaning of s 5(d) of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213).
 
 
 
Cpl Tay confirmed that he pleaded guilty to the charge of communicating information to the respondent in contravention of the OSA but repudiated the statement of facts. He was advised to plead guilty and had simply wanted to get the matter over with. As such, when he admitted to the statement of facts, its contents had not mattered to him.
At this juncture, the DPP again attempted to admit exh P7I, this time relying on ss 24 and 159 EA. Both applications were disallowed by the trial judge on the basis that they were inapplicable.
Having failed in his attempts to cross-examine Cpl Tay on his previous statement in writing, the DPP closed the prosecution`s case after putting to Cpl Tay that he had wilfully and deliberately chosen not to remember the facts within his knowledge and that he lied when testifying that he was not able to recall the events of 21 and 29 November 1998.
 The decision of the district judge 
 
 
 
The critical aspect of the district judge`s decision was her refusal to allow the prosecution to cross-examine Cpl Tay on his previous statement, exh P7I, pursuant to s 147(1). She first examined the regime and history of s 147 EA and concluded that s 147(3) EA, which was introduced in 1976, had changed the law concerning the effect of previous inconsistent or contradictory statements by admitting them as evidence of facts stated therein. In her view, this formed inroads into the basic principle prohibiting the admission of a witness`s former out of court statements as substantive evidence. This meant that the use of s 147 EA should be carefully circumscribed.
The district judge ruled that there were no serious discrepancies or material contradictions between Cpl Tay`s oral evidence and exh P7I in relation to the surrounding circumstances and events of 21 and 29 November 1998 for the following reasons: 
 
... The terms `contradiction` and `discrepancy` carry their plain and ordinary meanings. According to the 
 New Oxford Dictionary of English
, a contradiction means `a combination of statements, ideas, or features of a situation which are opposed to one another` while a discrepancy is `an illogical or surprising lack of compatibility or similarity between two or more facts`. Accordingly, s 147 of the EA is resorted to when a witness gives version A in a statement and then version B to the court, with serious or material differences in these accounts. Where a witness states in court that he does not remember the events, he has not given version B to the court. Prima facie, there could not be said to be any contradictions or discrepancies as there was simply no account of the event before the court. Moreover, when a witness is unable to provide an account to the court due to a lapse in memory, the situation is chronologically consistent in that court proceedings take place after the recording of statement. It would be futile to cross-examine such a witness under s 147(1) of the EA as his explanation, if any, would be that he cannot remember the events.
 
 
 
I appreciate that it could well be that a witness such as PW 3 is simply being evasive. In this scenario, a party calling the witness would be keen to admit his previous statement s 147(3) of the EA so that the contents would supplement the paucity of evidence in court. However, I was not persuaded that the words `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement` should be strained to cover a situation where a witness does not give an account to the court, even if the witness is deliberately refusing to remember. Based on the foregoing, in relation to the surrounding circumstances, the events of 21 and 29 November 1998, there were no serious discrepancies or material inconsistencies.
 
 
 
The district judge next compared Cpl Tay`s account of the events of 17 October 1998 with his earlier account contained in exh P7I (at para 60(a)) and ruled that they only contained minor inconsistencies and discrepancies. Accordingly, she did not allow the prosecution to cross-examine Cpl Tay on that portion of exh P7I pertaining to the events of 17 October 1998.
At the close of the prosecution`s case, the district judge held that the prosecution had not adduced any evidence against the respondent on the second and third charges. In her view, the only evidence came from DAC Nos 35629 and 35631 of 1999 in exh P8 which were taken into consideration for sentencing. The charges however did not contain any evidence showing that the respondent had reasonable grounds to believe that such information was communicated to him in contravention of the OSA. Neither did they throw any light on the exact information communicated or the surrounding circumstances in which such information was communicated on 21 and 29 November 1998.
Turning to the first charge, the district judge examined the statement of facts contained in exh P8 and Cpl Tay`s testimony in court. She noted that the information communicated to the respondent on 17 October 1998 was in very general terms without any specifics in terms of location, time or purpose; it was also communicated in the course of a normal conversation. In her view, the sum of the evidence did not show that the respondent had any reasonable grounds to suppose that the information was protected information, communicated in breach of the OSA.
Accordingly, the district judge acquitted the respondent of all three charges at the close of the prosecution`s case without calling upon him to enter on his defence.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Whether exh P 7I admissible pursuant to s 147(3) EA
 
The thrust of the DPP`s appeal hinged on his submission that exh P7I should have been admitted for the purposes of cross-examination or impeachment pursuant to ss 147(1) and 157(c) EA and as substantive evidence pursuant to s 147(3) EA. It is established law that, for proceedings under ss 147(1) and 157(c) EA, the court must first find that there are serious discrepancies or material contradictions between the witness`s oral testimony and his version contained in a prior statement in writing before it grants leave for the proceedings: 
Muthusamy v PP
 
 
[1948] MLJ 57
 , 
Somwang Phatthanasaeng v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 850
  and 
Lim Young Sien v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 257
 .
The district judge`s reasons for not allowing the prosecution to cross-examine Cpl Tay on exh P7I in relation to the surrounding circumstances and the events of 21 and 29 November 1998 are set out above. Before me, the DPP argued that the phrase `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement` could also encompass a situation where the witness deliberately refused to give an account to the court. Counsel for the respondent on the other hand associated himself with the trial judge`s reasoning; he argued that, since Cpl Tay had not testified to the facts, he had not provided any affirmative version in court which could be considered to be contradictory.
 The meaning of `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement`
This ground of appeal raised an important question of law as to the ambit of s 147(3) EA. For convenient reference, the relevant provisions are set out below: 
 
Section 147 EA
 
 
 
 
(1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined, without such writing being shown to him or being proved; but if it is intended to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him. 
 
(2) If a witness, upon cross-examination as to a previous oral statement made by him relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined and inconsistent with his present testimony, does not distinctly admit that he made such statement, proof may be given that he did in fact make it; but before such proof can be given, the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular occasion, must be mentioned to the witness, and he must be asked whether or not he made such statement. 
 
(3) Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of those proceedings be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.
  
 
 
Section 157 EA
 
 
 
The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him:
 
 
 
 
(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted.
  
 
 
The phrase `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement` is not defined in the EA. At the outset, I noted that the terms are ordinarily defined as follows: 
 
 
 Contradictions
 - a combination of statements, ideas or features of a situation which are opposed to one another: 
 New Oxford Dictionary of English
 
 
 
- a statement containing propositions one of which denies or is logically at variance with the other: 
 The Oxford English Dictionary
 Vol III (2nd Ed, 1989)
 
 
 
 
 Inconsistent
 - ... not agreeing in substance, spirit or form; not in keeping; not consonant or in accordance; at variance, discordant, incompatible, incongruous: 
 The Oxford English Dictionary
 Vol VII, (2nd Ed, 1989)
 
 
 
The DPP submitted that the phrase `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement` need not be restricted to a situation where the witness gives two substantive opposing version of events. He contended that, when a witness failed to give a version which was materially similar to his previous statement, that per se constituted a materially inconsistent testimony. He argued that, when a witness had given a detailed account of events in a previous statement, the implicit idea or feature of that statement was that he remembered the events and was able to provide an account of it. If the witness subsequently claimed that he was unable to remember the events stated in his previous statement, even after it was shown to him to refresh his memory, this was a `combination of ideas or features of a situation that were opposed to one another`. The DPP further argued that when a witness had provided a detailed account of events in a previous statement but subsequently, without any reason, gave testimony which did not agree `in substance, spirit or form` with the previous statement, the previous statement constituted a materially inconsistent statement.
I found the DPP`s submissions to be of merit. There was, in my view, support for adopting a flexible as opposed to a rigid, semantic interpretation of the phrase `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement`. In discussing s 145 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872 which is in pari materia with s 147(1) EA, the learned authors of Chief Justice 
 M Monir`s Principles and Digest of the Law of Evidence 
 (8th Ed), citing 
 Wigmore on Evidence 
 at [sect ] 1010, commented at p 1566: 
 
... There must be a real inconsistency between the two assertions of the witness. The purpose is to induce the tribunal to discard the one statement because the witness has also made another statement which cannot at the same time be true. Thus, 
 it is not a mere difference of statement that suffices; nor yet is an absolute oppositeness essential
; it is an inconsistency that is required. 
 Such is the possible variety of statement that it is often difficult to determine whether this inconsistency exists. ... As a general principle, it is to be understood that this inconsistency is to be determined not by individual words or phrases alone, but by the whole impression or effect of what has been said or done. On a comparison of the two utterances, are they in effect inconsistent? Do the two expressions appear to have been produced by inconsistent beliefs?
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
I was in full accord with the above observations. Indeed, in practice, there could be a wide variety of statements; an absolute oppositeness was not essential. In my view, the court had to compare the oral evidence and the previous statement and to assess the overall impression which had been created as a whole. The critical question was whether the two utterances, even if one was the utterance that `I can`t remember`, were in effect inconsistent and appeared to have been produced by incompatible beliefs.
American jurisprudence, however, seems to support the interpretation adopted by the district judge. It is stated in 98 
 Corpus Juris Secundum (A Complete Restatement of the Entire American Law) 
 at [sect ] 583 that: 
 
 
 A prior statement of a witness, in order to be provable for the purpose of impeachment, must be contradictory to, or inconsistent with, his testimony in some degree; and if such contradiction or inconsistency does not appear, the prior statement is properly excluded
. Whether such inconsistency actually exists should be determined not from single or isolated answers, but from the testimony of the witness as a whole; and the questions of contradiction is whether or not the proffered statement and the testimony of the witness lead to inconsistent conclusions, indicating that the differing expressions of the witness appear to have been based on incompatible beliefs.
 
 
 
 
 Accordingly, statements of the witness with respect to matters as to which he has not testified cannot be shown
; ... Where a witness has testified to certain facts, he may not be impeached by proof of prior statements that he did not remember such facts; and 
 where a witness merely states that he does not remember, he cannot be impeached by the showing of former statements with respect to the facts which he claims not to remember
, and the same principle applies where, at a trial, a witness professes lack of knowledge as to a particular matter. [Emphasis added.]

It is crucial to note that none of the cited decisions contained an analysis of the phrase `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement`. The decision in 
 Click v Commonweath 
 was underpinned by the Kentucky Court of Appeal`s concern over the admission of prejudicial evidence (at p 205): 
 
We think it is perfectly obvious that 
 the real objective of the Commonwealth`s attorney and the real purpose of the seven `impeaching witnesses`, was not to impeach Lloyd Click, but to prove by indirection that Ray Click had fired the fatal shot
. The purpose was to put in Lloyd`s mouth words Lloyd was unwilling to use on the trial, which would have the effect of establishing Ray`s guilt.
 
 
 
In 
 Maddox v Commonwealth
 311 Ky 685, 225 SW 2d 107, 108, after receiving a number of `I don`t` know` answers from an evasive witness, the Commonwealth`s attorney questioned her about some positive statements she allegedly had made to him before the trial, and he later took the stand himself and testified that she had made such positive statements. In holding this to be prejudicial error, the court said:
 
 
 
 
 `If the testimony is merely negative or the witness fails to make the statements which the party introducing him apparently expected, he will not be permitted to get before the jury the anticipated evidence by this second method.`
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
 
 
 State v Jolly 
 
 was a decision of the Supreme Court of Montana. There, the prosecution witness claimed that he could not recall a particular statement made by the defendant; he was then cross-examined on his previous affidavit where he gave an account of the conversation in question. The argument on appeal was limited to the effect of the prior conflicting statement. The question whether the impeachment should have been allowed in the first place was not raised at all as no objection was taken. Chief Justice Johnson took the view that the prior inconsistent statement was substantive evidence but held on the facts that the defendant`s alleged statement was so inherently improbable and incredible that it ought to be disregarded (at p 688). Justice Angstman in fact noted that the statement was proof that the witness made a statement contrary to his oral testimony; he took the contrary position that prior self-contradictions have no substantive or independent testimonial value (at p 689). With respect, the case did not in my view stand for the general proposition for which it was cited.
The decision in 
 Sadie Anthony v Don Hobbie 
 hinged on a rule in California, that a party may not impeach his own witness unless surprised by hostile testimony. The Court of Appeal of California noted that the witness did not give unfavourable testimony but merely stated that she did not remember the facts of the accident. The element of surprise was also absent (at p 751). In any event, the prior statement was not substantive evidence but only served to impeach the witness`s testimony that he could not remember. Clearly, the case also did not hold that the witness had not given a previous inconsistent statement.
There is no statutory requirement under ss 147(1) and 157(c) EA that the witness must have given surprise hostile evidence. Further, s 147(3) EA is unequivocal in effect; it provides that the prior inconsistent statement is admissible as substantive evidence. It may well be meaningless to permit the cross-examination of a witness who testifies to a lack of memory if the statement is not admissible as substantive evidence. It would only show that the witness had previously provided an account but has advanced the case no further. In light of these significant differences, and in the absence of any analysis of the phrase `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement`, I declined to follow the approach adopted in those decisions.
A similar argument was raised before the English Court of Appeal in 
R v Thompson
 
[1977] 64 Cr App R 96
. The accused`s daughter was called as a witness for the prosecution but refused to give evidence. She was treated as hostile and cross-examined on her previous statement. Upon cross-examination, she admitted that her previous statement was true and affirmed its contents. On appeal, the accused contended that it was not permissible to cross-examine the witness on her previous statement under s 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865. This provided that a party may prove that the witness had at other times made a statement inconsistent with his testimony. It was argued that the witness could not be considered to have given a contradictory or inconsistent oral version since she had refused to testify to the material events.
The court did not find it necessary to express a view on this argument; upholding the trial judge`s ruling on the basis that the common law right of the judge to allow cross-examination of a hostile witness in his discretion had not been destroyed or removed by statute. Nonetheless I found the following remarks by the Lord Chief Justice to be particularly pertinent (at p 99): 
 
... We are dealing here with a witness who shows himself decidedly adverse, and ..., it is always in the discretion of the judge to allow cross-examination. After all, we are only talking about the asking of leading questions. 
 If the hostile witness declines to say anything at all, that is as inconsistent with his or her duty as making a second and inconsistent statement about the facts.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
A far more helpful and persuasive authority was the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in 
 McInroy v The Queen 
 42 CCC (2d) 481. There, a Crown witness, when questioned on a certain conversation she had with the accused, stated that she could not recall the conversation. The trial judge permitted the Crown to cross-examine her on a previous statement pursuant to s 9(2) Canada Evidence Act, RSC 1970. In the statement, the witness related a conversation with the accused during which the latter confessed to the murder of the victim. The statement was recorded a few days after the conversation while the trial took place seven months later. When shown the statement, she maintained that she could not recall the conversation nor could she recall having said those things to the police. She however confirmed that her signature appeared at the end of the statement and agreed that what she had told the police was what she believed to be true then.
On appeal, the British Colombia Court of Appeal took the view that the trial judge erred in permitting the cross-examination under s 9(2) Canada Evidence Act: see 
 R v Rouse 
 36 CCC (2d) 257 at p 264. Chief Justice Farris reasoned that the witness had testified to nothing damaging the Crown`s case but had simply disclaimed any present relevant testimonial knowledge of the conversation. In such cases, a prior inconsistent statement of facts may not be used to impeach her. He also held that the admission of such statements would allow a party to reinforce by pure hearsay the gap in the witness`s evidence.
On further appeal, the Supreme Court disagreed with the Court of Appeal and upheld the trial judge`s decision to permit cross-examination pursuant to s 9(2) Canada Evidence Act, RSC 1970 which read: 
 
Where the party producing a witness alleges that the witness made at other times a statement in writing, or reduced to writing, inconsistent with his present testimony, the court may, without proof that the witness is adverse, grant leave to that party to cross-examine the witness as to the statement and the court may consider such cross-examination in determining whether in the opinion of the court the witness is adverse.
 
 
 
This provision is quite similar to s 147(1) EA and requires the witness to have made an inconsistent statement on another occasion.
The decision of Martland J on this point, which received the unanimous concurrence of the other Supreme Court judges, was especially instructive (at p 494): 
 
Section 9(2) is not concerned with the cross-examination of an adverse witness. That subsection confers a discretion on a trial judge where the party producing a witness alleges that the witness has made, at another time, a written statement inconsistent with the evidence being given at the trial. The discretion is to permit, without proof that the witness is adverse, cross-examination as to the statement.
 
 
 
 
 The task of the trial judge was to determine whether Mrs St Germaine`s testimony was inconsistent with her statement to the police. In my opinion, he was properly entitled to conclude that it was. At trial Mrs St Germaine swore that she could not recall any part of the conversation with McInroy in the kitchen of her house on the night of the killing, although only some seven months earlier she had given to the police, in her written statement, the details of that conversation, including McInroy`s admission that he was the murderer. If her statement at trial as to her recollection was true, inconsistency would not arise
, but the trial judge saw Mrs St Germaine and heard her evidence on the voir dire. 
 It was quite open to him to conclude that she was lying about her recollection and to form his own conclusions as to why she was refusing to testify as to her true recollection. Chief Justice Farris says [at p 263] in terms that `the trial judge clearly did not believe her when she said that she had a lack of recall`. This being so there was evidence of an inconsistency between what she said at the trial, ie that she had no recollection of a conversation, and what was contained in her written statement, ie a detailed recollection of it.
 
 
 
In 
Wolf v The Queen
 
[1974] 17 CCC (2d) 425
, 47 DLR (3d) 741, ... this court upheld a conviction for perjury against a person who had been the complainant on a charge of unlawfully causing bodily harm. He had given a signed statement to the police in connection with that charge. At the preliminary hearing he said that he could not remember the events described in the statement. The issue before this court was as to whether his evidence at the preliminary hearing was given `with intent to mislead` within s 120 of the Criminal Code. This court held that the case was not one of mere error, honestly made, but that the circumstances justified the conclusion that the failure of memory was dishonest and deliberately asserted to prevent the court from arriving at a decision on credible evidence.
 
 
 
 
 The granting of the Crown`s application was a matter for the sole discretion of the trial judge
 and, in my view, he had adequate grounds for exercising that discretion as he did. ... The trial judge was careful to explain, ... the limited extent to which that cross-examination might be considered by the jury. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In my view, Martland J`s treatment of the issue was sound and accorded with common sense and logic. Due to the varying permutations of inconsistent statements, it would be unduly restrictive and unrealistic to confine the operation of the statutory provisions to a situation where the witness gives two affirmative versions of the facts. A less semantic approach, which calls for a comparison of the oral testimony with the previous statement as a whole to determine whether they are compatible, congruent or consonant in substance, spirit or form, is preferred. A trial judge is perfectly entitled in the proceedings to conclude that a witness is deliberately lying about his recollection and to form his own conclusion as to why the witness is refusing to testify as to his true recollection. This will constitute evidence of an inconsistency between what the witness said at the trial, ie that he has no recollection of the material facts and what was said in the witness`s written statement, ie a detailed recollection of it.
 Principles of statutory interpretation 
 
 
 
In interpreting s 147 EA, I had borne in mind s 9A Interpretation Act (Cap 1) which provides: 
 
 
(1) In the interpretation of a provision of a written law, an interpretation that would promote the object or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.
  
 
 
As explained in 
Constitutional Reference No 1 of 1995
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 201
  at pp 210 and 211, a purposive approach should be adopted in interpreting legislation so as to give effect to the intent and will of Parliament. The operation of s 9A required no ambiguity or inconsistency.
In explaining the rationale for the introduction of s 147(3) EA, the then Minister for Law and the Environment, Mr EW Barker stated (see 
 Reports of Parliament 
 Vol 34 at cols 1246, 1247): 
 
 
 Clause 9 proposes that a previous statement made by a witness should be admissible not only to support or impugn his credibility as a witness but as evidence of the fact stated in it
. The present law has caused difficulty when evidence is given that a witness made a previous statement inconsistent with his evidence given in court. 
 Evidence that the witness did so is admissible but it is admissible not in order to prove the truth of what was said in the previous statement but only in order to neutralise the effect of the evidence given in court by the maker of the statement. Many regard this as too fine a distinction
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The explanatory statement to the Bills Supplement stated that: 
 
Clause 9 [bringing in s 147(3)] 
 provides where a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in the proceedings in question is proved
 or where a document used by a witness to refresh his memory is proved, then the previous statement or any statement made in that document used to refresh the witness`s memory 
 shall be admissible in evidence of any facts stated in it of which direct oral evidence of the witness would be admissible
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The draft cl 9 was based on the draft clauses prepared by the United Kingdom Criminal Law Revision Committee`s 11th Report on Evidence (General): see 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
  at pp 152 and 153. Their reasons for the proposal (at p 136) were reflected in the Minister`s statement set out above. The Committee further explained (at p 139): 
 
... 
 The essence of our proposed scheme is to supplement the oral evidence by hearsay evidence which is likely to be valuable for the ascertainment of the truth and cannot be given because of the restrictions in the present law
. In the case of a previous statement by a person who is called as a witness there is a special reason for proposing to make the statement admissible. It might be argued that, since the maker is giving evidence, there is no need to allow evidence to be given of what he said on a previous occasion. But assuming, as one must, that a person called as a witness in criminal proceedings is more likely than not to intend to try to tell the truth, it follows that what he said soon after the events in question is likely to be at least as reliable as his evidence given at the trial and will probably be more so. This may not always be the case, because the earlier statement may have been made in haste and perhaps under the influence of shock caused by the events in question, and the evidence given at the trial may be more carefully thought over; but at any rate, 
 if there is a discrepancy, it is likely to be helpful to the court or jury to have both statements
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
I had previously examined the underlying purpose of s 147(3) EA in 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
 where I stated at p 156: 
 
... reliability is not itself the sole justification for constituting an exception to s 122(1). Various policy reasons may come in as well. ... A similar reason must apply to s 147. When a prior statement is used to impeach the credit of a witness giving testimony in court, there are two possible sources of evidence: the prior statement or the testimony. 
 The testimony has been given in court - it may still be considered as evidence. But as a result of the impeachment process, that evidence may be considered unreliable. For the court to close its eyes to the evidence in the inconsistent statement may be to deny itself a possible source of evidence. The very fact of its inconsistency would indicate that either the testimony in court or the inconsistent statement should contain the truth. What is more, the inconsistent statement would have been given closer in time to the events related than the testimony at trial
. While the inconsistent statement would not have that inherent reliability which confessions or dying declarations would have for example, 
 it would be altogether too artificial to exclude it as well
. ... [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Bearing in mind the above, the essence of s 147(3) EA could be summarised as follows: (i) it allows a previous inconsistent statement to be admitted as substantive evidence of the facts stated; (ii) it supplements oral evidence with a previous inconsistent statement which is likely to be valuable for the ascertainment of the truth; (iii) it prevents the artificial exclusion of a possible source of evidence which could contain the truth. In interpreting the phrase `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement`, the court `will prefer a construction which advances this object rather than one which attempts some way of circumventing it`: 
 Bennion Statutory Interpretation 
 (3rd Ed, 1997) at p 785
When the witness falsely claims to have no recollection of the material events, he contradicts the essence of his previous statement which contains a detailed account of the facts. Such a witness is no different from a witness who gives false oral evidence. Both have essentially refused to provide a truthful account in court. The previous statement constitutes a valuable source of evidence which could enable the court to ascertain the truth. To exclude such statements by a rigid and semantic construction of the phrase `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement` would not promote the objectives of s 147(3) EA. On the contrary, it imports an unwarranted restriction of the use of the previous inconsistent statement and, in effect, circumvents and defeats the intention of Parliament.
As I observed in 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
  (at [para ] 23): 
 
With the enactment of s 147(3) in 1976, 
 the common law position has been departed from
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Consequently, I agreed with the DPP that the trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the purpose and intention behind the legislative enactment of s 147(3) when she held that the use of s 147 should be carefully circumscribed and that a statement such as exh P7I was not a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement.
The above reasoning also accorded with established canons of statutory interpretation. 
 Bennion Statutory Interpretation 
 (3rd Ed, 1997) described the approach to be adopted by the court as follows (at p 751): 
 
The court seeks to avoid a construction that produces an absurd result, since this is unlikely to have been intended by Parliament. Here the courts give a very wide meaning to the concept of `absurdity`, using it to include virtually any result which is unworkable or impractical, inconvenient, anomalous or illogical, futile or pointless, artificial or productive of a disproportionate counter-mischief.
 
 
 
 
 
 Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes 
 
 (12th Ed, 1969) further explained thus (at p 201): 
 
Where possible, a construction should be adopted which will facilitate the smooth working of the scheme of legislation established by the Act, which will avoid producing or prolonging artificiality in the law, and which will not produce anomalous results.
 
 
 
Adopting the construction advocated by the respondent would mean that a witness could not be cross-examined on his previous statement so long as he claimed to have no recollection of the facts, even if it was a deliberate lie. This would also prevent the admission of the previous statement as substantive evidence. This contrasted with the position of a witness who deliberately gave a different oral version of the facts. Such a construction would lead to absurd and anomalous results and would create an obvious loophole in the application of s 147(3) EA which could not possibly have been intended by Parliament.
In my opinion, the phrase `previous inconsistent or contradictory statement` must necessarily encompass a witness who had deliberately and falsely claimed that he was unable to recall the facts. This construction accorded with the spirit and objectives of s 147(3) and would not unduly broaden the scope of the legislative amendments. The court would still be required to evaluate the credibility of a witness`s testimony; while the weight to be attached to the previous statement would continue to be governed by the safeguards set out in s 147(6) and the factors set out in 
PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd

  at [para ] 27-31; approved in 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
  at [para ] 56: the contemporaneity of a statement with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, the possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement, the explanations for the inconsistencies, the context of the statement and the cogency and coherence of the facts relied upon.
 Application to the facts 
 
 
 
The district judge therefore applied the wrong approach in determining whether Cpl Tay`s oral evidence was materially inconsistent with or contradicted his previous statement exh P7I. The district judge should have assessed whether the alleged lack of recollection was a lie and stemmed from a deliberate refusal, for whatever reason, to testify as to his true recollection. The surrounding circumstances, such as the time lapse between the material events, the recording of the statement and the trial, the nature of the information and its significance to the witness as well as the demeanour of the witness, would have to be considered. The above factors are not exhaustive and would very much depend on the particular circumstances at hand.
From a review of the proceedings below, there were in my view sufficient grounds to conclude that Cpl Tay lied when he claimed to have no recollection of the relevant events. First, the statement exh P7I was recorded on 25 and 26 May 1999, barely six to seven months after the material events of October and November 1998. The trial took place on 27 and 28 December 1999; which was only seven months after exh P7I was recorded and about one year after the material events. It was not such a long lapse of time as to have caused this dramatic loss of memory. Secondly, the matters described in exh P7I were not peripheral or unrelated to Cpl Tay but were significantly and closely intertwined with his own circumstances. The respondent`s request led Cpl Tay to embark on a course of conduct described in his statement which led to his subsequent conviction for communicating information to the respondent in contravention of the OSA. Incidentally, I also noted that Cpl Tay pleaded guilty and admitted to the charges and the statement of facts on 18 November 1998, just prior to the commencement of the trial. It was inconceivable, in the absence of a credible explanation, for this sudden inexplicable loss of memory, even after exh P7I was shown to him to refresh his memory.
Cpl Tay`s responses in the trial were an obvious reflection of his obtuse, wilful refusal to provide truthful testimony in court. He gave the stock responses of `I cannot recall` or `I can`t remember` to almost every question posed by the DPP which would have directly incriminated the respondent. In contrast, he could provide fairly detailed responses to questions that did not directly implicate the respondent, strongly indicating that his loss of memory was selective in nature and was not genuine. The following extract illustrated this point most starkly: 
 
 
Q: Did you talk to the accused about operation by SSB on 21 November 1998? 
 
A: I cannot recall 
 
Q: Did you tell the accused there was going to be an operation that night? 
 
A: I cannot recall. This would not be stated in my pocket diary. 
 
Q: Did Ah San - Chua Tiong Tiong - page for you? 
 
A: I cannot recall. 
 
Q: Did the accused page for you? 
 
A: I can`t recall 
 
Q: I move on to 29 November 1998. Was there an operation by SSB? 
 
A: Not just SSB. Also, GSB, Anti-Vice and the Singapore Armed Forces. SSB was involved in the operation. 
 
Q: Were you involved in the operation? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: Did you attend a pre-operation briefing? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: In the briefing, was it mentioned areas targeted for operations? 
 
A: I can`t recall. 
 
... 
 
Q: In the briefing, was it mentioned that Geylang was one of the targeted areas? 
 
A: No, not in the briefing. 
 
Q: What time did you move out for operations? 
 
A: At 9.15pm. 
 
Q: Before you moved out, were you aware Geylang was one of the areas targeted for operations? 
 
A: Yes 
 
... 
 
Q: When did you find out? 
 
A: On the way there, I was assigned to a team under ASP Mark Chee. He informed us we were going to Geylang. 
 
Q: On 29 November 1998, before you moved out for the operations, did you speak with the accused? 
 
A: I can`t recall. 
 
Q: Did you call the accused before 9.15pm? 
 
A: I can`t recall. 
 
Q: Did you tell the accused SSB was conducting a raid/operation that night? 
 
A: I can`t recall. 
 
Q: Did you tell the accused SSB conducting a raid with anti vice and GSB in the Geylang area that evening? 
 
A: I can`t recall. 
 
Q: Did operation subsequently cover the Geylang area? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: In October 1998, did Chua Tiong Tiong call you to find out why there were so many raids/operations in Geylang. 
 
A: I can`t recall. 
 
Q: Did you tell him that SSB was targeting Chua Tiong Tiong? 
 
A: I can`t recall. 
 
Q: After that, did the accused call you to ask if you could provide tip-offs of raids to Chua Tiong Tiong? 
 
A: I can`t recall. 
 
Q: Did you tell the accused you would try? 
 
A: I can`t remember. 
 
Q: Did you tell the accused you would give tip-offs to Chua Tiong Tiong or the accused? 
 
A: I can`t remember. 
 
...
  
 
 
Taking all the circumstances into account, the irresistible inference to be drawn was that Cpl Tay had lied and was simply being deliberately evasive about his recollection. His oral testimony clearly contradicted the relevant portions of his previous statement exh P7I where he was able to give a detailed account of the surrounding circumstances which took place in October 1998 and the events of 21 and 29 November 1998. This scenario was within the ambit of s 147(3) EA and the district judge ought to have allowed the prosecution to proceed to prove and cross-examine Cpl Tay on the relevant portions of exh P7I.
At this point, I would briefly address the district judge`s concern that it would be futile to cross-examine such a witness under s 147(1) of the EA as his explanation, if any, would be that he could not remember the events. In my view, that would not pose insurmountable difficulties. It is but a factor to be taken into consideration in assessing the weight of the previous statement. The need for a credible explanation, such as a medical cause, would be pressing when the time lapse is short and the information is of a nature which the witness would ordinarily be expected to remember.
 Whether there were material discrepancies between Cpl Tay`s testimony and exh P7I in relation to the events of 17 October 1998
The DPP next contended that the trial judge erred in holding that there were no material inconsistencies or discrepancies between Cpl Tay`s oral evidence of the events of 17 October 1998 and his previous statement exh P7I. The relevant portion of exh P7I stated: 
 
 
60 I did give tip-offs to Ah San and Ah Boy on about four occasions. From my pocket diary, I confirmed that I gave tip-offs on impending police raid on the following occasions: 
 
a On 17 October 98 (Saturday). I contacted Ah Boy at his handphone number 07363571 and informed him that [there] was going to be a raid conducted in the Geylang area. I could have called him at about 2100 hrs. From my pocket diary, I attended a briefing at 2030 hrs conducted by deputy head SSB, ASP Adrian Quek. We were only informed that there was going to be a raid at Geylang area and we were not told of the specific place that we were going to hit. We moved out at 2100 hrs. I contacted Ah Boy through my handphone No 97645751 just before we moved out. 
 
...
  
 
 
The district judge disposed of the matter as follows: 
 
There was an inconsistency between para 60(a) of exh P7I and [Cpl Tay`s] evidence in court, being whether [Cpl Tay] contacted the accused before or after moving out for the raid. However, this difference in time, in my opinion, was minor. There was also one omission, the failure to mention in exh P7I that it was the accused who had paged [Cpl Tay] and asked [Cpl Tay] to go out for coffee. In this regard, I note the observation by Taylor J in Muthusamy v PP at p 58 that `[a] mere omission is hardly ever a discrepancy`. I held that the omission was not a serious discrepancy. Accordingly I did not grant the DPP leave to invoke s 147 of the EA.
 
 
 
In arriving at her ruling, the district judge appeared to have assessed the discrepancies in isolation. I had doubts as to whether this was the correct approach. It is useful to recall my earlier exhortation that the essence of an `inconsistent or contradictory statement` is whether the two versions amount to a `combination of features which are opposed to one another` or whether they agree in `substance` or `spirit`. The better approach would be to compare the two versions as a whole to ascertain whether they stemmed from incompatible or irreconcilable beliefs.
I also hesitated from an unqualified endorsement of the statement that `a mere omission is hardly ever a discrepancy`. To this end, I felt it necessary to set out in full, Taylor J`s observations in 
 Muthusamy v PP 
 (at p 58): 
 
Minor differences are attributable mainly to differences in interpretation and the way in which the statement was taken and sometimes to differences in recollection. 
 A perfectly truthful witness may mention a detail on one occasion and not remember it on another. A mere omission is hardly ever a discrepancy
. The police statement is usually much briefer than the evidence. Both the statement and the evidence are usually narratives reduced from question and answer. The witness is not responsible for the actual expression used in either, and all the less so when he does not speak English. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Viewed in context, Taylor J was really referring to a truthful witness who had omitted a detail due to genuine forgetfulness, differences in interpretation or the manner in which the statement was recorded. It would not extend to a witness who had deliberately omitted the material facts in an attempt to paint a different picture of the events which occurred.
The following passage from 
 Sir John Woodroffe & Amir Ali`s Law of Evidence 
 Vol 4 (15th Ed, 1992) at p 769 is instructive: 
 
... 
 a failure to assert a fact, when it would have been natural to assert it, amounts in effect to an assertion of the non-existence of the fact
. This is conceded as a general principle of evidence. ... 
 Whether silence or omission amounts to an inconsistency depends upon the individual circumstances of each case
. ... Obviously there may be omissions in the previous statements which make it inconsistent with and therefore contradictory to the evidence given by the witness in court. 
 The test is, would it have been natural for the person to make the assertion in question
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
As explained in 
 Dasu v State of Maharashtra 
 1985 Cri LJ 1933 at [para ] 14: 
 
In order to see whether there is a contradiction by omission it is necessary to find out whether the two statements cannot stand together. It is also necessary to see whether the statement which the witness has made in the witness-box should have been made by him while reporting the matter soon after the incident. 
 If the two statements made by the witness cannot stand together and the statement in the court is such that the witness would necessarily have made at the time of his earlier statement, then alone omission thereof can be considered to be a contradiction
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
A comparison of the two versions as a whole was therefore essential. The tenor of Cpl Tay`s oral testimony suggested that the communication of 17 October 1998 was inadvertently and innocently made in the course of a casual conversation initiated by the respondent`s page and invitation to coffee. It did not carry the implication that the respondent had reasonable grounds to suppose that the information was protected information conveyed in breach of the OSA. In contrast, the relevant portions of exh P7I indicated that Cpl Tay contacted the respondent for the specific purpose of informing him about the impending raid just before moving out for the operation. The timing of the conversation was crucial as it would have been difficult for Cpl Tay to tip-off the respondent after the team had moved out in the van and in the presence of his team members. This must also be viewed against the respondent`s request to Cpl Tay at the end of October 1998 to provide tip-offs of impending raids, as described in exh P7I.
Looking at all the circumstances of the case, it would have been most natural for Cpl Tay to mention that it was the respondent who paged and invited him for coffee in exh P7I. This information would have placed a significantly different perspective on the communication which transpired between them. After all, the account in exh P7I would have incriminated Cpl Tay; one would certainly have expected him to provide an accurate account to the authorities at that time, particularly in view of its serious repercussions. His failure to do so was a significant omission which required an explanation.
I therefore agreed with the DPP`s submission that Cpl Tay had given a materially inconsistent oral account of the events of 17 October 1998. In the circumstances, the prosecution should have been allowed to prove and cross-examine Cpl Tay on para 60(a) of exh P7I.
 Whether exh P7I should have been admitted under s 147(4) EA
In the alternative, the DPP contended that exh P7I should have been admitted into evidence pursuant to s 147(4) which reads: 
 
Where a person called as a witness in any proceeding is cross-examined on a document used by him to refresh his memory, that document may be made evidence in those proceedings.
 
 
 
This submission was, in my view, misconceived. Cpl Tay had not refreshed his memory using exh P7I. He had instead maintained that he was unable to remember the events in question and did not confirm its contents or the accuracy of the recording. The pre-condition for the exercise of s 147(4) EA was thus absent.
Furthermore, s 147(4) EA has to be read in conjunction with s 163 EA: 
 
Any writing referred to under section 161 or 162 [relating to refreshing of memory and testimony to facts stated in such document] must be produced and shown to the 
 adverse party
 if he requires it; 
 such party may cross-examine the witness thereupon
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Thus, when a witness`s memory has been refreshed with a document, the party adversely affected by the resulting testimony (the respondent), can cross-examine the witness (Cpl Tay) on the document. This in turn triggers s 147(4) EA. That was patently not the case here.
In support of his submissions, the DPP cited the case of 
Yuen Chun Yii v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 57
 . There, the prosecution sought to refresh the witness`s memory by reference to his previous statement which on its face contained evidence adverse to the accused. The witness confirmed that he made the statement but proceeded to qualify its contents. The defence then cross-examined the witness on his responses. It was in this context that I observed (at [para ] 26): 
 
Moreover, by the operation of s 147(4) EA, the defence may have unwittingly allowed the CPIB statement to be made evidence in the proceedings once they proceeded to cross-examine Chia on that document.
 
 
 
The circumstances in the present appeal were quite different. Exhibit P7I contained evidence which was potentially adverse to the respondent. Even if Cpl Tay had refreshed his memory using exh P7I, the party who could properly cross-examine him on exh P7I pursuant to s 163 EA was the respondent. In view of the nexus between ss 163 and 147(4) EA, s 147(4) EA really referred to cross-examination by the party adversely affected by the statement. Section 147(4) EA was thus inapplicable and could not have been relied on to admit exh P7I.
Once Cpl Tay intimated that he was still unable to recall the events, the proceedings under s 161 EA were rightly stopped by the district judge. Correspondingly, the prosecution was not allowed to cross-examine the respondent on the contents of the exh P7I. At that stage, Cpl Tay was a potentially unfavourable, if not hostile witness. The prosecution would have to turn to ss 147, 156 or 157(c) EA in order to cross-examine Cpl Tay on exh P7I and to admit it into evidence pursuant to s 147(3) EA: see 
 Yuen Chun Yii v PP 
 at [para ] 32.
 Whether admissibility of a witness`s statement is subject to the test of voluntariness
In her grounds of decision, the district judge queried whether exh P7I was subject to the requirement of voluntariness specified in s 24 EA, in the event that it was admissible for the purposes of impeachment or cross-examination. Counsel for the respondent, without citing any authorities in support, submitted that this requirement applied to all statements used against an accused person so as not to defeat the doctrine of voluntariness. The DPP did not pursue this issue although he appeared to have implicitly conceded this requirement when he noted, in his written arguments, that Cpl Tay ought to be aware that he could challenge the voluntariness of his statement.
Under such circumstances, it was strictly speaking not necessary for me to address this query. Nonetheless, in view of its impact on the procedure to be adopted in the admission of exh P7I for the purposes of impeachment or cross-examination, I felt compelled to express my observations on this pertinent issue.
At the outset, I noted that there are no statutory provisions which subject the admissibility of a witness`s statement to the requirement of voluntariness. Section 147(3) EA provides that the previous inconsistent or contradictory statement shall be admissible as substantive evidence once it is proved. `Proved` is in turn defined in s 3(3) EA as follows: 
 
A fact is said to be `proved` when, after considering the matters before it, the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists.
 
 
 
This refers to the proof of the existence of the statement and makes no reference to the question of voluntariness.
Statements of accused persons are, on the other hand, governed by express statutory provisions. Section 24 EA reads: 
 
A confession made by an 
 accused person
 is irrelevant in 
 a criminal proceeding
 if the making of the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal 
 nature in reference to the proceeding against him
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The proviso to s 122(5) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), which relates to any statement recorded from an accused person by the police, is expressed in similar terms. On a plain reading, both provisions are not applicable to witnesses as they deal with statements of accused persons: see 
Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 713
  at [para ] 12 (on s 122(5) CPC). That therefore indicates that the question of voluntariness would only go to the weight of a witness`s statement.
A similar view was expressed in Tan Yock Lin 
 Criminal Procedure 
, Vol 2 (1999) at para 2501: 
 
There is a difference between a witness`s statement and a statement made by the accused, which in Malaysia is referred to as a cautioned statement. 
 Unlike a witness`s statement, an accused`s statement is inadmissible in evidence for the purpose of impeachment unless it is voluntary
. An accused cannot be cross-examined on a statement which he made involuntarily. 
 This is not a general rule; but the requirement of voluntariness is imposed by the statute on statements made by an accused person
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
 , I postulated a justification for this distinction in relation to s 122(5) CPC (at p 155): 
 
It is clear then that [s 122(5) CPC] is intended to regulate the activities of the police. The basis of the proviso to sub-s (5) is not rooted in the reliability or otherwise of the statement made to the police, but is intended clearly to prevent any impropriety on the part of the interrogators.
 
 
 
 
 The position of a mere witness is in any event quite different from that of the accused
. The accused may be expected to be exposed to the danger of pressure or harassment, but the mere witness would not be. 
 This is clearly reflected in the absence of any overt safeguards against impropriety acting on witnesses
. There is none simply because there is generally no need for any. 
In any event, such impropriety would be dealt with by the residual discretion recognised in Cheng Swee Tiang v PP
 
 
[1964] MLJ 291
 . [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
To recall, 
 Cheng Swee Tiang v PP 
 recognised that, while evidence unlawfully obtained is admissible if relevant, there is a judicial discretion to disallow such evidence, if its reception would operate unfairly against an accused.
Nevertheless, my comments in 
 Sng Siew Ngoh v PP 
 have to be construed in context. In that case, the witness in question was the complainant and was what I would term a `mere witness`. Complications may arise, however, when the witness is not a mere witness, but an `accomplice` who has either been dealt with or, for whatever reason, was not charged. Such a witness would have been either a suspect or an accused person at the time of recording of the statements and was no different in status from any other accused person. He may therefore be expected to be exposed to the same danger of pressure or harassment. The prosecution would have to prove that the statement was voluntary before it could be tendered into evidence in a criminal proceedings involving that accomplice or in a joint trial with the accused on the same charge (neither of which was the case here). The same policy reasons for the statutory safeguards exist regardless of the current status of the individual.
As explained above, where there is any impropriety in the recording of the statements, the court may exclude such statements in the exercise of its residual discretion. To be consistent with this policy consideration, and as a prudent measure, the court will generally have to be satisfied as to its voluntary nature before it allows the admission of previous inconsistent statements of such witnesses.
The practice of the courts in several previous cases has been to conduct voir dires to ascertain the voluntariness and admissibility of the witness`s statement: see 
Rajendran s/o Kurusamy & Ors v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 225
  at [para ] 103-110 and 
Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 713
  at [para ] 12-14. In the latter case, I described the voir dire as being a `preliminary examination by the judge to seek to discover if the witness is telling the truth` (at [para ] 12). The voluntariness of the witness statements was also a consideration in 
Tang Keng Boon v PP
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 535
  [para ] 13 and 
Tan Khee Koon v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 724
  at p 740.
I fully recognise that there was no specific discussion in those cases, of the legal basis for the requirement of voluntariness, no apparent objection having been raised to the decision to convene a voir dire. In the ultimate analysis however, I was not prepared, at this stage, to disturb what appeared to me to be an accepted practice in the absence of full arguments by parties.
 Whether the record of proceedings (exh P8) was properly admitted pursuant to s 45A EA
In the proceedings below, the district judge admitted the record of proceedings (exh P8) pursuant to s 45A EA and relied on it as substantive evidence against the respondent. Although this issue was not raised before me, I was not convinced, upon a review of the relevant provision, that the district judge was entitled to do so pursuant to s 45A EA.
Section 45A(1) EA reads: 
 
Without prejudice to the generality of sections 42, 43, 44 and 45, the fact that a person has been convicted or acquitted of an offence by or before any court in 
 Singapore shall be admissible in evidence for the purpose of proving, where relevant to any issue in the proceedings, that he committed
 (or, as the case may be, did not commit) 
 that offence
, whether or not he is a party to the proceedings; and where he was convicted, whether he was so convicted upon a plea of guilty of otherwise. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Section 45A EA was inserted by the Evidence (Amendment) Act (No 8 of 1996). The Minister of Law, Professor S Jayakumar explained the purpose of this provision as follows (see Reports of Parliament Vol 65 at col 455): 
 
... Section 45A is to reverse a common law rule (known among lawyers as the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
, an English case) that operated to exclude evidence of judicial findings of convictions or acquittals This common law rule states that the evidence in an earlier criminal case cannot be admitted against the defendant in a later civil trial, although, as is known, the standard of proof is higher in a criminal case. For example, a criminal conviction for dangerous driving is inadmissible as evidence of negligence in a civil action for causing personal injuries to the other driver. Reversing this rule means that judicial time and legal costs will be saved by not having to litigate all over again the issues which have been decided by another court in previous proceedings. ...
 
 
 
Plainly, s 45A EA was limited to proving the fact that a particular individual had been convicted or acquitted of an offence, where relevant to an issue in the proceedings, and was really intended to save judicial time and costs in subsequent civil proceedings. It did not create an avenue for the admission of a previous conviction of a person as substantive evidence against an accomplice in subsequent criminal proceedings. Furthermore, charges which have been taken into consideration are neither convictions nor acquittals. It therefore follows that the district judge had erred in admitting the charges and statement of facts pursuant to s 45A EA and, without more, relying on them as substantive evidence against the respondent.
In my view, the error made by the district judge did not give rise to any failure of justice, insofar as it related to the first charge against the respondent (pertaining to the events of 17 October 1998). This was because the statement of facts would have been admissible as substantive evidence in any case.
What was the basis for the admission of a statement of facts? I had analysed this issue rather extensively in 
PP v Liew Kim Choo
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 699
  at [para ] 65-87. In that case, the only evidence implicating the accused was the statement of facts which the accomplice had admitted to at the time he pleaded guilty to the related charges. After reviewing the relevant law, I surmised (at [para ] 87): 
 
I therefore took the view that the statement of facts, properly classified as a confession for the purposes of s 17, was a statement made by PW4. It was a statement on which he could be properly cross-examined under s 147 of the Act. I also found that if such a statement was properly proved against him, the statement could be used as proof of the facts stated therein by virtue of s 147(3) of the Act ...
 
 
 
Applying the above principle, the statement of facts (pertaining to DAC 35628 of 1999) was a confession by Cpl Tay within the meaning of s 17 EA. Being inconsistent with his oral testimony, it was a statement on which he could be cross-examined under s 147 EA once it was proved against him.
The statement of facts was proved when the prosecution tendered the record of proceedings showing that Cpl Tay had admitted to it without qualification. Cpl Tay also confirmed that he had admitted to the statement of facts but chosen to dispute the truth of the contents. Since the contents of the statement of facts mirrored exh P7I, my earlier analysis of exh P7I applied here with equal vigor. I was satisfied that Cpl Tay`s oral testimony was materially inconsistent with his confession as contained in the statement of facts. The prosecution was therefore entitled to cross-examine Cpl Tay on the statement of facts and to rely on it as substantive evidence pursuant to s 147(3) EA.
 Whether there was prima facie case on the first charge
In view of my earlier decision in relation to exh P7I, I did not find it necessary to address the DPP`s further submission that the district judge should have called the defence in respect of the first charge. Suffice to say that the admission of exh P7I may well affect the district judge`s overall assessment of the evidence in the resumed trial.
As an ancillary matter, I noted that the district judge below held that there was no prima facie evidence showing that the respondent had any reasonable ground to suppose that the information was protected information, communicated in breach of the OSA. In this regard, it would be useful to recall that a guilty mind could be proved by direct evidence of knowledge or by inferring knowledge from the primary facts: 
PP v Bridges Christopher
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 162
  at [para ] 41. As I observed in 
Bridges Christopher v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 406
 , in determining whether the relevant mens rea was present for an offence under s 5(2) OSA (at [para ] 57, 58): 
 
... 
 a very relevant consideration is the nature of the information received ... If it is obvious that the information is official secret information, then the mere fact that it was received from someone working in the government would raise the inference that the recipient knew or had reasonable ground to believe that it was communicated to him in contravention of the Act. It would then be on him to offer some explanation as to why he thought otherwise.
 
 
 
If, however the information appears innocuous and is widely believed to be in the public domain, then the mere fact that the supplier of the information works for the government need not lead to the inference that the recipient had reasonable ground to believe that it was communicated to him in contravention of the Act. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It would be useful for the district judge to bear the above comments in mind when evaluating the evidence at the close of the prosecution case.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In the event, I allowed the appeals and remitted the three charges to the district judge. I directed the district judge to allow the prosecution to proceed to prove and admit exh P7I into evidence for the purposes of cross-examination; and to conduct further inquiry to determine the credibility of Cpl Tay`s oral testimony and the weight to be accorded to exh P7I.

:This is a petition by a Malaysian finance company, Credit Corporation (M) Bhd (`the petitioner`), for a revision of a vehicle forfeiture order by the district court. The petitioner was the owner of the vehicle and had financed its purchase made by Hapsah bte Rahmat (a Malaysian) (`the hirer`), through a hire purchase agreement. As in a typical human smuggling syndicate`s 
 modus operandi 
, the vehicle was stolen, had its engine illegally substituted and a false licence plate placed. The vehicle was used in the illegal smuggling of two Indian immigrants. The three immigration offenders have been dealt with.
The statutory provision under s 49(6) Immigration Act is unambiguous and mandatory. Forfeiture must be ordered if the vehicle has been used to commit an immigration offence. The district court rightly gave a forfeiture order of the vehicle. I dismissed the petition.
Although the court empathises with the innocent parties, whose vehicles are stolen and illegally used, the law is clear on its mandatory provision. I have taken the opportunity to substantiate this mandatory legislative provision, from judicial support from England and an institutional perspective, putting the statutory provision as part of a whole mechanism for reducing illegal immigration and particularly, for `drying up` the easy supply of vehicles for human smuggling syndicates.
 The facts 
 
 
 
Pang Siew Peng (`the offender`) was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint for using a vehicle, a Proton car, to smuggle two Indian nationals (`illegal immigrants`) into Singapore. The vehicle was seized on the same day pursuant to s 49(1) Immigration Act.
He was convicted of two charges of human smuggling, under s 57(1)(c) Immigration Act, and was sentenced to 30 months` imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. The two illegal immigrants were each sentenced to one month`s imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
The petitioner had financed the purchase of the vehicle, by Hapsah bte Rahmat (`the hirer`) in Malaysia, through a hire purchase agreement. It was insured by PanGlobal Insurance Bhd (`the insurer`). The vehicle was stolen in Malaysia on 18 August 1999. Its original licence plate was No JFB 3774. The original engine, a key component of the vehicle, was substituted with another engine without authorisation. Its licence plate was also illegally replaced with a false one, No JEM 3765. Based on the chassis number of the vehicle, the hirer and the insurer were contacted and informed of the seizure of the vehicle, and later its forfeiture.
However, for some inexplicable reason, the petitioner was not so informed, although its identity was made known to Singapore Immigration and Registration by the hirer, prior to the forfeiture application by the prosecution to the district court. The petitioner applied for the forfeiture order to be reversed.
 Mandatory forfeiture under s 49(6) Immigration Act when two conditions are met 
 
 
 
The petition resembled closely the case of 
Public Finance Bhd v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 354
 . In 
 Public Finance Bhd 
, in interpreting s 49(6) Immigration Act, I pointed out that once the two conditions under s 49(6) are met, forfeiture of the vehicle is mandatory. The two conditions are: 
(a) commission of the offence; and 
(b) use of the vehicle in the commission of the offence.
This stipulation is clear, unmistakable and exhaustive. There are no other factors to be considered. It precludes reliance by the court on any other factors that might be raised by the offender or, indeed by any other party such as the owner of the vehicle.
The fact that the vehicle was stolen, illegally altered and used for human smuggling, and the fact that the vehicle was used by the offender, a person not in lawful possession of it, for human trafficking, are irrelevant.
Indeed, it is within the relevant authorities` discretion to make a forfeiture application to the district court. Finance and car rental companies can make representations to them. However, once the authorities make a forfeiture application, the court will only be concerned whether the two conditions have been met. And if they have been, a forfeiture order must be made.
 Absence of criminal involvement by the petitioner is irrelevant 
 
 
 
The petitioner claimed that as an innocent party it was unjustifiable that they be penalised. However, I made clear in 
Public Finance Bhd v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 354
 , 
PP v Mayban Finance (Singapore) Ltd
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 462
  and 
PP v M/s Serve You Motor Services
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 669
  that, even though the court sympathised with the owners, forfeiture must be ordered once it has been used in the commission of the offence, regardless of whether the petitioner had participated in the criminal offence. The provision is clear and mandatory. The owners would have to be left to their remedies against the offenders.
Counsel for the petitioner submitted that s 49(6) Immigration Act should be given an interpretation that would promote the purpose or objective underlying it, rather than a literal interpretation that would not promote the purpose or objective.
Section 9A of the Interpretation Act stipulates that an interpretation that would promote the purpose underlying the written law shall be preferred to one that would not so promote the purpose. The court may refer to the Hansard. A purposive approach to statutory interpretation could be taken even if a provision was not ambiguous or inconsistent: 
Planmarine AG v Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 1
  (CA).
However, a purposive interpretation of s 49(6) Immigration Act would still yield a similar mandatory result.
During the Parliamentary debate on 2 May 1996, the Minister for Law, Professor Jayakumar made clear that forfeiture acts as a strong deterrent. If vehicles were returned to innocent owners, human smuggling syndicates would find it easier to obtain vehicles to carry out human smuggling, without the risk of confiscation. All they need to do is to hire or borrow the vehicles. Doing away with the mandatory provisions would only increase the pool of easy resources available to human smuggling syndicates.
Mandatory forfeiture would not directly stop the human smuggling syndicates from stealing vehicles. Far from it. The syndicates would continue stealing vehicles and paying young offenders to carry out human smuggling across the causeway.
Instead, mandatory forfeiture of the vehicles puts the onus on the vehicle owners to exercise care and responsibility when lending or hiring out their vehicles. By extension, it also places onus on hirers and borrowers to exercise greater care in preventing their vehicles from becoming easy theft targets.
In short, the mandatory provision for forfeiture ensures that a legal loophole does not exist. It is meant to `dry up` the easy supply of vehicles for human smuggling. A purposive interpretation of s 49(6) Immigration Act would yield a similar mandatory forfeiture order once the two conditions have been met.
 Notices under ss 49(2) and 49(3) of the Immigration Act 
 
 
 
Under s 49(2) Immigration Act, the seizing officer must give a notice in writing on the grounds of seizure to the owner, if known. Section 49(3) Immigration Act stipulates that the notice is not required if the seizure is made in the presence of or with the knowledge of the offender or owner of the vehicle.
The vehicle was seized in the presence of the offender at the Woodlands Checkpoint. The offender was served a notice of seizure under s 49(2) Immigration Act. In such circumstances, as I said in 
 Public Finance Bhd 
, s 49(3) Immigration Act obviates the need for any further notice of seizure to be given to the petitioner.
In fact, as s 49(6) Immigration Act is exhaustive, the petitioner was not even entitled to make representations to the district court for the return of the vehicle. This was not a valid argument.
 Requirements for criminal revision 
 
 
 
Counsel for the petitioner rightly pointed out that neither the petitioner nor the hirer could have foreseen that the vehicle would be stolen and used for human smuggling. Neither could they in the circumstances do anything more to prevent the theft and, later, its forfeiture. Therefore, counsel submitted that the petitioner suffered `injustice and undue hardship`.
I said in 
Ang Poh Chuan v Public Prosecutor
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
  that, although it is a wide discretion vested with the court, there must be some serious injustice, in other words, something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at the basis as an excuse of an exercise of judicial power by the district court, for the High Court to exercise criminal revision.
I also made clear in 
 Ang Poh Chuan 
 that hardship caused by forfeiture alone could not attract criminal revision. Injustice could be established only if it was shown that forfeiture ought not to have been ordered.
As I said in 
 Public Finance Bhd 
, even if the petitioner had been given express notice of the seizure, it would not have been able to make representations as to the forfeiture of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the requirements for criminal revision were not satisfied.
 Judicial support from England 
 
 
 
Such mandatory forfeiture provision is not new to the Commonwealth jurisdictions. One can derive support from the English Court of Appeal`s decision in 
Customs and Excise Commissioners v Air Canada
 
[1991] 2 QB 446
[1991] 1 All ER 570
, where the court strictly interpreted the mandatory statutory provisions in their Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.
On a flight to the United Kingdom, the cargo in a large commercial aircraft of Air Canada was found to contain cannabis resin. The aircraft was seized and made liable to forfeiture. The English Court of Appeal, following an established practice, interpreted the provisions as they were, strictly and clearly, without jeopardising their legislative intent.
The English Court of Appeal accepted that the liability to forfeiture of the aircraft was absolute and not dependent on proof of mens rea of the owner or user. The liability to forfeiture depended solely on the fact that it had been used for the commission of an offence, wholly independent of any knowledge, motive, consent or attitude of the owner or user of the aircraft. Intention to transgress or commit an offence in any way was irrelevant.
This example from England shows that Singapore is not alone in this area. It is not objectionable that the liability acts in rem. It is never a rule at common law that mens rea must be presumed to be a prerequisite of the incurring of liability to forfeiture. Various other cases can also be referred to, such as 
 Lord Advocate v Crookshanks 
 (1888) 15 R (Ct of Sess) 995, 
De Keyser v British Railway Traffic and Electric Co Ltd
 
[1936] 1 KB 224
, 
Customs and Excise Commissioners v Jack Bradley (Accrington) Ltd
 
[1959] 1 QB 219
[1958] 3 All ER 487
 and 
Denton v John Lister Ltd
 
[1971] 3 All ER 669
.
 Justification of the mandatory provision 
 
 
 
I will put forward a reasoning from an institutional perspective, to look at the justification of the mandatory provision. Section 49(6) Immigration Act provides a severe deterrent and sanction in the hands of the authorities to prevent human smuggling. This mandatory provision should be regarded as part of the preventive strategies. In this context, prevention means that the owners must take greater care of their vehicles and ensure that it is harder for offenders to steal the vehicles for human smuggling. It encourages greater vigilance to reduce the ready supply of vehicles for human smuggling.
Crimes result not only from the motivation of the offender but also from the situation in which the offender finds himself. If the situation can be altered to the offender`s disadvantage, for instance, increased chances of detection and swift punishment, and reduced supply of means to carry out the offences, then the opportunities for crime will certainly be reduced. This situational prevention can be extrapolated here.
In short, this is part of the purposive manipulation of the immediate environment in which human smuggling can be reduced from the reduction of the supply of vehicles, detection mechanism, deterrent effect in its punishment, to reduced opportunity of movement, harbouring and employment within Singapore. It is part of a whole scheme to reduce illegal immigration.
Crime prevention is a co-ordinated approach. We are aware of the extent of severity of the impact of human smuggling, such as that in the recent calamity in Dover, England that caused 58 illegal Chinese immigrant deaths on 18 June 2000, or the 180 illegal immigrants that were known to have died this year alone in Italian waters, often pushed into the sea and left to drown by smugglers trying to lighten their boats to get away from the Italian coast-guard patrols. I also referred to the Dover calamity in rejecting the appeal in 
 Mohamed Zakir Mohamed Ali v PP 
 (shipmate in stowaway case, 3 August 2000). The human smuggling syndicates are highly organized and international in their operations. Their illicit gains are extremely lucrative and exploitative. The massive poverty, enormous population pressure in and around the region, and the robust prosperity in Singapore makes Singapore an attractive destination.
The petition was about as hard a case as could well be. However, I could not allow the petition. Otherwise, a loophole would be created for car rental and finance companies, and become a soft option for the syndicates to so operate and exploit.
In short, the nature of the crime, its impact on public safety and social order, the punishment that it entails, the absence of social obloquy, the wording of s 49(6) Immigration Act and its context show very clearly Parliament`s intention that this punishment of forfeiture be meted out regardless of intent or knowledge. The problem of illegal immigrants is pernicious. The responsibility for a policy decision on this must remain with the Parliament. The legislative intent is unmistakably clear. The court should not dilute the overall deterrent effect of the statutory provision.
 Advice on trade practices to the companies to avoid further losses 
 
 
 
It is unfortunate that car rental or finance companies become unwitting victims to human smuggling syndicates. To avoid further losses, car rental and finance companies should immediately start incorporating the requirement of guarantees or insurance coverage into their hire purchase or rental agreements. These guarantees or insurance policies ought to cover the losses of theft and forfeiture by the relevant authorities. The costs of the guarantee or insurance protection will necessarily have to be borne by the individual hirers and borrowers. The onus will thus shift to the individuals to be more vigilant.
This measure can be practised on an industry-wide basis. The cost will be spread out and I do not foresee the individuals having to shoulder too sharp an increase in costs.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
I dismissed the petition. Car rental and finance companies should modify their trade practices to cover themselves. The cost will be passed down to car hirers or borrowers. With the deterrent effect of pecuniary loss, all parties will be made to be more careful in handling their vehicles.
There will always be unsuspecting victims in cases where vehicles are stolen and illegally used for human smuggling. But with a wider net and clearer deterrent messages, the public should be prompted to do their bids to reduce the easy supply of vehicles for human smuggling syndicates.

 Introduction 
The appellant was charged with two counts of knowingly giving false information to the police when she alleged that she had been raped by one Tan Eng Huat (`Tan`), an offence punishable under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). She was convicted on both charges and was sentenced to four weeks` imprisonment on each charge. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently. She appealed against both her conviction and sentence. Having considered the submissions, I dismissed the appeal and I now set out my reasons.
 The background 
 
 
 
The appellant was a 40-year-old housewife who had been seeking medical treatment from Tan, her Chinese physician, for aches and pain in various parts of her body for about eight years. On 14 July 1998, the appellant lodged a police report alleging that Tan had outraged her modesty. Corporal Edmund Yong (PW1) recorded a statement from her in which she claimed that she had on various occasions since November 1996 consulted Tan regarding the pain in her spine, left knee and stomach. On the pretext of improving her blood circulation, Tan molested her by massaging her breasts and the areas under her armpits. He also allegedly fondled her nipples.
About a month later, on 21 September 1998, the appellant informed the police that she had more facts to add to her earlier statement. On 22 September 1998, Sgt Eddie Sim Hark Beng (PW2) recorded a further statement from her (exh P5). Apart from affirming the molest incidents, she added that she was raped by Tan at his clinic-cum-residence on 20 June 1998 during her medical treatment. In a further statement dated 23 September 1998 (exh P6), which was also recorded by PW2, the appellant gave more details of the alleged rape. Exhibits P5 and P6 (collectively referred to as the `police statements`) formed the basis of the present charges against the appellant.
On 3 April 1999, Senior Sgt Young Khow Ming (PW3) recorded a further statement from the appellant (exh P7) in the presence of W/Sgt Khairani (PW4). According to him, he needed to clarify more facts with the appellant as the latter had undergone a polygraph test earlier and had been found to be untruthful. During this interview, she retracted her earlier allegations of rape and admitted that they were false because her sexual relationship with Tan was in truth consensual. She explained in the statement that her husband found out about their sexual relationship after reading a letter dated 21 September 1998 (exh D1) from Tan`s lawyers. She gave the false statement because she was afraid that her husband might divorce her if he knew the truth. For ease of reference, I will refer to this statement as the `confession`.
On 20 May 1999, the present charges were brought against her. In her cautioned statement, she did not deny the charges. She stated, ""I hope for leniency as my daughter is still young. I ask for a fine sentence. Also I`m going for a surgical operation.""
 Evidence of the prosecution 
 
 
 
At all material times, Tan was a Chinese physician who specialised in finger-massaging. He was introduced to the appellant about ten years ago by a friend of hers. Tan denied all the allegations of molest and rape but he admitted to having a sexual relationship with the appellant. He said that he had sexual intercourse with her on two occasions when the appellant came for treatment, the first time in March 1998 and the second time about three weeks later. According to him, she seduced him into having sexual intercourse with her in the hope that he would cure her of her illness. At first, he was unwilling to accept her sexual advances but he eventually succumbed when she stroked his private parts with her hands. On the second occasion, the appellant again used titillating words to encourage him to have sexual intercourse with her. He testified that she said, as long as he could cure her of her illness, she would let him `play with her`. Tan gave her $100 and $50 respectively after intercourse on both occasions, claiming that he did it out of guilt and also because the appellant had frequently complained about her financial difficulties.
The appellant continued to seek treatment from him after these two occasions. According to Tan, the appellant told him that she consulted other physicians for a month or two after the second incident but none of them could cure her of her illness. Therefore, she resumed treatment with Tan.
On 15 July 1998, the appellant telephoned Tan`s wife Tan Ah Juan (PW6). As a result of what was said during this conversation, PW6 confronted Tan and the latter admitted that he had an illicit affair with the appellant. That marked the beginning of the deterioration of the relationship between Tan and the appellant. Their relationship soured further when the appellant kept demanding to be cured by Tan. In August 1998, she began harassing him by visiting him almost every day and even threatened to commit suicide by jumping off his block of flats if he did not cure her.
Because of her demands and also because his wife asked him to, Tan continued to give treatment to the appellant. However, he could not cure her of her ailments. Eventually, he and his wife agreed to give the appellant $400 for her to seek treatment elsewhere as the appellant claimed that she had spent all her money on consultation fees. The appellant accepted the money but continued to harass them. On Tan`s instructions, his lawyer sent a letter dated 21 September 1998 (exh D1) to the appellant warning her to cease all forms of harassment and nuisance immediately or face legal action. It was also stated in this letter that the appellant seduced Tan and that they had sexual relations.
PW6 testified that as far as she knew, apart from the incidents involving the appellant, her husband did not have any sexual relationship with his other female patients. PW6 was on familiar terms with the appellant. Sometime in July 1998, the appellant called her on the telephone and told her that Tan `did not want to treat her`. She also said that Tan `dared not treat her` and she wanted PW6 to persuade Tan to continue the treatment. The appellant further claimed that Tan had `touched` her which PW6 understood to mean that Tan had molested her. PW6 was certain that the appellant did not allege that Tan had sexual intercourse with her. She only came to know about it when she confronted Tan later regarding the allegation of molest and Tan admitted that he had sexual intercourse with the appellant.
PW6 testified that she and Tan decided to give the appellant $400 to consult other physicians. She said that they were under a lot of pressure to find a cure for her due to her constant harassment. In spite of her anger over the affair, PW6 nevertheless persuaded her husband to try his best to cure the appellant. She pitied the appellant because she was in constant pain and she kept asking her to get Tan to help her.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The appellant gave evidence that she first sought treatment for her aches and pains from Tan in 1990. He earned her trust by successfully treating her for the pain in her leg, spine and left shoulder. However, Tan started making sexual advances towards her in 1996 or 1997. She claimed that Tan massaged and pressed many areas on her body, including the areas below her armpits and around her breasts under the pretence of giving her treatment and to improve her blood circulation. She testified that Tan discovered a lump in her breast in November 1997 and told her that it was a bruise. He added that it would turn cancerous if it was not massaged properly and she would then have to undergo an operation. Tan allegedly told her not to consult any other doctor and that he could cure the lump for her. Thus, she went back to Tan for treatment periodically, believing that he was the only one who could cure her.
The first incident of rape took place on 4 May 1998. The appellant arrived at Tan`s flat for treatment. After removing her brassiere during the treatment, Tan took off his shirt and sat behind her to massage her neck. He then hugged her from behind and asked her to `let him play` or he would not cure her. She refused. However, Tan persisted and made certain pornographic suggestions to her. He also promised her that he would cure her after that. He then dragged her to a mattress and tried to take off her shorts but he had some difficulty with that. At his request, the appellant took them off herself. After intercourse, Tan continued with his treatment. Before she left, he gave her $50 for her daughter, who was ill at that time, to consult a doctor. She refused and told him that she was not a prostitute.
The second incident took place on 20 June 1998. Tan called her and promised her treatment if she `let him play` a second time. The appellant asked him if he would treat her if she refused his request. He replied in the negative and told her that it was up to her to decide whether she could `bear the pain`. The appellant acceded to his request. She then arranged for her friend, Lim Kuy Yok Pauline (DW2), to baby-sit her daughter because Tan specifically told her not to bring her daughter along. Again, Tan gave her some treatment first before having sexual intercourse with her. This was followed by more treatment. This time, he gave her $100 and she again refused. However, she subsequently accepted it when Tan told her that he would not treat her if she rejected the money.
In July 1998, Tan called her and asked her if she wanted to `play` the third time. Again, he promised to cure her if she let him play. The appellant felt very cheated and angry. She did not go to Tan`s flat. She called Tan`s wife later and told her about the molest. The appellant testified that she felt `cheated` because she believed Tan when he told her that he was the only one who could have cured her. She maintained that she did not let him have sex with her willingly.
She also explained that she did not mention the rape incidents in her police statements because she `did not dare to speak`. According to her, she did not want her husband to know about these incidents because she was afraid that he would think less of her. She testified that her husband was enraged after reading the letter from Tan`s lawyers and it was then when she told him that she was raped by Tan. Thereafter, she made a police report against Tan.
With regard to her confession, she claimed that PW3 had fabricated the statement. She alleged that PW3 induced her into signing it by showing her the polygraph test results and accusing her of lying. He also told her that she would not succeed in court and that, if she did not sign the statement, her name would be published in the newspapers. As for the cautioned statement, the defence did not challenge its admissibility.
DW2 gave evidence of the appellant`s good character. She had known the appellant for more than 20 years and had found her to be honest, straightforward and frank. She was neither cunning nor greedy. Initially, she gave evidence that she did not know why the appellant had sexual intercourse with Tan, but later she testified that the appellant did so in exchange for treatment from Tan. She also testified that she overheard Tan asking the appellant over the telephone to let him `play` a third time. On her suggestion, she and the appellant made secret tape recordings of a conversation between the appellant, DW2, Tan and his wife PW6 to obtain evidence of Tan`s wrongdoing. The transcripts were tendered in court. The bulk of the conversation related to the appellant`s frustration resulting from Tan`s failure to cure her and further complaints about her ailments. During the conversation, Tan also broke down and knelt down before them as a demonstration of his remorse.
The appellant`s husband, Tan Kim Leng (DW3), gave evidence that he found out about the affair between his wife and Tan when he read the letter from Tan`s lawyers. The appellant then told him that she was forced to have sex with Tan because Tan told her that, if she wanted to cure her sickness, she must let him have sex with her. He was very angry and he wanted to beat Tan up. The appellant stopped him and asked him not to `blow up the matter`. Following that, he took the appellant to the police station to make a report against Tan. DW3 confirmed that the appellant knew that the sexual intercourse was not part of her treatment and that it was done `in exchange for treatment`.
 The findings below 
 
 
 
The appellant`s confession was admitted at the close of a 
 voir dire 
. The trial judge accepted the evidence of PW3 that he had not fabricated any part of the statement and that there was no threat, inducement or promise given to the appellant in the recording of the statement. She found that his evidence was supported by PW4 who was present during the session. PW4 gave evidence that the appellant looked dejected but she did not appear frightened. From her observation, PW3 did not threaten her or raise his voice at her. He also did not force her to sign the confession.
Having observed the demeanour and considered the testimonies of the witnesses, the trial judge was of the opinion that the prosecution witnesses were credible witnesses. The appellant`s version of events in court was inconsistent with her police statements. She alleged to the police that Tan had used force on her when he raped her. However, her case in court was that she had allowed Tan to have sex with her in exchange for treatment because her mind was `controlled` by him and therefore her consent was vitiated under s 90(a) of the Penal Code. In any event, she found that there was no evidence to suggest that the appellant`s consent was given under `fear of pain or injury or misconception of fact` in accordance with s 90(a) of the Penal Code.
The trial judge disbelieved her evidence that her mind was under the control of Tan who allegedly convinced her that he was the only one who could cure her. The evidence showed that the appellant consulted at least 37 other physicians to seek their second opinion. She did the same on 20 June 1998, the very day she was allegedly raped by Tan. Even though she was found to be of borderline intelligence, there was no sign of weak-mindedness or dependence she claimed to be labouring under. Based on the transcripts of the tape recordings, it was apparent that Tan was not in a position of dominance vis-Ã -vis the appellant as he was reduced to tears and had gone down on his knees. She even scolded Tan when he ejaculated into her without using a condom during their first intercourse. Her consent was also not given under any misconception as to the nature of the sexual intercourse. She had not been tricked into thinking that this was part of her treatment.
With respect to the transcripts which were tendered in court as evidence of Tan`s confession, the trial judge found no shred of evidence to support that allegation. There was no mention of `rape`. While Tan was clearly remorseful about something, there was no evidence to suggest that it was because he had raped the appellant. In fact, his wife testified that he was remorseful that he had sex with the appellant and had knelt down before her. Both the appellant and DW2 could not give any satisfactory explanation why they never alleged `rape` throughout the conversation.
The trial judge gave full weight to her confession and her cautioned statement, taking the view that there was no reason for her to lie. Based on the evidence, the trial judge found that the appellant had decided to offer Tan sex, thinking that he would then have to cure her of her ailments following several unsuccessful treatment sessions with Tan. When he failed to cure her, she became increasingly demanding and their relationship broke down. When he refused to treat her anymore, she felt angry and called up Tan`s wife to tell her that he had molested her. She managed to evoke enough sympathy from Tan`s wife, such that the latter convinced Tan to continue the treatment. When the subsequent treatments remain unfruitful, she started harassing him, making threats that she would report Tan for rape and molest. When Tan`s lawyers sent her a letter alluding to the sexual relationship between her and Tan, she had to make the police report of rape in order to appease her husband. It was also possible that she had lodged the report because she felt cheated that Tan did not fulfil his side of the bargain, that is, to cure her.
Hence, she held that the appellant had knowingly given false information regarding the rape because she knew all along that the intercourse was consensual. In view of the seriousness of the offence and the lack of remorse on the appellant`s part, the trial judge sentenced her to four weeks imprisonment on each charge. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant raised the following grounds of appeal: 
a the trial judge had erred in accepting the prosecution witnesses` version of events; 
b the appellant`s police statements were not false because her consent to sexual intercourse with Tan was vitiated under s 90(a) of the Penal Code; 
c the appellant`s confession was inadmissible; 
d the mens rea of the offence was not established as there was a reasonable doubt whether the appellant knew or believed that the police statements she made were false; and 
e the sentences imposed by the trial judge were manifestly excessive.
 Elements of the offence 
 
 
 
Section 182 of the Penal Code states: 
 
Whoever gives to any public servant any information orally or in writing which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, or to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months, or with fine which may extend to $1,000, or with both.
 
 
 
Thus, the prosecution must establish that (a) the accused person gave information to a public servant; (b) such information was false; (c) the accused person knew or believed that such information was false; and (d) the accused person intended or knew it to be likely that the information would be acted upon by the public servant in the manner contemplated by the provision. In this case, the counsel for the appellant only contested the issue of whether the second and third element of the offence were established.
 Whether the trial judge erred in accepting the prosecution`s version of events 
 
 
 
It was argued that the version of facts accepted by the trial judge was inherently improbable. Counsel for the appellant submitted that it was more likely that Tan was the one who demanded sex before he would treat the appellant. He pointed to several factors which, according to him, cast doubt on the likelihood of the appellant taking on the role of a seductress: the appellant was always dressed in casual wear like short pants and T-shirt; there was no evidence of any single attempt by the appellant to date Tan or any single moment where they shared intimate personal matters; and there was no evidence to pinpoint any motive on the part of the appellant to seduce Tan whom she respected and trusted as her physician.
Even though a substantial portion of counsel`s submissions were devoted to this argument, I found it to be devoid of any merit. In spite of the strenuous arguments mounted by him, I found nothing inherently incredible about the version of facts accepted by the trial judge which she arrived at after a detailed evaluation of the evidence. It could not be said that her findings of fact were clearly unsupportable by the evidence and were plainly wrong: see 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 . The appellant appeared to me to be rather obsessed about getting a cure for her ailments and had even resorted to drastic measures such as harassing Tan daily or threatening to commit suicide if Tan did not treat her. It was not inherently improbable that she may have thought, albeit gullibly, that by offering sexual favours to Tan, that would give him an incentive to cure her.
Counsel for the appellant also argued that the transcripts of the taped conversation showed that Tan was guilty of raping the appellant. As the trial judge correctly pointed out, the demonstration of remorse on the part of Tan was equivocal and it was equally consistent with the fact that he felt that it was unethical on his part to engage in a sexual relationship with his patients. Furthermore, if Tan had indeed demanded sex in exchange for treatment, it was simply inexplicable why the appellant or her friend DW2, nevertheless, did not mention a single word regarding the appalling misconduct of Tan during their taped conversation. Instead, the appellant merely complained and lamented repeatedly that Tan was unable to relieve her of her pain and discomfort.
At this juncture, I would like to make a brief reference to some drawings made by the appellant which allegedly documented the physical contact made by Tan during treatment and the two incidents of rape. It was contended that, since these drawings were made by the appellant contemporaneously, they were therefore reliable evidence of what transpired between the parties. In my view, the drawings did not conclusively prove that the appellant was raped. All they proved, if they proved anything at all, was that Tan had touched the appellant in the course of treatment and that they had sexual intercourse. As such, the documents did not advance the appellant`s case of non-consensual intercourse any further.
In view of the circumstances of the case and for the reasons cited by the trial judge, I found no justifiable basis for this Court to overturn her findings of fact.
 Section 90(a) of the Penal Code 
 
 
 
Section 90(a) of the Penal Code states: 
 
A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code -
 
 
 
 
(a) if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception.
  
 
 
Counsel for the appellant submitted that submission by a patient to her physician`s sexual demands could not amount to consent as she was labouring under the misconception that Tan would cure her. It seemed to me that the best case the defence could put forward on this issue was that the appellant had given her consent thinking that Tan would cure her thereafter. What was crucial in this case was that there was no misconception on the part of the appellant regarding the nature of the sexual act. By her own admission as well as the evidence of her husband, she obviously did not regard it as part of the treatment and that she had engaged in the act `in exchange for treatment`. In my view, given that she fully understood the nature of the act, her consent to such an act would not be vitiated under s 90(a) even though Tan did not subsequently manage to cure her.
Such a proposition is well established and is illustrated by the case of 
R v Flattery
 
[1876-77] 2 QBD 410
. In that case, the accused person engaged in carnal intercourse with the complainant under the pretence of performing a surgical operation to cure her of an illness she was suffering from. The court held that he had raped her and that her consent was vitiated. The complainant submitted to what was being done to her under the belief that he was merely giving her medical treatment. Thus, she only consented to the performance of the `surgical operation` and not to the sexual intercourse. In the premises, it was clear that the appellant and Tan had consensual sexual intercourse and her allegation of rape was therefore false.
 Whether the appellant`s confession was admissible 
 
 
 
The admissibility of the appellant`s confession was challenged on the ground that PW3 had threatened and induced her into making that statement by telling her that (a) she had no chance to contest the case and she would be better off admitting her guilt; (b) the polygraph test showed that she had lied; and (c) there would be newspaper publicity if she did not sign the confession. These same grounds were canvassed in the court below and were rejected at the conclusion of the 
 voir dire 
. Even though PW3 told the appellant that the polygraph test results showed that she had lied, there was no evidence to suggest that any other threats or inducement sufficient to render the statement inadmissible were made. It was held in 
Vadugaiah Mahendran v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 289
  that there was no reason why an accused person who was charged for unauthorised drug consumption could not be shown the urine test results before the statement was recorded, provided that nothing more was done which could be construed as an inducement, threat or promise. Similarly, the act of conveying to the appellant the results of her polygraph test 
 per se 
 would also not render her statement inadmissible. As such, I was of the view that the statement was correctly admitted into evidence.
In the course of the submissions, counsel for the appellant alleged that there were certain procedural irregularities in the investigation process. For instance, even though PW2 and PW3 had in their custody the secret tape recordings, they did not listen to them before taking the appellant`s statement. If they had done so, he alleged that they would have believed that the appellant was telling the truth and would investigate Tan instead. It was also alleged that, during the recording of her police statement in exh P6, she told PW2 that she continued her treatment with Tan because she believed that only Tan could cure her. However, PW2 did not record her explanation in the statement. It was contended that, because of this omission, PW3 suspected that the appellant might not be telling the truth about Tan raping her and that was why he interviewed her again for clarification. Further, it was submitted that PW3 was influenced by the results of the polygraph test before he recorded the confession.
The thrust of the defence counsel`s arguments was that these alleged irregularities had prejudiced the minds of the recording officers. A short answer to these contentions is simply this: the recording officers` subjective opinion of the appellant`s veracity and credibility could not possibly be relevant to the question of the admissibility of her confession, or, for that matter, any of the issues at hand before me.
 Whether the appellant knew that she was making a false statement 
 
 
 
The defence counsel argued that, even if the appellant`s consent was not vitiated, she did not knowingly give a false statement. For a charge under s 182, it is not sufficient to show that the allegations made were false, the prosecution must prove that the allegations made by the accused person were false to his knowledge or that he did not believe them to be true at the time when he made those allegations. Thus, it is a subjective test: see 
Fakirapa Ningappa Chikkabagewadi v The State
 
[1960] Cri LJ 1113
.
In support of his contentions, he argued that the recording officer PW2 did not dispel the possibility that the appellant was telling the truth when she accused Tan of rape during the interview. Again, I failed to see the relevance of his opinion or perception of the credibility of the appellant. The real issue was whether the appellant knew or believed that the allegations she made were false. In this regard, it is pertinent to note the contents of her confession to the police. In her own words, she said: 
 
I wish to say that on 22 September 1998, the statement which I gave to the Police Investigation [sic] Eddie Sim at Ang Mo Kio Police Division that I was raped by Tan Eng Huat is 
 not true
. I had given him a 
 false statement
 that I was raped [sic] by Tan Eng Huat on 20 June 1998 at Blk 304 Ang Mo Kio [num ]07-1135 because of the lawyer`s letter dated 21 September 1998. My husband had came [sic] to know that I had sexual relationship with Tan Eng Huat and I was afraid that he might divorce me. I am sorry for what I have done and I hope that I be given a chance. My daughter is still young, only 5 years old and they needed my care. I have done that to save my marriage. I hope the police will not inform my husband that I had made a 
 false report
 on the matter. 
 I did have sexual relationship with Tan Eng Huat voluntarily and he did that not against my will
. [Emphasis added]
 
 
 
In her cautioned statement, she merely pleaded for leniency without denying that she had committed an offence. In the light of her statements, the defence counsel`s contention that she did not know that she had given false information was without a doubt untenable.
 Appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
The appellant had four antecedents for drug consumption. It was submitted that the trial judge was influenced by these antecedents which were unrelated to the present charges when she sentenced the appellant. Having perused the grounds of decision, I noted that, even though the antecedents were brought to the trial judge`s attention, it did not appear from the judgment that she had taken this into account in determining the appropriate sentence. Instead, her main concern was that offences under s 182 were serious, as they involved the perversion and hindering of the administration of justice.
In my view, there were no real mitigating factors in this case and the appellant had shown no sign of remorse throughout the proceedings. Her allegation also led to the arrest of Tan. Any false allegation of rape must not be taken lightly. Not only is it a serious allegation, it is often difficult to verify because, in most of such cases, it is the word of one person against the other. Given the social stigma usually attached to such offences, it could irretrievably damage the reputation of the alleged `rapist` even if the allegations were subsequently proven to be false. In the light of the circumstances, it could not be said that the sentences were manifestly excessive.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the appeal.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The charge against the appellant was possession of controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking. The mainstay of his defence was his challenge to the proof of possession of a haversack that contained the drug. The appellant elected to remain silent and did not call any witnesses for his defence. He was found guilty of the charge, convicted and sentenced accordingly.
At the appeal, counsel for the appellant brought up several interrelated issues pertaining to the proof of possession as well as the admissibility of three long statements that were highly incriminating to the appellant. We unanimously rejected the submissions. We agreed that Justice Rubin`s scrutiny of facts was meticulous and that his findings of facts were amply justified. There was neither strong nor compelling ground, on either law or facts, to justify quashing the conviction.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The charge was that the appellant trafficked in a controlled drug, by having in his possession five packets of diamorphine weighing 32.27 g nett for the purpose of trafficking, without any authorisation, and had thereby commited an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (`MDA`).
The time and location of the arrest, as well as the identities of the parties involved were not challenged. Earlier on the day of arrest, a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) carried out surveillance on an apartment block at Kallang Bahru (`the Kallang Bahru apartment block`). A Malay male, later identified as Daud, was spotted at the void deck of the Kallang Bahru apartment block. At about the same time, one of the officers noticed a taxi arriving at the entrance of a multi-storeyed car park, next to the Kallang Bahru apartment block. Daud boarded the taxi from the front passenger side, seated himself and waited.
Then, the appellant was spotted at the corner of the corridor on the fifth floor of the Kallang Bahru apartment block. He was seen walking towards the staircase on the corridor of the fifth floor. Shortly after, the appellant emerged at the ground level. He immediately boarded the taxi from the rear left passenger side and occupied the rear left passenger seat.
The taxi driver testified that the appellant had a haversack with him then (`the haversack`). This was confirmed by Daud. Daud testified that, when he turned to the appellant and asked for the taxi`s destination, he noticed that the appellant had the haversack by his side. The appellant told them to proceed to a certain apartment at Yishun (`the Yishun apartment`).
The CNB officers trailed the taxi from Kallang Bahru to Yishun. At a certain junction, the taxi was intercepted by the CNB officers. Daud was arrested at the front passenger seat. The appellant was arrested at the rear passenger seat. The arresting officer, S/SSgt Tan testified that he saw the haversack laid beside the appellant.
At about 5pm, S/SSgt See and his team of officers arrived at the scene to take over the case from S/SSgt Tan and the arresting party. S/SSgt Tan briefed S/SSgt See and pointed out to S/SSgt See the haversack that was still beside the appellant in the taxi.
In the presence of both the appellant and Daud, S/SSgt See proceeded to unzip the haversack and found in it five packets of granular substance. These were later certified to be diamorphine by the Department of Scientific Services (`DSS`). A search was immediately conducted on Daud and the appellant. Amongst other things, a bunch of six keys was found in the appellant`s left trouser pocket.
At about 5.55pm, Insp Soh, with his party of officers arrived at the scene and took over the case from S/SSgt See, who handed over the haversack and the bunch of keys seized from the appellant. Then at about 6.25pm, Insp Soh, S/SSgt See and the team of officers brought along Daud and the appellant, and carried out a raid at the Yishun apartment. The officers used two keys from the bunch of six keys seized from the appellant, to gain entrance.
Both Daud and the appellant were brought into the Yishun apartment. In the ensuing search, some drug-related paraphernalia were found in a cabinet and a wardrobe, in a small room. They were: 
- from the left drawer of the cabinet, two boxes of candles; 
- from the right drawer of the cabinet: 
(a) a plastic container containing numerous empty sachets; 
(b) two stained pincers; 
(c) a digital weighing scale; 
(d) a plastic container containing a bowl with a knife and two spoons; 
(e) a box of candles; 
(f) a plastic container; 
(g) three stacks of envelopes; 
(h) empty sachets in a plastic bag; and 
- from the right bottom drawer of the wardrobe, a straw of heroin wrapped in tin foil.
Besides certifying that the five packets in the haversack contained a total of 32.27g nett of diamorphine, the DSS also certified that the bowl, two spoons and two of the plastic containers were stained with diamorphine.
The mainstay of the appellant`s defence was his challenge to the evidence of possession of the haversack. At the appeal, counsel for the appellant submitted that the prosecution had not proven beyond reasonable doubt the possession of the haversack by the appellant. It was submitted that there were numerous CNB officers on the specified surveillance mission observing the appellant and they were not merely perchance witnesses.
However, the evidence was clear on this. We will first highlight the relevant pieces of evidence, to demonstrate that there was no break in the chain of evidence showing that the appellant had physical possession of the haversack that contained the drug.
W/Sgt Yap spotted the appellant carrying the haversack as the appellant was walking towards and boarding the taxi at the entrance of the multi-storeyed carpark. This was not challenged by the defence at the trial.
The taxi driver testified that he saw the appellant with a haversack over his back. He even demonstrated to the court the manner in which the appellant carried the haversack.
Daud`s testimony on this confirmed the taxi driver`s testimony. Daud testified that after the appellant boarded the taxi, he turned to the appellant to ask him for the destination. Daud saw that the appellant had the haversack under his right arm. Daud also demonstrated to the court the manner in which the appellant held onto the haversack, and positively identified the haversack. The defence did not contest Daud`s testimony that the appellant had the haversack with him.
S/SSgt Tan, who arrested and handcuffed the appellant, also testified that the haversack was found in the taxi next to the appellant. The defence did not contest S/SSgt Tan`s testimony on this. In fact, the defence appeared to agree with S/SSgt Tan that the haversack was indeed recovered from the appellant in the taxi.
Whatever the contention regarding the surveillance evidence from the CNB officers of the appellant`s activities prior to his boarding the taxi, the indisputable fact was that the appellant brought the haversack with him when he boarded the taxi. This was confirmed by two witnesses, ie Daud and the taxi driver. And none of their testimonies could be faulted.
The appellant failed to successfully challenge this chain of evidence showing him having physical possession of the haversack that contained the drug. However, the presumption under s 17 MDA only arises where possession of the drug (not merely physical possession) has been proven. Many precedents can be found, such as 
Toh Ah Loh & Anor v R
 
 
[1949] MLJ 54

[1956] MLJ 237

 , 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
  and 
Yeo See How v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 390
 . The prosecution must also show that the appellant had knowledge of the drug in the haversack.
There was ample evidence to show that the appellant did in fact have such knowledge. We would address the evidence from his cautioned statement, the drug-related paraphernalia, the three long statements that revealed much of the appellant`s activities and were highly incriminating to him, as well as his silence when his defence was called. Taking into account all the evidence, we agreed that it was amply justified for the trial judge to have found that possession was proven beyond reasonable doubt, and the presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking under s 17 MDA was triggered.
 Cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the CPC 
 
 
 
In the cautioned statement, the appellant simply stated: 
 
I do not know anything about the stuff. That is all.
 
 
 
It was acknowledged by the trial judge. Counsel for the appellant submitted however that the trial judge had erred in law and in fact in failing to adequately consider and give due weight to the appellant`s defence disclosed by this cautioned statement.
In 
Tan Ah Tee v PP
 
 SLR 211 
, Wee Chong Jin CJ, stated that: 
 
once the prosecution had proved the fact of physical control or possession or possession of the plastic bag and the circumstances in which this was acquired by and remained with the second appellant, the trial judges would be justified in finding that she had possession of the contents of the plastic bag within the meaning of the Act unless she gave an explanation of the physical fact which the trial judges accepted or which raised a doubt in their minds that she had possession of the contents within the meaning of the Act.
 
 
 
The appellant`s bare denial in his cautioned statement, in the circumstances in which the haversack that contained the drug was found on him, as well as the finding and seizure of the drug-related paraphernalia by the CND officers in his presence at the Yishun apartment, allowed the court to infer that the appellant did have knowledge of the drug in the haversack.
 Drug-related paraphernalia 
 
 
 
Drug-related paraphernalia were seized at the Yishun apartment. They included a straw of heroin. Some of these items were also stained with diamorphine. In 
Abdul Karim bin Mohd v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 1
  and 
Chan Hock Wai v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 728
 , the finding of drug-related paraphernalia was treated as telling evidence of or, to be used as an inference of trafficking.
The utility of these drug-related paraphernalia was obvious. They were for the preparation of drug for sale. They were therefore relevant as circumstantial evidence reinforcing the finding of trafficking. This was further reinforced here, as a few of the items were stained with diamorphine, the same kind of drug the appellant was charged with.
In reverse, evidence of the drug-related paraphernalia illustrated that someone who was in the business of dealing with drug had more opportunity and was more likely to be in possession of the drug. It was thus very relevant to the principal facts in this case. The discovery of them strengthened the link between possession and trafficking, and worked both ways.
The relevancy of these drug-related paraphernalia was that the appellant, shown to be in the business of dealing with drug, had more opportunity and was more likely to be in possession of the drug, as charged.
 Long statements 
 
 
 
There were three other separate statements recorded on three separate dates, 11 August 1999, 14 August 1999 and 24 August 1999. They were highly incriminating to and revealing of the appellant. In them, the appellant admitted that he was in possession of the drug in the haversack, and knew that it contained the drug and that he intended to deal with it, by repackaging and selling it in much smaller sachets for profits.
There were objections to the admissibility of the evidence in these three statements. Voluntariness was made an issue. A voir dire ensued. On this, the law is settled, as seen in various authorities such as 
Gulam bin Notan Shariff Jamalddin v PP
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 181
 , 
Seow Choon Meng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
  and 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
 . The prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statements were made voluntarily. Section 24 of the Evidence Act governs the admissibility of the statements made to the CNB officers.
As counsel for the appellant submitted at length on the admissibility of these statements, we would deal with each allegation individually. On the day of arrest, inside the taxi shortly after his arrest, the appellant alleged that he was questioned by S/Sgt See in a stern manner. That was certainly far off from the borderline of a valid challenge. The case of 
Seow Choon Meng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
  made it amply clear that official interrogation preceding a confession may be robust.
On the day of arrest, at the Yishun apartment, the appellant was questioned by Insp Soh. The appellant was also once pulled aside by a tall Malay officer and was told that he had better admit and co-operate since he was caught with the drug. He also questioned the appellant in a firm tone about the drug. Again, this was an official interrogation preceding a confession. Again, we regarded it as robust, but not anywhere near a valid challenge on the issue of voluntariness.
The appellant alleged that on 6 August 1999, after the cautioned statement had been completed, Insp Soh showed the appellant the photograph of his son and his girlfriend. Insp Soh told the appellant to think about his son and girlfriend`s future, especially that of his son. Insp Soh told him to co-operate. Otherwise, he would recommend to the authorities the confiscation of his flat where he was residing with his parents and son. The appellant said his mind was not at ease, since he had only one son and both his parents were old. If the house were to be confiscated they would have no roof over their heads. He felt pressurised and confused.
The appellant also alleged that on 11 August 1999, the interpreter asked him about his sister. She told him that she had acted as the interpreter when his sister was facing a capital charge. The appellant said that whatever statement made on 11 August 1999 was not voluntarily given. He was trying to save the best for his son, his parents and the flat that they were residing in.
The appellant also alleged that on 14 August 1999, his mind was not at ease. He believed whatever Insp Soh told him about his son and house on 6 August 1999. After the statement was completed, Insp Soh told him to think about the charge he was facing. Insp Soh told the appellant again that he was going to recommend to the authorities that his house be confiscated because most of his siblings were involved in drug offences. The interpreter was not present at the time when Insp Soh told him this. The appellant said he was afraid. He believed then that Insp Soh was serious, as this was the second occasion he mentioned confiscation of the flat.
Had any of these last three allegations been accepted by the trial judge, the statements would certainly have been rendered involuntary. As was said in the case of 
Seow Choon Meng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
 , robust interrogation is an essential and integral aspect of police investigation. But there is a line to be drawn. The case of 
Sim Ah Cheoh & Ors v PP
 
 
[1991] SLR 150
  made it clear that if the questioning was too vigorous or prolonged, it would become oppressive, and the statements would be rendered inadmissible. We had no doubt that each of these last 3 allegations, had they been accepted by the trial judge, would have rendered the statements inadmissible. It is not a requirement that the inducement must relate or have reference to the charge in order to exclude a confession made as a result of that inducement ( 
Ibrahim v R
 
[1914] AC 599
, 
Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Harz & Anor
 
[1967] 1 AC 760
 and 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
 ). A threat made against family members could be sufficient to vitiate a confession ( 
Yeo See How v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 390
  and 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
 ).
The statement given on 24 August 1999 was made in a question and answer session. The appellant alleged that whenever he went out of line or was forgetful about certain events, he was corrected by Insp Soh and the interpreter. However, it was clear that the mere use of the question and answer method or cross-examination in recording a confession would not render the statement involuntary. This could be seen from the case of 
Sim Ah Cheoh & Ors v PP
 
 
[1991] SLR 150
 .
In the circumstances, the trial judge was satisfied that no vitiating comments, threats, inducements or promises were ever made to the appellant either during or before the commencement of the recording of the statements, as the prosecution witnesses` statements were by and large consistent and free from any significant inconsistency.
On the other hand, the trial judge found the claims of the appellant replete with contradictions and inconsistencies. We would elaborate on a few pertinent instances.
It was put to Insp Soh by the defence that after the interpreter left the interview room on 6 August 1999, Insp Soh told the appellant that he knew the background of his family members. But when the appellant was asked during his cross-examination whether that was so, the appellant answered in the negative.
It was also put to Insp Soh by the defence that after 6 August 1999 and before 11 August 1999, Insp Soh met the appellant and reminded him again to `better co-operate`. Insp Soh denied this meeting. When the appellant was cross-examined on this, he said he had not met up with Insp Soh during this period.
It was also put to Insp Soh that on 11 August 1999 he once again reminded the appellant: `Think about your child. Give me a good statement and I will know what to do for you.` Insp Soh denied this. It was put to Insp Soh that he told the appellant: `The drugs belong (sic) to Hamal. I know what to do about this. Better co-operate.` When cross-examined on whether these statements had been uttered by Insp Soh, the appellant replied in the negative.
It was also put to Insp Soh by the defence that he threatened the appellant on 14 August 1999 before the interpreter came in. But the appellant`s evidence in his examination-in-chief contradicted what was put to Insp Soh. The appellant maintained all along that when he went into the room of Insp Soh on 14 August 1999, the interpreter was already there.
It was also put to Insp Soh that on 14 August 1999, he told the appellant that the six keys seized from him belonged to the Yishun apartment and that he had better co-operate. Insp Soh denied making this statement. When the appellant was cross-examined on this, he could not recall.
Most important of all, when asked by the trial judge whether on 14 or 24 August 1999 Insp Soh put pressure on him by mentioning the possibility of the confiscation of the flat or the matter concerning his family members, the appellant simply said he could not recall.
From the record of proceedings and the grounds of judgment, it was obvious that the trial judge had exercised meticulous caution, in analysing the evidence and reaching his decision to admit the evidence from these statements. The decision to admit the evidence was amply justified. Authorities such as 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , at 719 and 
Ng Soo Hin v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 105
  have made clear that an appellant court would not disturb the findings of fact of a trial judge unless they were clearly reached against the weight of evidence. There was no compelling reason to do so here.
 Silence and negative inference 
 
 
 
There was more than sufficient evidence to call on the appellant to enter his defence, under s 189(1) CPC. The trial judge rightly did so. The legal authorities on this ( 
Haw Tua Tau & Ors v PP
 
 SLR 73 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 ; 
Sim Ah Cheoh v PP
 
 
[1991] SLR 150
  and 
 Oh Laye Koh v PP 
 (1995) 1 
 CLAS News 
 142) are clear. The standard allocution was administered, with the mandatory warning of possible adverse inferences under s 196(2) CPC.
However, when called upon to enter his defence, the appellant elected to remain silent. It was an informed decision. The trial judge granted an adjournment to let the appellant to reconsider his decision. He did not change his decision. Neither did he call any witnesses on his behalf. There was no submission from the defence, admittedly also upon his instructions.
As seen in 
Murray v DPP
 
[1994] 1 WLR 1
 and 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
 , a proper inference under s 196(2) CPC included the drawing of an inference that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged. The trial judge would necessarily have borne in mind whether taking into account all the other circumstances, a guilty inference was justifiable. As evinced in 
 Murray 
 and 
 Haw Tua Tau 
, it is a common-sense test. Intervention by an appellant court would only be exercised if it was obvious from the records that such negative inference was unjustifiable or unreasonable.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that an adverse inference ought not to have been drawn against him under s 196(2) CPC, and that it was not the only inference that could be drawn. The submission was that the appellant knew that he would be convicted if he could not come up with a good defence. This would never constitute a ground of appeal with any merits.
In the circumstances, both the appellant`s physical possession of the haversack that contained the drug, as well as the appellant`s knowledge of the content of the haversack were proven beyond reasonable doubt. The statutory presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking under s 17 MDA was triggered. That made out the offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) MDA. The appellant`s silence and failure to adduce any evidence to show that the drug was not for the purpose of trafficking necessarily meant that a guilty verdict was amply justified. Counsel`s submission that the trial judge erred in drawing an adverse inference against the appellant was unsustainable.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In this case, possession of 32.27 g of diamorphine was proven beyond reasonable doubt. The presumption under s 17 MDA was triggered. The appellant`s election to remain silent, refusal to call any witnesses, failure to explain his possession of the drug and to present final submissions at the trial, made it impossible for him to discharge the burden of rebutting the presumption against him, or to cast reasonable doubt on the case. There was no compelling reason to fault the trial judge`s decision to admit the three long statements. For the above reasons, we dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction and sentence.

: Although this was a minor molest case, the appeal raised significant legal issues. Counsel based the appeal on the lack of corroborative evidence, the way the court ought to treat the female complainant`s evidence, how caution ought to be exercised in treating such evidence and whether the case had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.
The complainant`s allegation was that the appellant touched the side of her right breast on a bus. The whole case turned on pure issues of fact. It boiled down to whose evidence to believe, the female complainant`s allegation or the male appellant`s bare denial of the offence. The trial judge, Audrey Lim, went for the complainant, finding her much more credible than the appellant. He was convicted and sentenced to ten weeks` imprisonment.
After going through the record of proceedings and hearing the submissions from counsel for the appellant, I found no compelling reason, either on facts or law, to overturn the conviction or to regard the sentence as manifestly excessive. I dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentence.
 The facts 
 
 
 
As the whole case turned on issues of fact, I shall lay out the facts in detail here. There was a single charge under s 354 of the Penal Code (`PC`) against the appellant, for outraging the complainant`s modesty by touching the side of her right breast. The date, time and place of the incident, as well as the identification of the appellant, were not challenged. The defence was a bare denial of the offence.
The complainant was a student. The appellant was then a treasury officer with a bank. They had not met before the incident. On that day, the complainant boarded a double-decker bus (`the bus`). She took a right window seat on the upper deck. During the journey, the complainant was listening to her portable radio with earphones. She felt two touches before she became more alert. She confronted the appellant on the third touch.
The complainant described the first touch as a `soft touch`. It was over the side of her right armpit towards the breast area. There was no movement and it lasted approximately four to five seconds. Thinking that it was an insect or the wire of the portable radio, she shuffled a little and adjusted herself.
The second touch happened some five to ten minutes later. Again, it was a soft touch, lasted about five seconds, and with no movement. She turned her head towards the area touched and saw a shadow from behind `pulling back`. She said the touch felt like it was by a hand. As she now suspected that it was the passenger seated behind her, she became more alert.
Within five minutes, the same touch came again, with the same sensation, at the same place. It did not last very long. When she felt it, the complainant immediately turned her head around. She saw a hand pulling back from the gap between her seat and the window, and that it belonged to the passenger sitting behind her, the appellant. She said the appellant was then leaning slightly forward, and when he pulled his hand back, he moved backwards leaning towards his seat.
She immediately stood up and asked him what he was trying to do. The appellant replied that he `just got excited`. The appellant however subsequently denied saying this. Shocked by the reply, she sat down and loudly told the appellant not to touch her again. She felt scared and angry. A male passenger across the aisle then told her to lodge a police report. The prosecution was unable to produce this male witness.
The appellant`s testimony was that during the bus journey, his mind was preoccupied with two things, namely, the currency exchange position that he had just created earlier in the morning, and the briefing which he was to give his colleagues later that morning. He said he was seated in a slouched position, with his knees propped up against the back of the complainant`s seat. He said he was holding his pager throughout the bus journey, with his hands resting on his laps, monitoring the foreign currency rates and various stock indexes.
The appellant said that, when he was confronted by the complainant, he thought that she was annoyed with him as he had propped his knees against her seat, or that his knees had clipped her hair in the process. He thus apologized to her. However, the appellant could not recall whether his knees had indeed clipped her hair. The complainant denied ever feeling that her hair had been clipped.
I found the trial judge`s reasoning on this much more convincing. If indeed the complainant`s hair was clipped or the appellant`s propping up his knees behind her chair had made her uncomfortable, the feeling of discomfort would have been on a completely different area of the body, certainly not the side of the right breast.
After the confrontation, the complainant walked downstairs to the bus driver, Lim, and informed him that she had been molested and asked him to send her to the nearest police station to lodge a report. Lim testified that she was very angry. At that point, the bus had already passed the nearest police station. Lim then stopped the bus and told her to borrow a handphone to call the police instead.
Meanwhile, the appellant came downstairs and tried to explain that it was all a misunderstanding. However, the complainant proceeded to ask the other passengers in the bus for a handphone to call the police. No one could lend her a handphone. Finally, the appellant offered his handphone to her. She took it from him and dialed for the police, told them her location, that she had been molested and that the offender was a Chinese. Lim testified that she was very angry throughout.
By then, the passengers in the bus were getting impatient with the delay. They wanted both the complainant and the appellant to get off the bus so that the rest of the passengers would not be held up for work. Lim opened the rear door, and some passengers alighted. The appellant asked the complainant to alight with him to settle the matter between themselves. She refused as she was afraid to deal with him alone. When the appellant alighted subsequently, the complainant followed him, fearing that he might run away.
At the bus-stop, the appellant told the complainant that he did not touch her breast and that she must have made a mistake. While waiting for the police to arrive, the appellant asked her whether she had informed the police of the right location. To that, she answered yes.
A police officer arrived soon after. The complainant immediately informed the police officer of the molest incident, recounting the three incidents of `soft touch`, and that the appellant, when confronted, told her that he `got excited`. The police officer noticed that the complainant looked very distressed, angry and almost in tears. In contrast, the appellant was very calm.
The police officer questioned the appellant who denied the offence and that he had said that he `got excited`. Instead, he claimed that he was holding on to the rail of her seat. When he was brought to the police station, he asked the police officer what redress he had against the complainant for making the allegations. Again, he was very calm throughout.
Another investigating officer recorded a cautioned statement from the appellant. It contained a bare denial. Nothing material turned on that. The appellant testified. There were no other witnesses.
 The appellant`s submissions at trial 
 
 
 
At the trial, counsel for the appellant suggested that a hand could not possibly have touched the complainant`s underarm and the side of her right breast without touching the nearby body parts. To this, the complainant replied that, although her arm was resting on her bag, it was not necessarily resting against the side of her body. She said the hand touching her was very straight. In re-examination, she clarified that she had been sitting with her arm slightly apart. During one of the incidents of touching, she had rested her forearm against the ledge of the window.
Counsel for the appellant also pointed out the appellant`s conduct after the incident. He did not attempt to escape. Instead, he offered his handphone to the complainant. He asked her to get off the bus to settle the matter between themselves. Whilst at the bus stop, he even asked the complainant whether she had informed the police of the right location. His s 122(6) CPC statement was not inconsistent with his testimony. Counsel thus submitted that such behaviour was not consistent with a person who had something to hide. In short, counsel relied on the consistency with which the appellant had maintained his defence.
For this, the trial judge reasoned that what the appellant had done was 
 not inconsistent either 
 with one who knew that he was in trouble. To run away in haste after being caught red-handed, would have aroused suspicion, making any subsequent defence much more unacceptable. There could have been reasons why the appellant did what he did, perhaps trying to pacify the complainant, hoping that she would relent and let the matter rest.
After all, the appellant was not uneducated or without his wits about him. He was calm throughout. I would have thought that an innocent person would have reacted rather differently on being accused of such an offence. He most probably would have reacted with great indignation and intense exasperation.
Of course, these were but postulations and explications. Nevertheless, they were based on common sense and understanding of normal human behaviour. More significantly, they showed that the explanation by counsel for the appellant regarding his behaviour after the incident was not the only plausible one. If at all, such behaviour must be treated as double-edged. As I said in 
Teo Keng Pong v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329
  at 339, a consistent defence does not always raise a reasonable doubt. I was not convinced that the appellant`s consistent defence in the circumstances and by itself was capable of casting a reasonable doubt.
 Principle of treating female witnesses in sexual offence cases 
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge failed to consider the complainant`s evidence with extreme caution, which the law required in sexual offence cases. Counsel brought up the issue of attributing to the female witnesses in such cases a special legal status.
The principle is that the courts do, and must treat every witness, whether female or male, alike. This is entailed by the basic fundamental principle of equality. Every witness`s evidence is to be treated with caution and to be analysed with the necessary meticulous attention and care, as the facts of the case require.
Unless this is proven to be the case in the first place, it is objectionable to argue that extreme caution is required because female witnesses are prone to fantasizing, exaggeration and lies due to some sexual neurosis. From my numerous judgments in the last ten years, I hope I have made clear that the court will no longer entertain such an argument, whatever the attitude was twenty years ago. Such generalised categorisation of female witnesses in sexual offence cases, based on the perceived dangers of false accusation caused by sexual neurosis, jealousy, fantasy, spite or shame, is not acceptable to a Singapore court today. Such dangers can easily be present in other cases too. To bring this up again in cases involving sexual offence, without pointing to specific facts justifying such extreme caution in a particular case, is both disingenuous and rather offensive in my view, and incongruous with the societal norm today. There would need to be an evidential basis for suggesting that the evidence of the witness might be unreliable. Mere suggestions by counsel would not be sufficient.
However, I am aware that in cases involving sexual offences, making an allegation is easy and rebutting it rather difficult. That is why I said in 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
  at 56 that evidence of such an allegation must be sifted with care. But this should be done in all cases, where the court is faced with two contested versions of events and has to choose one, for a decision one way or the other. I have elaborated further on this in [para ] 31 to 38.
Examples of similar cases where the court has merely the allegation of the complainant and the bare denial of the accused include physical assault and bag-snatching cases. These are not sexual offence cases. It does not make a difference whether the complainant is a female or male. In such situations, the court must be extremely cautious in convicting the accused based solely on the allegation of the complainant. But this does not mean that the complainant has to be treated any differently compared to other witnesses, or be given a special legal status. The extreme caution required is not based on the sex of the complainant. Whenever the court has to either acquit or convict the accused based on a single allegation by a complainant, the heightened risk of miscarriage of justice would necessarily prompt the court to be extremely cautious. It is a requirement necessitated by the amount of evidence available to the court to make a decision one way or the other, that impacts on the accused`s liberty.
Thus, the evidence of the complainant in a case involving a sexual offence need not be treated with any special legal status. Neither should it inhibit the trial judge from weighing such evidence in the usual way, bearing in mind such aspects of the human nature and behaviour as the trial judge considers to be material for that purpose.
 Corroboration 
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant submitted that corroborative evidence was required before the conviction could be justified. Counsel also submitted that the trial judge had erred in concluding that the complainant`s evidence was so reliable or unusually convincing that a conviction based solely on her evidence was not unsafe. These submissions were interrelated. For clarity, I will address them.
Firstly, I am aware that, although the ease of making an allegation and the difficulty of refutation are not just confined to sexual cases, they are generally of more concern in sexual cases. It is in the nature of sexual offences, that often all the court has before it are words of the complainant against the denials of the accused. Therefore, the appeal is not atypical.
Secondly, I made clear in 
 Tang Kin Seng 
 that in Singapore there is no legal requirement for a judge to warn himself expressly of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant in a case involving a sexual offence. But I also took great care to make clear that it is dangerous to convict on the words of the complainant alone unless her evidence is unusually compelling or convincing ( 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
  at 58, 
Teo Keng Pong v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329
  at 340 and 
Soh Yang Tick v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 42
  at 50). In short, the court is to be extremely cautious in relying on the sole evidence of the complainant for a conviction. The phrase `unusually compelling or convincing` simply means that the complainant`s evidence was so convincing that the prosecution`s case was proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of that evidence.
Thirdly, what is important is for the trial judge to analyse the evidence for the prosecution and for the defence with a view to deciding whether a conviction based solely on the complainant`s evidence is not unsafe. If it is not unsafe to so convict, the trial judge need not go further, except to explain clearly the reasoning behind the findings of fact.
Fourthly, if it is unsafe to convict, the trial judge should identify which aspect of the evidence is not so convincing. The trial judge should then look for supporting evidence and ask whether in taking the weak evidence, together with the supporting evidence, the trial judge is convinced that the prosecution case is proven beyond reasonable doubt.
Finally, in analysing the evidence, the trial judge must weigh it carefully, always bearing in mind the relevant aspects of human nature and behaviour. But it would be wrong to be bogged down by technicalities, especially when they have no logical bearing to the case in hand. Our approach is clear. We have left behind a technical and inflexible approach to corroboration and its definition ( 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
  at 60-63 and 
Soh Yang Tick v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 42
  at 52).
Instead, our approach is liberal, ensuring that the trial judge has the necessary flexibility in treating relevant evidence as corroborative. This is in line with the approach of other jurisdictions. What is important is the substance and the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the other weak evidence. Essential qualities of corroborative evidence are its independence, admissibility and whether it implicates the accused in a material particular.
Even if the evidence is capable of corroboration, whether it does supply corroboration still depends on all the circumstances of the case. The trial judge must pay particular consideration to the extent to which the evidence that is capable of corroboration does provide the corroborative evidence to satisfactorily dispel any doubt on the guilt of the accused. This flexible approach to corroboration ensures that proper weight is given to the right evidence and no undue weight is assigned to some evidence merely because it is called `corroboration`.
As I said in 
Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 767
  at 776, 
Soh Yang Tick v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 42
  at 53 and 
Tan Pin Seng v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 418
 , although s 159 EA ensures that the complainant`s former statement was capable of being corroborated, it was not independent evidence and thus had little additional evidential value. I also said in 
Tang Kin Seng
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
  at 65 that the evidential value of a prompt complaint did not render her complaint more credible. The fear that her reaction or distress might have been simulated or feigned has to be borne in mind. Here, the trial judge was aware that the complaint was not an independent piece of evidence and was essentially self-serving.
From the grounds of judgment, the trial judge was aware of all these issues. Counsel for the appellant relied heavily on the perceived unreliability of the complainant`s testimony. In short, counsel alluded to the risk of fabrication or concoction. In the circumstances, the trial judge correctly regarded the following as credible evidence: 
a she did not know the appellant before this incident; 
b the complaint was made immediately; 
c the distress accompanying the complaint; 
d the distress confirmed by both the bus driver and the police officer; 
e there was no reason to suspect any collusion between her and the persons she complained to; 
f she had no reason to frame him.
The trial judge also rightly took into account the fact that there was no hesitation in her reaction to what she perceived to be a molest incident. It was done in public and in full view of other passengers in a public bus. Furthermore, the trial judge also bore in mind that there was a great difference between touch on the side of the right breast and having one`s hair clipped or the feeling of discomfort as a result of someone`s knees propped behind one`s chair.
Counsel for the appellant did not raise the possibility of misconception. Neither was it dealt with by the trial judge. However, I thought it prudent to go on and consider the possibility that the complainant might have mistaken that someone had touched her breast when in reality it did not happen. If the appellant`s distress was the result of a wrong perception, when there was none, then her distress could not be a corroborative evidence. However, this possibility ought to be discarded as the complainant only became suspicious and alert after two touches and the charge was against the third touch.
Furthermore, when the complainant turned back to look at the appellant immediately after the third touch, she noticed that the appellant was then leaning forward and, when he pulled his hand back, he moved backwards leaning towards his seat. The appellant would not have been in such a position if, according to his evidence, he had been seating in a slouched position throughout the bus journey, with his knees propped up against the back of the complainant`s seat.
 Standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt 
 
 
 
The thrust of the submission of counsel for the appellant was that reasonable doubt had been cast. The points in the preceding paragraphs were linked to this ultimate issue. The question was whether the doubts as raised were real or reasonable, or whether they were merely illusory or fanciful. It is only when the doubts were real or reasonable that the prosecution had not discharged its burden, and the appellant was entitled to an acquittal ( 
Tang Kin Seng
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
  at 68, 
Teo Keng Pong
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329
  at 339).
Taking into account all these circumstances, I did not see how the appellant`s evidence was capable of casting reasonable doubt on the prosecution`s case. The trial judge was right to treat the complainant`s evidence as unusually convincing, that she was telling the truth and had no reason to lie. The trial judge`s findings of fact that the case had been proven beyond reasonable doubt were amply justified. I did not find this a proper case to disturb the conviction.
 How the trial judge arrived at the findings of fact 
 
 
 
This was a trial of facts, almost exclusively by oral evidence. These same issues invariably arise in all Magistrate`s Appeals in cases involving sexual offences, particularly molest cases. As I see it, the crux of the problem is simply that the appellants did not agree with the trial judges` findings of fact. Their dissatisfaction arose mainly because they could not see how the trial judge could have reasonably arrived at such findings of fact.
I mentioned in 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
  at 68 that: 
 
[i]n Singapore, it is the trial judge`s mind that is relevant. However, as trial judges, unlike juries, have to give reasons for their decision, there is the safeguard that an appellate court may intervene if he attaches undue weight to some piece of evidence.
 
 
 
In 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
  at 719, FA Chua J said: 
 
in examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor.
 
 
 
I take the opportunity to make this clearer.
In a case like this, the trial judge must always bear in mind that the objective of the trial is to arrive at reasonable and safe findings of fact. In the absence of circumstances which generate suspicion, every witness is to be presumed to be credible, until the contrary is shown. Defence counsel and the prosecution have the burden of raising the question of the credibility of each other`s witnesses. It is not a rule that a witness is to be presumed false until he is proven to be true.
The trial judge must also bear in mind that, among other factors, the amount of credibility to be given to the witness depends mainly on his ability to discern and comprehend what was before him, what has taken place, his opportunities of observation, the degree of accuracy with which he was accustomed to marking the passing events, and his integrity or honesty in relating them.
In such a case, the trial judge must also bear in mind that the weight to be attached to the witness`s evidence, among other factors, depends on his honesty, his ability, the number and consistency of the evidence, and conformity of the evidence with experience, and the coincidence of the evidence with other collateral circumstances.
For honesty and integrity, the trial judge must be open to any prevailing motive or inducement of the witness not to speak the truth. For the ability to speak the truth, the trial judge should take into account, among other factors, the opportunities that the witness has for observing the facts, the accuracy of the witness`s powers of discerning and the faithfulness of his memory in retaining the facts. For consistency, the trial judge must be aware that many seeming consistencies, will prove, upon closer scrutiny, to be in substantial contradiction, and vice versa. As to the conformity of the testimony with experience, the trial judge must be receptive to whether the facts related were such as ordinarily would occur in human experience. As to the coincidence of the evidence with collateral and contemporaneous facts and circumstances, the trial judge must carry out close inspection of the evidence, comparing its details with each other and with contemporary accounts and collateral facts, if any.
These are not and cannot be exhaustive. The trial judge has an onerous duty in assessing the veracity of the witnesses, the credibility of the evidence and the weight to be attached to the evidence. Ultimately the trial is a factual process, and not that of some mathematical truth-searching. Be that as it may, the trial judge`s reasoning must be as systematic, detailed and reasonable as possible.
The whole purpose of the guideline in 
 Tang Kin Seng 
 is simple. If the trial judge goes through this approach systematically, he will be much less likely to get tripped over certain dangerous or prejudicial reasoning pitfalls. The analysis of the evidence, with the amount of weight to be attached to it, will become more systematic, and less prone to impression and subjectivity.
Such a procedural guideline ensures that justice is both done and seen to be done. It shows how the trial judge has reasonably arrived at his conclusions, especially in cases where the complainant`s words are pitted against the accused`s denials.
The appellate court would not have the advantage of observing the demeanour and behaviour of the witnesses, unlike the trial judge. Thus, as a rule, the appellate court would not disturb findings of fact unless they are reached against the weight of the evidence, are plainly wrong or there remains a lurking doubt (s 261 CPC, 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
  at 719, 
Teo Keng Pong v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329

[1997] 3 SLR 464

Tan Chow Soo v Ratma Ammal
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 49
 ).
However, the appellate court will not be able to do so unless the trial judge shows very clearly 
 how and why 
 he reasons on the evidence presented. Unless the trial judge`s reasoning is shown with sufficient clarity and comprehensiveness, the appellate court will not be able to detect any possible unsafe or prejudicial reasoning that may have taken place.
Similarly, if the reasoning for arriving at the findings of fact is unclear, it is almost certain that the accused will be tempted to appeal. On the other hand, if the reasoning is clear and reasonable in the circumstances, there would be less tendency to do so, as the accused would know very well that the appellate court would be less inclined to overturn such a conviction.
Therefore, where there are keenly contested versions of events, the trial judge has the basic duty to lay down in a detailed and clear way how, why, the factors, evidence and considerations that he has taken or refused to take into account, the weight he has attached to them, in arriving at his findings of fact. On this, I would also refer to my judgment in 
Syed Yasser Arafat bin Shaik Mohamed v PP
 
 
[2000] 4 SLR 27
 . If the reasoning has been unreasonable or shows signs of bias or prejudice, then the appellate court will not hesitate to intervene.
From the grounds of judgment, the trial judge here did so with sufficient comprehensiveness and clarity. I found no compelling reason to fault her reasoning for arriving at her findings of fact.
 Sentence 
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the sentence of ten weeks` imprisonment was manifestly excessive. The sentence prescribed in s 354 PC is up to two years` imprisonment, or fine, or caning, or any two of such punishments. As I said in 
Chandresh Patel v PP
 (Unreported) and 
Tok Kok How v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 735
 , the benchmark for such an offence where a victim`s private parts had been intruded is nine months` imprisonment with caning. However, I also said in 
Teo Keng Pong v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329
  that for an offender without antecedents who committed relatively minor acts of molest under s 354 PC, a fine may be more appropriate.
In 
 Chandresh Patel 
, the offender, then a passenger aboard an SIA flight, touched the vaginal area of a female passanger on the flight. The sentence was six months` imprisonment with three strokes of the cane. In 
 Tok Kok How, 
 the offender, who had offered to share his umbrella with the victim, asked the victim if she was afraid of being raped and used the knuckles of his left hand to press onto her right breast while holding the umbrella over her. The sentence was nine months` imprisonment with three strokes of the cane. In 
Teo Kok Ham v PP
 (Unreported) , the offender, a taxi driver, fondled a sleeping female passenger and tried to pull down her bra. The sentence was six months` imprisonment without caning, as he was beyond 50 years of age.
In 
Teo Keng Pong v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329
 , the offender, a tuition teacher, molested his student by caressing her thigh, squeezing her on the back, touching her left breast and kissing her on the cheeks and lips. For the five offences of caressing her thigh and squeezing her back, the sentence was a $2,500 fine, in default, five weeks of imprisonment. For the other two offences of touching her breast, the sentences were three and four months respectively, a total of seven months` imprisonment.
In 
 Nordin bin Ismail v PP 
 [1996] 1 
 CLAS News 
 250, the offender, a police constable, molested a woman police constable at a police station, by placing his hand on her shoulder and her waist respectively. I reduced the sentence to $500 fine, in default one week`s imprisonment for each of the two offences.
Here, it was amply justified for the trial judge to impose a sentence of imprisonment. The appellant had touched the underarm that included a small part at the side of the complainant`s right breast. It was a soft touch. It lasted only a few seconds. Although the act of molest was minor and neither force nor coercion was used, the touch was on a private body part of the complainant. In such cases, there must be a sentence of imprisonment. The court must convey the disapprobation with which the court views such offences. The message must be unequivocal. The court will step in to maintain law and order, when individuals feel inclined to give in to certain impulses. And the court will maintain this with robust sanction. A fine will send a wrong signal to the public, at least in terms of deterrence.
The trial judge departed sharply from the benchmark. It was on the lower range on the scale of punishment for an offence of this nature. The trial judge stated that the two cases of 
 Chandresh Patel 
 and 
 Tok Kok How 
 differed significantly from the appeal. I agreed. Bearing in mind the appellant`s behaviour after the incident and that he had no antecedents, an imprisonment of ten weeks was sufficient punishment. I found no compelling reason to increase the punishment.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
I found no valid argument on the law. I agreed with the trial judge that the complainant`s evidence was unusually convincing, that she was telling the truth and had no reason to lie. Clear reasoning was shown in the grounds of decision. The findings of fact were amply justified. I dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentence.

: This was an appeal against the decision of the District Court given on 28 October 1999. The district judge had dismissed the appellant`s claim for damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by the tortious acts of the first and second respondents.
 The background 
 
 
 
The appellant, Amus bin Pangkong, was employed by Jurong Clavon Pte Ltd (the second respondents) as a general worker since 1994. The first respondents, Jurong Shipyard Limited (JSL), and the second respondents carried on the business of ship repairing.
On 12 February 1997, the appellant was instructed by the second respondents to carry out blastering work in the centre port tank of the vessel Stolt Eagle (the vessel). The work involved the cleaning of the tank of the vessel using a blastering gun. The vessel was undergoing repairs at JSL`s shipyard at the material time. The appellant carried out the blastering work from a platform about 9.5 m from the bottom of the tank. There were handrails positioned about 1 m from the platform. There were no footholds or toeholds on the platform itself. In addition, the tank was pitch dark except for a limited amount of light emanating from the lamps of workers who were working in the tank.
In the course of blastering, the appellant accidentally fell to the bottom of the tank and suffered severe injuries. When he was discovered by his co-workers, they noticed that he was not wearing a safety belt. Investigations carried out by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) after the accident revealed that there were no toe-boards on the platform on which the appellant was standing. This was a contravention of reg 93(1)(b) of the Factories (Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing) 1994 Regulations (the Regulations). The appellant has not worked since the accident.
Consequently, the appellant commenced an action against JSL and the second respondents. The appellant claimed damages for personal injuries suffered as a result of the negligence of JSL and/or the second respondents, a breach of their duties as occupiers of the vessel and a breach of their statutory duties under the Factories Act Cap 104 (the Act). He further pleaded the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur which point his counsel wisely abandoned in his petition of appeal and at the hearing together with his claim based on ss 28(1)(a) and (b), 33(1) and 62 of the Act.
Dr Chang Wei Chun (PW1) gave evidence on behalf of the appellant as to his condition after the accident. Tan Geok Leng (PW2), an engineer and factory inspector from the Department of Industry Safety at the MOM, was called upon to give evidence on the practice of his ministry as regards the enforcement of the Regulations. The accident report that was prepared by the MOM was annexed to his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. It was noted that the person who prepared the accident report, one Lee Kah Bee, was not in Singapore at the time of the trial. Accordingly, he was not called as a witness for the appellant during the trial. However, Mohamed Salleh bin Ahmad (Mohamed), Herman bin Ibrahim (Herman) and Idris bin Salleh (Idris) were called to testify on the appellant`s behalf. These three persons had been previously employed as blasterers for the second respondents. Another witness was Zainuddin Jamil (Zainuddin), a co-worker of the appellant who was working in the tank with the appellant when the accident occurred. Karthigesan a/l Eswara Chandran (DW3), the safety officer of the second respondents, was also called as their witness.
Chia Boon Sun (Chia) was a loss adjustor and surveyor who was engaged by the insurers of JSL and the second respondents to investigate the circumstances surrounding the appellant`s accident. Chia (DW1) had obtained a statement from the appellant about three months after the accident.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The district judge dismissed all the appellant`s claims against both respondents. She did not think that the appellant was truthful on the issue as to whether he had received safety training from the second respondents. The appellant testified that he was never given any safety training whilst he was employed by the second respondents. In contrast Mohamed (PW4) and Herman (PW5) stated that they had attended safety courses. Idris (PW6) did not undergo any safety training but stated that he already knew how to use the relevant safety equipment due to his previous employment in Malaysia. The district judge felt that the evidence as a whole indicated that employees of the second respondents were given training in the use of safety equipment unless they had already acquired the necessary skill and knowledge, as in the case of Idris. It was against this background that she found it difficult to believe the appellant`s evidence that he had mastered the use of sophisticated equipment, like the blastering gun, by himself.
The court below was also dissatisfied with the evidence of Mohamed and Idris on the issue of whether safety belts were provided to blasterers. In the course of cross-examination, Mohamed stated that he was taught how to use equipment such as the gas mask, helmet, safety shoes, gloves and ear plugs but was not taught how to operate the blastering gun. Similarly, Idris stated in cross-examination that he and his fellow blasterers were provided with all the relevant safety equipment except the safety belts. The district judge found it hard to accept the evidence of either witness that a safety course conducted by the then Ministry of Labour would cover all types of safety equipment save for safety belts. Accordingly, the district judge concluded that Mohamed and Idris were coached by the appellant as to the evidence they should give and were ready to pin liability on the second respondents as regards the non-provision of safety equipment.
The court below took the view that the bias of the appellant`s witnesses was demonstrated again when Mohamed and Idris were cross-examined on the second respondents` practice vis-.-vis safety rules and regulations. Both witnesses gave the impression that the second respondents blatantly flouted numerous safety rules and regulations. Accordingly, the district judge found that Mohamed, Herman and Idris were not independent witnesses.
In contrast, the district judge found Chia (DW1) to be an independent and reliable witness. Chia had recorded a statement (see exh `CBS 1` in his affidavit) from the appellant. In his statement to Chia, the appellant admitted that he was wearing a safety belt at the time of the accident but he simply did not anchor the safety belt because he was moving about on the working platform. As the appellant was not fluent in English, the statement was interpreted to him in Malay by one Omar Muthalif (Omar), who was the appellant`s supervisor at the time. According to Chia, the appellant signed the statement after the contents had been interpreted to him. However, the appellant denied that the signature on the statement was his. The district judge chose to believe Chia as she felt there was no reason for Chia to conspire with Omar against the appellant. Accordingly, the contents of the appellant`s statement were accepted as evidence that the appellant was wearing a safety belt on at the time of the accident and he was himself negligent in failing to anchor it to the platform. After considering the evidence of Chia, the appellant`s admission in the statement to Chia and the dubious nature of the evidence of Mohamed, Herman and Idris, the district judge consequently found as a fact that safety belts were furnished to the appellant and the other blasterers on 12 February 1997.
Having assessed the evidence, the court below then went on to address the legal issues. The issues were firstly, whether JSL and the second respondents were liable to the appellant in negligence; secondly whether JSL and the second respondents were liable to the appellant as occupiers of the vessel; and thirdly, whether JSL and the second respondents were in breach of their statutory duties under the Regulations, and were therefore liable to the appellant for damages suffered as a consequence of the breaches.
With respect to the first issue, the appellant alleged that the second respondents had breached their duty of care to him in two respects. He alleged that the second respondents were negligent firstly, in failing to provide him with a safety belt and secondly, in failing to ensure that the blastering work that was executed by the appellant and his co-workers was supervised. As the district judge had concluded that the appellant was in fact provided with a safety belt by the second respondents on the day of the accident, she accordingly found that there was no breach of a duty of care on the part of the second respondents in this respect.
As regards the appellant`s allegation that the second respondents had breached their duty of care in failing to supervise the blastering work, the district judge rejected the appellant`s contention that the second respondents were obliged to ensure the physical presence of a supervisor inside the tank of the vessel together with the blasterers. Whilst the second respondents clearly had a duty to provide a safe system and place of work, she felt that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ensure that the workers continue to use their safety belts given the darkness within the tank. Furthermore, the workers were required to move along the platform in the course of working. It would be impossible for a supervisor to ensure that all of them would re-anchor their safety belts whenever they moved to a new location along the platform. However, the district judge felt that the second respondents were obliged to ensure that the workers were specifically reminded to use safety belts at the commencement of their work. As they had failed to do this, the second respondents were in breach of their duty in this respect.
However, despite the breach of duty on the part of the second respondents, they were not liable in negligence to the appellant as the breach of duty was not the cause of the appellant`s injuries. The district judge noted that the appellant was aware of the importance of using a safety belt before carrying out his work in view of his own evidence that he would request for a safety belt before commencing work. The learned judge had also found that the appellant had been provided with a safety belt prior to the accident. Despite his awareness of the danger involved, the appellant did not secure his safety belt properly. Accordingly, the district judge concluded that the second respondents were not liable in negligence to the appellant as their breach of duty was not the proximate cause of the accident.
In relation to the second issue, the court below found that JSL and second respondents were not liable as occupiers to the appellant. As regards JSL, the district judge held that they were not `occupiers` of the place in which the appellant was working as JSL did not have a sufficient degree of control over the premises (see 
Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co Ltd
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 677
 ). Accordingly, occupier`s liability did not attach to JSL.
The second respondents admitted that they owed a duty of care to the appellant as occupiers of the tank. However, they contended that they had taken all reasonable care for his safety and were not liable to the appellant. The court cited 
Industrial Commercial Bank v Tan Swa Eng
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 716
  where the Court of Appeal held that an occupier would be liable to an invitee if four conditions were satisfied. The four conditions were: 
(1) the occupier actually knew or ought to have known of the danger that caused the injury; 
(2) the danger was unusual to the invitee, having regard to the nature of the premises and the invitee`s knowledge; 
(3) the danger was unknown to the invitee and the significance was not appreciated by the latter; and 
(4) the occupier had failed to use reasonable care to prevent damage from occurring, whether by notice, lighting, guarding or otherwise.
Applying the test in 
 Industrial Commercial Bank v Tan Swa Eng 
 to this case, the learned district judge found that the second respondents were not liable to the appellant as occupiers. Although the second respondents were aware, vicariously through their foreman and supervisor, of the danger that caused the appellant`s injuries, the danger was not unusual as it would be obvious that working on scaffoldings would be dangerous without a properly secured safety belt.
The court then dealt with the appellant`s claims that JSL and the second respondents had breached their statutory duties under the Act and the Regulations. The appellant alleged that JSL and the second respondents had contravened ss 33(3) and (7) of the Act. Section 33(3) of the Act provides: 
 
There shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, be provided and maintained safe means of access to an egress from every place at which any person has at any time to work and every such place shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, be made and kept safe for any person working there.
 
 
 
Section 33(7) of the Act provides: 
 
Where any person has to work at a place from which he would be liable to fall a distance of more than 3 metres or into any substance which is likely to cause drowning or asphyxiation, a secure foothold and handhold shall be provided so far as practicable at the place for ensuring his safety.
 
 
 
The district judge noted that counsel for the appellant did not make any reference to ss 33(3) and (7) in his closing submissions. Additionally, she accepted the submission from counsel for the respondents that the Investigation Report made no mention of a lack of foothold or handhold. In any event, she did not think that the evidence revealed a breach of these provisions.
In the light of her findings, the district judge concluded that the appellant had failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, his case on all three causes of action brought against both respondents.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Being dissatisfied with the decision of the court below, the appellant filed this appeal. In summary, the appellant raised the following grounds on appeal : 
(1) the district judge erred when she found that there was evidence to support the second respondent`s contention that the appellant had a safety belt on at the time of the accident. Consequently, the district judge erred when she concluded that the second respondents were not in breach of their duty to provide the appellant with a safety belt; 
(2) the duty to provide a safe system of work by way of supervision was continuous in nature and accordingly, the district judge erred in confining the duty to the commencement of the blastering work; 
(3) the district judge erred in finding that the second respondents` failure to supervise the workers was not the proximate cause of the appellant`s injuries; 
(4) the district judge erred in finding that the first respondents were not occupiers of the tank in the vessel; 
(5) the district judge erred in finding that the second respondents were not liable to the appellant as occupiers; 
(6) the district judge erred in concluding that there was no breach of s 33 of the Act on the part of the first and second respondents.
 Did the district judge err in finding that the appellant had a safety belt on when the accident occurred? 
 
 
 
The court had found as a fact that the appellant was wearing a safety belt at the time of the accident. This finding led the district judge to conclude that there was no breach of the duty to provide safety belts on the part of the second respondents. Support for the finding was derived from the contents of the appellant`s statement to Chia in which the appellant allegedly admitted that he had a safety belt on when the accident occurred. Although the appellant`s three (3) colleagues had testified that they were not provided with safety belts by the second respondents prior to the accident, the court below rejected their evidence on the basis that they were biased in the appellant`s favour. The district judge preferred to infer from the evidence that uniforms and additional equipment were provided to the appellant and his co-workers on the day of the accident.
It is trite law that an appellate court should not interfere with a trial judge`s finding of fact unless the finding is plainly wrong or unjustified by the evidence before the court (see 
Aircharter World Pte Ltd v Kontena Nasional Bhd
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 1
  at p 9). As stated by Lord Thankerton in 
Watt v Thomas
 
[1947] AC 484
 at 487
 : 
 
... an appellate court which is disposed to come to a different conclusion should not do so unless it is satisfied that any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge`s conclusion ... The appellate court, either because the reasons given by the trial judge are not satisfactory or because it unmistakably so appears from the evidence, may be satisfied that he has not taken proper advantage of his having seen and heard the witnesses, and the matter will then become at large for the appellate court.
 
 
 
Bearing in mind the fact that appellate intervention is warranted only in limited situations, I am of the view that the district judge erred in finding that the appellant was wearing a safety belt on the day of the accident for the reasons which I shall now set out.
The district judge erred in placing excessive reliance on the appellant`s admission to Chia in which the appellant admitted to wearing a safety belt when the accident occurred. The appellant`s statement was recorded by Chia about three months after the accident. Chia spoke to the appellant in Malay and recorded the appellant`s statement in English in his own handwriting. Chia stated that he had the contents of the statement explained to the appellant twice, once by himself and another time by the appellant`s supervisor, Omar. I find that the accuracy of the appellant`s statement to Chia is questionable. Chia did not testify to his proficiency in Malay nor was Omar called as a witness by the respondents. The appellant had also disputed the contents of the statement and denied that the signature on the statement was his. Further, Chia can hardly be considered an independent witness as he was an insurance adjuster engaged by the respondents. It is not unlikely he would have been inclined to obtain a statement from the appellant which would be favourable to the respondents. In the light of these facts, the court below should not have attached so much weight to, but should have disregarded, the appellant`s statement to Chia.
Secondly, there was no support for the court`s inference merely from Zainuddin`s evidence that uniforms and additional safety equipment were provided to the appellant and his co-workers 
 on the day of the accident 
. Indeed, the district judge`s treatment of Zainuddin`s evidence was unsatisfactory. She chose to accept an isolated part of Zainuddin`s evidence wherein he had stated that every worker was provided with safety equipment including a safety belt 
 prior to the day of the accident 
. The district judge even inferred from this statement that uniforms and additional safety equipment were provided on the day of the accident even though this was contrary to what Zainuddin subsequently said in cross-examination. The relevant excerpts of the cross-examination (NE 49 Record of Appeal 311) is set out below : 
 
 
Q: What do you mean by the last line of para 7 of your affidavit of evidence-in-chief? 
 
Paragraph 7 : 
 
`On 12 February 1997 safety equipment was available for use and I took a set of the safety equipment to use. My friend Irjan had also used a set of the safety equipment but I cannot remember if the [appellant] was using any safety equipment at the material time. The [appellant] has on other occasions used the safety equipment given to him. It is therefore not true that the [appellant] was not given any safety equipment to use.` 
 
A: Before you do the blasting, everybody was given the safety belt. 
 
Q: Did you see for yourself all the workers being given safety belts? 
 
A: We were given the equipment before the blasting work and 
 that was on a different day 
 (emphasis mine). 
 
Q: [The appellant] and three other workers formerly working for the [second respondents] gave evidence that there was no safety belt even when they asked for it and were told to work. 
 
A: On that day, there were no equipment. We were given the safety equipment long before [that day]. We keep the equipment ourselves. The equipment consists of lamp, gloves, shoes and ear plugs. 
 
Q: Did you say on 12 February 1997, there was no safety equipment available? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
The district judge chose to ignore the latter part of Zainuddin`s evidence wherein it was clearly stated that nothing was provided on 12 February 1997, which would have contradicted the inference she had made. Her reason for ignoring the latter part of Zainuddin`s evidence was that it was inconsistent with his statement that every worker was provided with safety equipment including a safety belt 
 prior to the day of the accident 
. Due to such an `inconsistency`, the district judge concluded that Zainuddin had demonstrated `divided loyalty` to the appellant and the respondents.
In my view, it was wrong for the court below to be selective in the treatment of Zainuddin`s evidence. There was in fact no real inconsistency from which a conclusion of `divided loyalty` could be inferred. It was not contradictory for Zainuddin to say that whilst safety equipment had been provided to the appellant and his co-workers some time before the day of the accident, no such equipment, be it safety belts or other sorts of safety gear, was provided on the day of the accident itself. Accordingly, the court`s inference that uniforms and safety equipment were provided on 12 February 1997 cannot be supported in the light of an express statement to the contrary by Zainuddin.
Apart from the questionable `admission` of the appellant in his statement and the mistaken inference by the district judge, there was no evidence to justify the finding that the appellant had a safety belt on when he was found at the bottom of the tank after the accident. The district judge herself had stated in her grounds of decision as one of the undisputed facts that the appellant was found by his co-workers after the accident without a safety belt on. Accordingly, the district judge was wrong when she found as a fact that the appellant was wearing a safety belt at the time of the accident.
 Were the second respondents in breach of their duty to provide the appellant with a safety belt? 
 
 
 
I will now consider the issue of whether the second respondents were in breach of their duty to provide the appellant with a safety belt either prior to or on the day of the accident. At common law, the employer-employee relationship gives rise to a duty on the part of the employer to take reasonable care to carry on operations so as not to subject the persons employed to unnecessary risk. In the decision of 
Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co v English
 
[1938] AC 57
, Lord Wright redefined the employer`s duty as threefold: `the provision of a competent staff of men, adequate material, and a proper system and effective supervision`. In relation to the duty to provide adequate material, it has been reiterated time and again that employers are under a duty to provide adequate equipment to their workers and would be liable if an accident is caused through the absence of some item which was obviously necessary or which a reasonable employer would recognise to be needed (see 
Williams v Birmingham Battery and Metal Co
 
[1899] 2 QB 338
; 
Lovell v Blundells & T Albert Cromptom & Co
 
[1944] KB 502
; and 
Ross v Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd
 
[1964] 1 WLR 768
).
In this case, the second respondents did not dispute the fact that a safety belt was an essential piece of safety equipment in connection with the appellant`s duties as a blasterer. However, there was insufficient evidence supporting the second respondents` contention that safety belts were provided to the appellant and his co-workers. Zainuddin was the only witness who stated that safety belts were provided some time before the day of the accident. However, he denied that any such equipment was given or was available to the workers on 12 February 1997. Zainuddin also reiterated in cross-examination and in re-examination that none of the workers used safety belts on 12 February 1997. On the basis of his evidence and the undisputed fact that the appellant was found without a safety belt on him after he fell, I can only conclude that safety belts were not provided to the appellant and his co-workers on 12 February 1997. It was also unclear if the appellant and his co-workers were provided with safety belts prior to 12 February 1997 as there was very little evidence to this effect, apart from Zainuddin`s ambiguous statement that the workers were given safety belts on a `different day`. In my opinion, the second respondents have breached their duty to provide the appellant with a safety belt.
Even if safety belts had been provided to the appellant, the second respondents had a duty to ensure that the appellant and his co-workers used the important safety equipment they were provided with in the course of blastering. I will elaborate on this when I address the second respondents` duty to ensure the supervision of the appellant and his co-workers.
 Were the second respondents in breach of their duty to provide a safe system of work by ensuring that the appellant and his co-workers were supervised? 
 
 
 
The appellant alleged that the second respondents had breached their duty of care in failing to ensure supervision over the blastering work carried out by the appellant and his co-workers. At the trial, the appellant and second respondents differed in their views on the extent of supervision required. The appellant contended that the second respondents were obliged to ensure that a supervisor was present inside the tank with the blasterers. The second respondents disagreed and stated that they were only obliged to ensure that the appellant and his co-workers were told to wear their safety belts.
The district judge concluded that the second respondents were obliged to ensure that the workers were specifically reminded to use safety belts 
 at the commencement of their work 
. As they had failed to do so, the second respondents were in breach of this duty. The district judge disagreed with the appellant`s contention that a supervisor was required to be present within the tank as she thought that it was impossible for a supervisor to ensure that all the workers would re-anchor their safety belts whenever they moved to a new location along the platform. The district judge also stated that it was impossible for anyone to ensure that the workers used their safety belts given the darkness within the tank.
In my opinion, the court below erred in confining the duty to supervise the appellant and his co-workers to the commencement of the blastering work. The employer`s duty to provide a safe and proper system of work requires that the employer devise a suitable system and instruct his men in what they must do (see 
Pape v Cumbria County Council
 
[1992] 3 All ER 211
). The width of the employer`s duty in providing a proper system of work was recently reiterated by the Court of Appeal in 
Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 579
 . It was there stated (in [para ] 48 at p 574): 
 
The employer is responsible for the general organisation of the factory or undertaking; in short, he decides the broad scheme under which the premises, plant and men are put to work. This organisation or `system` includes such matters as coordination of different departments and activities; the layout of plant and appliances for special tasks; the method of using particular machines or carrying out particular processes; the instruction of apprentices and inexperienced workers; and the general conditions of work`.
 
 
 
On the specific issue of the supervision of employees, it was stated in 
 Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd 
 (p 575) that `an employer`s duty includes checking to ensure that the system is followed by its employees`. Similarly, it was stated in 
General Cleaning Contractors v Christmas
 
[1953] AC 180
 that the employer must also exercise reasonable care to see that his system of working is complied with by those for whose safety it is instituted and that the necessary safety precautions are observed.
It follows that the second respondents were under an obligation to provide a safe and proper system of work and 
 to ensure that such a system was implemented 
. It was insufficient to merely provide the workers with safety belts and other safety equipment. The workers had to be supervised in order to ensure that the safety belts were put to proper use. The district judge felt that a reminder at the commencement of the blastering work was sufficient discharge of this duty; I respectfully disagree. The second respondents were at the very least obliged to ensure that the blasterers were regularly supervised as to the importance of using safety belts and other equipment in the course of the blastering operation.
The district judge had observed that it would be impossible to ensure the use and continuous re-anchoring of the safety belts by the workers since the tank was dark and the workers were constantly moving along the platforms. With due respect, there was no evidence to support these observations. In view of the fact that the appellant and his co-workers would be required to constantly move along platforms high above the bottom of the tank, in a dark environment illuminated only by their lamps, the imposition of a duty of care on the second respondents to ensure that the workers were constantly checked and supervised on the manner in which the safety equipment was used was clearly justified. Moreover, the employer should also be aware that workmen are often careless for their own safety, and his system must, as far as possible, reduce the effects of an employee`s own carelessness (see 
 General Cleaning Contractors Ltd v Christmas 
 (supra) at pp 189-190, per Lord Reid). Even if it was inconvenient to have a supervisor physically present inside the tank throughout the blastering operation, the second respondents were still required to ensure that a supervisor was nearby and periodically if not regularly, entered the tank to ensure that the workers used their safety equipment. There was no evidence at all that this was done by the second respondents nor was there evidence that it was unreasonable or too onerous to expect the second respondents to do this. Accordingly, it is my conclusion that the second respondents were in breach of their duty to ensure that the appellant and his co-workers were properly supervised.
 Was the second respondents` failure to supervise the workers the proximate cause of the appellant`s injuries? 
 
 
 
The court below had found that although there was a breach of duty on the part of the second respondents in failing to supervise the appellant and his co- workers, that breach of duty was not the cause of the appellant`s injuries. The reason was because the appellant was provided with a safety belt which he consciously chose not to secure properly. The district judge found that the appellant was aware of the risk and dangers of blastering from a high platform as he had said that he would request for a safety belt before starting the blastering work.
As stated earlier, I am doubtful whether the appellant was provided with a safety belt by the second respondents since he was found without one after his fall. Even if he was provided with a safety belt on a prior occasion, he was not reminded to use it nor was he checked or supervised on whether he was using one during the blastering process, on 12 February 1997.
In my opinion, the second respondents` breach of duty was the proximate cause of the appellant`s injuries. If the second respondents had provided the appellant with a safety belt and had exercised due care in ensuring that it was properly used, the appellant would not have been injured. The district judge herself conceded in her grounds of decision that `
 a properly secured safety belt would have broken his fall 
`.
Further, the fact that the appellant had stated that he would request for a safety belt before commencing the blastering work does not affect the chain of causation as it does not conclusively demonstrate that the appellant was aware of all the risks and dangers involved in the blastering process whilst he was working. As stated by counsel for the appellant, the workers or blasterers were illiterate and had little sense of danger. A mere request on the part of the appellant for a safety belt should not be interpreted as an understanding of and an assumption of the risks involved in blastering operations. The observations of Lord Reid in 
 General Cleaning Contractors Ltd v Christmas 
 (supra) at pp 189-190 that workmen are often careless for their own safety is particularly instructive in this regard. Accordingly, it is my conclusion that the second respondents` breach of duty was the proximate cause of the appellant`s injuries.
 Were JSL `occupiers` of the interior of the tank in the vessel? 
 
 
 
The court had found that JSL were not `occupiers` as they had no control over the conditions within the tank. The mere fact that JSL had signed on the Application Form (P76) did not mean that they owed a duty of care to the appellant as occupiers of the premises. The court commented that although JSL were occupiers of the shipyard itself, they could not be considered occupiers of the interior of the tank.
In 
 Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co Ltd 
 (supra), the Court of Appeal had to consider the issue of whether the main contractors, Shun Shing, were liable to the plaintiff as occupiers of the construction site despite the fact that the whole of the construction works had been subcontracted to several parties, one of whom was responsible for employing the plaintiff. The plaintiff had been injured as a result of an accident at the construction site. The Court of Appeal held that Shun Shing were occupiers of the entire site including the site office where the accident took place. The Court of Appeal was of the view that Shun Shing had a sufficient degree of control over the site even though the other subcontractors also had some degree of control over the part of the site where the accident occurred. Being the main contractors, Shun Shing had an interest in the construction work and remained answerable to HDB, the owners of the site, for the work in question. The Court of Appeal did not consider the issue of whether HDB, the owner of the site, were occupiers as HDB was not a defendant in the proceedings.
The Court of Appeal in 
 Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co Ltd 
 adopted the following passage from the judgment of Lord Denning in 
Wheat v E Lacon and Co Ltd
 
[1966] AC 552
 at p 578 : 
 
... wherever a person has a sufficient degree of control over premises that he ought to realise that any failure on his part to use care may result in injury to a person coming lawfully there, then he is an `occupier` and the person coming lawfully there is his `visitor` : and the `occupier` is under a duty to his `visitor` to use reasonable care. In order to be an `occupier` it is not necessary for a person to have entire control over the premises. He need not have exclusive occupation. Suffice it that he has some degree of control. He may share the control with others. Two or more may be `occupiers`.
 
 
 
At p 580, Lord Denning observed by way of dictum: 
 
... where an owner employed an independent contractor to do work on premises or a structure, the owner was usually still regarded as sufficiently in control of the place as to be under a duty towards all those who might lawfully come there.
 
 
 
It follows from 
 Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co Ltd 
 and the dictum of Lord Denning in 
 Wheat v E Lacon & Co Ltd 
 that JSL were occupiers of the shipyard and the interior of the vessel. As owners of the shipyard, they must have had some degree of control and interest over the works on vessels in their shipyard. Indeed, it was stated by Tan Geok Leng (Tan), an engineer and factory inspector from the MOM, that JSL were regarded as the occupiers. Tan also stated that JSL were ultimately responsible for approving the erection of the necessary scaffolding. It was clear that JSL had some measure of control and influence over the operations that took place in the tank. Although they may have subcontracted out the actual blastering work to the second respondents, the fact that they may not have `
 immediate supervision and control 
` over the appellant and his co-workers does not mean that they ceased to be occupiers at law (see 
 Wheat v E Lacon & Co Ltd 
 (supra) at p 579, per Lord Denning).
I disagree with the court`s conclusion that whilst JSL were occupiers of the shipyard in general, they were not occupiers of the interior of the vessel. If the district judge`s conclusion was correct, it would effectively mean that JSL could transfer their responsibilities as occupiers by contracting out the blastering and other works that take place within vessels at their shipyard to other parties, such as the second respondents. This would set a dangerous precedent at law. Accordingly, it is my view that JSL were occupiers of the shipyard, including the interior of the tank in question of the vessel.
 Were JSL and the second respondents liable to the appellant as occupiers of the tank? 
 
 
 
In view of my conclusion above and the second respondents` admission that they were occupiers of the tank, the issue that needs to be addressed is whether JSL and the second respondents were liable to the appellant as occupiers of the tank.
In substance, the duty of an occupier to an invitee would be to prevent damage or injury from any unusual dangers on the premises he knew or ought to know and which the invitee does not know about. In 
 Industrial Commercial Bank v Tan Swa Eng 
 (supra) , the Court of Appeal laid down four conditions which had to be satisfied before liability can attach to occupiers. The conditions are : 
 
 
(1) the occupier actually knew or ought to have known of the danger that caused the injury; 
 
(2) the danger was unusual to the invitee, having regard to the nature of the premises and the invitee`s knowledge; 
 
(3) the danger was unknown to the invitee and the significance was not appreciated by the latter; and 
 
(4) the occupier had failed to use reasonable care to prevent damage from occurring, whether by notice, lighting, guarding or otherwise.
  
 
 
I agree with the district judge that JSL and the second respondents were not liable to the appellant as occupiers. In my opinion, condition (2) was not satisfied in relation to JSL and the second respondents as the danger in this case was not unusual to the appellant, having regard to the nature of the premises and the appellant`s knowledge. As there are hardly any local decisions that discuss or define what constitutes an unusual danger, some assistance may be derived from English decisions that considered this point. These English decisions are relevant as they predate the Occupier`s Liability Act 1957 in England which effectively replaced the common law rules on occupier`s liability.
It is clear that what constitutes an unusual danger is a matter of fact and degree in all circumstances. In 
London Graving Dock Co v Horton
 
[1951] AC 737
, the House of Lords held that an unusual risk is one which is not usually found in carrying out the task which the invitee has in hand. Accordingly, in 
Stowell v Railway Executive
 
[1949] 2 KB 519
, a patch of oil on a railway platform was an unusual danger to a person who was there to meet a passenger. In contrast, a defective window was held not to be an unusual danger for a window cleaner in 
Christmas v General Cleaning Contractors Ltd
 
[1952] 1 KB 141
.
The English position was followed in the Malaysian Federal Court in 
Lee Lau & Sons Realty Sdn Bhd v Tan Yah & Ors
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 51
 . In that case, recovery was denied to a forklift operator who was killed when the machine fell on him. Upon the instructions of the defendants` servant, the plaintiff had jacked up the machine and rested it on two tree stumps. These collapsed when the plaintiff was inspecting the machine. The Federal Court held that the fact that there may have been a dangerous situation per se did not constitute unusual danger. Citing 
 London Graving Dock Co v Horton 
 (supra), the Federal Court held that the occupier`s duty was confined to protection against unusual dangers and an unusual risk is not one which is usually found in carrying out the task which the invitee has at hand.
For similar reasons, the danger in 
 Industrial Commercial Bank v Tan Swa Eng 
 (supra) was unusual. In that case, the occupiers were tenants who occupied the ground floor of the New World Hotel. The hotel collapsed and caused the death of two of the occupiers` customers. It was clear that the danger of the premises collapsing was a danger which was unusual to the two deceased as `no customer is expected to guard against such dangers when he walks into the occupier`s premises as an invitee` (per Lai Kew Chai J at p 721).
In my opinion, the danger faced by the appellant in this case was not unusual. The risk of falling off a high platform is inherent in the task of blastering whilst moving along a platform positioned some 9.5 m above the bottom of a tank, in dark conditions. The danger was not unusual to the task the appellant was required to carry out. In view of my conclusion in this regard, I do not think it necessary to examine whether or not the other conditions have been satisfied. Suffice it to say that the appellant should be denied recovery under this claim.
 Were JSL and second respondent in breach of s 33 of the Act? 
 
 
 
The district judge found that there was no breach of ss 33(3) and (7) of the Act. In her grounds of decision she stated that JSL and the second respondents were also in breach of ss 33(8) and (9) of the Act. However, sub-ss (8) and (9) were not specifically pleaded by the appellant. Accordingly, I will only consider whether sub-ss (3) and (7) have been breached.
Section 33 of the Act provides : 
 
 
(1) All places of work, floors, steps, stairs, passages, gangways and means of access shall - 
 
(a) be of sound construction and properly maintained; and

With respect to s 33(3) of the Act, counsel for both respondents stated that the burden of proof was on the appellant to prove a breach of the section. This view was, with due respect, mistaken. In 
 Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co Ltd 
 (supra), the Court of Appeal addressed the issue of the burden of proof in relation to s 33(3) of the Act. Whilst acknowledging that the duty under s 33(3) was not absolute, being qualified by the phrase `so far as is reasonably practicable`, the Court of Appeal stated that the burden of proving what is reasonably practicable in relation to s 33(3) lies not on the person injured but on the person responsible for maintaining the safety of the workplace. Support for this view was derived from the House of Lords` decision of 
Nimmo v Alexander Cowan and Sons Ltd
 
[1968] AC 107
.
In 
 Nimmo v Alexander Cowan and Sons Ltd 
, Lord Guest stated (at pp 121-122) : 
 
The object of [s 33(3)] was to provide for a safe working place by imposing criminal and civil liability on the occupier in the event of breach ... To treat the onus as being on the pursuer seems to equiperate the duty under statute to the duty under common law, namely, to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to keep the working place safe. I cannot think that the section was intended to place such a limited obligation on employers.
 
 
 
In the same case, Lord Upjohn stated (at pp 125-126): 
 
[T]he whole object of the Factories Act is to reinforce the common law obligation of the employer to take care for the safety of his workmen ... I cannot believe that Parliament intended to impose on the injured workman ... the obligation to aver with the necessary particularity the manner in which the employer should have employed reasonably practicable means to make and keep the place safe for him ... it is the duty of the employer to make the place safe so far as is reasonable practicable. It is his duty with his experts to consider the state of the place of work in all circumstances and to take whatever steps he can, so far as is reasonably practicable, to make it safe. He must know and be able to give reasons why he considered it was impracticable for him to make the place safe. If he cannot explain that, it can only be because he failed to give it proper consideration, in breach of his bounden duty to the safety of his workmen.
 
 
 
In 
 Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co Ltd 
 (supra), the Court of Appeal held that Shun Shing had breached their statutory duty under s 33(3) of the Act as they had not shown that they had taken any steps to ensure that the site office was of sound construction and was properly maintained. They also had not shown that they had taken steps, so far as was reasonably practicable, to ensure that the site office was made and kept safe for any person working therein. The fact that the site office collapsed in the circumstances in which it would ordinarily have withstood is clear evidence that Shun Shing had breached their statutory duties.
In a similar vein, it was not disputed that the appellant was found at the bottom of the tank without a safety belt on. In my view, this was a clear indication that the appellant was either not provided with a safety belt or was not supervised or reminded to use one while blastering. JSL and the second respondents did not adduce sufficient evidence to show that they had taken steps, so far as was reasonably practicable, to ensure that the platform inside the tank of the vessel was kept safe for workers who carried out the blastering operations. There was no evidence to show that the workers who were required to perform the blastering works were adequately supervised on the use of safety equipment nor was there cogent evidence that the workers were given safety equipment on the day of the accident. Accordingly, there was a breach of the duty under s 33(3) of the Act. For the reasons already stated, I have no doubt that this breach of duty was the cause of the appellant`s injuries.
As for s 33(7) of the Act, I agree with the district judge that the Investigation Report did not make any mention of a lack of foothold or handhold, or that any foothold or handhold was not secure. In the absence of any evidence to this effect, it cannot be said that s 33(7) has been breached. Accordingly, the claim under this provision should be dismissed.
 Contributory negligence 
 
 
 
The district judge suggested in her grounds of decision that the appellant himself might have been contributorily negligent. According to her, if the appellant had been standing firmly on the platform, he would have not lost his balance and fallen to the bottom of the tank.
In my view, there was no evidence to support the suggestion that the appellant was not standing firmly on the platform. Even if he was not standing firmly, the appellant would not have fallen if he was wearing a safety belt. Furthermore, the appellant`s awareness of the importance of the safety belt cannot be interpreted to mean that he fully appreciated the significance of the risks involved in not wearing one. As stated in 
 Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd 
(supra), `
 the whole object of the law in imposing a duty on employers to provide a safe system of work is precisely to protect an employee from his won inadvertence or carelessness 
`. Although it is not necessary for me to express my view in this regard, I did not think the evidence indicated that the appellant himself had been contributorily negligent. In any case the defence of contributory negligence was not pleaded - I disallowed the application by counsel for the respondents to amend his clients` defence to add this plea, before hearing of the appeal commenced. The application to amend was made far too late in the day and if allowed, would have caused irreparable prejudice to the appellant`s case which no order for costs could possibly compensate, not to mention that the case would have to be re-heard to adduce further evidence on this issue.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In my opinion, the district judge erred in finding that the second respondents were not liable in negligence to the appellant. She also erred in concluding that both respondents were not in breach of s 33(3) of the Factories Act. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal. The judgment below is therefore reversed (together with the order for costs) in the appellant`s/plaintiff`s favour. There will be interlocutory judgment in favour of the appellant against the respondents and the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts is directed to assess damages due to the appellant. Costs of this appeal are awarded to the appellant and the security for costs should be refunded to the appellant`s solicitors.

 Facts 
The appellants in this case, two brothers, were convicted under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`PC`) of voluntarily causing hurt to the respondents. The respondents were one Thomas Ng Loy Yam (`Thomas Ng`), and his mother Madam Sim Ng Siew (`Madam Sim`).
On 10 October 1998, the respondents, together with about ten of their relatives, went to Bee Low See Temple at 71B Jalan Jurong Kechil, Singapore (`the temple`), to pray for a deceased relative. On that same day, the appellants and their relatives were praying and conducting rites for the appellants` deceased father at the same temple. The first appellant was annoyed by the noise that the respondents` group was making. A scuffle broke out abruptly between Thomas Ng and the appellants over this, in the course of which Thomas Ng and Madam Sim were hurt. Thomas Ng sustained minor injuries. Unfortunately, Madam Sim sustained injuries that were of a more serious nature, namely, a fracture in the lowest vertebrae of her thoracic spine.
The day after the incident, Thomas Ng lodged an official complaint with the police about that incident, alleging that he and his mother had been assaulted by the appellants. The police carried out investigations, but no charges were preferred by the State. Thomas Ng and Madam Sim then took out a private summons, and brought the matter to trial in the magistrate`s courts.
During the trial, two different versions of evidence emerged. Each party made different allegations as to who had been the aggressor, who threw the first punch, and who had in fact caused Madam Sim`s injuries.
 The prosecution`s version of evidence 
 
 
 
The prosecution`s key witnesses were Thomas Ng, Madam Sim and Thomas Ng`s cousin, one `Ah Hai` (PW4). All three witnesses testified as follows: upon entering the temple, the respondents and their relatives were talking amongst themselves and searching for their deceased relative`s tablet on the shelves. At that time, the appellants and their relatives were chanting and carrying out rituals a few feet away. Suddenly, the first appellant shouted angrily at the respondents in Hokkien: 
 
You are talking so loudly. Do you know what place is this?
 
 
 
At this, PW4 replied in a calm and polite tone: 
 
Brother we can talk over this matter - don`t have to be so loud.
 
 
 
The first appellant continued to shout at PW4, so PW4 walked away and sat down in a chair nearby. Thomas Ng, upon observing this, went up to the first appellant and repeated what PW4 had said. Before he finished his sentence, the first appellant swung his right fist at him, and punched him hard on the left part of his forehead. He fell down to the ground. Madam Sim, who was 67 years old at the time, and hard of hearing, had been oblivious to this, as she was searching for her relative`s tablet on the shelves. At this point, she turned around to talk to Thomas Ng, and saw him lying on the ground. She hurried over to his side, and helped him up by his left arm. The second appellant came charging towards them, and pushed both of them to the ground. As they were lying on the ground, the second appellant kicked Thomas Ng in the lower abdomen. Thereafter, the respondents` relatives intervened and put a stop to the incident. They attended to Madam Sim, who was crying out in pain. An ambulance was called and Madam Sim was conveyed to the hospital. According to the respondents, no one from their group had assaulted either of the appellants at any time.
The other two witnesses called by the prosecution were medical officers who had attended to Thomas Ng and Madam Sim immediately after the incident. The medical evidence showed that Madam Sim had fractured a vertebrae in her lower back. This injury was consistent with her falling down and landing on her bottom. Thomas Ng sustained the following injuries: a bruise on the left side of his forehead, a bruise between his eyebrows, tenderness over his right lower chest, two bruises on his left foot, and abrasions over his upper arm and right wrist.
 The defence`s version of evidence 
 
 
 
The appellants` version of evidence was different from that given by the respondents. The first appellant gave the following account of the incident, and his evidence was essentially echoed by the second appellant and their sister, DW3: the respondents` group was talking noisily in the temple, and the appellants` younger sister had said `Shhh !` This quietened the respondents` group for a while, but their noise level went up again soon after. The first appellant stood up, stepped forward and told the respondents` group in Mandarin: 
 
Oi. Can you all please not talk so loudly. This is not a supermarket.
 
 
 
At this, PW4 approached him and said something to the effect of 
 
Why are you talking so loudly, we can discuss matters.
 
 
 
To this, the first appellant replied that the respondents were the ones who were disturbing him and not the other way around. Three other persons from the respondents` group joined PW4. Together, the four of them surrounded the first appellant, and were arguing with him. Suddenly, Thomas Ng, who had been outside the temple up to this point, was alerted by the commotion and charged into the temple. He stood behind PW4 and his other three relatives, and joined in the argument. He made an insulting gesture, by pointing his middle finger in the first appellant`s face. The first appellant pushed Thomas Ng`s hand away, whereupon PW4 and the other three persons raised their fists as if to assault him. Then, Thomas Ng, who was still behind his relatives at this point, `jumped up and hit the first appellant`s head with his fist`. Thereafter, the first appellant warded off the blows of his five attackers by blocking them with his arms. Then he heard someone cry out, and the fighting stopped. He saw Madam Sim lying on the ground. The second appellant added that, when he saw Thomas Ng jump up and hit the first appellant, he intervened and defended the first appellant. He parried the blows of the five assailants. Suddenly he heard someone cry out, and he saw Thomas Ng and Madam Sim lying on the ground. Thereafter, one of his sisters called an ambulance, and Madam Sim was conveyed away in the ambulance.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned magistrate who heard the case believed the prosecution`s version of evidence over that of the defence. However, he found that there was no element of `common intention` between the appellants to voluntarily cause hurt to the respondents. Thus, he amended the original charges which they faced, which were charges of voluntarily causing hurt to the respondents with a common intention under s 323 read with s 34 of the PC, to charges of voluntarily causing hurt to the respondents under s 323 of the PC. Thereafter, he convicted the first appellant for one offence of voluntarily causing hurt to Thomas Ng and sentenced him to two weeks` imprisonment. He convicted the second appellant for two offences of voluntarily causing hurt to Thomas Ng and Madam Sim, and passed a sentence of three months` imprisonment for each offence, the sentences to run concurrently. Being dissatisfied with their convictions and sentences, the appellants appealed to me.
 Issues in the appeal 
 
 
 
Before me, counsel for the appellant argued that the appellants` convictions were against the weight of evidence in the case. He submitted that the magistrate had erred in believing the respondents` version of evidence over that of the appellants`, for there were several material inconsistencies in the testimonies of the respondents` witnesses. He argued that in any event the second appellant should not have been convicted of the second charge for voluntarily causing hurt to Madam Sim, for she had been hurt accidentally. Alternatively, it was argued that the sentences received by both appellants were manifestly excessive.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The alleged `material inconsistencies` in the respondents` evidence
 
Faced with two versions of evidence, which differed in details, the learned magistrate had to decide which version to believe. Having heard and observed all the witnesses, and having reviewed all the evidence before him, he believed the respondents` witnesses and their version over that of the appellants`. At the appeal, counsel for the appellants argued that the magistrate had erred in this respect, for there were material inconsistencies in the respondents` testimonies.
First, counsel for the appellants submitted that the respondents had been evasive as to how the confrontation between the two parties had arisen. He argued that, on the one hand, the respondents had said that there was no reason for the first appellant to be upset on that day, but, on the other hand, the evidence showed that they had clearly known that the first appellant was upset by the noise they were making. I disagreed that these aspects of the respondents` evidence were evasive or contradictory. Although they had been aware that the first appellant was angry because of the noise level emanating from them, there was no reasonable cause for his anger as they had not been talking very loudly. This was their subjective opinion, and they were entitled to it, especially in view of the fact that even the first appellant himself had testified in cross-examination that the respondents` group was merely talking `slightly louder than normal`.
According to the respondents, no one in their group had assaulted either of the appellants. Counsel for the appellants submitted that this aspect of their evidence was highly incredible, for, if that had been the case, there would have been no reason for the second appellant to have lost his composure and rushed in to help the first appellant. I was not convinced by this submission. The second appellant`s motive for getting involved was obviously to take the side of his brother against Thomas Ng. That was reason enough for his involvement. Moreover, neither appellants had complained to the police of any bruises or injuries. Although the first appellant claimed at the trial that he had suffered superficial injuries, like pain on his head and red marks on his face from being punched by Thomas Ng, he could produce no medical record of this. He had not sought any medical attention after the incident. In contrast, Thomas Ng had suffered bruises on his forehead and between his eyebrows, tenderness in his chest and bruises and abrasions on his arms and legs. These injuries were consistent with his complaint of having been punched on his left forehead, pushed hard on the chest and kicked while he was lying on the ground. Thomas Ng had been physically examined by PW2, and he had also complained of these injuries to the police. These factors undoubtedly supported the respondents` evidence that no one had laid a finger on the appellants.
Thomas Ng and Madam Sim testified that Madam Sim was trying to help Thomas Ng to his feet at the time when the second appellant charged towards them and pushed both of them down. Counsel for the appellants said that this evidence was contradicted by PW4, who did not say that Madam Sim was trying to help Thomas Ng to his feet at the relevant time. Instead, he said that Madam Sim was trying to restrain Thomas Ng from going towards the first appellant at that time. Counsel also pointed to Madam Sim`s medical report, which recorded that she had told the doctor that she had been `trying to separate family members caught in an argument` when she was pushed. I accepted the possibility that Madam Sim may have been trying to restrain Thomas Ng from walking towards the first appellant just before her fall. However, even if this constituted an inconsistency in the respondents` evidence, it was only a minor and trifling one. In my mind, what was important, was that all three witnesses had testified that the second appellant had charged towards Thomas Ng and Madam Sim, and had used both hands to shove them - he had used his right hand to push Madam Sim (who was standing on Thomas Ng`s left and holding on to Thomas Ng`s left arm), and his left hand to push Thomas Ng. Both Thomas Ng and Madam Sim had fallen down as a result. Then, while Thomas Ng was lying on the ground, the second appellant kicked him. All three witnesses were consistent and unswerving as to these pertinent aspects of the evidence.
Thus, I found no basis for the allegation that there were material inconsistencies in the testimonies of Thomas Ng, Madam Sim and PW4. I agreed with the magistrate that their testimonies were consistent in all material aspects. I also agreed with the magistrate that the appellants` version of evidence was unbelievable. Thomas Ng was of small build, and significantly shorter than the first appellant. According to the appellants` own testimonies, Thomas Ng was, at the relevant time, separated from the first appellant by a `wall` of four persons, comprising PW4 and three other relatives. The appellants would have the court believe that Thomas Ng had hopped up from behind this wall of four men, reached out through them and swung his arm down in a thumping motion, from sideways, so as to punch the first appellant on the left temple. Like the magistrate before me, I found this ludicrous. In view of the fact that Thomas Ng was significantly shorter than the first appellant, I could not think how he could have executed the requisite jump, high enough to reach the first appellant`s forehead from behind the wall of four men, and at the same time stretch out his right fist from behind the four persons, so as to successfully thump the first appellant on his left temple. During the trial, the magistrate even conducted a live demonstration in his courtroom, to show that this move was impossible. Even if I accepted that Thomas Ng had indeed executed the requisite jump, I was still unable to see how he could have swung his fist from behind the four persons so as to hit the first appellant on his left temple. The allegation was not that the first appellant had been thumped on the crown of his head or punched straight in his eyes or nose or mouth, or hit from under his chin. Instead, he said he had been knocked on the side of his head on his left temple, which, incidentally, was where Thomas Ng himself had a bruise from an alleged punch from the first appellant. The entire sequence, as recounted by the appellants, was unnatural, contrived and implausible.
The learned magistrate also noted that the defence counsel had not put material details such as Thomas Ng`s odd jump and punch to PW4 in cross-examination. This cast a measure of doubt on the cogency of the defence`s case, and indicated that the appellants had formulated those details in the witness box. According to the cases of 
Browne v Dunn
 
[1893] 6 R 67
 and 
Liza bte Ismail v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 454
  , the magistrate was fully entitled to make this finding. Nonetheless, counsel for the appellants was dissatisfied with this aspect of the magistrate`s judgment. He argued before me that the failure to cross-examine PW4 on those material aspects of the evidence was simply the result of an omission on the part of the defence counsel, and should not have been held against the appellants. This submission, however, was not enough to convince me, at the appeal stage, to overturn the magistrate`s assessment of the evidence, which was sound in legal principle.
 The second appellant`s appeal against conviction for the second charge
The other submissions made by the appellants` counsel related to the second appellant`s conviction on the second charge, for causing hurt to Madam Sim. The argument was that, by all accounts, Madam Sim had most likely fallen accidentally, and that the second appellant had only pushed Thomas Ng, if at all. Madam Sim had said in her evidence that she was pushed on her palm, which was on Thomas Ng`s arm. From this, counsel for the appellants argued that, in all likelihood, Madam Sim was holding on to Thomas Ng and trying to restrain him, and Thomas Ng was then pushed, and as a result Madam Sim fell down. Thus, it was argued that Madam Sim`s fall was an `accident` and the second appellant should not have been convicted for voluntarily causing hurt to her.
The question for me, at this stage, was this: if, as the appellant`s counsel claimed, the second appellant had only 
 intended 
 to push Thomas Ng, and had also 
 actually 
 only pushed Thomas Ng, would he still be liable under s 323 of the PC for voluntarily causing hurt to Madam Sim, who was hurt in the process of Thomas Ng being pushed ? Under English law, the position would have been straightforward, for the appellant would clearly have been liable by operation of the English common law doctrine of `transferred malice`. The English doctrine of `transferred malice` states that where the actus reus and mens rea elements of the same crime coincide, in that a defendant, with the mens rea of a particular crime, has caused the actus reus of the same crime, then the defendant is guilty of that crime, even though the result, in some respects is an unintended one (see 
R v Latimer
 
[1886-87] 17 QBD 359
; 
R v Mitchell
 
[1983] QB 741
[1983] 2 All ER 427
). Thus in the English case of 
 Mitchell 
, where D struck O, who fell against P, who also fell and sustained a fatal injury, D was guilty of manslaughter, for `[t]he criminality of the doer of the act is precisely the same whether it is [O] or [P] who dies`. In Singapore law, however, there is no general common law doctrine of `transferred malice`, as there is in English law. Under local law, the closest principle to the English doctrine of `transferred malice` is a limited one, inculcated in s 301 of our Penal Code, and dealing specifically with the offence of culpable homicide.
Despite the absence of a general doctrine of `transferred malice`, I had no doubt that the second appellant was guilty under s 321 of the PC for Madam Sim`s injuries, simply on a plain reading of that section itself. It is pertinent that s 321 of the PC has been deliberately worded in a wide manner. It states: 
 
Whoever does any act with the 
 intention
 of thereby causing 
 hurt to any person
, or with the 
 knowledge
 that he is likely thereby to cause 
 hurt
 to 
 any person
, and does thereby cause hurt to any person, is said `voluntarily to cause hurt`. [Emphasis mine.]
 
 
 
The requisite mens rea element for the offence is either `intention` or `knowledge`. In the first place, intention, being purely an operation of the mind, can only be proved by drawing inferences from the surrounding circumstances and the acts of the person. A person is said to intend the natural consequences of his act. Thus, if the second appellant had indeed pushed Madam Sim on her palm, then the law can indeed infer that he had intended to cause her to lose her balance and to fall down. Even if I gave the second appellant the benefit of the doubt, and entertained the possibility that he had not actually pushed Madam Sim, and had really only pushed Thomas Ng, he would still not escape liability, for he would still possess the requisite mens rea of `knowledge`. The medical evidence revealed that Thomas Ng had suffered tenderness over his right chest immediately after the incident. This indicated that the second appellant had not merely given Thomas Ng a light push on the chest, but had shoved the latter very hard. When the second appellant charged at Thomas Ng and thus shoved Thomas Ng, Madam Sim, who was a frail and small old woman, was holding on to Thomas Ng`s arm. In the circumstances, Madam Sim`s fall was clearly a foreseeable and reasonably likely result of the second appellant`s actions. All this indicated that the second appellant possessed the knowledge that he was, by his acts, likely to cause hurt to Madam Sim by causing her to fall. There is no definition of the term `knowledge` in the Penal Code. In my judgment, for the purposes of s 321 of the PC, the term `knowledge` encompasses both recklessness (where an accused knows he is likely to cause a result) and negligence (when an accused has reason to believe that he is likely to cause a result). I was reinforced in this view by the general definition of the term `voluntarily` in s 39 of the PC, which states: 
 
A person is said to cause an effect `voluntarily` when he causes it by means whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, 
 he knew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Be it recklessness or negligence, the evidence revealed clearly that the second appellant 
 knew 
 that, by pushing Thomas Ng in the manner which he did, he would thereby cause hurt to Madam Sim. Without question, he was liable under s 321 of the PC for voluntarily causing hurt to her.
In any event, s 321 of the PC is worded in such a way that the 
 intended 
 victim need not be the 
 actual 
 victim - the section does not state that the accused must cause hurt to that same person whom he had the intention to hurt, or knew would be hurt by his conduct. Instead, the requisite mens rea for an offence under s 321 of the PC is possessing either `the intention to cause hurt to 
 any person 
` or `the knowledge that one is likely thereby to hurt 
 any person 
`, and the 
 actus reus 
 of the offence is the act of causing hurt to `any person` (as opposed to `
 the person 
` or `
 that same person 
`). Undoubtedly, the use of the words `any person` throughout the section was deliberate. The purpose of this must have been to allow the section to cover cases where the defendant, with the intention to cause hurt to O, or knowing that he was likely by his act to cause hurt to O, actually causes hurt to P in the process. In effect, this is a very specific and limited statutory application of the doctrine of `transferred malice`.
 Sentences 
 
 
 
Thus, I dismissed the appeals against conviction of both appellants. Under s 323 of the PC, each appellant could have been imprisoned for up to one year, or fined up to $1,000, or both.
The first appellant, a first-time offender, was sentenced to two week`s imprisonment by the magistrate. On the facts, as found by the magistrate, he was guilty of punching Thomas Ng on the forehead. By all accounts, the incident had arisen over a very trivial matter. The first appellant`s conduct had been the result of an impulsive outburst rather than a premeditated attack. Moreover, Thomas Ng had sustained only slight and superficial injuries as a result of the first appellant`s conduct. These were mitigating factors in his favour. On the other hand, the circumstances showed that the first appellant should not have been provoked to the extent that he was. Having balanced all these factors, I found it fit to commute the first appellant`s sentence of two week`s imprisonment to a fine of $1000.
The second appellant was sentenced to three months` imprisonment on each of the two charges, the sentences to run concurrently. Like his brother, he had no previous record of any indictable misconduct. His actions were not premeditated, but resulted from impulse. However, there was one key factor which weighed heavily against him, and that was the gravity of the injuries he caused to Madam Sim, by virtue of his violent and ill-tempered outburst. The injuries suffered by Thomas Ng were superficial. However, Madam Sim, who was 67 years old at the time of the incident, suffered a fracture of the lowest vertebrae in her thoracic spine (somewhere in the middle of her back). She was hospitalised on 10 October 1998 and discharged a week later on 18 October 1998. She received outpatient treatment on 21 October 1998, by which time her condition had apparently improved. There was no record before the Court of further medical attention after that date. According to Madam Sim, however, she had wanted to seek further medical treatment, but did not have the financial means. Prior to the incident, she was active, healthy and mobile for her age. She testified at the trial that, as a direct result of the incident, she could walk only with the support of a walking stick, and felt great pain after standing up for 20 to 30 minutes. She was comfortable lying around and in a wheelchair, and could only venture out of her residence in a wheelchair. There was no evidence of any intervening event which could have contributed to her poor physical condition.
It is significant to note that under s 320(g) of the PC, a `fracture or a dislocation of a bone` falls within the definition of `grievous hurt`. Therefore, I considered the fracture suffered by Madam Sim to be a serious injury. The second appellant`s conduct in causing such a vulnerable and aged victim, as Madam Sim, to fall down and fracture a bone in her back was wholly irresponsible, and intolerable in the eyes of the law. In the circumstances, a custodial term of imprisonment imposed against him was more appropriate than a fine. Moreover, the fact that he had kicked Thomas Ng was also a serious and aggravating factor. Therefore, the concurrent sentences of three months` imprisonment on each charge was well within the ambit of the Magistrate`s discretion and could not be considered manifestly excessive. I dismissed his appeal against the sentence that he had received.
On a final note, any apparent disparity in the sentences received by the first appellant and the second appellant was only commensurate with the level of guilt and the gravity of the injuries that they had caused. The first appellant was not convicted for causing hurt to Madam Sim. Moreover, the magistrate had found no element of `common intention` shared by the two appellants to cause hurt to the respondents, and he had amended the original charges against them to exclude the operation of s 34 of the PC. On the facts of this particular case, the first appellant was not prejudiced by the injuries that his brother had caused to Madam Sim, when it came to sentencing.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
Thus, I dismissed both appellants` appeals against conviction. I reduced the first appellant`s sentence from two weeks` imprisonment to a fine of $1000. But I dismissed the second appellant`s appeal against sentence.
Outcome:
Appeals against conviction dismissed; first appellant`s appeal against sentence allowed; second appellant`s appeal against sentence dismissed.",2000-09-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

s 105 Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed)
 
: The respondent was convicted on three charges for voluntarily causing hurt to her domestic maid, Bonasih Sarmo (`Bonasih`) pursuant to s 323 read with s 73(1)(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The charges comprised the same act by the respondent of slapping Bonasih on the left side of her face at the respondent`s house on three separate occasions; once in the early morning, once later in the morning and once in the evening of 24 July 1999.
The s 323 Penal Code offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or with fine which may extend to $1,000, or with both. However, under the enhanced penalties for offences against domestic maids provided under s 73(2) of the Penal Code, a court may enhance the sentence to one and a half times the amount of punishment to which the offender would otherwise have been liable for that offence; making for a maximum sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 18 months, or with fine which may extend to $1,500 or with both.
In the court below, the respondent was fined $1,500 on each charge, in default, two weeks` imprisonment on each charge, making a total fine of $4,500, in default, six weeks` imprisonment. The fine was paid.
The prosecution appealed against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate while the respondent appealed against the conviction. I dismissed the respondent`s appeal against conviction and allowed the prosecution`s appeal on sentence. I now give my reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
Bonasih arrived in Singapore from Indonesia around 15 July 1999. She commenced work as a domestic maid at the respondent`s bungalow on 22 July 1999.
At or about 3am on 24 July 1999, the respondent entered Bonasih`s room and discovered that she was sleeping with the bedroom lights and fan on. Angered, the respondent used her right hand to slap Bonasih`s left cheek. The respondent then inquired about her husband`s clothes, and upon hearing an unsatisfactory answer, she slapped Bonasih again. The following morning, Bonasih noticed that she had a bruise on the left side of her face and a cut on her lips. These were the facts of the first charge.
On the second charge, at or about 8.30am later that morning, Bonasih was in the kitchen boiling water to fill a flask. The respondent entered the kitchen and scolded Bonasih for putting too much water into the flask. The scolding was followed by another slap from the respondent.
Later that evening, the respondent was again displeased with Bonasih`s work. This time, the respondent was unhappy with the way in which Bonasih cooked the rice. The respondent slapped her again in the same manner, using her right hand on the left side of Bonasih`s face. These were the facts of the third charge.
On 28 July 1999, Suyanti Sastro Sugito (`Yanti`), another domestic maid working in the vicinity of the respondent`s house, inquired about Bonasih`s bruises. After being questioned by Yanti repeatedly, Bonasih finally told her that the respondent had slapped her. Yanti alerted the police. When they arrived, police officer Mohammad bin Suporno (`Mohammad`) observed that there was a three to four centimetre bruise on the left side of Bonasih`s face and a cut on the left side of her lips. However, Bonasih told Mohammad that she was responsible for her own injuries as she had fallen in the toilet while cleaning the wall. Mohammad observed that she appeared very frightened, particularly after the respondent joined them. He asked her to show him how she fell and, after the demonstration, he felt that the injuries were inconsistent with her story.
On 8 August 1999 at around 3pm, Bonasih`s sister, Buniyah bte Sarmo (`Buniyah`) visited her at the respondent`s house. Bonasih confided to her sister that she was frequently physically abused by the respondent. Subsequently, the respondent returned home and Buniyah left. Shortly after, Bonasih fled the respondent`s house, seeking refuge with her sister who was still waiting at a nearby bus stop. Buniyah recounted that she looked very frightened and was crying. Later, Bonasih reported the assaults to the police.
When sent for a medical examination, Bonasih informed the examining doctor that she had been slapped on the face by the respondent and was also punched on her right arm. She also said that her ear was pulled and her face pinched. The medical report from Dr Adrian Koh Jit Hin (`Dr Koh`) stated that there was tenderness on the left side of Bonasih`s jaw. There were no bruises or fractures. However, Dr Koh opined that her injuries were consistent with her account and were consistent with injuries caused by blows from a `blunt object`.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CONVICTION
 
The crux of the case was factual. After hearing the witnesses for both sides and after observing their demeanour during the course of the trial, the magistrate noted that the maid came across as a very honest and credible witness. He also felt that she was not a very intelligent person who was capable of weaving a consistent story to support her allegations against the respondent.
In sharp contrast, the magistrate described the respondent as a very intelligent witness who was always slow and careful with her answers. In spite of this, her fa+ade cracked when inconsistencies arose during the course of her testimony and when compared with the evidence given by her own witnesses. As such, the magistrate found that she was not an honest witness and her version of events was not to be believed.
In view of the evidence before him, the magistrate convicted the respondent on all three charges of voluntarily causing hurt to Bonasih.
 SENTENCING
During mitigation, the respondent submitted that she had suffered greatly from this incident and that she was extremely remorseful over the incident. It was also submitted that she had co-operated fully with the police.
The magistrate noted that the events leading to the assaults were extremely trivial matters and there was no provocation from Bonasih prior to being assaulted. The magistrate also noted that Parliament had amended the law in 1998 to provide for enhanced punishment in cases involving, inter alia, voluntarily causing hurt to domestic maids. However, noting that Bonasih`s bruises had healed soon after the assaults and that, within a week after the incidents, there was no visible evidence of bruising, the magistrate considered these injuries to be minor and regarded this factor as the key consideration during sentencing.
Examining case precedents, the magistrate found that a heavy fine was usually imposed for offences charged under s 323 of the Penal Code where the hurt caused was not severe. In particular, he noted 
 PP v Tan Siam Keow 
 (PS 643 and 644/2000) where the victim was slapped in the face several times, her head was hit and her hair pulled. As a result of the assaults, the victim suffered multiple bruises on her arm and legs. The magistrate noted that the judge in that case took a further three charges into consideration and fined the accused the maximum of $1,500 per charge.
As such, after taking into account s 73(2) of the Penal Code, the magistrate imposed the maximum fine of $1,500 per charge.
Both the prosecution and the respondent appealed.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CONVICTION
 
It was undisputed that Bonasih suffered injuries that included facial bruises and a cut to her lip. The key question in the current appeal was whether these injuries were the result of the respondent`s assaults as laid out in the charges. The respondent challenged various findings of fact and inferences drawn by the magistrate. I dealt with them as follows: 
(1) Injuries on Bonasih 
(2) Bonasih`s credibility 
(3) The respondent`s credibility 
(4) Motive to frame the respondent
 Injuries on Bonasih
The respondent contended that the magistrate did not properly consider her evidence. Despite Bonasih`s statement that she was slapped almost every day, the respondent alleged that the magistrate failed to consider why Buniyah did not testify to have seen visible bruises on Bonasih when she visited her on 8 August 1999. Also, she contended that the magistrate failed to properly assess the evidence given by Dr Koh, in particular that the injuries alleged to be suffered by Bonasih were not independently observed or verified.
I found that it was absurd for the respondent to rely on these grounds of appeal since Bonasih`s injuries were undisputed. The respondent testified to have seen bruises and swelling on Bonasih`s face on 25 July 1999. Her injuries were also independently observed by the police officer, Mohammad, when he first interviewed Bonasih at the house. While Mohammad was not strictly an expert witness, I was prepared to accept his observations and conclusion, which was made after watching the demonstration from Bonasih about the way she allegedly fell in the toilet and comparing it with the injuries sustained by Bonasih. In cases such as these, a normal person`s human experience is sufficient to conclude that the injuries sustained could not have been the result of a fall as described. In any case, after evaluating Mohammad`s testimony in the light of other evidence, the magistrate also found that Bonasih`s injuries were not caused by a fall.
The respondent`s family doctor of 16 years, Dr Singh, testified that had Bonasih been slapped on the cheek, she would have shown bruises. Dr Singh`s examination occurred on 2 August 1999, nine days after Bonasih was first assaulted. More importantly, the magistrate correctly noted that Dr Singh`s evidence was irrelevant since the injuries were not in issue at the trial and the respondent had testified that Bonasih`s `left face was reddish and slightly swollen` on 25 July 1999. I also rejected the respondent`s contention that Bonasih ought to have complained to Dr Singh if she was really hurt. Such failure to complain was inconsequential since it was readily apparent that Bonasih was already in constant fear of the respondent and therefore would certainly not have dared to complain to Dr Singh in the presence of the respondent who was in the examination room. In any case, in 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
  at 65, I said that the evidential value of a prompt complaint lay not in the fact that making it renders the victim`s testimony more credible, but rather, it was the failure to make a complaint which rendered a victim`s evidence less credible: 
 
 
78 ... Deciding whether to call a previous complaint `corroboration` or otherwise does not add anything to the fact finding process. In all cases, it is necessary to identify the reason behind the perceived unreliability of the complainant`s testimony. Only then is it possible to decide whether a previous complaint or the absence of one adds anything at all to the equation. 
 
79 The evidential value of a prompt complaint often lay not in the fact that making it renders the victim`s testimony more credible. The evidential value of a previous complaint is that the failure to make one renders the victim`s evidence 
 less 
 credible. The reason is simply common human experience. It is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint. However, as in all cases where common human experience is used as a yardstick, there may be very good reasons why the victim`s actions depart from it. It would then be an error not to have regard to the explanation proffered. All these merely illustrate the fallacy of adhering to a fixed formula.
  
 
 
Also, I failed to see how Dr Koh`s evidence was helpful to the respondent`s case. By the time he examined Bonasih on 8 August 1999, any bruises suffered as a result of the respondent`s slapping on 24 July 1999 would have healed substantially. In any case, Dr Koh was still able to detect tenderness on Bonasih`s left jaw. When informed by Bonasih that the injuries arose from being slapped on the face by the respondent, he noted that the `injuries were consistent with her account and were consistent with blow(s) from a blunt object`. Dr Koh also clarified in court that a `blunt object` could mean a `stick, foot or fist` and did not rule out the possibility that the injuries could be caused by slapping of up to three times a day.
 Bonasih`s credibility
In essence, the respondent contended that Bonasih`s evidence should not be believed. She argued that Bonasih was mentally unstable and that the magistrate had placed too much weight on her evidence and ignored the fact that she was a pathological liar.
The respondent`s only evidence in support of her allegation that Bonasih was mentally unstable was that Bonasih was cracking her knuckles loudly when she was first picked up from the maid agency. However, I did not think that this alone was sufficient to prove mental instability. Bonasih had explained that she had merely felt nervous, arising from the respondent`s expression of dislike of her at the maid agency. Also, I noted that Bonasih was going to a new place and any ostensible nervousness would have been perfectly understandable.
The police officer, Mohammad`s evidence was particularly helpful on questions relating to Bonasih`s credibility. For example, Bonasih testified in court that she was in great fear of the respondent. This was corroborated by Mohammad when he visited the house on 28 July 1999 and he described Bonasih as follows: 
 
I could see she was trembling, her hands were shaking and words coming out from her mouth are whispering like she does not want someone else to hear it.
 
 
 
He testified that Bonasih became particularly frightened when the respondent came out of the house to join them and it was apparent to him that Bonasih was unwilling to tell him the truth about her injuries, choosing instead to maintain that she had a fall. Such a spontaneous display of fear involuntarily manifested by Bonasih provided strong support for the prosecution`s case. Furthermore, I felt that the circumstantial evidence was exceptionally compelling in other respects: It was the respondent`s own testimony that she had noticed injuries on Bonasih on 25 July 1999. As such, it was only logical to infer that the injuries were caused between the time when Bonasih first arrived at the respondent`s house on 22 July 1999 and 25 July 1999. Separately, Bonasih`s overwhelming fear of the respondent was independently observed by Mohammad when he first met Bonasih. Since there was no evidence that Bonasih was ever allowed to go out of the house on her own nor was there any suggestion that she had been assaulted by someone else in the respondent`s household, the evidence when put together provided strong support for Bonasih`s allegations.
It should be noted that none of the prosecution witnesses were found to have been inconsistent nor were they ever discredited. Furthermore, Bonasih`s credibility was supported by independent medical opinion from Dr Koh. From the notes of evidence, I agreed that Bonasih did not seem particularly intelligent but, on the whole, she was an honest and consistent witness.
 The respondent`s credibility
On the other hand, I agreed that the respondent was a highly intelligent woman. She tendered extensive documentary exhibits such as a car park coupon on the night of 22 July 1999, the receipt obtained at a restaurant the same night, the passport showing that a trip had been made to Johore Bahru on 25 July 1999 and the police report made on 8 August 1999 about Bonasih`s fleeing from her house. However, none of these peripheral documents were relevant or material since they were far detached from the issues, time and location stated in the charges.
I agreed that the respondent`s evidence was generally inconsistent and untruthful. Raising an alibi defence on the third charge, the respondent stated that she was at her mother`s residence playing mahjong with the rest of her family on the evening of 24 July 1999. In support of this, the respondent produced her mother, Mdm Choong Fatt Keow (`Mdm Choong`), to support this story. The respondent testified that on that occasion, after losing money to her sister during mahjong, her sister had jokingly said that she would buy her a birthday cake in return. According to the respondent, this was never done. However, Mdm Choong contradicted her daughter`s account when she testified that the cake was indeed bought and that the respondent and she herself even had a slice of it. Neither of them could have been mistaken or confused since they had narrated events on that evening with remarkable clarity. Another inconsistency was detected when the respondent told the court that her daughter had complained that the meal prepared by Bonasih on the evening of 24 July 1999 did not suit her taste. During cross-examination, the respondent elaborated to say that she did not have to worry about leaving Bonasih alone to cook dinner because she had prepared extra rice and dishes on that day. When reminded that, if this was so, then her daughter would not have had to eat Bonasih`s cooking, the respondent immediately qualified herself by saying that there was not enough dishes prepared. I agreed with the magistrate that the respondent changed her story when she realised her mistake.
The prosecution then sought to argue that the inconsistencies were actually lies told by the respondent and that this amounted to corroboration of the prosecution`s case. While I agreed that there may be cases where lies may properly be regarded as circumstantial evidence of guilt on the basis that they were invented to conceal guilt, a trial judge must not be overly hasty to come to that conclusion as an accused may lie for a variety of reasons. In any case, the trial judge, as the finder of fact must first satisfy himself that the accused did indeed lie. In this regard, I found it helpful to refer to 
R v Lucas
 
[1981] QB 720
 which was followed in the local case of 
Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 767
 . In 
 R v Lucas 
, Lord Lane CJ stated at 724 that an accused`s lies may corroborate other evidence against him if, but only if, certain criteria are satisfied: 
 
... the lie ... must first of all be deliberate. Secondly, it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly, the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth ... people sometimes lie, for example, in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or out of a wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from their family. Fourthly, the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of the accomplice who is to be corroborated, that is to say by admission or by evidence from an independent witness.
 
 
 
In the present case, the inconsistency arising from whether a birthday cake was actually bought and shared did not relate to a material issue in the charge. Similarly, whether or not the respondent had prepared sufficient dishes for her daughter`s consumption on the night of 24 July 1999 was also insufficiently conclusive and not material enough to qualify as corroboration. I was, however, prepared to note that this indicated the respondent`s lack of credibility, and that little, if any, weight should be placed on her evidence.
In general, the alibi defence involves more than a mere denial of presence at the scene of the crime, but asserts collaterally that the accused was present somewhere else. Section 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) states: 
 
The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.

In 
Ramakrishnan s/o Ramayan v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 645
 , I stated that s 105 of the Evidence Act operated such that the accused bore the evidential burden of production to raise the issue of alibi. In other words, the accused had to raise a reasonable doubt as to his presence at the scene stated in the charges. In this case, Bonasih testified convincingly for the prosecution that, on the night of 24 July 1999, the respondent was at home teaching her to cook. The only evidence produced by the respondent in support of her alibi was her own testimony and Mdm Choong`s testimony. Quite apart from the fact that her mother, Mdm Choong, was an interested witness, I found Mdm Choong`s evidence to be inconsistent and, as such, little weight should be placed on her testimony. In my opinion, the respondent had failed to discharge the evidential burden of proof on her alibi defence.
With regard to the bare denial on the first charge, the respondent denied having used a key to access Bonasih`s room, claiming that she did not have any such key. After cross-examination, the magistrate disbelieved her and found that it was implausible for the respondent, who had occupied the house for over 13 years, not to have all the keys to the rooms, in particular, the key to the new maid`s room. As such, he rejected the respondent`s bare denial. I agreed with the magistrate.
On the second charge, Bonasih testified that she was slapped by the respondent in the kitchen at about 8.30am, 24 July 1999. Counsel for the respondent did not challenge Bonasih`s account of the assaults on that morning, choosing instead to assert another bare denial. To bolster her story, the respondent claimed that she did not see Bonasih before she left for her routine Saturday morning swim. However, it was not disputed that Bonasih was boiling water in the kitchen and the respondent testified that she prepared and ate breakfast and was around the house at the material time. As such, I found that it was inconceivable that the respondent would fail to meet Bonasih in the single floor bungalow house.
 No motive for framing the respondent
Finally, the respondent contended that Bonasih had framed her in order to escape working for her. This was another bare allegation. There was not one iota of evidence to suggest any hostility displayed by Bonasih towards the respondent which might be the cause for the former`s purported desire to frame the respondent. In fact, if Bonasih had wanted to frame the respondent so that she could leave her employment, then, instead of telling Mohammad that she had fallen in the toilet, she would have seized the opportunity and told him that she had been assaulted by the respondent. She would certainly have been rescued by the police. As such, I rejected the respondent`s arguments.
 Conclusion
It should be noted that the magistrate`s decision to disbelieve the respondent and believe Bonasih was reached after a trial process where he had had the benefit of observing the witnesses and their demeanour. As it has been repeatedly stated, an appellate court will not interfere with a trial judge`s findings of fact, especially where such findings were based on his assessment of the witnesses` veracity and credibility, unless they were plainly wrong. See, for example, 
Arts Niche Cyber Distribution v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 111
 . While the credibility of the witnesses did play a large part in this case, the court was helped by the compelling circumstantial evidence in coming to its final conclusion. I was unable to find any merit in the respondent`s arguments and accordingly I dismissed the respondent`s appeal against conviction.
 SENTENCE
The object of legislation providing for enhanced punishment for certain offences against maids in Singapore stemmed from the recognition that maids require additional protection because of their special circumstances. As noted by the Minister for Home Affairs in Parliament in April 1998, full time domestic maids are usually female and are totally dependent on their employers for food and lodging. Having travelled long distances to work in Singapore, many of them are totally deprived of their support network of family and friends. In this case, Bonasih was particularly vulnerable, having arrived from Indonesia just a week before starting work, and having only started working for the respondent less than two days before the assaults began. In contrast, the respondent was well aware that she was in a position of authority and had abused it. While the offences did not seem premeditated, it was disturbing to note that they were committed habitually and in response to dissatisfaction over very trivial matters. Shockingly, the respondent seemed to use slapping as standard punishment in instructing Bonasih on her work.
Evaluating Bonasih`s injuries, I did not think that they were minor enough to justify a fine. The bruises and a fairly large cut on the lip were visible four days after the assault, and this suggested that they were not superficial wounds and a great deal of force was used which caused extensive bleeding. As such, I felt that the magistrate was mistaken about the extent of injuries suffered by Bonasih. He did, however, note that the respondent used her bare hands to carry out the assaults which made it unnecessary to impose an even heavier sentence.
Contrary to the respondent`s submissions, I did not observe any ostensible contrition or remorse on her part for causing the injuries. Quite the opposite, it became clear that, after the assaults, the respondent subjected Bonasih to a regime of threats and coached her to lie if she was ever questioned. Bonasih was therefore not subjected only to physical abuse; the beatings and threats created in Bonasih an `
 overwhelming fear 
` of the respondent. One can only imagine the trauma that Bonasih experienced throughout the short duration of her employment. I therefore held that, where mental abuse was calculatedly applied in conjunction with physical abuse to a domestic maid, this should be viewed as a serious aggravating factor.
Maid abuse usually takes place in the privacy of the home where offences are hard to detect. In recent years, the number of foreign maids working in Singapore households has risen steadily. Unfortunately, reported cases of maid abuse have also risen steadily: 105 in 1994 to 193 in 1997. I felt that a deterrent sentence should be imposed to arrest the rising trend of such offences. In addition, I noted that such disgraceful conduct lowers Singapore`s international reputation and damages bilateral relations with neighbouring countries.
In 
Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP
 
 
[2001] 4 SLR 610
 , the offender had used a broom handle to assault her maid causing extensive bruises. The offender`s sentence was enhanced from three months` imprisonment to nine months` imprisonment. In 
Tan Yok Hong v PP
 (Unreported) , the offender pleaded guilty to one charge of causing hurt to a maid by slapping her on the face, causing bleeding to the maid`s nose. Two other charges of causing hurt were taken into consideration and the offender was sentenced to two weeks` imprisonment. In 
PP v Faridah bte Abdul Fatah
 (Unreported) , the offender had placed eight clothes pegs on the victim`s ears and pulled them off one by one. The medical report disclosed that the maid suffered bruising and abrasions to both her ears as a result. Following an appeal, the initial fine of $1,500 was enhanced to three weeks` imprisonment.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the reasons above, I allowed the prosecution`s appeal against sentence and varied the original sentence. After reading s 323 with s 73(2) of the Penal Code, the final sentence was enhanced to six weeks` imprisonment on each charge. Two of the three sentences were ordered to run concurrently, making for a total of twelve weeks` imprisonment. The fines paid by the respondent were ordered to be refunded.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellant, Lim Choo Song, was charged with the following offence: 
 
That you, LIM CHOO SONG
 
 
 
On or about the 16th day of June 2001, at or about 11.10p.m., in a motor car bearing registration number SCV 7067K at the Car Arrival Inspection Bay, Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore did import into Singapore a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, 2 packets of granular substances containing not less than 23.43 grams of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 and punishable under section 33 of the said Act.
 
 
 
After a trial, the appellant was convicted and given the mandatory sentence for importing the stated quantity of diamorphine. He appealed against his conviction. After considering all the evidence, we dismissed his appeal. We now give the reasons for our decision.
 Background 
 
 
 
 
 
When the appellant`s motor vehicle, bearing registration number SCV 7067K, was stopped by Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) officers at the Woodlands Checkpoint in Singapore on 16 June 2001, he was the only person in the car. He had just driven from Johore Bahru to Singapore. When his car was searched at a car inspection pit, Sergeant Choo Thiam Hock (`Sgt Choo`) discovered a plastic bag in the arm-rest compartment of the rear seat of the car. Inside the bag were two brown envelopes containing a granular substance. The appellant was arrested and the bag and envelopes were seized.
Tests revealed that the two packets seized by the CNB contained not less than 23.43g of diamorphine with a confidence level of 99.9999%.
After his arrest, the appellant gave a number of statements to CNB officers. As he spoke Hokkien, his statements, and where relevant, questions posed to him and his answers, were translated by an interpreter.
About two hours after his arrest, the appellant`s first statement was recorded when he was questioned by Inspector Omer Ali Saifudeen with the assistance of his interpreter, Sgt Choo. The English transcript of part of this statement is as follows: 
 
 
Q What is this? (pointing at the bundle)
 
A I think drugs ...
 
Q What is it for? Why did you bring it in?
 
A `Ah Meng` asked me to bring in and give to `Ah San`.
 
Q How much does a packet like this cost?
 
A I don`t know. They gave me 1,000 ringgit to bring this in.
 
 
 
The appellant was offered an opportunity to make a statement when a charge was framed and read to him pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). The consequences of remaining silent and the fact that the penalty, if convicted, was death, was explained to him. An interpreter, Mr Wu Nan Yong, was present. The appellant elected to say nothing.
The appellant`s next statement was recorded with the assistance of an interpreter, Mr Tan Chee Leong, on 21 June 2001. It included the following paragraphs: 
 
 
1. On 16 June 2001, at about 11.10pm, I was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint. I was in my car, a white BMW SCV 7067K. At the rear seat, inside the armrest compartment was a plastic bag. 
 I knew there was drug inside the plastic bag 
.
 
2. On 16 June 2001, at about 4pm, I drove my car ... into Johore ... I went horse-betting at Merlin Tower ... Then I proceeded for a hair-cut. At this point in time, I received a call on my handphone from a man known as Ah Meng. Ah Meng asked me to wait for him at the carpark in Jalan Ah Fook at 8-plus pm. He also asked me to help him bring something into Woodlands, Singapore. He promised me ringgit one thousand for the effort ...
 
3. At 8-plus pm, I went to the carpark in Jalan Ah Fook ... Ah Meng came in a black car. I saw Ah Meng approaching towards my car with a plastic bag in his hands. He opened the back door of my car ... opened the armrest compartment at the rear sear, placed the plastic bag inside it. He asked me to bring the thing out. 
 On my part, I knew it was drug, possibly `bae hoon` 
.
 
5. Ah Meng asked me to hand over the thing to a man known as Ah San. I was told to drive my car to Woodlands KFC carpark. I do not know Ah San or his contact number. Ah San would be the one to identify me. He knew my car number.
 
6. At 10-plus pm, I drove my car to the Woodlands Checkpoint ... After that, I drove my car into Singapore ...
 
8 ... Upon reaching the Arrival Inspection Bay, I was stopped by a Malay CNB officer ...
 
13. The officers then forcefully broke open the cover of the armrest compartment. They then found the plastic bag inside. They took out the plastic bag. They asked me if there were 
 any more 
 drugs. I said no ... [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
On 22 June 2001, the appellant`s fourth statement was recorded with the assistance of Mr Tan Chee Leong at around 2.10pm. In it, the appellant stated, inter alia, as follows: 
 
 
21. My previous statement of 21/6/2001 was read back to me in Hokkien by a Chinese interpreter. I affirm the statement to be true and accurate. I do not wish to add or change anything ...
 
29. When I was arrested, the Indian officer asked me what are these things, pointing at the two packets of wrapping. 
 I said drug 
. He then took a knife and cut open one of the wrappers. He again asked me what are these. 
 I said drug 
. I told him Ah Meng asked me to give to Ah San. 
 I told him Ah Meng promised to give me ringgit one thousand 
. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
The only issue at the trial was whether the appellant knew that the two packets seized from him at Woodlands Checkpoint contained drugs. The prosecution pointed out that apart from the evidence that the appellant was aware that he had drugs in his possession, the effect of the presumptions in ss 18(2) and 21 of the Misuse of Drugs Act was that he was presumed to be in possession of the envelopes seized from him and that he knew that those envelopes contained drugs.
At the close of the prosecution`s case, the appellant`s counsel submitted that there was no case to answer. However, the trial judge ruled that there was a case to answer. When informed of this, the appellant elected not to give evidence in court and no other evidence was tendered to advance his case. All the same, his counsel pointed out that he should not be convicted because there was a doubt as to whether or not he was the person who was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint on 16 June 2001 and there were inaccuracies in the recording of his statements to CNB officers.
The appellant`s counsel pointed out that apart from Assistant Superintendent Soh Thiam Loon, no one had identified the appellant as Lim Choo Song or as the person mentioned in the statements of the witnesses. It was also alleged that the appellant`s passport and identity card were not identified in court by Sgt Ng Beng Chin, the officer who seized these documents. However, the trial judge said that there was no doubt that the appellant was the person arrested at Woodlands on 16 June 2001. To begin with, when the charge was read to the appellant, he did not deny that he was Lim Choo Song. In fact, he claimed trial. Furthermore, the appellant`s counsel, who conceded that the appellant`s statements were admissible, posed questions to Inspector Omer Ali Saifudeen and Sgt Choo on the basis that it was the accused who made the statements in question. During cross-examination, there was no dispute that the appellant was the person arrested for having drugs in his car. The trial judge also noted that the appellant had made it clear in his third statement to CNB officers on 21 June 2001 that he was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint on 16 June 2001. In his fourth statement, which was recorded on 22 June 2001, the appellant admitted that he was driving the car bearing registration number SCV 7067K when he was arrested.
As for the attacks on the accuracy of the interpretation of the statements, it was alleged that the appellant did not say in his first statement that the packets seized from him contained drugs. He had used a Hokkien word `tok pin`, which meant poisonous substances and not drugs. The interpreter, Sgt Choo, disagreed. However, Mr Tan Chee Leong, who interpreted the appellant`s statements on two other occasions accepted, when cross-examined, that `tok pin` could mean either poisonous substance or drugs. As for the appellant`s third statement, which was recorded on 21 June 2001, the appellant`s counsel contended that the appellant had not told the interpreter, Mr Tan, that he knew that there were drugs in the plastic bag or that it was possibly `Bae Hoon`. However, Mr Tan disagreed and said that if the accused had not used that Hokkien phrase, it would not have been recorded in the statement. These alleged inconsistencies were not such as to persuade the trial judge that the appellant had no case to answer.
The trial judge held that in view of the evidence tendered by the prosecution, the accused`s statements and his silence, the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
In his written submissions for the appeal, the appellant`s counsel argued that the appeal should be allowed because the trial judge failed to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt that he imported the drugs in question into Singapore on 16 June 2001 and failed to regard the appellant`s statements to CNB officers as unreliable as their accuracy had been challenged. However, events which unfolded before the hearing of the appeal made it impossible for the appellant`s counsel to rely on these grounds.
On 27 February 2002, the appellant filed CrM 4/2002 for the purpose of obtaining an order that he be allowed to adduce fresh evidence to prove his innocence. For this purpose, he filed an affidavit on 26 February 2002, in which he stated that with regard to the matters set out in the charge against him, he was in fact gathering evidence for the CNB. However, when the criminal motion was heard, counsel for the appellant informed the court that he had instructions to withdraw the criminal motion. Leave was given to the appellant to withdraw the criminal motion and we proceeded to hear the appellant`s appeal against his conviction.
By withdrawing his criminal motion to adduce further evidence, the appellant placed himself in a difficult position because he had, to date, presented no evidence that he had been authorised to bring the drugs in question into Singapore. The appellant`s counsel, Mr James Masih, accepted that the appellant had admitted in his affidavit filed on 26 February 2002 that the drugs were in his possession, albeit for a different purpose. As such, the appellant was no longer in a position to contend that there was a doubt as to whether he had brought the drugs into Singapore. No other argument was advanced as to why the appeal should be allowed. As such, the appellant`s appeal was dismissed.

 The case 
The plaintiffs and the defendant, all businessmen and one other, Yeh Fu Kuo (`Yeh`), a Taiwanese businessman, were shareholders in Chosen Plastics Pte Ltd (`Chosen Plastics`) which was incorporated in Singapore in 1986 to manufacture plastic moulded components for the computer industry and sub-assembly services. It was not disputed that Chosen Plastics had basically one big customer, namely, Hewlett Packard which bought its manufactured components. The defendant was appointed the Managing Director of Chosen Plastics as he had technical experience. The plaintiffs assumed the office of directors.
By the end of 1997 or early 1998, the relevant period, Chosen Plastics had 2,020,000 million issued ordinary shares of $1 each of which 30% and 11% were owned respectively by the first and second plaintiffs, 40% by the defendant and 19% by Yeh.
Over the years, the business of Chosen Plastics had grown and the shareholders had acquired or formed new companies to carry out complementary businesses to that of Chosen Plastics.
In August 1988 Newtech Pte Ltd (`Newtech`) was incorporated and 500,000 ordinary shares were issued and paid up of $1 each. Chosen Plastics owned 42% of the shares, the defendant 30%, one Tang Ah Ah and one Wang Chew Hoon (`Wang`) 5% and 23% respectively. The directors of Newtech were the first plaintiff, the defendant and Wang.
In May 1992 Chosen Technologies Pte Ltd (`Chosen Tech`) was incorporated as a subsidiary of Chosen Plastic. Chosen Tech issued 150,000 ordinary shares of $1 each paid up. Chosen Plastics owned 55% of the shares, the defendant 15% and one Chow Kok Hwee 30%. The directors of Chosen Tech were the second plaintiff, the defendant and Chow Kok Hwee.
Chosen Plastics Malaysia Sdn Bhd (`Chosen Malaysia`) was incorporated in 1993. It had 1,000,000 ordinary issued shares of $1 each, of which the first and second plaintiffs owned 40% and 20% respectively, the defendant 20% and one Ang 20%. The plaintiffs and the defendant were appointed directors of Chosen Malaysia. The management and business affairs of Chosen Malaysia was also left solely to the defendant.
Subsequently, in May 1996 the defendant consulted the plaintiffs about Chosen Plastics expanding its business by setting up a factory in Shanghai, China. The plaintiffs consented and Chosen Investments Pte Ltd (`Chosen Investments`) was thereafter incorporated the same month. Chosen Investments issued 500,000 ordinary shares of $1 each paid up. Chosen Plastics subscribed to 40% of the shares, Newtech 48% and Wong Chew Hoon 12%.
Soon thereafter, Chosen Enterprise (Shanghai) Co Ltd (`Chosen Shanghai`) was incorporated in Shanghai as a 100% subsidiary of Chosen Investments.
The defendant was overall in charge and was the driving force of all the above businesses which I shall for convenience refer to as the `Chosen Group`.
The first plaintiff had signed personal guarantees for about $2m in favour of Overseas Union Bank (`OUB`) concerning the business operations of Chosen Plastics. Chosen Plastics was, amongst other things, using the overdraft funds for its Shanghai business, Chosen Shanghai, through Chosen Investments.
The defendant was also a guarantor to the bank overdraft. He had also given personal loans and the Chosen Group owed him about $2.1m.
In 1997 the Shanghai business was expanding and the defendants` business plan was to take advantage of that and continue to provide more funds and to further expand the Shanghai business. He put the plan to the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs were reluctant to risk more money being spent in China as it was a difficult market requiring cash payments and as they were guarantors to the loans taken in Singapore. The accounts showed that up to June 1997, Chosen Shanghai had chalked up trade debts of $2,723,689. One other factor complicated matters: The Asian financial crisis had started to set in. The defendant, nevertheless, looking to the future, was insistent that expansion in Shanghai continue to take advantage of the growing demand for its plastic moulded components for future profitability.
The dialogue continued. Eventually, because of the defendant`s continued insistence to expand but because the parties could not see eye to eye on the matter. The first plaintiff then approached the defendant in about September 1997 to sell all his shares to the defendant. In his cross-examination, the first plaintiff was asked if he was `anxious` to sell his shares to which he answered `Yes` [NE 11]. The second plaintiff and Yeh who were close to the first and second plaintiffs, likewise wished to similarly sell their shares to the defendant. The trio started negotiating seriously on the valuation of the Chosen Group sometime from September 1999 and the negotiations continued into early March 2000.
Eventually after negotiating and making all the accounts of the Chosen Group available to the plaintiffs as requested by them up to or about 31 December 1997 the parties agreed to value the Chosen Group at $12,000,000. The defendant was not willing to buy the shares held by the first and second plaintiffs and Yeh on any higher valuation than that. It was not disputed that the first and second plaintiffs could have obtained an independent valuer to value the shares but did not do so. The first plaintiff in 
 cross-examination 
 in fact admitted that in February 1998 `it was a good price` [NE 14].
It was also not disputed that the defendant was willing to sell all his shares in the Chosen Group to the plaintiffs and Yeh based on the same valuation if they were not happy concerning the valuation (as he was also concerned about his own exposure and the problem of raising a loan to pay for the buy-out) but the plaintiffs and Yeh declined take up the defendant`s offer. In fact the first plaintiff when asked if initially the defendant was reluctant to buy the shares had stated `Maybe`. When asked by the court during which period, the first plaintiff answered, `Between end of 1997 and early 1998` [NE 31].
On or about 14 March 1998, the valuation of the Chosen Group was settled and on that date, the plaintiffs entered into two formal written agreements (`the agreements`) with the defendant in the presence of their respective solicitors to sell their respective shares to the defendant in the Chosen Group. The consideration to be paid to the first plaintiff and second plaintiff shares was $3,599,993.53 and $1,319,999.04 respectively (a total of $4,919,992.57). A similar agreement was entered between Yeh and the defendant in respect of his shareholdings. He was to be paid $2,280,007.50. The grand total consideration to be paid to the first and second plaintiffs and Yeh was $7,200,000. This was agreed to be paid by an initial immediate payment of $500,000 and additionally a sum of $500,000 to be put in escrow with solicitors with the balance to be paid on or before 6 July 2000. If the balance was not paid, 8% of the purchase price paid was to be forfeited. The payment of the balance was staggered in the agreements to allow the defendant to raise a bank loan and to make the payment on or before 6 July 2000.
From some time in December 1997 
 after 
 the first and second plaintiffs and Yeh had offered to sell their shares to the defendant, the defendant enquired from DBS and OUB and one Henry Tan Song Kok, PW4, (`Henry Tan`) a Consultant from Tan & Sitoh, Accountants, about the possibility of the Chosen Group going public to raise funds for expansion in Shanghai and also for a loan to pay for the purchase of the plaintiffs` and Yeh`s shareholdings. The defendant had difficulties getting the loan from DBS. The defendant continued his inquiries with OUB as they were already Chosen Group`s bankers. Henry Tan was to liaise with OUB. After a meeting on 31 December 1998 with the defendant, OUB sent a letter to Chosen Plastics on 6 January 1998 requesting them to sign a Mandate Letter in favour of OUB as their Manager, Underwriter and Placement Agent for the proposed Initial Public Offering (IPO). The defendant in the initial discussion was told that there was a possibility of listing the company on the SES. It was a normal letter probably given to all applicants. However, OUB was not given the Mandate until June 1998 as the defendant still had some problems with OUB obtaining a personal loan to assist him to pay for the intended purchase of shares from the plaintiffs and Yeh. The Vice President and Head of Corporate Finance OUB confirmed this when he said: `The mandate was not signed because the defendant was looking for financing to pay existing shareholders ...` [NE 70].
In the meantime, completion of the sale and purchase of the shares under the agreements successfully took place on or about 6 July 1998 on which date the balance of the total sum due to the first and second plaintiffs and Yeh was paid off.
Subsequently, a loan to the defendant was approved by OUB on 10t June 1998 to finance the purchase of the plaintiffs and Yeh`s shares. The first working meeting was held on 25 June 1998 for getting the IPO underway and scheduling worked out for the same.
Thereafter, the defendant, in preparation of Chosen Group going public, having bought the shares from the plaintiffs and Yeh as set out earlier, injected the said shares into Chosen Holdings (`Chosen Holdings`) the vehicle for the IPO and issued the shareholders in the companies in the Chosen Group with Chosen Holding`s shares.
After further restructuring and completing all the preparatory work and representations by OUB, Chosen Holdings was able to secure permission from the SES to be listed. A public offering was made of ordinary shares at $0.29 which had a par value of $0.10, ie at a premium. Before the Invitation to the public to subscribe to the shares of Chosen Holdings, Chosen Holdings had issued 183,959,520 shares to its existing shareholders including the defendant and after the Invitation the total number of shares issued were approximately 238,549,520 with a paid up capital of about $23,845,000. The defendant himself held directly and indirectly 117,451,120 shares. After the IPO the listing of the shares on the SES took place on 26 February 1999.
One of the stated purposes in the prospectus of publicly listing Chosen Holdings according to the defendant was specifically to raise funds through the market for expansion in Shanghai as well as Malaysia.
The first and second plaintiffs commenced this action on 18 March 2000 about a year after the above listing of Chosen Holdings. They claimed that during the negotiations between the defendant and themselves to sell their shares to the defendant at the valuation of $12,000,000 more specifically between December 1997 and 14 March 1998 when the two agreements were signed, the defendant had intention and plans and was negotiating for a listing of the Chosen Group and his plans constituted material fa and circumstances which should have been disclosed to the plaintiffs as shareholders by the defendant because the defendant as a Managing Director had a fiduciary duty to them to do so and had such disclosures been made the plaintiffs would not have entered the two Agreements and sold their shares to him thereby occasioning a loss to them. The defendant had in the circumstances, breached his fiduciary duty to them for which wrongful conduct he was liable. The plaintiffs asked for rescission of the two agreements alternatively that the defendant make good their losses in respect of the sale of their shares.
The plaintiffs additionally had pleaded and contended that the defendant had also made 
 misrepresentations 
 concerning the Chosen Group to the effect that for the year 1998, the said companies were not doing well and their profits for 1998 would fall. Such representation the plaintiffs alleged were false and untrue or made recklessly and were made to 
 induce 
 the plaintiffs to sell their shares although the Chosen Group were doing well and the plaintiffs acting on the misrepresentations had sold their shares to the defendant. Further, alternatively, the plaintiffs pleaded that the representations were negligently made in breach of a duty of care owed by the defendant to the first and second plaintiffs.
However, to go on the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Goh Thien Phong (PW3), had the first and second plaintiffs not sold their shares in the Chosen Group to the defendant, they would each have been issued and entitled to hold at the end of the restructuring and before going public the following number of ordinary shares against their values based on a price of $0.20 being currently quoted for the counter on the SES during the hearing:
 
 
first plaintiff
 
:
 
41,842,430 ordinary shares valued at $8,368,486
 
 
 
second plaintiff
 
:
 
16,405,720 ordinary shares valued at $3,281,144
 
 
 
 
In the circumstances, as the first and second plaintiffs had already been paid $3,599,993.53 and $1,319,999.94 respectively, they claimed that their loss in damages had therefore been $4,768,492.50 for the first plaintiff and $1,961,145 for the second plaintiff.
The first and second plaintiffs before me claimed damages/accounts of profits due to them in the above sums of $4,768,492.50 and $1,961,145 from the defendant due to his wrongful conduct as a result of his fiduciary breach of duties. The plaintiffs had also pleaded for a rescission of the two agreements with the defendant but it was submitted on their behalf that they would be satisfied if the 
 alternative 
 remedy of damages/accounts of profit (ie equitable monetary compensation) due to them was granted.
The defendant denied these claims. His case, on the other hand, was that the plaintiffs and Yeh were willing sellers of the shares because they wanted to cash out having spent a small sum on their investments and had feared potential losses in Shanghai and were therefore not willing to pump more money into the Shanghai operation. The Asian financial crisis had also impacted on their decision. The defendant`s case was that by 31 December 1997, Chosen Shanghai`s Accountants Report (exh D3) showed the equivalent of $5,219,249.77 owing to Chosen Plastics for trade debts through Chosen Investment. This sum had grown from the amount owed in June 1999 as previously stated. The defendant`s evidence was that up to 31 December 1997 the Shanghai Co was for the time being loosing money as the plaintiffs well knew although the defendant was confident and was banking on its future profitability through expansion. The plaintiffs, he said, were aware of the situation. He said they had offered to sell him all their shares. He had never approached them to sell their shares and it was they who wanted to abandon ship and cash out and leave him to continue the business and to expose him to potential risks in China. The defendant said he had sacrificed his family life all these years for the business. The defendant said he was willing to leave the business if they bought out his shares at the same valuation they had mutually arrived. He had agreed to purchase their shares at the agreed valuation reluctantly. He had provided the plaintiffs all the information they wanted or they independently could get. But they did not want to. The defendant said that in a very competitive field and with one major customer he could not dither. He had to plan forward from December 1999 by when he had agreed to accept their oral offer to purchase their shares after the plaintiffs and Yeh did not want to buy him out so that he could raise fresh capital to ensure his expansion plans and to ensure the future viability of the company. He had therefore begun enquiring immediately from December 1999 about a possible listing on the SES or SESDAQ to raise funds. He emphasised that there was no guarantee he could obtain listing to raise public funds and he was given none as banking funds were hard to obtain because of the financial crisis and as banks had become very cautious. Further, he had also been reminded at that time they had only one main customer to purchase their goods - a fact which was not considered to be good for public listing as the evidence of his advisers showed. He said he owed no fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs or Yeh to disclose what were nothing more than enquiries by him from banking advisers on the possibility of obtaining an IPO to raise funds following the plaintiffs` oral offer to sell him their shares which he had accepted. He had, on the other hand, a fiduciary duty to advance the interests of the Chosen Group of companies and also at the same time to preserve his own interests in view of the plaintiffs` decision to part company with him.
 Decision 
 
 
 
The short issues were whether: 
(i) a fiduciary duty on the part of the defendant as Managing Director or special circumstances existed between the plaintiffs and the defendant requiring material disclosure by him; 
(ii) there was misrepresentation by the defendant.
 Law
 
 
 
 The existence of fiduciary duty or special circumstances
 
The law generally treats a company director, being its trustee and agent as a fiduciary. He may not make a secret profit from holding his office. Consequently, he owes a fiduciary duty to the company. However, he is generally regarded as not owing any such duty to shareholders of the company since the company is a separate entity from its shareholders. The latter principle of law, long observed, was stated a hundred years ago in 
Percival v Wright
 (Unreported) . In that case, the directors bought certain shares from a number of shareholders. The shareholders had approached and had offered to sell the shares to the directors. The directors at that time had an offer from a third party to purchase the whole undertaking in the said company. The directors did not disclose this fact to the shareholders from whom they purchased the shares. Although the purchase by the third party failed to go through, the shareholders sued the directors for non-disclosure of the third party`s offer and asked for a rescission of the sale submitting that they would have obtained a higher price for their shares if that information which had deliberately been concealed from them had been revealed to them by the directors. Swinden Eady J held: 
 
... the purchasing directors were under no obligation to disclose to their vendor shareholders the negotiations which ultimately proved abortive. The contrary view would place directors in a most invidious position, as they could not buy or sell shares without disclosing negotiations, a premature disclosure of which might well be against the best interest of the company. I am of opinion that directors are not in that position.
 
 
 
There is no question of unfair dealing in this case. The directors did not approach the shareholders with the view of obtaining their shares. The shareholders approached the directors and named the price at which they were desirous of selling. The plaintiffs` case wholly fails, and must be dismissed with costs.
 
 
 
One of the difficulties postulated in 
 Percival v Wright 
 was as to what information should be released by directors to shareholders. Plaintiffs` counsel in that case conceded that not all information known to directors should be made available also to shareholders. Counsel accepted on plaintiffs` behalf that directors were, as to information acquired in the ordinary course of management, `tacitly released` from their duty of disclosure. Counsel for the plaintiffs went on to state: 
 
The defendants, for instance, would not have been bound to disclose a large casual profit, the discovery of a new vein, or the prospect of a good dividend.
 
 
 
In 
 The Law Relating to Actionable Non-Disclosure and Other Breaches of Duty in Relations of Confidence, Influence and Advantage 
 by GS Bower (2nd Ed, 1990, by Sir Alexander Kingcome Turner) the learned author explained the decision in 
 Percival v Wright 
 (at para.18.53): 
 
In particular, the court did not hold that there might not be
 particular circumstances
, going beyond those inherent in the ordinary relation of director and shareholder, in which the imposition of fiduciary duties of disclosure would be entirely appropriate. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Since 
 Percival v Wright 
 there have therefore been a number of cases both in the United Kingdom and overseas which recognise that in particular or special circumstances some duties arise between directors and shareholders either requiring disclosure because a special relationship exists between the directors and the shareholders or because matters arise where shareholders have to necessarily rely on what directors say or do. In the latter type of case there is a guarded departure if any from the general principle set out in 
 Percival v Wright 
.
Thus, in 
Coleman v Myers
 
[1977] 2 NZLR 225
 in a transaction between directors and shareholders, the Court of Appeal in New Zealand held that special circumstances arose in the case giving rise to a fiduciary duty arising between the parties necessitating material disclosure by the directors because of the family character of the company, the position of the directors in the family and the company, their high degree of insider knowledge and the manner in which the directors had gone about persuading shareholders to sell their shares.
In 
Glavanics v Brunninghausen
 
[1996] 19 ACSR 204
, an Australian case, the court held that fiduciary relationship between a director and a shareholder who was also a director, (but an inactive one) existed. The brief facts were that the relationship between the two directors G & B, having deteriorated, G, the inactive director, agreed to sell his one-sixth shareholding to B. However, prior to the agreement B had received an offer for the purchase of the company business of which he did not inform G. B having bought G`s shares thereafter sold the company to the purchaser. The court was of the view that although there was no relationship of confidence and trust between G & B it nevertheless recognised several factors inherent in the case which gave rise to a fiduciary relationship between G and B, namely, a direct sale of shares by G to B; the fact of there being only the said two shareholders in the company which made it realistically impossible to distinguish between a fiduciary duty owed to a company and that owed to the shareholders and very importantly the evidence had gone on to show G`s complete dependence on B for information and advice and the prior offer of purchase of the business of the company by another in the circumstances was regarded as material factor which B ought to have disclosed to G as the information was sensitive to the pricing of the shares that G sold to B. On appeal the Court of Appeal of New South Wales affirmed the decision: 
Brunninghausen v Glavanics
 
[1999] 32 ACSR 294
. In so upholding the decision, the appellate court opined that whilst the general principle that a director`s fiduciary duties are owed to the company and not to the shareholders is correct, the nature of the transaction may give rise to a fiduciary duty owed by the directors to the shareholders. 
 Ford`s Principles of Corporate Law 
 sums up pithly the circumstances in which there is a fiduciary obligation to disclose: 
 
In summary, pointers towards the existence of a fiduciary obligation include shareholders` dependence upon information and advice, the existence of a relationship of confidence, the significance of some particular transaction for the parties and the extent of any positive action taken by, or on behalf of the directors to promote the transaction and the structure of shareholdings in the company: 
Coleman v Myers, Chan v Zacharia
 
[1984] 154 CLR 178
 at 198; 53 ALR 417 per Deane J; 
 Glavanics v Brunninghausen
. Even if there is no relationship of trust and confidence, as was the case in 
 Brunninghausen
, a fiduciary relationship can still exist between a director and shareholder where the director occupies a position of particular advantage in relation to the shareholder and special circumstances, such as confidential negotiations to sell the company`s business, allow the director to use that advantage to the detriment of the shareholder: 
 Brunninghausen v Glanavics
.
 
 
 
 
 Misrepresentation
 
As to misrepresentation by the defendant, the law envisages the representation made to be one of fact and not just an expression of opinion. However, any opinion or belief must be shown to be expressed upon reasonable grounds. If it can be shown that a defendant possessing knowledge did not express his opinion honestly such expression of an opinion can amount to a misrepresentation for which relief lies. Thus in 
Smith v Land & House Property Corp
 
[1884] 28 Ch D 7
 at 15, per Bowen LJ stated: 
 
It is often fallaciously assumed that a statement of opinion cannot involve the statement of a fact. In a case where the fa are equally well known to both parties, what one of them says to the other is frequently nothing but an expression of opinion ... But if the facts are not equally well known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by the one who knows the facts best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly states that he knows facts which justify his opinion.
 
 
 
Similarly, an opinion stated as a fact where for instance a company publish as a forecast of an expert as if it was a positive fact then such publication constitutes a representation.
However, a misrepresentation is considered to be harmless if amongst other things, if a plaintiff did not allow it to affect his judgment. In 
JEB Fasteners Ltd v Marks Bloom & Co
 
[1983] 1 All ER 583
 the plaintiffs who were negotiating to acquire a company were given inaccurate company accounts. The accounts were considered by the plaintiffs but did not in any material degree affect their judgment in deciding whether or not to acquire the company. The Court of Appeal held that on the facts the plaintiffs were not entitled to any relief. If a plaintiff equates an opinion as a statement of fact constituting a misrepresentation then the plaintiff must show that he reasonably relied on it and induced the plaintiff to act as he did.
 Law and fact
 
 
 
 Misrepresentation
 
I shall take the first and second plaintiffs` second submission - that of misrepresentation first. The misrepresentation pleaded and alleged by the first plaintiff in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief in paras 40 and 44 (1PAEC) and reiterated in evidence was that the defendant had stated: 
(i) that for the year 1998 the Chosen Group was not doing well; 
(ii) that profits of the aforesaid companies for 1998 would fall.
Briefly, the first plaintiff`s evidence as contained in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief was that in February 1998 when the first and second plaintiffs, Yeh and the defendant met to finalise the valuation of the Chosen Group (excluding Chosen Investments, Chosen Shanghai & Performance Plastic Sdn Bhd because they were not making money) at $12,000,000 they had not taken into account the 
 prospective 
 profits for the year 1998 because the defendant had told the others that Chosen Plastics and its related companies were not doing well and that their profit would fall. The first plaintiff testified the annual report of Chosen Plastics and its related companies (Exh. 3AB 771) subsequently showed a profit for the year ending June 1998 to be $4,579,868. This profit had not been considered in the valuation reached between the parties because the defendant had said 1998 was not profitable. Had he known of the potential for such profits he would not have agreed to the $12,000,000 valuation and would have negotiated further.
The defendant`s evidence, on the other hand, in cross-examination was that the statement attributed to him about the Chosen Group not doing well was made in about December 1997 in the midst of the Asian crisis and as an expression of opinion then, whilst the first and second plaintiffs were now looking at the account books with hindsight. He said he was being cautious. As far as the second allegation that profits for 1998 would fall, he had not made such a statement and that the first and second plaintiffs knew between July 1997 and November 1997 that four companies in the group had been doing well i.e. three in Singapore and Malaysia and that Newtech was doing particularly well in the same business. He had never induced them to sell their shares nor were they induced as such.
I noticed that whilst the first plaintiff alleged that the defendant had said that Chosen Plastics group was not doing well for 1998 and the profits for 1998 would fall, the second plaintiff`s evidence was that: 
 
defendant said crisis would affect results [NE 34].
 
 
 
The first plaintiff himself was asked and answered: 
 
 
Q: Assuming it was made the defendant`s view was being expressed cautiously since it was difficult to predict profits ahead? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
I found that no accurate statement was recalled as to what words were exactly used by the defendant. In any event, I accepted the evidence of the defendant that he was apprehensive and was expressing a concern and a fair opinion in December 1997 about a possible lower earning for the year ended 1998 in view of the Asian crisis which was then getting worse and because they had only one client Hewlett Packard with whom the contra were all for a duration of a short period of three months each time. Hewlett Packard could reduce contra and dictate prices after giving a brief notice. I also accept the defendant`s evidence that the defendant did not say that for 1998 profits would be lower. The first plaintiff was recalling from memory what the defendant told him three years earlier. I also found the first plaintiff varied his evidence a number of times thereby affecting his credibility. For example, concerning the negotiations for sale of the shares, having said in his pleadings the negotiations started in September 1997, in court he changed the month to October 1997. In another part of his evidence he stated that negotiations had started in February 1998. When questioned again whether they had not started in September 1997, he said he meant `final` negotiations were in February 1998 although the word `final` had not been used by him earlier. When asked by the court when was the meeting to sell the shares he had simply replied `February 1998`.
In any event, I was satisfied that even assuming the statements as alleged by the first plaintiff and attributed to the defendant were made and the statements amounted to misrepresentations (which though I found they were not) they did not induce the first plaintiff or the second plaintiffs to sell their shares to the defendant. This is because the first plaintiff admitted so himself in his cross-examination: 
 
 
Q: Are paras 40 and 44 [1PAEC] your only evidence in regard to your alleged misrepresentation? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Assuming such a statement was made - that statement did not make you sell your shares? 
 
A: Yes. Not because of statements defendant made in paras 40 and 44.
  
 
 
I agreed with defence counsel that in the circumstances there was no evidence that the plaintiffs were induced by any such representations to sell their shares to him. The first plaintiff`s judgment was unaffected by the statements if made. The said plaintiffs also could not have relied on any such statements because they were experienced businessmen and had access to all the information concerning the companies.
There is one other allegation of the first plaintiff which I propose to deal under the heading of misrepresentation as a matter of convenience although not pleaded under such a heading but raised in the first plaintiff`s affidavit of evidence-in-chief and testimony in court. According to the first plaintiff`s oral testimony, he had been told in `1997` on `two` or `three` occasions when he asked the defendant whether `we can consider listing` (Chosen Plastics) the defendant had replied it was `not possible`. Questioned in 
 cross-examination 
 that the defendant had told him `it was difficult` and not `not possible`, his reply was `I cannot remember`. Although the first plaintiff orally recalled in court that he was told the above on two or three occasions in 1997, in his Affidavit, however, he had not recalled how many times he was told. In his interrogatories, however, he had answered it was once in early 1997. In court, he said it was in September 1997. With the first plaintiff contradicting his evidence I was satisfied on the consistent and unblemished evidence of the defendant that the first plaintiff had queried him only once and that too in early March 1997 when he told him it `was difficult` to list Chosen Plastics because of the dependency of the Chosen Group on one customer, a view which OUB shared. The defendant was expressing his opinion and made no wilful misrepresentation to the first plaintiff as such.
 Fiduciary duty/special circumstances
I now come to the first issue canvassed on behalf of the plaintiffs, that of fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiffs by the defendant as alleged by the plaintiffs and its breach, if any, by him or the presence of special circumstances or relationship obliging the defendant to make the material disclosure.
I would point out at the outset that the existence of a fiduciary duty and the obligations it entails under it differ widely and will largely be dependent on the circumstances of the particular case, ie a situation specific approach has to be adopted to determine its existence. The issue therefore must be seen and understood and analysed against the working relationship and background of the plaintiffs and the defendant in the Chosen Group together and the reasons for the divestment by the plaintiffs of their shares to the defendant.
There was as was in the case of 
 Glavanics v Brunninghausen 
 no relationship of confidence and trust between the plaintiffs and the defendant. It was purely a business relationship. The first and second plaintiffs seldom met socially or went out together.
So what then were the factors inherent in the case that gave rise to a fiduciary relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant, if any? I could discern none. Unlike in 
 Glavanics v Brunninghausen 
 where there were only two shareholders, (the plaintiff and the defendant) the judge could not differentiate the duty owed to the company and the shareholders as such there, in the present case apart from the defendant there were other shareholders in Chosen Plastics and the related companies. One of the more important considerations of establishing a fiduciary relationship between a director and at that a managing director, buying shares from shareholders (here the first and second plaintiffs) is to show that such a director misled them on the share price at which the shares were sold thereby depriving them of a higher price and/or misled them on some relevant fact which if disclosed to them would have resulted in their not selling the shares at all as they were completely dependent on the said director for information.
The facts of the instant case clearly show that the first and second plaintiffs were not dependent on the defendant for information concerning either the performance of the Chosen Group or its valuation. The plaintiffs themselves were active directors of the companies and suffered from no disadvantage. They conceded that they could get any information on the said companies as directors and the defendant had never refused to give them any information they wanted. They had all the relevant accounts as at the end of December 1999.
The plaintiffs as directors of the Chosen Group had themselves been involved in the decision making process of the Chosen Group through passing resolutions, signing cheques and annual reports. The plaintiffs had put in initially $40,000 and $10,000 as investment in Chosen Plastics and ploughed profits back into the company and it grew. They eventually volunteered to sell all their shareholdings to the defendant devoid of any persuasion by the defendant. The first plaintiff admitted in his 
 cross-examination 
 that he and the defendant met together to discuss business sometimes and at other times the defendant met with the second plaintiff and also with Yeh two or three times a year [NE 20]. The first plaintiff further admitted that management business plans were discussed with him and the second plaintiff and that the defendant also discussed all expansion plans involving raising and expenditure of money with him. The first plaintiff and the second plaintiffs were also co-signatories of cheques of Chosen Plastics and some of the related companies and signatories of annual reports of both Chosen Plastics and Chosen Malaysia. It was the second plaintiff who co-signed Chosen Plastics a cheque returning $2.1m loan moneys to the defendant upon completion of the sale and purchase of the shares in question. The second plaintiff was also Chosen Plastics` Secretary from 1986 to 1998 and resolutions of Chosen Plastics were signed by either one or both plaintiffs. The plaintiffs had also stood as personal guarantors to loans taken by Chosen Plastics part of which were used to fund the business in Shanghai.
It was plain to me from all these facts which were not in dispute that both plaintiffs had taken an active and informed interest in the Chosen Group. They were businessmen of long standing. They were actively pursuing at the same time other businesses they owned and they knew or must have known how the business of the Chosen Group was being run and what the revenues and profits were. I would also like to mention that the first plaintiff was also running a significant and successful separate business in Hiashya Machinery which sold injection moulding machinery and had sold many dozens of such machines each costing in the region of about $50,000 or more to the Chosen Group and was or had been a director in half a dozen other companies and that he had as late as 1995/6 gone on to start another business in China. The second plaintiff had been or was a shareholder and or director in also about half a dozen other companies.
Then again the defendant had no hand in the plaintiffs wanting to sell their shares to him. That the first plaintiff volunteered to sell all his shares in Chosen Plastics and its related companies is admitted to in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief after disagreeing with the defendant about his policy and plans to expand in China and articulating his lack of confidence about making it good there. Importantly, the first plaintiff`s challenging words to the defendant were that 
 if he was so confident then he should take over the company and further responded that things could be discussed when the defendant told him that he did not have enough money to buy over the company 
. The first plaintiff in his cross-examination also admitted that he the first plaintiff thereafter approached the defendant to sell him his shares. The second plaintiff and Yeh had joined in to sell their shareholdings as the trio were in close touch with each other. Yeh no doubt wanted to sell out after he was unhappy because he wanted a personal loan from Chosen Plastics of $500,000 from its retained earnings. This request had been rightly rejected by the defendant. As for the second plaintiff, he had expressed his own reasons for selling his shareholdings to the defendant, namely, that he had lost track of the company`s business, that it was growing too fast and he could not keep track of it and he was afraid of the indirect liability for the Shanghai operations when the first phase of the expansion in Shanghai was implemented. The first and second plaintiffs were aware at all times that the Chosen Group as a whole were still making good money at the end of 1997. Results for the financial years of 1996 and 1997 of Chosen Plastics show a profit of $2,004,814 and $2,583,354. The letter account was co-signed by the second plaintiff. The unaudited balance sheet of Chosen Malaysia given to the defendant at the end of December 1997 and standing as at 31 December 1997 showed an accumulative profit of RM5,364,714.60.
In the circumstances, I agreed with defendant`s counsel`s submission and came to the conclusion that the first and second plaintiffs were eager to sell out and hold cash and had voluntarily offered to sell their shares to the defendant in September 1997 which offer he accepted as they were apprehensive about the defendant`s intended expansion of the Chosen Group in Shanghai China because as guarantors to bank loans to Chosen Plastic in Singapore which in turn was financing the Shanghai operations they felt exposed. After September to early March 2000 the parties were only concerned with accepting a valuation of the Chosen Group (save for the loss making companies as explained by the first plaintiff and stated earlier) and the purchase price of the shares to be paid by the defendant. All this was settled on 14 March 2000 by the two written agreements.
I was further satisfied that the plaintiffs and Yeh had prolonged discussions from September 1997 to early March 2000 on what the valuation should be as they regularly consulted Yeh on the valuation even to the extent of going to meet him in Taiwan. The first plaintiff in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief said that Yeh had felt the valuation was in the region of $20,000,000. Eventually, Yeh had come to Singapore in March and the plaintiffs and Yeh finalised the price at $12,000,000 as the defendant was not prepared to value Chosen Plastics and the related companies higher. The defendant had taken into consideration and quite rightly too that he was buying the shares during the economic crisis of which I took judicial notice, when most businesses felt uncertainty; that he was going to pay for the shares in cash with bank borrowings on which he had to pay interest; that quoted shares were illiquid and were always sold at a discount and the book value of a company may not always be realised on an asset sale. I bore in mind that the plaintiffs and Yeh had also decided not to buy out the defendant at the same valuation.
I may add that although the plaintiffs denied that the Asian crisis was a cause of their selling off their shares, it was a reasonable inference from all the evidence that the crisis in all probability also weighed on their minds and I drew such an inference. I was satisfied that the plaintiffs therefore did not want to take these risks and preferred to cash out with the considerable profit they were sitting on, namely, the first plaintiff on some $3.6m and the second plaintiff on some $1.3m and they did cash out after signing the two Agreements in March 1998 by agreeing to value the company at $12,000,000. Moreover, the first plaintiff cannot complain about the above valuation because he himself admitted 
 that at that time it was a good price 
 (NE 14). The first plaintiff`s financial input into the Chosen Group had been about $40,000 and the second plaintiff`s about $10,000 some 15 years earlier.
I now come to the first and second plaintiffs` main complaint that the defendant did not tell them that, he was making enquiries or conducting negotiations to publicly list the Chosen Plastics and its related companies on the SES and they would not have entered the written agreements and sold to the defendant their shares had he divulged this information to them and that as such he breached his fiduciary duty to them as a director. The defendant did not dispute that from December onwards he had started to inquire from OUB Bank and Henry Tan on the possibility of the Chosen Group going public by listing them on the stock exchange and that he did not disclosure this information to the plaintiffs. He believed he did not have to. He had explained why.
I am of the opinion that the defendant was not under a duty to so inform the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs had already indicated to the defendant that they wanted to divest themselves from the Chosen Group and sell their shares to him specifically because of a fear of potential future losses by the Shanghai branch of the Chosen Group. The defendant had already announced his plans to them that he wanted to expand in Shanghai. They had refused and wanted instead to sell all their holdings off. They had no confidence in his judgment. The defendant was, to my mind, entitled to buy the shares from the plaintiffs which they wanted to sell to him and make future plans immediately by attempting to raise funds in any manner he thought fit including from the public by a public listing of the Chosen Group through the newly incorporated vehicle Chosen Holdings so as to provide for the future of the Chosen Group and to raise a loan to pay for the shares he was buying from the defendant.
It is pertinent to note that during this period all the defendant had done was to consult with OUB (and DBS) about the possibility of listing his company to raise funds for expansion in China. Both OUB and DBS banks had given him a Mandate letter dated 6th January 1998 to sign. Any of the letters if signed would have given a Mandate to the selected bank to act for the Chosen Group to manage and procure the IPO. The defendant had only been told that a listing was possible. The defendant had left it `at that`. He had not signed on and returned the Mandate letter to either bank as the application of his loan to pay for the shares was facing difficulties. Eventually, he only signed the letter of Mandate in June 1998 in OUB`s favour when they agreed to give him a personal loan to help him pay for the shares bought from the first and second plaintiffs and Yeh. The approval for the loan had come only on 10th June 1998. Until then everything was uncertain and it was only after that, that OUB went ahead processing the application for a public listing. All this took place well after 14t March 1998 when the two agreements were signed formalising the sale of the shares of the plaintiffs to the defendant.
I found the defendant had pursued the possibility of listing the Chosen Group only after the plaintiffs had rebuffed his plans to expand the business operations in China by cutting off more funds going from Singapore to Shanghai and by offering to sell all their shares to the defendant which offer he had orally accepted pending settlement of the price to be paid for the shares. If I understood the first and second plaintiffs` contention rightly, it was this. With hindsight of over a year after the public listing of Chosen Holdings the plaintiffs were saying the defendant should have disclosed his 
 future 
 plans for the Chosen Group after they had orally agreed with him to withdraw from the said companies but before the two agreements were signed on 14 March 2000 so that they would have had the opportunity to change their minds about selling him the shares. I have said earlier that all the defendant had done was to make inquiries about listing up to the time when the two agreements to sell the shares were signed between the respective parties. There was as far as I could see, no duty imposed by the law on the defendant to so disclose his 
 future 
 plans for the Chosen Group which were only then conceptual and premature and which even if initiated may eventually have turned out to be abortive.
Finally, the law recognises that a shareholder is entitled to act in his own interests. In 
Pender v Lushington
 
[1877] 6 Ch D 70
 where the plaintiffs were registered shareholders and entitled to vote but their votes were rejected on the ground that their purpose in acquiring the shares was to vote for an improper motive, Jessel MR said: 
 
... in all cases of this kind where men exercise their rights for some motive adequate or inadequate, and I have always considered the law to be that those who have the rights of property are entitled to exercise them whatever their motive may be for such exercise.
 
 
 
The learned judge went on to hold that a shareholder has a right, if he thinks fit, to give his vote from motives or promptings of what he considers his own individual interests. By parity of reasoning, I am therefore of the opinion that the defendant as a shareholder was entitled to consider his own interests as well. I hold on the facts found that there was neither a fiduciary relationship between him and the plaintiffs nor were there any special or exceptional circumstances warranting the defendant to make the disclosure the plaintiffs complained of as not being made. I further found that no issue therefore arose of any applicable relief being available to the plaintiffs. The defendant as a director had not acted unfairly or improperly in his relations with the plaintiffs in the divestment of the shares in question by them.
The plaintiffs having therefore failed to prove their case on a balance of probabilities, I dismissed the same with costs to be taxed or agreed.

s 9A Interpretation Act (Cap 1)
 
: This was an appeal by the prosecution against the sentence imposed by District Judge A Rahim Jalil on the respondent. Tsao had pleaded guilty to one charge of attempting to commit house-breaking by night with the intention of committing theft contrary to s 457 read with s 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Act`).
Tsao had also pleaded guilty to one charge of failing to present himself for a urine test contrary to a supervision order which is an offence under reg 15(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations 1976 and punishable under reg 15(6)(a). Two other similar charges under these Regulations were taken into consideration.
Tsao`s antecedents included a conviction under s 457 of the Act in 1990 and a conviction under s 454 in 1993. For the latter offence, he was sentenced to suffer the enhanced punishment of caning provided for under s 458A.
The judge sentenced Tsao to undergo six years` corrective training. He rejected the prosecution`s argument that s 458A applied here as well and that, therefore, caning should also be imposed. This was because the offence Tsao pleaded guilty to was an attempt to commit the offence under s 457, whereas s 458A states that the enhanced punishment of caning applies where a person commits an offence under s 457.
The prosecution appealed on the basis that the sentence was manifestly inadequate because the judge failed to impose the punishment of caning.
 The issue 
 
 
 
The issue here was whether or not s 458A applies where a person is convicted of having attempted to commit an offence under s 457 and, if so, whether or not Tsao was liable to the enhanced punishment of caning. The DPP submitted that there is no direct authority in the law reports which relates to this issue, and invited the court to set out the grounds of its decision to provide a useful precedent for the future.
 The prosecution case 
 
 
 
The prosecution submitted that a plain reading of s 458A showed that it applies. The charge states that Mr Tsao `committed an offence punishable under section 457 read with section 511`. There is no distinct offence of attempted house-breaking and so the offence was one under s 457, but read with another section. Therefore, Tsao committed an offence under s 457.
The next submission was that the Parliamentary intention behind s 458A (enacted in 1984) was that the enhanced punishment of caning should apply to an attempt as well as to a completed offence.
The prosecution therefore submitted that: 
 
the words `commits an offence` under s 457 should not be strictly read to mean that that specific offence of s 457 must have been committed. But rather, it should be taken to mean 
 the commission of any offence of which the substantive provision is s 457
. (Italics in original.)
 
 
 
 
 
 The defence case 
 
 
 
 
 
Counsel for Tsao, Mr R Kalamohan, argued that s 458A is at least ambiguous and, on established principles of statutory interpretation of penal provisions, any ambiguity should be resolved in favour of an accused person.
Secondly, Mr Kalamohan argued that the legislative intent behind s 458A was to impose caning only on professional and repeat offenders where there is a possibility of injury, assault, rape or death.
Finally, Mr Kalamohan pointed out that the Penal Code does not deal with attempts as severely as it does with completed offences. Section 511 of the Act does not allow any imprisonment term to exceed one-half of the longest term provided for the offence.
 The district judge`s decision 
 
 
 
The judge rejected the prosecutor`s submissions. First, he contended that a plain reading of s 458A required the offence under s 457 to have been committed and not merely to have been attempted.
Secondly, he contended that an attempt is not treated as severely as a completed offence. He referred to the punishment provision under s 511 and contended that this indicates that, when it comes to sentence, `the offender who attempts to commit an offence would receive a lesser sentence`.
Thirdly, he contended that a statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty should be strictly construed and that a construction more favourable to the accused should be adopted to resolve any ambiguity in a penal provision.
Finally, the judge rejected the construction of s 458A made by the prosecutor because `[this] approach would run contrary to the settled rule of the construction of a penal provision`. The judge also disagreed that the parliamentary intention behind s 458A was as stated by the prosecutor, because the debates referred to `made no mention that the section would also apply to attempted offences`. The judge also rejected the application of the principle in the case of 
Richards v Macpherson
 
[1943] VLR 44
 to this case. This was because that case dealt with the equivalent of s 109 of the Act which equates the sentence for an abettor with that for a principal offender. The same cannot be said for attempts. `On the contrary, s 511 specifically provides different punishments for each.`
 Observations 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ambiguity and the construction of penal statutes
 
The answer to this conundrum lies in the correct interpretation of s 458A. The defence makes much of the rule that penal statutes ought to be construed strictly in favour of the accused in the case where the statute is ambiguous and two reasonable constructions are possible. Mr Kalamohan quoted Justice GP Singh who said, `[a] statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty is strictly construed` (
 Principles of Statutory Interpretation 
 (7th Ed, 1999) at p 631). However, the author continued: 
 
But this rule ... is now-a-days of a limited application; and speaking broadly, serves in the selection of one when two or more constructions are reasonably open. The rule exhibits a preference for the liberty of the subject and in a case of ambiguity enables the court to resolve the doubt in favour of the subject and against the Legislature which has failed to express itself clearly.
 
 
 
The defence also relied on the case of 
The Andara
 
 [1978-1979] SLR 364 
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 190
  where it was held that a construction more favourable to the ship owners should be adopted to resolve any ambiguity in a penal provision. In a more recent case, 
Teng Lang Khin v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 372
 , it was likewise held that `the penal nature of s 101(2) [of the Road Traffic Act] required that [any] ambiguity be resolved in favour of the appellant`. Reliance was also placed on a dictum of Lord Esher MR in 
Tuck & Sons v Priester
 
[1887] 19 QBD 629
 at p 638: 
 
If there is a reasonable interpretation which will avoid the penalty in any particular case, we must adopt that construction. If there are two reasonable constructions we must give the more lenient one. That is the settled rule for the construction of penal sections.
 
 
 
The first question then was whether or not there is an ambiguity in s 458A. Farnsworth explained what an ambiguity is by distinguishing it from the related concept of vagueness. He said: 
 
According to this distinction, a word is vague to the extent that it defines `not a neatly bounded class but a distribution about a central norm`. Thus the word 
 green
 is vague as it shades into yellow at the one extreme and into blue at the other, so that its applicability in marginal situations is uncertain. Ambiguity is an entirely distinct concept. A word may have two entirely different connotations, so that it may be at the same time both appropriate and inappropriate. Thus the word 
 light
 is ambiguous when considered in the context of dark feathers. (
 Word and Object
, 1960 at p 85, quoting W Quine.)
 
 
 
It has been held that a document is not ambiguous just because a variety of definitions can be found in the lexicon; the intended meaning may be clear from the context ( 
Cincinnati Ins Co v Flanders Electric Motor Service Incorp
 (Unreported) ). Also, words are not necessarily ambiguous because courts in past cases have taken a different view of the words ( 
Graingrowers Warehouse Co v Central National Ins Co
 (Unreported) ). A fortiori a word is not necessarily ambiguous simply because the parties to the instant dispute have taken different views of the words ( 
Kane v Royal Ins Co of America
 (Unreported) ; 
Budd v P & O Steam Navigation Co Ltd
 
[1969] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 262
).
In 
Higgins v Dawson
 
[1902] AC 1
 at p 10, Lord Davey said: 
 
[a document] is not ambiguous by reason only that it is difficult of construction. If it is finally held to bear a particular construction, that must govern its legal meaning, notwithstanding any difficulty that the courts might have felt in arriving judicially at the construction; it is only ambiguous when, after full consideration, it is determined judicially that no interpretation can be given to it.
 
 
 
In my view the words in s 458A are not ambiguous. Therefore, the rule requiring a strict construction of penal statutes was not relevant. The real question that faced this court was whether to adopt a literal approach to interpretation and give effect to the plain meaning of the section or whether to adopt a purposive approach and endeavour to discover the parliamentary intention behind the section and give effect to it. The answer is clear. Section 9A of the Interpretation Act requires the latter approach. Furthermore, s 9A makes it clear that Parliament does not believe that statutory provisions alone are sufficient for courts to rely on. It expressly allows the use of extrinsic materials in the quest for the true meaning of statutory provisions.
 Purposive interpretation 
 
 
 
This approach is certainly apposite to this case. In 
Diaz Priscilla v Diaz Angela
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 361
 , the Court of Appeal held that, in applying s 9A, there was no need for any ambiguity or inconsistency in the provision in question. The dictum of Dawson J in 
Mills v Meeking
 
[1990] 169 CLR 214
 at p 235 was approved of: 
 
the approach required by s [9A(1)] needs no ambiguity or inconsistency; it allows a court to consider the purposes of an Act in determining whether there is more than one possible construction. Reference to the purposes may reveal that the draftsman has inadvertently overlooked something which he would have dealt with had his attention been drawn to it and if it is possible as a matter of construction to repair the defect, then this must be done.
 
 
 
Both the parties in this case dealt with the question of what exactly the intention of Parliament was. They both made reference to the record of the second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill which resulted in, inter alia, s 458A. They both relied on the paragraph entitled `Clauses 19 to 25: Housebreaking` at p 1870. In this appeal, the defence argued that `[t]he legislative intent of imposing caning is meant for professional and repeat offenders of housebreaking and where there is a possibility of injury, assault, rape or even death`. The prosecution, on the other hand, argued: 
 
it is clear that the intent and purpose of the enactment under s 458A was one of deterrence. The additional punishment of caning that the court was empowered to impose in a subsequent offence was to be an additional deterrence. ... the need for deterrence is equally compelling in a case where the accused has tried but is unsuccessful in completing the task at hand ie housebreaking.
 
 
 
It seemed from a reading of the paragraph that the amendment was introduced to deal more effectively with what was perceived as a particularly heinous offence; one which caused psychological harm and (potentially) serious physical harm as well. No doubt burglary is a serious offence. But can it be said that an attempt to burglarise is as serious and should therefore be treated in the same way? The paragraph itself makes no mention of attempts but the mischief it is aimed at is clear: the risks associated with house-breaking. The aim of the amendment was to prevent or minimise such mischief.
In my view, the intention of Parliament behind s 458A was to deter a subsequent attempt as much as a subsequent commission of an offence under s 454 or s 457. This was so because an attempt to break into a house would trigger the same insecurities and cause the same anxieties and fears in the occupants. Furthermore, a burglar who was caught attempting to break in by an occupant might be just as dangerous as one who had succeeded. If Parliament intended to prevent this harm when it was caused by the commission of the offence, it could be said to have intended to prevent this same harm when it was caused by an attempt to commit the offence.
There was another reason why no distinction should be drawn here between an attempt and the actual commission of the offence under s 457. It is usually purely fortuitous why an attempt was unsuccessful and, if the offender had his way, the offence would have been consummated. This was true of this case as well. Tsao certainly had the mens rea necessary for the offence - he intended to break into the clinic to steal. The fact that he was arrested just before he got in did not lessen his moral blameworthiness by one iota.
The modern law recognises that there is no distinction between the culpability of one who attempts to commit and one who succeeds in committing an offence. Once a man can be said to have `embarked on the crime proper` ( 
R v Gullefer
 
[1990] 3 All ER 882
, followed in 
Chua Kian Kok v PP
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 542
 ) he has committed the actus reus of attempting to commit the offence. If he has, at the same time, the intention to commit the offence, he also has the necessary mens rea (
 Chua Kian Kok 
, supra). However, when a man has `embarked on the crime proper` with the intention of committing the crime, he is morally blameworthy whether or not he succeeds or is prevented from succeeding by some fortuitous event. As Clarkson put it: 
 
One who tries to kill another or to cause other harm is in as much need of incapacitation and rehabilitation as one who succeeds ... from a retributivist standpoint the person who tries to commit a crime is just as blameworthy as he who succeeds. The difference between success and failure could be mere chance and the criminal law is not a lottery with liability dependent on `the invisible hand of Fate` (Schulhofer, 1974). ( 
Criminal Law in Singapore and Malaysia
 
[1989] at p 249
.)
 
 
 
Indeed, the English Criminal Attempts Act 1981 generally allows a court, upon a conviction of attempt, to impose any penalty that would be within its powers for the completed offence (s 4). Our Penal Code provides that attempts should `be punished with such punishment as is provided for the offence (but subject to the proviso that imprisonment is limited to half the maximum allowed).
If one who attempts to commit and one who succeeds in committing an offence are equally blameworthy, they should be punished similarly. However, this is not the case in practice. Although the English Criminal Attempts Act allows the same punishment for inchoate and completed offences, `[i]n practice, the punishment for an attempt will generally be less than for the consummated crime ... Often the attempter receives a discount of 50 per cent or more` (Glanville Williams, 
 Textbook of Criminal Law 
 (2nd Ed, 1983)). Likewise, the proviso to s 511 limits any term of imprisonment to half the maximum allowed for the offence.
There is at least one good reason why an attempter should be punished less severely. It provides some inducement for such a one to desist before he brings about the harm he intends. This goes against the logic that it should make no difference whether a person is thwarted by the police or by his conscience of by a fear of a heavier penalty. He is punished because he has `embarked on the crime proper` with the intention of committing the crime. Therein lies the reprehensibility of his behaviour and it is no less reprehensible merely because he failed to succeed. However, as Professor Smith has pointed out, `[i]n some jurisdictions, logic has given way to policy and a defence of free and voluntary desistance is allowed` (
 Smith & Hogan`s Criminal Law 
 (9th Ed, 1999) at p 320). But the Professor continued, `[t]he principal argument in favour of a withdrawal defence is that it might induce the attempter to desist - but this seems unlikely. The existence of the defence would add to the problems of law enforcement authorities` (ibid).
In any event, to those who object that there must be a distinction between the sentence for an inchoate and a complete offence, if only to encourage offenders to desist before consummating the offence, it can be argued that s 458A merely requires caning as an additional punishment. The court is left with the discretion as to how many strokes to impose. Therefore, such concerns should not affect the interpretation of s 458A as applying to cases where a subsequent s 457 offence is attempted.
There is at least one more good reason for applying s 458A to attempts. If the law were otherwise, the police or the public would have to allow a known convicted burglar to succeed in breaking in and stealing before they arrested him in order to ensure that he would be liable for the enhanced punishment of caning. This certainly could not have been the intention of Parliament. Once a person has attempted to commit an offence, the police ought to be able to move swiftly to thwart the consummation of the offence unhindered by any fear that they would be thwarting at the same time the imposition of any enhanced punishment which the person would suffer if they allowed him to commit the offence before effecting an arrest.
Additionally, the prosecution drew attention to a very pertinent section of the Interpretation Act. Section 38 provides: 
 
A provision which constitutes an offence shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be deemed to provide also that an attempt to commit such offence shall be an offence against such provision, punishable as if the offence itself had been committed.
 
 
 
 
 
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 458A was clearly intended to be an enhanced punishment provision. It states that it applies in the case of a subsequent commission of an offence under s 457. However, for all the reasons above, it should equally apply in the case where a person attempts to commit a subsequent offence under s 457. Therefore, the appeal by the prosecution was allowed and an additional sentence of caning of six strokes was imposed on the respondent.

: This was an appeal by the appellant, Lim Poh Tee (`Lim`), against the sentence imposed by district judge Jasvendar Kaur.
In the court below, Lim claimed trial to and was convicted, of one charge of corruptly accepting from one Chua Tiong Tiong (`Chua`), a known illegal moneylender, gratification in the form of free entertainment of an unspecified sum on a day in 1997, as an inducement to show favour to Chua in relation to his principal`s affairs, to wit, to assist Chua in the event that he requires help in his illegal moneylending activities, which offence was punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (`PCA`). Lim initially lodged, but later discontinued, an appeal against the conviction. At the hearing below, he was also tried and acquitted of two other charges of framing an incorrect record or writing with intent to save a person from punishment, which offences were punishable under s 218 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). There was no appeal against the orders of acquittal..
Chua was jointly tried and convicted at the same trial, of corruptly giving the said gratification to Lim, which offence was punishable under s 6(b) PCA. He was sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment. Chua has appealed against the sentence and his appeal is pending.
The sentence prescribed for an offence punishable under s 6(a) PCA was a term of imprisonment of up to five years or fine not exceeding $100,000 or both. The district judge sentenced the appellant to two and a half years` imprisonment. After hearing both parties, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons in writing.
 The facts 
 
 
 
Lim joined the Singapore Police Force as a police constable in 1983. At the material time, he held the post of Acting Inspector, attached to the Violent Crime Squad at the Jurong Police Division Headquarters. He was a key officer in the division. He was the second officer-in-charge of the Violent Crime Squad and was also covering the duties of a Chief Investigation Officer (IV).
Chua, also known as `Ah Long San` or `Ah San`, operated an illegal money-lending business from Geylang. This was known to Lim. Together, they had frequented the Lido Palace Nite Club (`Lido Palace`) located at Concorde Hotel at least four or five times since 1996. Chua was the one who settled the bills on these occasions.
Lem Woon Wee (`Lem`), was formerly a police corporal attached to Jurong Police Division Headquarters. He was responsible for investigating illegal moneylending cases. Sometime in the middle of the night of 18 October 1997, while at home, Lem was informed of the arrest of one Lee Hwee Leong (`Lee`) for an offence under the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) for harassing a debtor, one Saithu Julalutheen (`Saithu`). Lem later received a page from Lim who enquired if he had a loan shark case. When he confirmed this, Lim said that the person arrested was his friend`s friend and asked him to help out. From this, Lem formed the impression that Lim wanted him to treat the suspect leniently.
Lee had gone to Saithu`s flat to collect money on behalf of one `Ah Ban`, an illegal moneylender, who in turn worked for Chua. At the station, Lim brought Lee up from the lock up. He informed Lee that outside people had given instructions and reassured the latter that he would be alright. Lim asked Lee whether he knew `Ah San` or `Ah Thiam` and asked him not to implicate `Ah San`.
Lem arrived at the station and discovered that Lim had already taken Lee from the lock up; he found them together in Lim`s office. A statement was then purportedly recorded from Lee by Lem. The contents of the statement were in fact narrated by Lim, who informed Lem that his `friend`s side` had already settled the matter with the victim who would give a negative statement. He stressed to Lem the importance of recording a statement from the victim which stated that `Ah Ban` was not a loan shark and that the loan was interest free. This was duly done by Lem later that morning. Lim dropped by during the recording of Saithu`s statement.
Lim told Lem there was no need for him to be present at the morning panel. Instead, Lim briefed the panel on the case involving Lee; the panel directed that an investigation paper be put up. Lim however informed Lem that the case had been settled and to file away the papers. He directed Lem to record that there were no elements of illegal moneylending, to classify the report as `police assistance required` and to release Lee unconditionally. Lem complied.
About two weeks later, Lim invited Lem to Lido Palace. They went to a KTV room where Lim introduced Lem to Chua, who was introduced as `Ah San`. Lim told Chua that Lem was from the `Jurong loan shark` squad. Lim and Lem proceeded to enjoy the entertainment, which included hostesses, food, drinks and karaoke. They did not pay for the entertainment. Instead, Lim said that there was no need to pay and that `they` would settle the bill.
On a subsequent occasion in October 1997, Lim separately invited both Lem and another police officer, sergeant Yap Chee Kong (`Sgt Yap`), to a function at Lido Palace. Sgt Yap was also attached to Jurong Police Division Headquarters and was also responsible for investigating loan shark cases.
Upon his arrival at Lido Palace, Sgt Yap was met by Lim. The latter in turn brought Sgt Yap to meet Chua and introduced him as his colleague Yap who handled loan shark cases in Jurong. The three officers, that is, Lim, Lem and Sgt Yap, then spent the night enjoying the entertainment in the form of singing, drinks and hostesses. The bill for the entertainment was again paid by Chua.
A few days later, Lim approached Lem and Sgt Yap. Referring to Chua as `Ah Long San`, he said that Chua had many runners of whom he had lost count. He told them to keep him informed of any future reports involving loan shark cases and to provide him with the names of the suspects, the name of the complainant, the place of operation of the suspects and their contact numbers. He would then check with Chua whether the suspects were under him. In this way, Chua`s associates could liaise with the complainant to give a negative statement or to stop the harassment.
At the close of the trial, the district judge concluded that Lim got himself involved in Lee`s arrest as he had been asked by Chua to help out. Subsequently, he invited Lem and Sgt Yap to Lido Palace and introduced them to Chua, in the course of which he intentionally informed the latter that they were responsible for investigating moneylending cases at Jurong. Chua had provided free entertainment to Lim with the corrupt intention of seeking his assistance in the event that he required help in his illegal moneylending activities. At the same time, Lim accepted the entertainment corruptly as an inducement to assist Chua in the event that the latter required such assistance. Thereafter, Lim requested Lem and Sgt Yap to provide him with information on loan shark cases reported at the station with the intention of passing on the information to Chua so as to enable the latter to alert his runners to escape conviction. The district judge accordingly convicted Lim on the charge of corruption.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The district judge observed that the starting point usually adopted in sentencing was six months` imprisonment and noted that sentences for police officers convicted of corruption have ranged from six weeks` imprisonment to three years and more. There was thus no single benchmark sentence.
The district judge took into account the need for a substantial element of punishment and deterrence as Lim had committed the corruption offences in his capacity as a police officer. She also considered the fact that Lim was a senior and key officer of Jurong Police Division Headquarters at the material time and that his conduct constituted a serious abuse of his position and a gross betrayal of trust. Furthermore, Lim sought to draw two junior officers into the web of corruption and had instigated them to act contrary to their enforcement duties. His actions had also brought disrepute to the Singapore Police Force and undermined public confidence in the rectitude of police officers. Finally, the district judge took into account Lim`s previous conviction in 1998, for an offence of corruption punishable under s 6(a) PCA for which he was sentenced to three months` imprisonment.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Mr Muralidharan Pillai, the counsel for Lim, argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive. He submitted that the sentence imposed was significantly above the normal tariffs and noticeably disparate to other similar cases; that a shorter sentence would have sufficed to deter like-minded offenders; that the sentence was seriously disproportionate to the sentence imposed on the accomplice; and that excessive weight had been placed on his previous conviction.
The DPP, Mr Tan Boon Gin, on the other hand, argued that the considerations of public interest, the need for deterrence as well as the aggravating factors present, justified the sentence which was imposed by the district judge.
 The sentence 
 
 
 
Deterrent sentence
At the outset, I noted that Mr Pillai conceded that a deterrent sentence was called for. Indeed, it was patently obvious that the public interest demanded the imposition of a substantial deterrent sentence as it involved corruption on the part of a public servant; and further involved an abuse of the position and powers of a police officer.
Mr Pillai however, argued that the district judge failed to consider whether a shorter sentence would have sufficed to meet the need for deterrence. In support, he cited Lord Lane`s observations in 
R v Bibi
 
[1980] 1 WLR 1193
 at p 1195A: 
 
... sentencing courts must be particularly careful to examine each case to ensure, if an immediate custodial sentence is necessary, that the sentence is as short as possible, consistent only with the duty to protect the interests of the public and to punish and deter the criminal.
 
 
 
Lord Lane`s comments were however, prefaced by his concern over the dangerous state of overcrowding in the UK prisons, which was not a pertinent nor relevant consideration in the present appeal. In any event, Lord Lane recognised that the varying severity of the offences merited sentences of different duration and would also depend on the role and degree of culpability of the offender in question. There, Lord Lane was addressing his mind to a first offender who had played a fringe role in the enterprise; who was not possessed of the normal degree of independence of mind and action and for whom any term of imprisonment would have inevitably been traumatic. Such features were not present in relation to Lim.
Mr Pillai also relied on the Malaysian Supreme Court decision in 
Mohamed Abdullah Ang Swee Kang v PP
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 167
  at p 170I which commented that: 
 
The fact that a sentence of imprisonment is imposed as a deterrence does not justify the sentencer in passing a sentence of greater length than the facts of the offence warrant.
 
 
 
This was not a new or novel proposition. The entire tenor of the judgement revealed that the Malaysian Supreme Court merely reiterated the need to consider the overall perspective, including the total gravity of the offence, the facts of the commission, the presence or absence of mitigating factors and the sentences imposed in similar cases.
Viewed in that light, the cases cited by Mr Pillai go no further than my earlier observations in 
Xia Qin Lai v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 343
  at [para ] 29 where I stated: 
 
... the principle of deterrence (especially general deterrence) dictated that the length of the custodial sentence awarded had to be a not insubstantial one, in order to drive home the message to other like-minded persons that such offences will not be tolerated, but not so much as to be unjust in the circumstances of the case.
 
 
 
Thus, the pertinent question to be addressed was whether the length of the sentence imposed by the district judge was unjust in all the circumstances of the case. In this regard, the culpability of the offender, the circumstances of the offence, the aggravating and mitigating factors and the sentences imposed in similar cases would be relevant considerations.
Disparity with sentences imposed in similar cases
In seeking to persuade this court to reduce the sentence imposed on Lim, Mr Pillai relied on the case of 
Krishan Chand v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 291
 . There, I allowed the appeal and reduced the sentences after noting that the sentences imposed by the district judge far exceeded the tariffs set for the offences in question, especially in view of the genuine mitigating factors prevailing in that appellant`s favour. Following that rationale, Mr Pillai argued that the sentence imposed on his client was greatly in excess of the sentences imposed in the similar cases of 
Hassan bin Ahmad v PP

`
In 
 Hassan 
, the appellant, who was an Assistant Superintendent of Police, was convicted after a trial, of four charges under s 6(a) PCA for corruptly receiving monies from the same protagonist, Chua. On one occasion, the appellant, at Chua`s request, made certain inquiries concerning Chua`s associate who had been arrested by the police. On another occasion, also at Chua`s request, he enquired into the status of an arrested suspect and intervened in the interview of the suspect. He was a first offender and was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each charge, to run consecutively. On appeal, I upheld the sentences, while commenting that the total sentence of 18 months was generous.
In
 William Fong 
, the appellant, a police inspector, was convicted after a trial, of two charges under s 6(1) PCA, for corruptly receiving moneys from the same Chua. In return, the appellant used his office and police connections to make certain enquiries into the status of police investigations in which Chua was interested. He was a first offender and was sentenced to nine months imprisonment per charge with the sentences to run concurrently. In that case, I also upheld the sentences on appeal.
In 
 Royston Sim 
, the accused, a police inspector, was convicted after a trial, of one charge under s 6(a) PCA for corruptly receiving money from the same Chua. At Chua`s request, he subsequently made an unauthorised status enquiry on a certain individual. The accused in that case had four previous antecedents, of which three involved the unauthorised screening of data and an unauthorised enquiry on behalf of Chua, as well as receiving free drinks from him. The district judge sentenced him to nine months` imprisonment after taking into account his commendable service records, his personal circumstances and the single charge. There, the accused did not lodge an appeal against the sentence.
The above-mentioned three cases shared certain aggravating features with the present appeal. These related to the offenders` position as law enforcement officers of some seniority, the corrupt acceptance of gratification from Chua as an inducement for showing favours in relation to their principal`s affairs, the abuse of trust and the adverse impact on the integrity and reputation of the Police Force. As the same giver and similar corrupt purpose was involved, these provided formidable support for Mr Pillai`s submission that the sentence of two and a half years` imprisonment imposed on Lim on the single charge was far in excess of the usual term of nine months` imprisonment. Incidentally, the cases in question were decided after the conclusion of the trial in the present appeal. It could conceivably be argued that the district judge may well have imposed a different sentence had it been possible to bring these cases to her attention.
Nonetheless, while consistency in sentencing was a desirable goal, this was not an inflexible or overriding principle. The different degrees of culpability and the unique circumstances of each case play an equally, if not more, important role. Furthermore, the sentences in similar cases may have been either too high or too low: 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
  at [para ] 26, following 
Yong Siew Soon v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 933
  at p 936. It was readily apparent upon a closer examination, that there were several significant crucial differences in the facts of the present appeal which clearly warranted a comparatively higher sentence.
As was correctly observed by the district judge, it was highly reprehensible Lim intentionally drew two junior officers into the web of corruption and in that way rendered more police officers beholden to Mr Chua`s corrupt gratification. Not content with personally betraying the trust reposed upon him, he sought to similarly corrupt other junior officers who would have looked up to him as a role model and for guidance. He was after all a senior officer and a key appointment holder at Jurong Police Division Headquarters with subordinate officers under his command. By insidiously cloaking the entertainment in a veil of normalcy and acceptability, Lim was effectively recruiting a cadre of police officers who would be similarly beholden to Chua. He further instigated the junior officers to act contrary to their duties and to assist Chua and his associates to evade criminal liability. His conduct showed that he was prepared, not merely to make enquiries into investigations on Chua`s behalf, but to actively interfere in the course of police investigations and to subvert the due administration of the criminal justice system. I further noted that Lim had demonstrated absolutely no remorse for his conduct and had cast spurious and unsubstantiated allegations against various law enforcement officers in the course of his defence. Lastly, Lim had a prior conviction for a wholly unrelated offence of corruption. These were extremely critical distinguishing considerations which did not feature in the 
 Hassan 
,
 William Fong 
 and 
 Royston Sim 
 cases.
Viewed in that manner, I was quite unable to accept the submission that the sentence of two and a half years` imprisonment was unjustified and far in excess of the facts and circumstances of the case.
Mr Pillai had also cited 
Yusof bin A Samad v PP
 
 
[2000] 4 SLR 58
  where the appellant, a former police corporal, was convicted after a trial, of 14 counts of corruption under s 6(a) PCA for accepting gratification in return for supplying confidential information pertaining to deceased persons and their next-of-kin, which information he had obtained as a police hearse driver. He was sentenced to nine months per charge, with the first two sentences to run consecutively.
In my view, that case was of marginal relevance due to its different factual matrix. There the appellant provided confidential information to undertakers to enable them to rapidly descend on the scene of the police case. While this may have hindered sensitive police work in the process, it was quite unlike Lim`s blatant and deliberate intention to assist illegal money-lenders to escape criminal liability
Disparity with sentence imposed on Mr Chua
Mr Pillai next argued that the sentence imposed on Lim was seriously disproportionate to the sentence of one and half years` imposed on the giver, Chua. He cited the following commentary from 
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts
 
[2000] at p 602
 in support: 
 
The law makes the giver equally culpable as the receiver. However, not all givers are in the same category. Givers who act under some form of pressure or in a moment of fear to avoid a minor transgression of the law would not be treated with the same severity as acceptors who in most situations would be motivated by greed. 
 However, givers who intend to corrupt the establishment of law and order for private gain, or those who give or offer bribes to pervert the course of justice are generally treated with as much severity as the acceptors of the bribe
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
I would deal briefly with this submission, bearing in mind that the appeal by Chua against the sentence imposed on him is still pending. In the first place, there is no rigid or inflexible rule that the giver or acceptor of such bribes be treated with equal severity. As I emphasized earlier, while consistency in sentencing is desirable, the varying degrees of culpability and the unique circumstances of each case play an equally, if not more important role. The sentence imposed on the accomplice may also have been too high or too low. I was thus not inclined to be fettered by the sentence which was imposed on Chua.
For the purposes of this appeal, it sufficed to say that there were justifiable grounds for imposing a higher sentence on Lim. The aggravating features which were unique to Lim have been highlighted above and would in large part, explain the difference in the sentences imposed.
Previous conviction
Mr Pillai further contended that the district judge had placed excessive weight on Lim`s previous conviction which was committed after the present offence, in imposing a sentence which greatly exceeded the normal sentencing tariffs. To recall, Lim was convicted in 1998 of a similar offence of corruption which occurred on 9 March 1998; for which he was sentenced to three months` imprisonment.
There was little merit in this submission. It was clear from 
Sim Yeow Seng v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 44
  at p 47D-E that: 
 
 
 ...a sentencing court should have regard to all of the accused`s antecedents up to the moment of sentencing because these antecedents reveal his character, his attitudes and the likelihood of rehabilitation. So long as previous convictions are shown to exist, therefore, it does not matter whether they were in respect of offences committed before or subsequent to the offence for which the court is considering sentence.
 
 
 
 
... All things being equal, the need to deter an accused from further gravitating towards such wrongdoing is basis enough for the sentencing court to enhance sentence to an appropriate degree; although, as I stated in 
 Boon Kiah Kin
, it should simultaneously be remembered that the accused is being punished solely for the offence before the court and any enhancement ought not to bring the sentence beyond the tariff applicable to the offence. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Lim`s previous conviction for an unrelated offence of corruption committed in 1998, revealed his propensity to corrupt means of self-enrichment and correspondingly, a need to deter him from gravitating towards such wrong-doing. Accordingly, the district judge was fully entitled to take his previous conviction into account. Further, when one examined the district judge`s decision in totality, it would have been readily apparent that the antecedent was merely one of the factors considered by her when she assessed the appropriate sentence. The more material considerations were the need for deterrence and the presence of serious aggravating factors.
It was certainly not a situation whereby the district judge relied excessively on the previous conviction and in consequence, enhanced the sentence beyond the tariff applicable to the offence. As explained above, I was quite unable to accept Mr Pillai`s submission that the sentence imposed on Lim was greatly in excess of the sentences imposed in other cases.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In determining the appropriate sentence in any particular case, the court is faced with a difficult and indefinable task. The sentencing judge has always to examine the relevant facts most thoroughly as no two cases are exactly the same. While I appreciate the sentencing practice in other cases where a somewhat lower sentence was imposed, a degree of flexibility must be allowed in order to meet the different considerations and factual matrix of each particular case.
Had the case been first heard before me, I may well have been inclined to order a slightly lower term of imprisonment. An appellate court however, would only interfere with the sentence imposed by the lower court based on the principles in 
Tan Koon Swan v PP
 
 
[1986] SLR 126
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 129
 . In my view, the sentence of two and a half years` imprisonment could hardly be described as being manifestly excessive or unjust in all the circumstances of the case. There being no error of principle on the part of the district judge, there were really no grounds to justify a reduction of the sentence imposed on Lim. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal and upheld the sentence imposed by the court below.

: The respondent, Chew Suang Heng (`Chew`) was charged in the District Court as follows: 
 
DAC 42083/2000 (P1)
 
 
 
You, Chew Suang Heng, M/58 yrs are charged that you on or about 26 August 2000, at Geylang Police Station, Singapore, did corruptly offer a gratification of a sum of $1000 (one thousand dollars) to one Jayasaravanan s/o Jayapragasam, a police constable in the employ of Singapore Police Force and attached to Geylang Police Station, as an inducement to do an act in relation to his principal`s affairs, to wit, to release you from detention for an offence of loitering for the purpose of illegal betting, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (the `PCA`) provides as follows: 
 
 
6 If - 
 
... 
 
(b) any person corruptly gives or agrees to give or offers any gratification to any agent as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do any act in relation to his principal`s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs or business; or 
 
... 
 
he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
  
 
 
 
 
 The facts 
 
 
 
 
 
The facts set out in the prosecution`s statement of facts were admitted by Chew. On 26 August 2000 at about 8pm, while investigating a complaint of illegal horse-betting activities, Jayasaravanan S/O Jayapragasam (`Jayasaravanan`), a police constable attached to Geylang Police Station, and two Special Constables, Effendy bin Mohamed Rashid (`Effendy`) and Danker Clive Harrison (`Danker`), arrived at the vicinity of Block 3, Eunos Crescent. There were people gathering at the block.
Jayasaravanan noticed Chew holding a black pager in his right hand and constantly looking at it. Jayasaravanan then instructed Effendy and Danker to detain him. Chew threw away the black pager and started to run but was apprehended and handcuffed for loitering for the purpose of betting.
Chew was brought to Geylang Police Station in the police car. Jayasaravanan, Effendy and Danker were all in the police car with Chew. In the police car, Chew pleaded for leniency and asked to be let off. He told the police officers that he had over $3,000 with him and would give them $1,000 if they let him go. Jayasaravanan told Chew to keep quiet. When Chew insisted, Danker informed him that it was an offence to bribe police officers.
When the party had reached Geylang Police Station, the police officers brought Chew to their room. Chew asked Effendy to close the door and, when the door was closed, he took out a $1,000 note and placed it in front of Jayasaravanan. Jayasaravanan asked Chew to take the money back but he refused and pleaded to be released unconditionally. It was then that Jayasaravanan arrested Chew for trying to bribe him. The $1,000 note was seized and Chew was charged accordingly.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
Chew pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to a fine of $6,000 and in default six months` imprisonment by district judge Seng Kwang Boon (the `judge`). The $1,000 `bribe money` was ordered to be forfeited. In sentencing Chew, the judge considered these factors: 
(i) Chew had pleaded guilty to the offence; 
(ii) Chew had no similar convictions previously although he had previous convictions for cheating and other offences; 
(iii) the offence was not premeditated and Chew had committed the offence to avoid being charged for illegal punting, a relatively minor offence (he was in fact fined $2,000 for illegal punting); 
(iv) the gratification offered was a small amount; and 
(v) although Chew was trying to bribe a police officer, such acts would not succeed as our police officers are of the highest calibre.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed by the judge on Chew, contending that the sentence was manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of the case and that a deterrent custodial sentence ought to have been imposed on Chew.
In seeking a custodial sentence to be imposed on Chew, the prosecution contended, inter alia, that the judge had failed, in sentencing Chew, to adequately consider that Chew`s conduct was potentially highly prejudicial to the administration of criminal justice in Singapore as he had attempted to subvert the proper course of police investigations with his offer of a bribe to the police officer. I agreed with this submission. There is no doubt that attempting to bribe a law enforcement officer and interfering in the proper course of police investigations is a serious offence. Generally, corruption offences involving law enforcement officers or other public servants attract harsher penalties and custodial sentences as compared to similar offences committed in commercial dealings and in the private sector.
For corruption offences under the PCA which involve government servants, the norm is a custodial sentence and it is departed from where the facts are exceptional. For example, in 
Meeran bin Mydin v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 522
 , the appellant had pleaded guilty to two charges of bribing an immigration officer and was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each charge.
There is no doubt that an element of public interest exists in corruption offences involving the bribery of a public servant and that the courts have taken a stern view of such offences. In view of this public interest in stamping out bribery and corruption in the country, especially in the public service, a deterrent sentence for such offences is justified. The severity of the sentence imposed, however, would depend on the facts of each individual case.
In the present corruption offence, Chew had voluntarily offered the police officer a bribe without any solicitation. In such circumstances involving an attempt to bribe a law enforcement officer and undermine the administration of justice, I had no doubt that a custodial sentence was warranted. The aggravating and mitigating factors were then considered in determining the length of the custodial sentence.
 Mitigating factors 
 
 
 
In sentencing Chew, the judge had considered that his plea of guilt was a mitigating factor. In my view, however, in the circumstances of the case, Chew`s plea of guilt was of little mitigating value as the case against him was clearly made out. In pleading guilty, he must have known that the prosecution would have had no problem in securing a conviction in view of the evidence. The three police officers, Jayasaravanan, Effendy and Danker, were all in the police car with Chew when he first offered the gratification to them and they would all have been able to testify against him.
It is clear that not every plea of guilt by an offender should carry weight as a mitigating factor. In 
Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP
 
 
[1990] SLR 1011
 (Unreported) Chan Sek Keong J commented at 
[1990] SLR 1011
, 1014; 
[1991] 1 MLJ 321
, 322-323: 
 
... the voluntary surrender by an offender and a plea of guilty by him in court are factors that can be taken into account in mitigation as they may be evidence of remorse and a willingness to accept punishment for his wrongdoing. However, I think that their relevance and weight to be placed on them must depend on the circumstances of each case. I do not see any mitigation value in a robber surrendering to the police after he is surrounded and has no means of escape, or much mitigation value in a professional man turning himself in in the face of absolute knowledge that the game is up.
 
 
 
Further, in 
Fu Foo Tong & Ors v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 448
  at p 455, Karthigesu JA said: 
 
... It is not axiomatic that every plea of guilt `entitles`, as it was contended by counsel to a discount of between one-quarter to one-third of what might otherwise be considered an appropriate sentence after a trial. A plea of guilt can be of no mitigating value, for example, when the evidence overwhemingly supports a conviction.
 
 
 
In sentencing Chew, the judge also considered the fact that the offence was not premeditated and that Chew had committed the offence to avoid being charged for illegal punting, a relatively minor offence. However, in my view, the judge had omitted to consider and address the fact that Chew had repeatedly attempted, despite being warned against it, to bribe the police officer into releasing him from custody.
In corruption offences, givers who act in a moment of fear to avoid a minor transgression of the law would not be treated with the same severity as acceptors who in most situations would be motivated by greed. However, this did not help Chew in this case. Although he might have been desperate at first to avoid being charged for illegal punting, his fear and desperation were not an excuse for him to stubbornly persist in trying to bribe the police officer even after he had been warned several times. In my view, the judge should not have considered Chew`s lack of premeditation and fear of being charged as a mitigating factor in this case.
Further, the judge considered that there was no adverse consequence of Chew`s act by stating that, although Chew was trying to bribe a police officer, such acts would not succeed as our police officers were of the highest calibre. The judge appeared to have given Chew credit for the high moral calibre of the police officers when none was due. Although Chew`s attempt to bribe the police officer did not succeed, the fact remained that such an attempt was carried out with a mind to subvert the course of justice. There was no reason why Chew should be given credit for the refusal of the police officer to accept the bribe. Therefore, the fact that there were no actual consequences of Chew`s act should also not be a mitigating factor in this case.
As for Chew`s record of previous offences, the prosecution submitted that the judge had failed to attach due weight to Chew`s antecedents, especially his previous conviction for an offence of cheating. To my mind, however, it was clear that none of Chew`s antecedents (which included, inter alia, using a forged document, cheating and possession of counterfeit currency) had any bearing to the present offence of corruption for which he was being charged and this fact was not an aggravating factor in sentencing Chew. This was in line with the principle enunciated by the Court of Appeal in 
Roslan bin Abdul Rahman v PP
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 211
 . In that case, the appellant pleaded guilty in the High Court to the charge of robbery causing death under s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and the trial judge took into account the appellant`s previous drug-related antecedents during sentencing. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the appellant`s drug-related antecedents should have no bearing on the present trial as they were completely unrelated to the offence with which the appellant was charged.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In conclusion, I found no reason why a deterrent custodial sentence should not be imposed on Chew. There were no exceptional circumstances in this case and, on the facts, I allowed the appeal and sentenced Chew to two months` imprisonment in addition to the fine of $6,000 imposed by the judge. The forfeiture of the $1,000, offered to the police officer, as ordered by the judge remained.

: The appellant was tried in the District Court on the following amended charge: 
 
that you, on or about 3 February 1999 and 1 March 1999, in Singapore, did intentionally fabricate false evidence for the purpose of being used in a judicial proceeding, to wit, by forging the handwriting and signatures of one Susanna Lim Sai Hong on 4 sheets of paper purporting to be records of payments made by you to the said Lim Sai Hong, which documents so forged were marked and annexed as exhibits CPS 6, 7, 8 and 9 to an affidavit affirmed by you on 22 March 1999 and filed with the Subordinate Courts in connection with a civil suit MC Suit 3003/99, in which the said Lim Sai Hong was the plaintiff and you, the defendant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 193 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
 
 
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
 
 
The complainant was one Susanna Lim Sai Hong (`Ms Lim`), an insurance agent with OUB Manulife. She first knew the appellant in 1996 when he bought an insurance policy through her. On 16 February 1998, at the request of the appellant, she lent him $3,000. He subsequently failed to repay her the money.
About ten months later, on 2 December 1998, the appellant telephoned her to ask if she was interested in investing in a business which involved the export of rice from Pakistan to West Africa. The next day, Ms Lim met up with the appellant at his dental clinic, where she made up her mind to invest in his rice trading venture. The appellant and Ms Lim thereupon entered into an agreement, the terms of which were reduced into a document dated 3 December 1998 (`the rice trading agreement`). It was hand-written by Ms Lim and signed by both Ms Lim and the appellant. Under the rice trading agreement, Ms Lim was to invest $15,000 in the venture. Shipments of rice would be made from Pakistan to West Africa fortnightly, and, for every shipment, Ms Lim would receive 20% of the $15,000 that she had invested (ie $3,000). Once the shipments ceased, the full $15,000 would be refunded to her.
Ms Lim`s subsequent attempts to collect the profits of her investment were unsuccessful, as the appellant kept telling her that shipment was being delayed. Finally, on 21 December 1998, she went to the appellant`s office. The appellant was agitated by the way that she kept questioning him about the money, and wanted to terminate the rice trading agreement. Ms Lim agreed. The appellant gave Ms Lim a cheque for $22,000. Of this sum, 
[bull ] $15,000 was for the refund of the amount invested by Ms Lim under the rice trading agreement; 
[bull ] $3,000 was for the 20% return made under the first shipment; 
[bull ] $4,000 was to go towards repayment of the February 1998 loan extended by Ms Lim to the appellant. The loan itself was $3,000, and the extra $1,000 was compensation for the delay in payment.
The parties then signed a document stating that the rice trading agreement would be terminated once the appellant`s cheque for $22,000 was cleared (`the termination agreement`). This termination agreement was also hand-written by Ms Lim.
The appellant`s cheque was subsequently dishonoured on 2 January 1999. From then on, Ms Lim`s repeated attempts to get her money back from the appellant were met by one empty promise after another. Finally, she commenced MC Suit 3003/99 against the appellant, claiming the sum of $22,000.
On 26 March 1999, Ms Lim opened her letterbox to find an affidavit that had been affirmed by the appellant. The affidavit was prepared in relation to the civil suit filed by her, and had been forwarded to her by the appellant`s solicitors. By para 12 of his affidavit, the appellant averred that he and Ms Lim had entered into an agreement on 5 January 1999 whereby he would repay the $22,000 sum due to her by way of weekly instalments. A photocopy of the agreement, purportedly signed by Ms Lim, was exhibited at CPS-6 of the affidavit. In paras 13 to 15 of the affidavit, the appellant described how he had already made three instalment payments of $6,000 each, so that the total sum repaid by him amounted to $18,000. Each of the three payments was reflected by an acknowledgement of receipt, purportedly signed by Ms Lim. Photocopies of the three acknowledgements of receipt were exhibited in the affidavit at CPS-7, CPS-8 and CPS-9 respectively.
Ms Lim was shocked. She had never signed any agreement for the repayment of the money in instalments. She had certainly never signed any acknowledgements of receipt for the sums which the appellant claimed to have repaid. The next day, on 27 March 1999, Ms Lim lodged a police report against the appellant, claiming that he had forged her signature on the documents in the affidavit.
When Ms Lim subsequently brought summary judgment proceedings for her claim in MC Suit 3003, the appellant succeeded in obtaining leave to defend for the amount of $18,000. On appeal to the High Court, the appellant was given leave to defend for the entire amount of $22,000. However, when the matter eventually came up for hearing, the appellant signed a consent judgment, without admission of liability on his part, for the sum of $18,000, plus costs.
 The defence below 
 
 
 
According to the appellant, he first came to be acquainted with Ms Lim in late 1996, when she approached him to buy an insurance policy through her. Within a year afterwards, he learnt that Ms Lim was a part-time moneylender. He found this out from her close church friends, who informed him that she lent between $3,000 to $20,000, and charged interest at 10 to 20 per cent. He subsequently borrowed a sum of $3,000 from her on 1 June 1998. Sometime in August 1999, she visited his clinic to ask for repayment. It was then that she overheard him on the telephone talking about the rice trading venture. This got her excited, and she wanted a share of the pie. He refused, but told her that he himself would need a large sum of money for the venture. She offered to lend him the money, whereupon he told her that he would get back to her.
At the end of November 1998, he contacted her and told her that he required the money. She turned up at his clinic on 3 December 1998 and asked him how much he needed. He replied, `any amount`. She offered to lend him $15,000, at a fortnightly interest of 20%. When he accepted the loan, Ms Lim asked for a document to evidence the terms of repayment of the loan. At the same time, she wanted to cover up the fact she was an illegal moneylender. As such, she had the terms of repayment dressed up as being part of a rice trading venture contract. That, said the appellant, was how the rice trading agreement was born.
When the appellant subsequently had difficulty repaying the loan, Ms Lim demanded that he give her a cheque for $22,000. This sum was constituted by: 
[bull ] the principal sum lent of $15,000, 
[bull ] interest of $3,000 earned by Ms Lim on the $15,000, 
[bull ] the $3,000 lent by Ms Lim to the appellant in June 1998 and 
[bull ] $1,000 being the interest earned on the $3,000 loan.
That was when he gave her the cheque for $22,000. This cheque was subsequently dishonoured. When Ms Lim confronted the appellant, he managed to persuade her to allow him to make repayment by way of instalments. She agreed. On 6 January, she drafted the agreement allowing him to make the instalment repayments (exh CPS-6 of the appellant`s affidavit). On that same day, he paid her $6,000 in cash, whereupon she signed an acknowledgement of receipt. Subsequently, he made two further cash payments of $6,000 each, and she also signed an acknowledgement of receipt for each payment. All in all, there were three acknowledgements of receipt signed by Ms Lim. However, she had kept the original documents, and given him only the photocopies.
 Evidence of the handwriting experts 
 
 
 
At the trial before the district court, experts in handwriting analysis were called by both the prosecution and the defence. The expert for the prosecution was Mr Yap Bei Sing, a scientific officer with the Department of Scientific Services. Mr Yap`s view was that most of the words in CPS-6 (ie the purported agreement by Ms Lim to accept repayment by instalments) were produced by photocopying and cut-and-paste manipulation of Ms Lim`s handwriting in the rice trading agreement and in the termination agreement. As for the three acknowledgements of receipt purportedly signed by Ms Lim (CPS-7, CPS-8 and CPS-9), Mr Yap was of the view that these documents contained two sets of handwriting. One set had a smooth cursive quality, while the other was slow conscious writing. The parts of the writing that were smooth and cursive were again cut and pasted from various portions of the rice trading agreement and the termination agreement.
Mr Yap`s conclusion that the relevant parts of CPS-6 to CPS-9 were cut and pasted was based on the fact that no two sets of handwriting by the same person could ever be identical. The similarity which the handwriting in CPS-6 to CPS-9 bore to that in the rice trading agreement and in the termination agreement could only be achieved through cut-and-paste manipulation.
The handwriting expert called by the appellant was one Linda Collin James, who had then been practising document examination for nine years. In her testimony, Ms James elaborated on certain reports that had been prepared by her prior to the trial. In one of her reports, dated 21 May 2000, she commented that she could not affirmatively say whether the documents exhibited to the appellant`s affidavit were genuine or forged. However, in a subsequent report dated 8 June 2000, she criticised the findings of Mr Yap, saying that some of the words in the allegedly forged documents were, contrary to Mr Yap`s view, not entirely identical to those in the rice trading agreement or termination agreement, but were of different size. She also questioned Mr Yap`s finding that the allegedly forged documents were produced by cut-and-paste manipulation, as she was of the view that cut-and-paste manipulation could only be established by direct evidence, such as shadow lines from cut edges, and misalignment. Nevertheless, in the course of cross-examination, she agreed that it was possible, depending on the photocopying machine, for traces of cut and paste manipulation not to appear.
Mr Yap`s rebuttal evidence was to the effect that the different sizing of the words referred to by Ms James was actually a result of size distortion caused by the photocopying process and not because the words were different.
 The district judge`s finding 
 
 
 
With respect to the testimonies of the handwriting experts, the District Judge accepted Mr Yap`s evidence that the questioned documents in the appellant`s affidavit were indeed produced by cut-and-paste manipulation. She also accepted Mr Yap`s evidence that these documents bore two different sets of handwriting. Even then, she concluded that Mr Yap`s evidence was not to be accorded the highest weight, as there was no direct evidence of cut-and-paste manipulation, such as shadow lines and cut edges.
However, the district judge held that, even without the aid of the scientific evidence, Ms Lim was `undoubtedly a witness of truth`. In contrast, she found the appellant`s story about Ms Lim being an illegal moneylender to be unworthy of credit. She accordingly convicted the appellant of the charge and sentenced him to a two year imprisonment term.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The provision under which the appellant was charged, s 193 of the Penal Code reads as follows: 
 
Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine; and whoever intentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any other case, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
 
 
 
The definition of `to fabricate false evidence` is in turn defined by s 192: 
 
Whoever causes any circumstances to exist, or makes any false entry in any book or record, or makes any document containing a false statement, intending that such circumstance, false entry, or false statement may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding ... and that such circumstances, false entry, or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause any person, who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding, is said `to fabricate false evidence`.
 
 
 
The above provisions are clear enough. If the appellant had indeed appended to his affidavit documents which he knew to be forged, with the intention that these documents be used in the civil action brought by Ms Lim against him, he would be guilty of an offence under s 193 of the Penal Code.
The main crux of this appeal thus centred on whether the relevant documents (CPS-6, CPS-7, CPS-8 and CPS-9) were indeed forged. The appellant maintained that the documents were genuine, in that they were prepared and signed by Ms Lim. To support his stand, he raised essentially the same contentions as those raised in the district court below.
 The illegal moneylender allegation 
 
 
 
It is unclear why this allegation was raised by the appellant at all. Whether or not Ms Lim was an illegal moneylender was wholly irrelevant to the question of whether the documents were forged. Even if she was an illegal moneylender, that would not have absolved the appellant of criminal liability, if he had indeed forged documents with the intention of using them as evidence in a court of law. Nevertheless, the appellant`s evidence, advanced to support his claim that Ms Lim was a moneylender, was most enlightening insofar as it demonstrated the appellant`s utter lack of credibility.
The appellant explained that he first came to know that Ms Lim was a moneylender from a church friend of Ms Lim`s. The church friend had alluded to Ms Lim`s moneylending activities when the appellant told this church friend that he needed some money. That being the appellant`s story, one would have expected the appellant to have some degree of acquaintance with this church friend, seeing as how he had confided in her on such a personal matter. Oddly enough, the appellant claimed that he was not well acquainted with this church friend, saying that he had only met her once. He was unable to give the court any particulars of this church friend, and was unable to even furnish her name. The obvious deduction to be made was that this `church friend` was nothing more than a figment of the appellant`s imagination.
The illegal moneylender allegation also went against other independent documents. After Ms Lim lodged her police report against the appellant, the latter gave a statement, dated 25 June 1999, to one Senior Staff Sergeant Sabil. Paragraph 7 of the statement read: 
 
So on the 3.12.1998, she [ie Ms Lim] came down to my clinic to tell me how much she should invest in the business ... She also asked me how much profit she would get out of the $15,000. I told her the profit was not fixed because the deals still have not finalized yet. She then suggested to me to give her 20% of her investment value on the completion of the deal ...
 
 
 
Thus, by his very own statement to the police, the appellant referred to the $15,000 as an `investment` and not a `loan`, and he further described the 20% as being `profits` rather than `interest`. During cross-examination in the district court, the appellant explained that it was Sergeant Sabil who used the word `invest` and not him. The appellant further alleged that some of the sentences found in para 7 of the statement were not made by him. Nevertheless, the appellant admitted that he did read the statement after it had been prepared. He had even made many amendments to it, and had appended his signature after reading through it. During cross-examination, the appellant explained that, although he read through the statement, he did not read every sentence. This was because he had been `in a state of shock`. He further explained that the amendments were merely made to correct grammatical errors only. When asked why he focused on the grammatical errors when he should have been correcting the alleged material errors in para 7 of his statement, his reply was: `I always prefer to write good English`. I found the appellant`s explanations, which bordered on sheer flippancy, to be wholly unsatisfactory.
Apart from the police statement, there was also the affidavit to which the forged documents were annexed. In it, the appellant averred that Ms Lim `entered into an agreement [with him] to invest` and he described the 20 per cent as `profits`. The district judge below had queried the appellant as to why he had described the rice trading agreement as an investment that yielded profits, instead of stating what he claimed to be the truth, ie that it was nothing more than an illegal moneylending transaction. His reply was: `I cannot offer any explanation`.
Thus, while the question of whether Ms Lim was a moneylender was quite irrelevant to the charge, the evidence pertaining to this issue that was adduced in the district court only served to emphasise the unreliability of the appellant`s testimony.
 Circumstances surrounding the alleged repayment 
 
 
 
The more pertinent issue to be determined in this appeal was whether the documents in the affidavit were indeed forged. In all likelihood, they were. First and foremost, the appellant alleged that he paid Ms Lim the $18,000 in cash. This was a most unlikely story. $18,000 is by no means a small sum. One would reasonably expect that payment for such a sum should be made by way of a cheque, or by some other means which would provide a record of the transfer of funds. It is hard to believe that the appellant would simply give Ms Lim the entire amount in cash, and rely only on a scanty acknowledgement of receipt to evidence payment.
Secondly, the whole purpose of an acknowledgement of receipt is so that the person who has made payment can use the acknowledgement to evidence that payment was indeed made. Thus, as Ms Lim was the party making payment (to the sum of $15,000) under the rice trading agreement, it was she who kept the original copy of the agreement while the appellant was given a photocopy. Likewise, when the appellant allegedly made the payment of $18,000, one would have expected the appellant to keep the original copies of the acknowledgements of receipt and let Ms Lim have the photocopies. Anomalously, the appellant claimed that the reverse happened, ie it was he who was given the photocopies while Ms Lim kept the originals. It was hard to believe that the appellant would part with such a large sum of money without first asking for the original copies of the documents evidencing payment.
Thirdly, the appellant offered no satisfactory explanation as to where he obtained the $18,000, which he allegedly used to make repayment to Ms Lim. He claimed that he took the money from his wife, who kept the cash at home. This again defied belief. It is a most unusual practice for anyone to stash away a sum as large as $18,000, in cash form, at home. This practice would be all the more extraordinary in the appellant`s case, where he claimed that he was in such dire need of money at the relevant time that he had no choice but to sign the rice trading agreement, despite the interest on the loan being so exorbitant.
Finally, one could not help but wonder why the appellant never asked his wife for the $18,000 in the first place, instead of entering into the rice trading agreement. His explanation was that he felt uncomfortable about asking his wife for money as he had borrowed money from her before. I found this explanation to be unacceptable. He felt uncomfortable about borrowing the principal sum from his wife, but he apparently had no qualms about asking her for the principal sum plus an exorbitant interest when it was time to make repayment under the rice trading agreement.
The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all the above facts was that the $18,000 was never paid by the appellant. The acknowledgements of receipt appended to the appellant`s affidavit were obviously forged, and that was the reason why the appellant could not produce the original copies. The appellant had attempted to adduce as evidence documents purportedly signed by Ms Lim, when he knew that Ms Lim did not sign those documents. This clearly amounted to a deliberate fabrication of false evidence. The charge against him had thus been made out. On this ground alone, the appeal against sentence should have been dismissed.
 Amendment of the charge 
 
 
 
The appellant had initially been charged with two separate offences: 
[bull ] The first charge was that of committing forgery with intent that the document forged be used for the purpose of cheating (an offence under s 468 of the Penal Code). 
[bull ] The second charge was that of making a false statement on oath to a Commissioner for Oaths (an offence under s 181 of the Penal Code).
At the commencement of the trial on 26 April 2000, both charges were amalgamated on the recommendation of the district judge, so that the appellant faced a single charge, under s 193 of the Penal Code, of having fabricated false evidence. The amalgamated charge read: 
 
You ... are charged that you, sometime between 3 December 1998 and 22 March 1999, at 112 East Coast Road, Katong Mall [num ]02-05, Singapore, did intentionally fabricate false evidence for the purpose of being used in a judicial proceeding ...
 
 
 
At the end of the trial, prior to sentencing, the district judge amended the amalgamated charge by switching the place of commission of the offence from `at 112 East Coast Road, Katong Mall [num ]02-05, Singapore`, to simply `in Singapore`. The reason for the amendment was that there was no evidence as to where the offence actually took place.
Section 163(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), allows the court to amend a charge at any time before judgment is given. Section 167 of the Code further states that, if the charge is altered by the court after commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the appellant shall be allowed to recall and examine, with reference to the new or altered charge, any witness who may already have been examined. In this regard, the appellant complained that the district judge erred, in that she neither asked the appellant nor the prosecution whether they wanted to recall any witnesses after the amendment was made.
I found no merit in this complaint. The district judge need not extend an invitation to the parties to recall their witnesses in relation to the amendment, because it is for the parties to apply for their witnesses to be recalled, and in this case the defence itself never bothered to make any application for witnesses to be recalled. In fact, in my view, the defence clearly never intended to recall any of its witnesses.
The appellant further argued that the amendment was a convenient means by which the District Judge overlooked the prosecution`s inability to adduce evidence as to the place of commission of the offence. The short answer to that was that there never was a need, in light of the issues canvassed at trial, for the prosecution to have adduced any evidence on this point. The bone of contention throughout the trial was whether the appellant had forged the relevant documents; the question of where the forgery took place was never in issue. The amendment to the charge thus caused no prejudice to the appellant. That being the case, it did not furnish the appellant with any grounds for asking that his conviction be reversed (see 
Lee Ngin Kiat v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 511
 ).
 Affirmation before a Commissioner for Oaths 
 
 
 
The appellant`s affidavit was purportedly affirmed before one Ranjeet Singh, a Commissioner for Oaths. In the trial below, the appellant maintained that his affidavit was never affirmed before Mr Ranjeet Singh. The appellant repeated this contention in the present appeal. Why the appellant raised this contention evades comprehension. Whether or not the affidavit was affirmed before a Commissioner for Oaths was wholly beside the point. Illustration (b) to s 192 of the Penal Code, which defines what constitutes fabrication of false evidence, states: 
 
`A` makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of using it as corroborative evidence in a court of justice. `A` has fabricated false evidence.
 
 
 
Hence, so long as a false document has been fabricated with the intention that it be subsequently used in court, the offence has been made out. There is no need for the affidavit containing that false document to be affirmed before a Commissioner for Oaths. This point seems obvious enough, so it was somewhat unfortunate that so much time was devoted in the trial below towards determination of the question of whether the appellant had affirmed the affidavit before Mr Ranjeet Singh.
 Appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
The fabrication of evidence that occurred took a lot of careful planning, deliberate effort and skilled craftsmanship. To make matters worse, the appellant had, in trying to wriggle his way out of trouble, cast aspersions on a host of persons. He accused Ms Lim of being an illegal moneylender. He accused Sgt Sabil of putting things into his police statement which he did not say. He accused Mr Ranjeet Singh as well as his own lawyer of preparing an affidavit which he did not affirm.
To top it all off, the appellant remained unrepentant to the very end. Throughout the trial, he led the district court on a wild goose chase, with the result that much precious court time was wasted over the deliberation of wholly irrelevant matters, such as whether Ms Lim was an illegal moneylender and whether the appellant`s affidavit had been affirmed in his presence.
Far from finding that the sentence was manifestly excessive, I was of the view that it was manifestly inadequate. In light of all the above aggravating factors, I exercised my discretion under s 256 of the Criminal Procedure and enhanced the sentence, replacing the imprisonment term of two years imposed by the district judge with a term of three and a half years.

: The appellant was tried before magistrate Gilbert Low for having committed the offence of affray. The charge against him read as follows: 
 
You, Guy Ermer, are charged that you, on or about 23 May 1999, at or about 6.40pm, at the vacant land off Loyang Way, Singapore, which is a public place, did commit an affray, to wit, by fighting with one Ng Chin Tong and disturbed the public peace, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 160 of the Penal Code, Cap 224.
 
 
 
He was convicted and sentenced to two weeks` imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of $1,000 in default of which he was to spend two weeks in prison. He appealed against both conviction and sentence and, for the reasons set out below, I dismissed his appeal against conviction but allowed his appeal against sentence.
 The appellant`s story 
 
 
 
Mr Eldon said that he was riding his off-road motorcycle on a track built for such purposes at the time of the incident. While practising to jump off a ramp known as `the big table-top`, he saw one Ng Chin Tong wheeling a motorcycle across the area where he would land. But he managed to avoid colliding into Mr Ng and his motorcycle, missing by about five feet.
He completed the circuit and returned to the start and finish area and saw Mr Ng beginning a lap on the circuit. He shouted his name and said `that was a bloody stupid thing to do` and proceeded to tell him that what he had done was dangerous and unacceptable as he was an experienced off-road motorcyclist.
This rebuke took place while the appellant was on his motorcycle about six feet behind Mr Ng`s motorcycle. They were stationery at this time. Mr Ng then rode off but stopped about four metres away. He then got off and walked back towards the appellant, who then got off his motorcycle. Mr Ng raised his voice and asked why he was being called stupid. The appellant responded by pointing out that he was not calling him stupid but was saying that what he had done was stupid. Mr Ng said that it was his fault and asked him what he wanted, to which the appellant replied that he wanted an apology.
A Malay boy was present at this confrontation and the parties were standing in a triangle with Mr Ng to the appellant`s left and the Malay boy to his right. The Malay boy insisted that it was the appellant`s fault and the appellant began to remonstrate with him when suddenly Mr Ng grabbed hold of his helmet and pulled his head towards him and punched him in the face which resulted in, among other injuries, a fractured nose. In self defence, the appellant held onto Mr Ng by his shirt in an effort to prevent further blows. Mr Ng then pushed him backwards and fell with him, landing on top of him and struggling to hit him more.
At some point, others got involved and were trying to kick the appellant. The Malay boy tried to pull his helmet off. The whole struggle lasted a minute and a half. Other people intervened to pull the two of them apart and it was over. At no time did the appellant hit Mr Ng.
 Mr Ng`s story 
 
 
 
Mr Ng said that he had to cut across the track in order to wheel a broken-down motorcycle away from the circuit. He was experienced enough and had had the presence of mind to look out for riders jumping off the top of the ramp, `the big table-top`. However, as he was crossing, he looked up to see the appellant jumping off the ramp. He swerved to the side to avoid being hit. He saw the appellant land safely and proceed down the circuit.
Mr Ng returned to the circuit later to practise. Suddenly, a rider came up from behind him and scolded him and overtook him so closely that the rider brushed the right side of his motorcycle and caused him to fall. The rider was the appellant who then walked towards him. Mr Ng got up and asked what the matter was. The appellant then pushed him on the chest and they started fighting. They grappled with each other and fell to the ground. The appellant then punched him.
The appellant was the aggressor and the fighting back which Mr Ng engaged in was done in self-defence. The fight lasted for five to ten minutes. Other people then intervened and stopped the fighting.
 The magistrate`s decision 
 
 
 
The prosecution relied on the testimony of Mr Ng and others to establish that there had indeed been a fight. In particular, the prosecution called Mr Patrick Lim Boon Hua (investigating officer); Mr Ng Chin Tong; Mr Sahrin bin Topan, and Mr Samad bin Ismail (all eyewitnesses).
Mr Sahrin testified that he saw the appellant ride past and brush Mr Ng`s motorcycle, causing the latter to fall. From a distance of about 30 metres, he witnessed the ensuing argument and the fight. He could not remember many of the details but he was emphatic that there was a fight. Mr Sahrin identified the appellant and Mr Ng as the parties involved.
Mr Samad testified that he was with Mr Sahrin watching the motorcycles go through the circuit when he witnessed the whole incident. He said he saw the motorcycles collide, the argument and both the appellant and Mr Ng fighting on the ground. The fight lasted for five to ten minutes. He claimed to have been 15 metres away at the time and he also identified the appellant and Mr Ng as the parties involved. Mr Samad also witnessed something of what happened after the fight.
For the defence, the appellant, Mr Christopher Sullivan, Miss Ong Choon Yen (both eyewitnesses); and Dr Ivor Gunaseelan Thevathasan (an expert witness) were called to testify.
Mr Sullivan is a friend of the appellant and testified that he saw him narrowly miss hitting Mr Ng when the former jumped off the ramp. Subsequently, he saw him ride over to Mr Ng and he saw them start to argue. He then intervened and told the appellant to return to the truck. As the appellant turned to pick up his motorcycle from the ground, Mr Ng `swung a punch at Guy in the face near his nose`. A scuffle followed and they wrestled one another on the ground. Then a Malay boy came over and started to twist the appellant`s helmet off. Mr Sullivan intervened and pulled the Malay boy away. The crowd then managed to stop the fight.
Miss Ong is also the appellant`s friend. She was at the scene and witnessed the near collision between him and Mr Ng. She saw him return to the starting point. She witnessed Mr Ng shouting at him and after he laid his motorcycle down, she saw Mr Ng `raise his hand against Guy and they were both on the floor`. She saw others running to the scene and some tried to separate them but others kicked the appellant.
At this point she saw Mr Sullivan intervene. He pulled away someone who was kicking the appellant and proceeded to have a heated argument with him. The crowd then managed to break up the two parties.
Dr Thevathasan was called as an expert to explain the cause of the injuries suffered by the appellant. He testified that the fracture of the nasal bone could have been caused by the impact of a blunt object such as a fist. The swelling and bruising to his right upper eyelid were caused by a `blow injury`. He testified that the injuries were not consistent with injuries usually associated with such motor sports.
The magistrate noted that the defence`s case was that the appellant did not fight with Mr Ng but was merely exercising his right of private defence in response to an attack by Mr Ng.
The magistrate therefore dealt with the question of whether or not there had been a fight. He examined the conflicting accounts of what had happened and concluded: 
 
The defence contended that [Mr Ng] was an accomplice and his evidence should be viewed with caution. Although [Mr Ng`s] evidence is unclear on some aspects (for example, whether in the course of the fight, the accused did hit him on the head with a stick), it was still his evidence in Court that there was a fight between him and the accused. Even if I were to discredit [Mr Ng`s] evidence as being unreliable, this does not detract from the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses, [Mr Sahrin] and [Mr Samad], who testified that there was a fight between the accused and [Mr Ng]. I was also satisfied that [Mr Sahrin] and [Mr Samad] were not personally known to [Mr Ng]. Further, the presence of injuries on [Mr Ng] lend [sic] support to the contention that there was a fight.
 
 
 
The magistrate continued by finding that the injuries suffered by Mr Ng `were inflicted during the course of the fight with the accused`. This is because `[i]f the defence version that the accused did not fight with nor hit [Mr Ng] were to be believed, it does not explain the presence of the injuries on [Mr Ng`s] body. In addition, [Mr Ng] also alluded to his injuries in his police report and to Dr Lim the next day.`
The magistrate also found that there was a material discrepancy between the defence witnesses as to the time of Mr Sullivan`s intervention. Mr Sullivan himself had testified that he intervened as the appellant and Mr Ng were arguing while Miss Ong had testified that Mr Sullivan had intervened after the fight had started. These testimonies were maintained throughout cross-examination. The appellant himself had not mentioned that Mr Sullivan intervened during the argument. The magistrate concluded that `this discrepancy as regards the time of intervention of Christopher Sullivan is a material one`.
Another discrepancy the magistrate thought worth noting was that Mr Sullivan did not mention that some in the crowd had joined in to kick the appellant, whereas both of them had mentioned that. The magistrate found: 
 
the prosecution`s version more reliable. Both [Mr Sahrin] and [Mr Samad] testified that the fight was only between the accused and [Mr Ng]. The crowd only intervened to break up the fight. Neither did they mention about a third party (the Malay boy) being involved in the fight. If the crowd were to participate in kicking the accused, why then should they also break up the fight? My finding was that the fight was only between the accused and [Mr Ng]. The crowd merely intervened to break up the fight. There was no Malay boy involved in the fight. It appears that the defence`s allegation that the crowd participated in kicking the accused is merely an excuse to diminish the accused`s involvement in the accident, by making him the victim of the whole thing.
 
 
 
The magistrate concluded by finding in favour of the prosecution as he found its version of the story to be more credible. He also rejected the appellant`s plea of private defence. Thus, the magistrate convicted him.
Regarding the sentence, the magistrate found that the appellant was the person responsible for the fight, which he initiated by brushing Mr Ng`s motorcycle with his own and causing Mr Ng to fall. Apart from sparking off the fight it was, in itself, a dangerous act. As an alternative, the magistrate accepted Mr Ng`s evidence that the appellant pushed him on the chest first before the fight started. As a result, the magistrate thought that a custodial sentence was appropriate. He cited from the judgment in 
PP v Lee Seck Hing
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 745
  at p 748 and, drawing an analogy with road-rage violence, applied its reasoning to the circumstances of the instant case.
 The appellant`s case on appeal 
 
 
 
Mr Ng`s injuries
Mr Damodara argued that the magistrate had erred when he concluded that Mr Ng`s injuries were the result of a fight between him and the appellant. He pointed out that the doctor examining Mr Ng could not confirm that the injuries were sustained in a fight. Mr Damodara suggested that Mr Ng`s injuries could have been caused by his falling off his motorcycle. This, he submitted, was very likely, considering the nature of off-road motor sports.
Mr Ng`s testimony
Mr Damodara`s next argument was that the magistrate erred in accepting Mr Ng`s testimony. In the police report which Mr Ng made he had said clearly that the appellant `pick up a wooden stick, less than a meter and hit on my head`. In cross-examination however, this was shown to have been an embellishment. Mr Ng confessed that all he saw was the stick lying on the ground next to the appellant and that he had simply assumed that he had picked it up and used it to hit his helmet. `This major discrepancy alone, on the circumstances of the incident, should have categorized the testimony of [Mr Ng] as highly suspect and incredulous.`
Mr Ng had also said that, after the appellant had brushed his motorcycle and caused him to fall, he got up and `ask him what`s the problem in a friendly manner`. Mr Damodara argued that this was clearly a lie because such a response in such circumstances was highly unusual.
Further, Mr Damodara argued that Mr Ng was technically an accomplice of the appellant and that the magistrate should have treated his evidence with caution.
Mr Sahrin`s testimony
Mr Damodara argued that Mr Sahrin`s testimony was weak and did not corroborate Mr Ng`s story. Mr Sahrin could not remember the details of the fight and could only assert that there had been a fight. Mr Damodara also questioned the veracity of this witness as he was brought in at a late stage and `under dubious circumstances`.
Mr Samad`s testimony
Again Mr Damodara argued that Mr Samad`s testimony did not corroborate Mr Ng`s story. Mr Samad`s statement that both the motorcycles had collided and that both the riders had fallen contradicted Mr Ng and Mr Sahrin.
Mr Damodara therefore argued that the evidence of Mr Sahrin and Mr Samad was irrelevant and materially inconsistent. The magistrate had therefore erred in accepting their evidence. Again, Mr Samad`s late introduction as a witness was a cause of concern to Mr Damodara.
The appellant`s testimony
Mr Damodara argued that his testimony was unshakeable and that he even volunteered to undergo a polygraph test. He asserted that he was merely exercising his right of private defence and that his injuries were far more serious than Mr Ng`s.
Mr Damodara then argued that the appellant`s testimony was largely corroborated by Mr Sullivan and Miss Ong.
Mr Damodara argued that the magistrate had erred when he used the inconsistency between the stories of the defence witnesses `to completely disregard their entire testimonies`. This showed that the magistrate applied a double standard to the assessment of the veracity of the witnesses. When it came to the inconsistency in Mr Ng`s testimony, the magistrate had been far more `forgiving`.
Sentence
Mr Damodara`s argument was that the imposition of a custodial sentence in this case was `manifestly excessive, inordinate, inappropriate and not fitting the circumstances of the case`. The imposition of the custodial sentence was based upon the erroneous reasoning that: 
a the appellant had started the fight; 
b he had caused Mr Ng to fall off his motorcycle; 
c the road rage analogy was appropriate; 
d he was found guilty after a full trial; and 
e his version of the story was `totally at odds with the evidence adduced by the Prosecution`.
Furthermore, the magistrate had failed to take into consideration the fact that it was the appellant`s first conviction and that Mr Ng was not a first offender.
 The prosecution`s case in the appeal 
 
 
 
The conviction
Mr Tan cited the usual cases which are relied upon for the proposition that an `appellate court should be slow to overturn a trial judge`s findings of fact, especially where they hinge on the trial judge`s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence`: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
  at p 653.
Mr Ng`s testimony
Mr Tan admitted that there was an apparent contradiction in Mr Ng`s testimony regarding the attack with a stick. However, he submitted that Mr Ng had satisfactorily explained himself. The inference which Mr Ng had drawn from his sensory experiences - the sound and feel of something hard hitting his helmet and the sight immediately after of a stick lying next to the appellant - was `perfectly reasonable`. As Mr Ng was `perfectly candid` in court during cross-examination, `[n]o adverse inference should be drawn against [Mr Ng] in this respect`. Mr Tan added that the magistrate had considered this contradiction and had exercised his prerogative to disregard it as immaterial and to accept the rest of Mr Ng`s testimony as true.
The cumulative effect of the testimonies of Mr Ng, Mr Sahrin and Mr Samad
Mr Tan then dealt with the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. Both Mr Ng and Mr Samad had testified that when the appellant`s motorcycle had brushed Mr Ng`s, there was a collision between the machines. Mr Sahrin, however, had said that there had been no contact between the motorcycles at all. Mr Tan`s submission was that this discrepancy was immaterial. In addition, he cited Abdul Hamid J in 
Chean Siong Guat v PP
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
  for the proposition that `allowances must be made for human fallibility in the giving of evidence and that discrepancies in evidence are common`.
Mr Tan argued that the discrepancy was `not serious and can be easily explained by human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection. This is especially so in the instant case where (a) things happened very fast (b) [the witnesses] were observing the event from different places and (c) Mr Sahrin and Mr Samad were some distance away`.
Mr Tan submitted that the discrepancies did not affect the evidence relating to the essential elements of the offence which was consistent between the three witnesses. The only question in issue was whether there had been a fight and this, he submitted, had been adequately proved by the evidence of the prosecution`s witnesses.
Mr Ng`s injuries
Mr Tan submitted that, just as the doctor was unable to confirm that the injuries were inflicted in a fight, she was unable to confirm that they were self-inflicted. He admitted that there was no conclusive evidence that the injuries were inflicted in a fight but it was a reasonable inference to make and that the magistrate was entitled to believe Mr Ng`s testimony that the injuries were inflicted by the appellant in the fight.
Treating the evidence of Mr Ng, Mr Sahrin and Mr Samad with caution
Mr Damodara had argued that the magistrate had failed to treat the evidence of Mr Ng with the caution which accomplice evidence demands. Mr Tan simply dismissed this contention as `utterly without merit` because the magistrate had considered the matter at p 7, [para ] 16 of his judgment.
Mr Tan also dealt with the argument that Mr Sahrin and Mr Samad`s appearance at the trial was `suspicious` because they were introduced very late and were not on the original list of witnesses tendered at the pre-trial conference. Mr Tan dismissed this argument as `utterly without merit`. He argued that the change of witnesses after a pre-trial conference was `hardly sinister in itself`. Post PTC investigations may reveal new witnesses and the prosecuting officer may not be the same as the one who participated in the PTC and may wish to call different witnesses. Therefore, the magistrate was entitled to accept them as independent witnesses.
The defence witnesses` testimonies
Mr Tan submitted that the magistrate was `perfectly justified` in rejecting the evidence of the appellant, Mr Sullivan and Miss Ong.
First, he argued that Mr Sullivan and Miss Ong were `interested witnesses`, being friends of the appellant. Secondly, he pointed to `inherent improbabilities in the evidence of the defence witnesses`. Thirdly, `there are material inconsistencies in the evidence of the defence witnesses, which cannot be easily explained by human fallibility alone`.
Sentence
Mr Tan submitted that the road-rage analogy was appropriate and therefore the rationale behind the sentencing rules in road-rage cases was applicable here. The people who participate in such sport form a `self contained micro-community` who have to operate in circumstances not unlike those in which normal everyday motorists operate. The public interest in maintaining law and harmony among members of such micro-communities, who have to share a small plot of land to enjoy the riding of their motorcycles, is no different from the public interest in maintaining law and harmony among motorists on Singapore`s roads. A prison sentence was called for here to act as a deterrence, both to the appellant and to others as well.
 My determination 
 
 
 
Conviction
The gist of the appellant`s case was that he had been the victim of Mr Ng`s assault and that he had not responded in like manner. I found this suggestion difficult to accept. A man who is being assaulted would certainly not lie passively and do nothing in response. To expect a court to believe that this was the case was unrealistic at best. Indeed, the appellant`s argument was that he was acting in the exercise of his right of private defence. This postulated that he had indeed responded to Mr Ng`s assault. If this was the case, then it could be said that a `fight` took place and therefore that the offence of affray was made out. A `fight` has been defined simply as a `bilateral transaction in which blows are exchanged` ( 
Bhagwan Munjaji Pawade v State of Maharashtra
 (Unreported) ). The defence of private defence, if made out, would defeat the argument that there had been no fight because it was based upon there being some culpable conduct on the part of an accused person which was justifiable in the circumstances.
The proposition that an appellate court will be slow to overturn a trial judge`s findings of fact is well established in Singapore. It is also well established in English jurisprudence and found eloquent expression by Lord Shaw in the case of 
Clarke v Edinburgh and District Tramways Co Ltd
 (Unreported) . He said: 
 
When a judge hears and sees witnesses and makes a conclusion or inference with regard to what is the weight on balance of their evidence, that judgment is entitled to great respect ... I can of course quite understand a Court of Appeal that says that it will not interfere in a case in which the judge has announced as part of his judgment that he believes one set of witnesses, having seen them and heard them, and does not believe another. But that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a court of justice. In courts of justice in the ordinary case things are much more evenly divided; witnesses without any conscious bias towards a conclusion may have in their demeanour, in their manner, in their hesitation, in the nuance of their expressions, in even the turns of the eyelid, left an impression upon the man who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed page. What in such circumstances ... is the duty of the appellate court? In my opinion, the duty of an appellate court in these circumstances is for each judge of it to put to himself, as I now do in this case, the question, am I - who sit here without those advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the judge who heard and tried the case - in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that a judge who had them was plainly wrong? If I cannot be satisfied in my own mind that the judge with those privileges was plainly wrong, then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his judgment.
 
 
 
Having examined the case in great detail, I could not say that I was satisfied that the magistrate was plainly wrong in coming to the conclusion he did. Coupled with the inherent improbabilities in the appellant`s story, I had no hesitation in dismissing the appeal against conviction.
Sentence
I then dealt with the appellant`s appeal against his sentence. Mr Tan`s main submission in support of the magistrate`s imposition of a custodial sentence was that such a sentence was necessary here for the same reasons as those which apply in road-rage cases. He therefore argued that the case of 
 PP v Lee Seck Hing 
was applicable as a precedent.
That case, however, was an extreme example of violence on our roads. The facts which justified a custodial sentence were very different from the facts of the instant case and a parallel could not be correctly drawn between the two cases. Furthermore, I took judicial notice of the nature of off-road motorcycle sport and noted the dissimilarities between such activity and the use of motor vehicles for more mundane purposes on Singapore`s roads.
Off-road motor sport attracts a certain type of person. He is the rough and ready outdoor type. The people who indulge in such activity enjoy the thrills and spills of the sport. When a dispute ends in fisticuffs, the situation is very different from that of an innocent motorist who is beaten up by another motorist simply because the former cut into the latter`s path. I therefore disagreed that it was appropriate to apply the road-rage sentencing rules to this case.
I therefore allowed the appeal against sentence to the extent that the two weeks` imprisonment term was set aside.

1 This was an appeal arising from the conviction of the appellant Tay Chi Hiong (‘Tay’) by district judge Doris Lai-Chia Lee Mui of two charges under s 8(1)(b) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). Tay was sentenced to pay a fine of $15,000 on the first charge and $20,000 on the second charge with default sentences fixed at two and four months respectively. I dismissed Tay’s appeal against both conviction and sentence. I now give my reasons.
The prosecution’s case
2 On 7 August 2001, Mdm Loo Chiew Fah lodged a complaint that persons unknown had written ‘owe money pay money’ on the walls adjacent to her unit at Blk 1 Eunos Crescent. She informed the police that a number of people had already come to her home demanding payment from her husband Chua Beng Kiaw (‘Chua’). However, she was unaware of his whereabouts as they had been separated for the last two years.
3 Attempts were made to trace Chua and he was located sometime in September 2001. Chua informed the police that he had found himself in need of money sometime in December 1999. A friend of his brought him to Lorong 16 Geylang and introduced him to Tay to enable him to obtain a loan. Tay agreed to give him a loan of $500 at an interest rate of 20% and took down his particulars.
4 The loan was to be repaid in weekly instalments of $100 over six weeks. Any late payment would result in all previous payments being forfeited and Chua would have to start afresh to make six successive payments of $100. When Chua pleaded with Tay for a reprieve, Tay replied that he was not in a position to decide and would have to consult his boss - a man going by the name of ‘Ah Kau’.
5 Chua testified that he met Tay four times in Geylang to make payments towards the loan. After this the venue for payment was changed to Yishun. He met Tay seven or eight times in Yishun at Blk 747 during which he handed over sums of $100 or $200 towards repayment of the loan. He could not recall the exact dates or the precise amounts paid out each time, but from 1999 to 2001 they amount in total to a sum exceeding $1000.
6 On 14 September 2001, Chua was shown some 60 to 70 photographs of known moneylenders. He identified Tay from these photos. On 26 September 2001, an ID parade was conducted and Chua picked out Tay from the line-up as the man who had dispensed the loan and collected repayments from him. Chua affirmed that he would have been able to make a positive identification even if he had not seen the photographs previously because he had met the appellant so many times to make payments.
7 Tay was charged with two counts of abetment by intentionally aiding ‘Ah Kau’ to carry on an illegal moneylending operation by (i) dispensing $500 to Chua in December 1999 and (ii) collecting $100 from Chua in March 2000.
The defence
8 Tay’s defence was one of complete denial. He denied knowing Chua or working for a man named ‘Ah Kau’ and alleged that he had been framed. Tay had previously been arrested for being an illegal moneylender. He had co-operated with the police at the time and provided information on the man he had been working for. Tay implied that Chua had been instigated to falsely implicate him in order to ‘punish’ Tay for helping the police.
Decision of the court below
9 The district judge acknowledged that there were discrepancies between Chua’s evidence and that of his wife, Mdm Loo. Chua’s testimony was that his wife had received a call asking her to inform Chua he was to make payments at Yishun instead of Geylang. Mdm Loo testified that she did not recall receiving any such phone calls but said several persons had come to the house to demand payment and it was possible that one of them may have told her to pass on the message.
10 The district judge considered these discrepancies between Chua and Loo’s evidence to be immaterial and was prepared to accept Chua’s evidence on all material points. As regards Tay’s defence, the district judge considered it to be incredible. She found that there was no evidence to suggest Chua was attempting to frame Tay. Rather, the facts indicated otherwise. It was Chua’s wife, Mdm Loo who made the initial police report. At that time, Chua had already been separated from his wife for quite some time and Chua had to be traced by the police before he gave a statement.
11 Having considered the evidence before her, the district judge preferred to accept Chua’s testimony and found that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt.
Appeal against conviction
12 The prosecution’s case was based primarily on Chua’s evidence. As such, this appeal turned solely on whether the trial judge erred in accepting Chua’s version of events. It is settled law that an appellate court will not overturn findings of fact unless they can be shown to be against the weight of evidence. As I said in 
PP v Azman Abdullah
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
 at p 21,
 
An appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the trial judge’s decision, must not merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong.
 
 
Bearing this in mind, I was of the view that there was nothing to indicate that the district judge’s findings were unsupportable or against the weight of the evidence adduced.
13 Tay contended that the district judge failed to adequately consider the inconsistencies in Chua’s evidence and should have found him to be an unreliable witness. Now, the main discrepancy in Chua’s evidence was his account of how he received the message that he was to make payments in Yishun instead of in Geylang. In his examination-in-chief, Chua stated:
 
The accused called my home subsequently and informed my wife to ask me to make payment in Yishun. Thereafter I made payments in Yishun.
 
 
However, when questioned about this, Mdm Loo in her examination-in-chief stated:
 
I do not have much of an impression of someone calling me to tell my husband to go to Yishun to pay. Normally they will come and tell their names. Yes, I did tell my husband that someone had come to ask him to go to Yishun to pay money.
 
 
It is possible that one of the persons who came to demand payment did mention that my husband should make payment in Yishun.
 
14 In her grounds of judgement, the district judge considered this discrepancy between Chua and Loo’s evidence to be immaterial and found that it did not affect the veracity of Chua’s evidence. The district judge was fully entitled to come to such a conclusion. As I held in 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
, there is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in its entirety or not at all. So long as the inconsistencies were minor in nature, or related to minor issues, it did not undermine the evidence in respect of key issues.
15 Here, the main issue was Chua’s identification of Tay as the man he had liaised with in relation to the loan. The propriety of the identification parade was not in dispute. As such, the main question was whether Chua was telling the truth. In assessing Chua’s credibility, the district judge noted that there was no motive for him to lie in order to frame Tay. If it was indeed a set-up, there would have been no need to mention the third person ‘Ah Kau’. Furthermore, Chua was not the person who made the initial police report. It was his wife who made a complaint to the police and she did not know Chua’s whereabouts at the time. Chua only came forward a month later when the security personnel at his work place informed him that he was being sought by the police.
16 In light of the above, I was satisfied that the district judge was justified in choosing to rely on Chua’s evidence in all material aspects and to reject Tay’s testimony. Being mindful of the fact that this Court had neither seen nor heard the witnesses, I was prepared to accept the district judge’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses.
17 However, I would just briefly touch upon one point which was not addressed by the district judge. The second charge related to a payment of $100 made to Tay in March 2000. Chua’s evidence in relation to this was:
 
On this occasion I can’t recall whether it was $100 or $200. However, I confirm that I did make some payment that day. This payment was also related to the loan in question.
 
 
As such, the charge against Tay should have read ‘..
intentionally aiding the said ‘Ah Kau’ to collect a sum of $100 or $200 from Chua Beng Kiaw…’.
 In my opinion, this was an omission that fell squarely within s 396 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which reads:
 
Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of –
 
 
(a) any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge or judgement or other proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceeding under this Code;
 
(b) the want of any sanction required by section 129; or
 
(c) the improper admission or rejection of any evidence, unless the error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity or want has occasioned a failure of justice.
 
Since Tay suffered no prejudice as a result of the omission in the charge, I found no need to disturb the findings of the district judge.
Whether sentence imposed was manifestly excessive
18 For the first charge, the mandatory minimum was a fine of $10,000. Tay was sentenced to pay a fine of $15,000, in default two months’ imprisonment. For the second charge, the enhanced penalties under s 8(1)(b) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) were applicable and the mandatory minimum was a fine of $20,000. The sentence imposed was a fine of $30,000, in default four months’ imprisonment.
19 Both sentences were already at the lower end of the scale of punishment prescribed and could not be said to be manifestly excessive in any way. I therefore dismissed the appeal against sentence.",2003-01-16 00:00:00,SG High Court

(delivering the judgment of the court): The appellant, Thiruselvan s/o Nagaratnam, resided at Block 645, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, [num ]12-4995, Singapore. He was a lashing worker with the Port of Singapore Authority. On 13 January 2000, he was arrested for his involvement in a drug transaction with one Katheraven s/o Gopal (`Katheraven`). He was tried before the High Court on a charge for abetting Katheraven in trafficking in 807.6g of cannabis on 13 January 2000 at about 3.40pm at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, Singapore, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 12 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Ed). He was convicted and was sentenced to suffer death. Against his conviction he now appeals.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The evidence led by the prosecution was as follows. On 13 January 2000, Katheraven was introduced to an undercover narcotics officer, Sgt Andrew John Joachim (`Sgt Andrew`), who was interested in purchasing 1 kg of cannabis. He met Sgt Andrew at about 2.45pm at Bukit Merah View, and offered to sell to Sgt Andrew 1 kg of cannabis for $2,200 plus $500 commission. When Sgt Andrew asked for a reduction of the price, Katheraven made some calls on his handphone (No 97603714) and spoke in Tamil to the person at the other end. He then informed Sgt Andrew that the price could not be reduced. Upon confirmation of the deal, Katheraven made further calls on his handphone. Thereafter, he told Sgt Andrew that he had to go to Ang Mo Kio to collect the drugs.
According to the telephone records, which were subsequently obtained by the prosecution, there were four successive outgoing calls from Katheraven`s handphone to the appellant`s pager (No 96069940) between 3pm and 3.04pm on that day. This was followed by two incoming calls from the appellant`s home telephone (No 4525161) at about 3.05pm and 3.13pm.
Sgt Andrew drove to Ang Mo Kio with Katheraven. They arrived at the car park of Block 646, Ang Mo Kio Street 61 at about 3.30pm. Katheraven left the car and walked towards the direction of Block 648 Ang Mo Kio. The telephone records showed that there were two outgoing calls to the appellant`s pager at 3.36pm and 3.40pm respectively. A short while later, Katheraven ran back to Sgt Andrew`s car carrying something under his T-shirt. After he stepped into the car, he lifted his shirt, removed a slab of cannabis and handed it to Sgt Andrew. He was arrested immediately thereafter by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`).
The slab of substance was subsequently analysed by the Department of Scientific Services and was found to contain 807.6g of cannabis and 115g of cannabis mixture.
 The telephone calls 
 
 
 
After Katheraven`s arrest, between 3.49pm and 6.37pm, there were 20 incoming calls to his handphone from the appellant`s home telephone, which were not answered by the arresting CNB officers. At about 7.20pm, Katheraven`s handphone rang again. This time the call was answered by one of the arresting officers, Cpl Anan Devan (`Cpl Anan`). The telephone records showed that this incoming call came from a public telephone (No 4549968) at Block 632 Ang Mo Kio [num ]01-952. According to Cpl Anan, the caller asked for `Kathi`. Cpl Anan informed him that Kathi was not around and that he was a friend of Kathi. The caller (later identified as the appellant) identified himself as `Thiruchy`. Cpl Anan could not remember the entire contents of the conversation but he distinctly recalled that the appellant said in Tamil `Porula Edutha Karsai Tharunam`, which meant, `If the thing is taken, the money must be paid`. Cpl Anan told him that he would not cheat him and would pay the money. Cpl Anan believed that the caller possibly mistook him for the purchaser of the drugs who would have the money to pay him. He accordingly informed the other CNB officers.
Shortly after, the appellant called again. The telephone records showed that this incoming call was received at 7.30pm and came from the same public telephone. The appellant asked for Kathi. Cpl Anan said that he was not around and asked the appellant where he wanted the money to be handed to him. The appellant said that he would be at the coffee shop at Block 630 Ang Mo Kio and that he would be wearing a `Milan` white soccer jersey and a pair of soccer shorts.
On the way to Ang Mo Kio, Cpl Anan received another call from the appellant, recorded at 7.47pm (from No 4520742), asking about the time Cpl Anan would reach the coffee shop. Cpl Anan replied that he was on his way. On arrival, Cpl Anan, together with SSgt Mohd Azam spotted a male Indian fitting the description in the company of two other male Indians in a coffee shop at Block 632. Before long, the appellant called again asking where he was and said that he was waiting for the money. Cpl Anan replied that he was in the vicinity but did not feel safe going to the coffee shop. Cpl Anan expressed his preference to meet in front of the bus stop at Block 639 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6. The appellant agreed. The telephone records showed that this incoming call was made at 8.09pm and came from a public telephone (No 4522407) at Block 632 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6.
There were altogether four telephone calls made to Katheraven`s handphone between 7.20pm and 8.09pm, which were answered by Cpl Anan. The appellant admitted that he made the four calls but disputed the contents of the conversations.
 The arrest 
 
 
 
At about 8.20pm, the appellant was arrested as he was walking toward the bus-stop at Block 639 Ang Mo Kio. He was wearing a `Milan` white soccer jersey. As he was being brought to his registered address for a search, he denied that he was the caller or that he was known as Thiruchy. When the appellant`s wife opened the door, Cpl Anan asked her in Tamil if Thiruchy was in, and in reply she said that he was not at home. At this juncture, the appellant shouted in Tamil that he was only known by his first name `Thiruselvam`.
 Statements made by the appellant 
 
 
 
The prosecution adduced several statements made by the appellant after his arrest. He did not challenge that the statements were made by him voluntarily and they were duly admitted in evidence. In these statements, the appellant gave accounts of the events leading up to his arrest. In the first four statements recorded from him between 13 and 19 January 2000, the appellant denied knowing Katheraven. He said that he merely agreed to do a favour for a friend known as Thambi who had requested him to collect a sum of over a thousand dollars from a person wearing black shirt and trousers at the bus-stop in front of Block 639 Ang Mo Kio. He had in turn informed Thambi that he was wearing soccer shirt and trousers. He denied knowing that the money he was collecting was drug money. In this version, he did not speak to Cpl Anan on the telephone; nor did he arrange to meet Cpl Anan at the bus stop where he was arrested.
In two subsequent statements recorded on 25 and 26 January 2000 by ASP Fan Tuck Chee (`ASP Fan`) and interpreted by Ms Caroline Edmund Susila (`Caroline`), the appellant admitted that he had not told the whole truth in his earlier statements. He had not mentioned Joe, who was a friend of Thambi. He now admitted knowing Katheraven who called him `Thiruchi`. Katheraven contacted him on 13 January 2000 on his pager (No 96069940) on three occasions in the afternoon in relation to Katheraven`s prior arrangement to meet Thambi or Joe. The first page was received at about 2pm. He assisted Katheraven by contacting Joe on his behalf and liaising between Katheraven and Joe using his house telephone. He had given Joe`s handphone to Katheraven so that he could contact Joe directly.
It is unnecessary to set out further details of his statements. In so far as they are material and assist the appellant in his defence, they contained an account substantially along the line of his defence to which we shall refer in a moment.
 Evidence of Katheraven 
 
 
 
Katheraven was called as a witness for the prosecution. He had earlier pleaded guilty in the High Court on 16 June 2000 to two non-capital charges for supplying the drugs to Sgt Andrew on 13 January 2001. He was sentenced to a total of 25 years` imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.
In his testimony in court, Katheraven completely exonerated the appellant from any involvement in the supply or sale of the drugs to him. His evidence was that on 13 January 2000 at about 12.45pm, he received a call on his handphone from his friend `Selvam` who asked for his assistance in obtaining 1 kg of cannabis for his friend, Andrew (ie Sgt Andrew). At about 1pm, he paged and telephoned one Joe Bhaskaran using his handphone to arrange for the supply of the drugs. He conceded that he spoke to the appellant on 13 January 2000 at about 1pm, but the call concerned the return of a sum of $300 which he had borrowed from the appellant earlier. He essentially denied discussing about drugs in any of his telephone conversations with the appellant.
According to the telephone records, there were no outgoing calls to Joe Bhaskaran`s number which Katheraven gave as 97517436. In fact there was no record of any such call from Katheraven`s handphone to this number on 13 January 2000. During the time between 12.44pm and 1pm, the records reflected only an incoming call from number 7458050 at 12.44pm following by an outgoing page to the appellant`s pager at 12.52pm. The next call was one coming from the appellant`s home at 12.54pm.
As a result of the material contradictions between Katheraven`s oral testimony and his previous statements, the prosecution applied for leave to refer to previous inconsistent and contradictory statements made by Katheraven with a view to impeaching his credit. These previous statements were: (i) a signed statement recorded on 20 January 2000, exh P29 (`P29`); (ii) a statement of facts which was produced in court and to which he admitted when he pleaded guilty to the trafficking charges on 16 June 2000, exh P46 (`P46`); (iii) a statement recorded on 16 June 2000 after he had pleaded guilty to the trafficking charges, exh P49 (`P49`). The trial judge having read the statements allowed the prosecution to refer Katheraven to the statements and to cross-examine him with a view to impeaching his credit. The trial judge also admitted the statements as evidence of the facts stated therein under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. In so doing, the trial judge took the view that there was no necessity to conduct a voir dire to satisfy himself that the statements, P29 and P49, were made by Katheraven voluntarily. The material portions of the three statements were substantially similar and implicated the appellant in the supply of the drugs to Katheraven.
 Defence 
 
 
 
The appellant gave evidence in his defence. He denied any involvement in the drug transaction. He admitted Katheraven was known to him since 1993 and had his pager number. His evidence was that his telephone conversations and numerous outgoing calls to Katheraven up to 6.37pm on 13 January 2000 pertained to the repayment of a sum of $300 which Katheraven had borrowed from him some two weeks earlier and were not about drugs.
So far as material, his evidence of the material events is as follows. At about 6.30pm, on 13 January 2000, he went to the coffeeshop at Block 632 Ang Mo Kio to meet a friend Shanmugam. Shortly after, he met one Thambi, who had sold VCDs to him in the past. At Thambi`s request, the appellant followed him to the coffeeshop at Block 630 to discuss something important. There, he saw Joe, a close friend of Thambi. Thambi and Joe were known to both him and Katheraven. Thambi said that Katheraven telephoned him the previous day to arrange to buy some stuff, which he said was drugs. Thambi spoke to Joe, and both of them made arrangements to supply the drugs to Katheraven who took them, saying that he would pay later and that he would not cheat them. As he was a close friend of the appellant, Joe trusted Katheraven and allowed him to take the stuff. That was the first time he heard of the transaction, and he was shocked and surprised that Joe was a drug pusher. He was told that Katheraven had since failed to make the payment. Joe told him to call Katheraven to come to the coffee shop, since Katheraven was his friend. They also insisted that he pay on Katheraven`s behalf and that he could collect the money from Katheraven, since they were friends. When the appellant protested, Joe shouted at him, and threatened to do something to him and Katheraven if he failed to call Katheraven and ask him to come by 8pm to pay them the money. He then agreed to locate Katheraven and tell him to see them.
He said that Joe and Thambi did not inform him of the amount of money which Katheraven had to pay. Neither did they tell him that the drugs they supplied to Katheraven were cannabis. It did not occur to him to ask them. In the midst of this argument with Joe, he removed a card (where he had written the name, Thambi, and Joe`s telephone number) from his waist pouch and threw it on the table, saying that he would have nothing to do with them anymore and did not want to get involved in the matter under discussion. He told Joe and Thambi that he would call Katheraven and ask him to pay up.
The appellant then returned to Block 632. Along the way, he called Katheraven from a public telephone. The person who answered the call (ie Cpl Anan) said that Katheraven was not in and that he was Katheraven`s friend. The appellant introduced himself as Thiruchy. Conversing in Tamil, the appellant said that Katheraven had called him earlier about the return of a loan; that Katheraven had put him into some kind of problem and that people were asking for him and waiting for payment. He asked Cpl Anan to enquire from Katheraven what stuff he had taken from Ang Mo Kio. Cpl Anan promised to pass the message to Katheraven and asked him to call back after five minutes.
The appellant related the conversation to Thambi who was then standing beside him. The appellant called again and questioned Cpl Anan whether he had asked Katheraven. Cpl Anan responded that both he and Katheraven would be coming with the money and asked where they should meet. The appellant told him to meet at the coffeeshop at Block 632 Ang Mo Kio, where he would show them the men who wanted the money. Thereafter the appellant returned to his friends at Block 632, while Thambi returned to Block 630.
From the coffee-shop he called Cpl Anan the third time. Cpl Anan informed him that he and Katheraven were on their way and would arrive in about 20 minutes. The appellant said that he would be at Block 632, to which Cpl Anan replied that he had gone there but nobody was there. They each described their respective clothings to the other so that they could identify each other. Cpl Anan said that he was not familiar with that place, and the appellant responded that Katheraven knew the location of the coffeeshop.
A short while later, the appellant received a call from Thambi. The appellant informed him that Katheraven and his friend were on their way with the payment. However, Thambi said that he and Joe had to leave as they had something to attend to and that he would call Katheraven on his own to collect the payment.
The appellant continued drinking with his friends. He subsequently called Katheraven`s handphone with the intention of informing him that Thambi and Joe had left. Cpl Anan answered the call and said that they were already in the vicinity. When the appellant told him to meet at the coffee shop at Block 632, Cpl Anan suggested the bus-stop at Block 639 instead. The appellant agreed and left for the bus-stop where he was arrested. After he was handcuffed, he was assaulted by Cpl Anan. At the time of his arrest, he denied that he was Thiruchy or that he called Katheraven`s handphone as he was in fear and was confused.
 Josephine d/o Anthony 
 
 
 
The appellant`s wife, Josephine d/o Anthony, gave evidence on his behalf. She testified that her husband spoke to Katheraven on the telephone on the 13 January 2000, after which her husband informed her that Kathi was going to return the money borrowed from him, including some moneys pertaining to VCDs, which Katheraven had bought from her husband`s friend. Her husband had also asked her to get a name card from his pouch with the name `Thambi` written on it, and her husband gave the number to Katheraven over the telephone. Apart from the above, she could not remember anything else. She conceded that she had not mentioned this to the CNB officers in her statement to them which was recorded some four months after his arrest. She explained that she was stressed up that her husband was arrested and it did not occur to her to tell the CNB officers.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Before us, Mr Sidambaram, counsel for the appellant, raises the following main arguments. First, he submits that the charge against the appellant, being a capital charge, in contradistinction to the non-capital charge that was preferred against Katheraven, the principal offender, was in breach of art 12 of the Constitution. Secondly, the trial judge erred in admitting in evidence the two statements made by the appellant, P29 and P49, and the statement of facts, P46. Thirdly, the trial judge erred in his evaluation of the evidence and in disbelieving the appellant. The evidence against the appellant was wholly circumstantial and did not conclusively point to his guilt.
 Article 12 of the Constitution 
 
 
 
As a preliminary point, Mr Sidambaram submits that in preferring the charge against the appellant, the prosecution had breached art 12(1) of the Constitution, which provides: 
 
All persons are equal before the law and entitled to equal protection of the law.
 
 
 
The appellant was charged for abetting Katheraven in committing the offence of trafficking in a quantity of 807.6g of cannabis, which is a capital charge. Katheraven himself, on the other hand, was charged for trafficking in a quantity of not more than 500g and not less than 300g of cannabis which, because of the reduced amount of cannabis involved in the charge, was a non-capital charge. He was convicted on that charge. In other words, Katheraven being the main offender was charged and convicted on a lesser charge, while the appellant himself, who allegedly abetted Katheraven in that offence, faced a capital charge. There was thus no equality before the law. To achieve equality, the appellant ought to have been charged with abetment of the same offence with which Katheraven was charged, a non-capital offence.
In response, Mr Bala Reddy, the deputy public prosecutor, contends that the prosecution has the discretion to decide whether or not to prefer a charge in any particular case, and whether or not to prefer a charge against a particular offender, and what charge should be brought against the offender. He further submits that there is no legal requirement that the abettor should be charged and convicted for abetting the trafficking in drugs in the same quantity as the principal offender is charged so long there is proof that the offence of trafficking in the quantity as stated in the charge was committed.
A point similar to the one under consideration was decided by the Privy Council in 
Teh Cheng Poh v PP
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 50
 , on appeal from the Federal Court of Malaysia. There, the accused was charged with possession of a revolver and ammunition in a security area under the Internal Security Act 1960. He was tried under the special procedure laid down by the Essential (Security Cases) (Amendment) Regulations 1975 and was found guilty and was convicted. At the time of the commission of the offence, there were two Acts of Parliament which made unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition a criminal offence. One was s 57 of the Internal Security Act 1960 which made unlawful possession of firearms or ammunition in a security area a capital offence. The other was the Arms Act 1960, and the offence under that Act was not a capital offence. The ingredients of the offences under the respective Acts are substantially the same. In exercise of his discretion, the Attorney General decided to charge the accused under the Internal Security Act, which carried the mandatory death penalty. It was contended on behalf of the accused that the exercise of such discretion deprived the accused of the equality before the law under art 8(1) of the Malaysian Constitution which provided: 
 
All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.
 
 
 
The Privy Council rejected this argument. Lord Diplock delivering the judgment of the Board said at p 56: 
 
... Under the common law system of administration of criminal justice a prosecuting authority has a discretion whether to institute proceedings at all and, if so, with what offence to charge the accused. Such a discretion is conferred upon the Attorney General of Malaysia by art 145(3) of the Constitution, viz:
 
 
 
`The Attorney General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for an offence other than proceedings before a Muslim court, a native court or a court-martial.`
 
 
 
There are many factors which a prosecuting authority may properly take into account in exercising its discretion as to whether to charge a person at all, or, where the information available to it discloses the ingredients of a greater as well as a lesser offence, as to whether to charge the accused with the greater or the lesser. The existence of those factors to which the prosecuting authority may properly have regard and the relative weight to be attached to each of them may vary enormously between one case and another. 
 All that equality before the law requires, is that the cases of all potential defendants to criminal charges shall be given unbiased consideration by the prosecuting authority and that decisions whether or not to prosecute in a particular case for a particular offence should not be dictated by some irrelevant consideration
. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
A more direct authority on the point is the case of 
Sim Min Teck v PP
 
 
[1987] SLR 30
 . There, the appellant, Sim Min Teck, was convicted of two charges of murder, namely, that he with two other persons, in furtherance of a common intention, committed murder by causing the deaths of two persons. One of the two accomplices was charged on the same facts with the lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. It was argued on behalf of Sim before this court that he had been discriminated against, contrary to art 12(1) of the Constitution, on the ground that his accomplice had been charged with the lesser offence. This court had no hesitation in rejecting this submission. Wee Chong Jin CJ, delivering the judgment of the court, said at p 33: 
 
Lastly, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that because Beh had been charged on the same facts with the lesser offence, the appellant had been discriminated against contrary to art 12(1) of the Constitution of Singapore which states that `All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.` We rejected this contention. The Attorney General of Singapore is by art 35(8) of the Constitution given power, exercisable at his discretion to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.
 
 
 
The Chief Justice then quoted with approval the above passage of the judgment of Lord Diplock in 
 Teh Cheng Poh 
 (supra).
It is true that in 
 Sim Min Teck 
 the accused was one of the main offenders and the accomplice played a lesser role in the commission of the offence of murder. In the instant case, the position is the reverse: the appellant was only an abettor of Katheraven, the person who committed the main offence. To that extent, this case is slightly different from 
 Sim Min Teck 
. However, this difference is immaterial and does not detract from the weight of that authority. The principle remains the same. The prosecution has a wide discretion to determine what charge or charges should be preferred against any particular offender, and to proceed on charges of different severity as between different participants of the same criminal acts. In this case, it has a discretion to choose between preferring a charge against the appellant for abetment of trafficking in a quantity which carries the capital punishment and preferring one for abetment of trafficking in a quantity which does not. In our judgment, there was no breach of art 12 of the Constitution.
 Previous statements 
 
 
 
As we have related, there were three previous statements of Katheraven on which he was cross-examined and which were admitted in evidence to prove the facts stated therein under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. They are: (i) the statement recorded on 20 January 2000, P29; (ii) the statement of facts which was produced and admitted in the proceedings against him when he pleaded guilty to the trafficking charges on 16 June 2000, P46; and (iii) the statement recorded on 16 June 2000 after he had pleaded guilty to the trafficking charges, P49. Mr Sidambaram challenges the decision of the trial judge on the admission of these three statements in evidence, on the ground that, as regards to P29 and P49, they had not been proved to have been made by Katheraven voluntarily, and as for P46, it had not been proved that Katheraven had admitted to that statement. We now consider his arguments in relation to each of the statements seriatim.
 The statement of facts - exh P46 
 
 
 
It is convenient to consider first the argument against the admission of the statement of facts, P46. The main contention here is that the prosecution had not proved that Katheraven had admitted to the statement of facts, P46, in the proceedings brought against him, and accordingly P46 was not a statement made by Katheraven and the trial judge erred in allowing it to be used for the purposes of cross-examining Katheraven under s 147(1) of the Evidence Act and in admitting it as substantive evidence of the facts stated therein under s 147(3) of the Act. Mr Sidambaram pointed out that the prosecution did not produce the relevant record of the proceedings against Katheraven and the latter did not admit that in those proceedings he had admitted to the contents of P46. In these circumstances, there was no evidential basis to support the trial judge`s finding that P46 had been interpreted and explained to and admitted by Katheraven.
We find this a technical quibble. There was no dispute as to the authenticity of P46 before the trial judge. It was a certified true copy of the original and contained the court markings indicating that P46 was admitted as an exhibit in the criminal proceedings against Katheraven on 16 June 2000. There was no dispute that P46 was an exact copy of the statement of facts which was tendered in the proceedings against Katheraven. Katheraven was then represented by counsel and P46 was admitted in the presence of his counsel. There is no straitjacket requirement that the tender of the record of proceedings is the only way to prove that Katheraven had admitted to P46 without qualification.
The trial judge exercised great caution in dealing with P46. He asked Katheraven a series of questions to satisfy himself that Katheraven had indeed admitted to P46 without qualification. Katheraven initially admitted but in the very next breath denied that the statement of facts was read and explained to him. On the other hand, he admitted that the charge was read to him and was admitted by him; but he claimed that he could not recall whether P46 was read or interpreted to him. At a later point in his testimony, he claimed that he admitted out of fear to the untrue facts stated in relation to the appellant`s involvement in the drug transaction. The trial judge found that Katheraven was lying with regard to this statement. He was justified in making this finding and on the evidence was entitled to come to the conclusion that P46 had been read and explained to Katheraven in court and that he had admitted to the statement without qualification.
 Statements made on 20 January - exh P29 
 
 
 
We now turn to the statement, P29, which was made by Katheraven on 20 January 2000. Before the trial judge, Katheraven admitted that P29 was his signed statement, and the trial judge dispensed with any proof that the statement was indeed made by Katheraven. The statement was used by the prosecution in the cross-examination of Katheraven under s 147(1) of the Evidence Act, and the trial judge admitted it as evidence of the facts stated therein under s 147(3) of the Act.
In so admitting the statement, the trial judge held that there was nothing in s 147, which requires the admissibility of a statement of a witness to be subject to the additional proof that the witness, and in this case, Katheraven, made the statement voluntarily. He said at [para ] 73 of his grounds of judgment: 
 
I observed that nothing in s 147(3) requires the admissibility of a statement of a witness (including one who might have been an accomplice or an accused person) to be subject to additional proof of voluntariness. Similarly there is no specific statutory provision for admissibility for the purposes under s 147(1) (2) or s 157(c) to be subject to the requirement of voluntariness.
 
 
 
Before us, Mr Sidambaram takes issue with the admission of P29 as evidence of the facts as stated therein. He submits that P29 was recorded from Katheraven for investigation purposes and was a confession made by Katheraven at the time when he was an accused person. He was an accused person, because there was then criminal proceedings pending against him. Therefore, s 24 of the Evidence Act applies to that statement, and as Katheraven disputed that he made the statement voluntarily, the trial judge should have conducted a voire dire to determine whether the statement was made by Katheraven voluntarily. As that had not been done, that statement of Katheraven ought not to have been admitted in evidence.
It is not in issue that Katheraven was at the time he made P29 an accused person in the proceedings then pending against him, and that the statement was, in so far as it concerned him, a confession falling within s 17(2) of the Evidence Act. Now, if he were an accused person in the present proceedings, clearly under s 24 of the Evidence Act the prosecution would have to prove that he made the statement voluntarily. But in the present proceedings he was not an accused person; the proceedings were not against him, but against the appellant. Only the appellant was an accused person; Katheraven was merely a witness. The question therefore is whether s 24 is applicable with regard to P29, which was a confession made by Katheraven who was an accused person at the time he made it.
It is convenient at this stage to refer to s 24 of the Evidence Act which is as follows: 
 
A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if the making of the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding against him.
 
 
 
The wording in this section refers in general terms to 
 a confession made by an accused person 
 and says that it is irrelevant in 
 a criminal proceeding 
 in certain circumstances. There is nothing in the section to confine these crucial words to a definite or particular accused person or criminal proceeding. Hence, in a sense these words are capable of a construction which suggests that the section is applicable to a confession made by a person who, at the time he made it, was an accused person with reference to the proceedings against him, but who is not an accused person in `a criminal proceeding` in which he appears merely as a witness. In our view, we do not think that such an application was intended by that section.
This section has to be construed in the context of the meaning of a confession which is defined in s 17(2) of the Evidence Act as follows: 
 
A confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.
 
 
 
In our view, the words `accused of an offence` relate to the offence with which the accused is being charged and the admission relates to that offence. If the admission relates to some other offence with which the accused is not being charged or to an offence with which a person other than the accused is charged, such admission, in so far as the accused is concerned, has no relevance.
Reverting to s 24 of the Evidence Act, it seems to us that the words `an accused person` must bear some relevance to the `criminal proceeding`, and it follows that the words `an accused person` means a person who `is accused` of the offence and the words `a criminal proceeding` mean the criminal proceeding in which that person is accused of the offence, ie the proceeding in which the accused is charged with the commission of the offence to which the confession relates. In our opinion, s 24 is confined to a confession made by a person who is an accused person in the criminal proceedings in which he is being charged. It has no application where the confession, though made by a person who was at the time he made it an accused person, is used in other proceedings in which the person who made it is not an accused person but merely a witness.
There is some support for the view that s 24 is confined to a confession made by an accused person which is used in a criminal proceeding against him and has no application in circumstances such as the present case where it is used in proceedings against another person. Mr Bala Reddy has brought to our attention the following persuasive authorities, which we find helpful. In 
Viran Wali v State
 (Unreported) , the court considered s 24 of the Indian Evidence Act, which in all material respects was identical with s 24 of our Evidence Act. The court rejected an argument that the operation of s 24 Indian Evidence Act was excluded because the accused person was not formally accused of an offence at the time he made the confession. Syed Murtaza Fazl Ali J having reviewed several earlier authorities concluded at p 15: 
 
... 
 Section 24 refers to the status of a person not at the time when he made the confession but when the confession is being considered by the court and when he is undoubtedly an accused person
. On a consideration, therefore of the authorities mentioned above, we are clearly of the opinion, that s 24 refers even to a person who becomes an accused subsequently and this interpretation seems to be in consonance with the language employed in s 24 of the Evidence Act. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
A similar view was expressed by the Madras High Court in 
Deputy Director, Enforcement Directorate, Madras v P Mansoor Mohamed Ali Jinnah & Ors
 (Unreported) at [para ] 26: 
 
It is clear from the principles enunciated by the judicial pronouncements of the Supreme Court and the various High Courts that the expression `an accused person` occurring in s 24 of the Evidence Act connotes the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal proceeding and includes any person who subsequently becomes an accused provided that at the time of making the statement, criminal proceedings were in prospect, and it does not predicate a formal accusation against him at the time of making the statement sought to be proved as a condition of its applicability.
 
 
 
In our opinion, where s 147 is invoked and a previous statement of a witness, who is not the accused in the proceedings before the court, is used to cross-examine him and also to prove the existence of certain facts stated therein, what is required to be proved is that the statement was made by the witness. There is no requirement under s 147 to prove further that the witness made the statement voluntarily. We are reinforced in our view by the provisions of s 147(6) which provides: 
 
In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.
 
 
 
In this regard, we agree with what the trial judge said in [para ] 74 of his grounds of judgment: 
 
In my opinion, the safeguards for ensuring the reliability of statements admitted under s 147 are found in s 147(6). If a statement has been involuntarily extracted from any witness (and all the more so from a witness who at the time of giving the statement was an accused person), the weight of that statement admitted for the purpose under s 147(3) may be significantly reduced although its admissibility per se remains unaffected.
 
 
 
Where, however, the witness is an accused person himself, then the application of s 147 is subject to s 24 of the Evidence Act and also s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code, if the latter is applicable. In other words, if the statement is a confession, then before the use of that statement under s 147 it must be proved that the statement was made by the accused voluntarily. If the statement is not a confession but falls within s 122(5) of the Code, equally it must be proved that the accused made the statement voluntarily. This requirement is specifically enjoined by the respective statutory provisions.
In conclusion, insofar as P29 is concerned, there is no requirement to conduct a voir dire to determine that it was made by Katheraven voluntarily before it is admitted for cross-examination or as substantive evidence under s 147 of the Evidence Act. It does not follow, however, that the court can ignore the question of the voluntariness in the making of the statement. If it is raised in the process of examination and cross-examination of the witness, and it is found that the statement was not made voluntarily, that is certainly an important factor to be considered in determining the weight to be accorded to the statement.
There is a further argument raised by Mr Sidambaram in relation to P29. It is submitted that the prosecution had failed to call the interpreter, Ms Caroline Edmond Susila, to prove that P29 was made by Katheraven, thereby resulting in a gap in the evidence pertaining to the circumstances in which P29 was recorded. This omission rendered the making of P29 unproven and therefore inadmissible.
This argument has completely no merit. It is patently clear that Katheraven had from the outset admitted that P29 contained his signature and was a statement made by him. What he retracted was the truth of its contents, explaining that he was in fear at the time he gave the statement. He did not retract his admission that P29 was his statement. In the circumstances, there was no necessity to call the interpreter to prove that it was made by Katheraven, though the absence of such witness may well impact on the weight to be accorded to the statement in light of Katheraven`s allegation concerning ASP Fan. That is an entirely separate issue altogether, which we will address in a moment when we consider the sufficiency of the evidence against the appellant.
 Statement made on 16 June 2000 - P49 
 
 
 
We now turn to P49. That statement was made by Katheraven soon after his plea of guilt and his conviction by the High Court in the presence of his counsel representing him at the time. Katheraven before the trial judge denied that he made that statement; he admitted only that the signature on the last page of the document was his. Consequently, the prosecution led evidence from ASP Fan and the interpreter, Mohd Ferdhouse, to prove that the statement was made by him. The trial judge was in the end satisfied that the statement, P49, was made by Katheraven.
The trial judge next considered whether there was any requirement to subject the statement to the further proof that Katheraven made it voluntarily, and held that as Katheraven was merely a witness, he saw no necessity for conducting a voire dire to determine the voluntariness of Katheraven in making that statement. He therefore admitted the statement as evidence of the facts stated therein under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. In our opinion, the trial judge was correct.
Mr Sidambaram submits that the statement was pre-prepared and was brought to Katheraven while he was in the lock-up in the Supreme Court immediately after he had pleaded guilty to the charges, that Katheraven signed it out of fear and that he signed the statement even though the contents were false, and that at that time Katheraven would have signed any document placed before him. For this reason, he submits that P49 is unreliable and no weight should be attached to that document.
We note that Mr Sidambaram is not saying that P49 is not admissible in evidence; he is saying that, because it was not given voluntarily by Katheraven, no weight should be given to the statement. On this aspect of the evidence, the trial judge dealt with it at [para ] 68 and 69 of his grounds of judgment where he said: 
 
 
68 At first, Katheraven said that he gave his statement in P49 in fear as he was afraid that something might happen to him. He explained that the investigating officer (`IO`) had told him during the recording of this statement that he would be hanged. Later he retracted his evidence and said that the IO did not say that to him. Katheraven was undoubtedly an unreliable witness in court. 
 
69 As counsel was present when his P49 statement was obtained, I found it hard to accept that he was still fearful of the CNB officers. Moreover, he was no longer in their custody but in the custody of the prison officers by now.
  
 
 
We can find no reason for disturbing this finding of the trial judge. In any case, P49 was not the only statement that implicated the appellant. The appellant has to contend with the two other statements, P29 and P46, which have been admitted in evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act, and which implicated him in similar terms.
 Katheraven`s evidence and his former inconsistent statements 
 
 
 
We now turn to the evidence. In this regard Katheraven`s evidence plays a major role. His evidence in court exonerated the appellant completely from the drug transaction. However, his three statements, P29, P46 and P49, implicated the appellant.
When confronted with the statements, Katheraven proffered various explanations for the contradictions, and he retracted the material parts of the statements which implicated the appellant. He testified that he gave the statement, P29, in fear as the investigating officer told him that he would be hanged. He readily agreed to a suggestion to implicate the appellant as he wanted to save himself from the gallows, and to induce the investigating officer to believe him. He admitted, however, that the investigating officer had not promised him anything in exchange for implicating the appellant. When he was questioned further, he explained that the only reason he subsequently implicated the appellant in P29 was because he was afraid that something might happen to him. When he was pressed further as to why he chose to implicate the appellant, he explained that this was because `he`s my friend` and `[b]ecause he was arrested and taken to MIB with me`.
As regards the statement of facts, P46, he initially admitted, then denied that the statement of facts was read to him when he pleaded guilty to the drug trafficking charges. He admitted that the charges was read to him and that he had pleaded guilty to the charges against him but was not able to remember the subsequent proceedings; specifically, he could not remember whether he had admitted to the statement of facts. When he was asked by the trial judge, he confirmed that whatever he pleaded guilty to or admitted to was done out of fear. However, he conceded that the charges against him were true but asserted that the contents of P46 was untrue. When he was questioned by defence counsel, he agreed to the suggestion that he was prepared to admit to the statement of facts in order to escape the gallows, and was not concerned about the truth of the contents after the charges against him were reduced.
As regards P49, he said that he was confused and did not understand its contents; he simply signed the pre-prepared P49 as he was afraid that the prosecution may appeal against his sentence, but he agreed that this was a wholly self-induced fear. By then, he was not bothered whether what was stated in it was truthful or not and signed the statement as it no longer concerned him.
The material portions of the three statements which implicated the appellant in the drug transaction were substantially similar. It is not necessary to refer to all the three statements in detail. Suffice it here to set out the material part of P29 which is as follows: 
 
 
13 `Thirichi` now works as a lashing worker at the port. Sometime in 1999, I got to know that he has contacts in cannabis as he told me that if there is anybody who wants cannabis, I can contact him and introduce buyers to him. He also told me that he will give me whatever he afford as commission. 
 
14 ... 
 
15 On the day when I was arrested, I called `Thirichi` at about 2 something in the afternoon at his house. I was with `Andrew` in the car and I told `Thirichi` in Tamil that I needed 1 kg of cannabis. He told me to call him back in about 5 minutes time. About 5 minutes later, `Thirichi` called me back at my handphone and asked me to go down to the coffeeshop at Blk 630 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6. He also told me that a man in blue shirt and pants will be at the coffeeshop and I am to tell the person my name. The person will then give me the stuff and I am to hand over the money of $2220. During the conversation with `Thirichi`, he told me the price for the 1 kg of cannabis. The conversation lasted for about 10 to 15 minutes. 
 
16 ...
  
 
 
Later, Katheraven said: 
 
 
17 ... I did told `Andrew` to drive me to Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 and on the way there, I called `Thirichi` instead of `Joe`. I asked `Thirichi` if he had any stuff and I wanted 1 kg of cannabis. `Thirichi` asked me to call him back in 5 minutes time. I called him back again in 5 minutes and told him that I am driving to Ang Mo Kio and asked if the stuff is ready. `Thirichi` then answered that he had already arranged for the stuff and told me that the stuff costs $2220 and asked me to call him again when I reached the carpark of Blk 645 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6. He will then arrange for the Malaysian supplier to deal direct with `Andrew`. I told `Thirichi` that `Andrew` does not want to deal direct with the cannabis supplier. `Thirichi` asked me why `Andrew` was scared and I told him not to worry as `Andrew` is my friend. `Thirichi` then told me to meet a man in blue shirt and trousers at the coffeeshop of Blk 630 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 and identify myself. The man will hand to me the cannabis and I will pay him. However, I told `Thirichi` that the buyer wants to see the stuff and will only pay upon seeing the stuff. `Thirichi` agreed to the payment arrangement and ask me to make sure that the money is paid. 
 
18 After I reached Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, `Andrew` dropped me off at the carpark of Blk 646 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 and I did walk to the coffeeshop at Blk 630 Ang Mo Kio. At the coffeeshop, the Malaysian did use my handphone to call the number 96069940. In the toilet, the Malaysian handed over the block of cannabis to me and as I had said before, I removed the black plastic bag hid the cannabis by tucking it into my trousers. The Malaysian told me that he needed to go out somewhere and asked me to give the money to direct to `Thirichi`. At that time, I was thinking of paging `Thirichi` and paying him the money after I had collected it from `Andrew`.
  
 
 
The trial judge, having considered his evidence and the statements, placed far more weight on the statements than his sworn testimony in court. In determining the weight to be accorded to the statements, the trial judge directed his mind to the factors contemplated in s 147(6) and the guidance provided in the cases of 
Selvarajan James v PP
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 750
 ; 
PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd & Anor
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 158
 (Unreported) 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
 . The trial judge said at [para ] 81: 
 
P29 was a statement made by him fairly contemporaneously, about seven days after the drug transaction in question. P49 and the SOF were given on 16 June 2000 some five months later. Katheraven was consistent throughout that period of five months and never wavered in implicating the accused as the one who arranged for the supply of one kg of cannabis to him. Although the accused might be under considerable strain when giving his statement in P29 after having been arrested for a capital offence, and he might be apprehensive in court when he pleaded guilty and admitted to the SOF, however, I did not find any fear, pressure or intimidation or any motivation that would cause him to falsify an account in P29 of the involvement of his childhood friend in a very serious offence, or to admit to an untrue account in the SOF ... I concluded that Katheraven decided to reveal the accused`s involvement in all his previous statements because that was simply what happened.
 
 
 
Later, after consideration of other aspects of Katheraven`s evidence, the trial judge came to the following conclusion at [para ] 86 and 87: 
 
 
86 I had carefully scrutinsed P29, P49 and the SOF and tested the alleged facts stated therein against the evidence of the CNB officers and the other objective evidence in particular the phone records. I was mindful at all times that he was an accomplice and that he might have an incentive to frame the accused in P29 to minimise his involvement, exculpate himself or to seek leniency in any way he could ... Needless to say, I still exercised caution in taking account of Katheraven`s three inconsistent statements for the truth of their contents. I had carefully considered in detail Katheraven`s explanations for the contradictions between his former statements and his oral testimony, which for the reasons given earlier were wholly unsatisfactory. 
 
87 In court, Katheraven exonerated the accused and retracted all the parts in his statements that implicated the accused to help him. In my judgment, his testimony was highly suspect, if not untruthful.
  
 
 
We agree entirely with the trial judge`s evaluation of Katheraven`s evidence.
 Telephone calls 
 
 
 
The other material evidence against the appellant was the telephone records adduced by the prosecution, which showed the telephone calls made from and to Katheraven`s handphone at the material time. During the time when Sgt Andrew was with Katheraven in the afternoon of 13 January 2000, which was approximately between 3pm and 3.45pm, there was a series of telephone calls made by Katheraven using his handphone (No 97603714). The telephone records showed that four successive outgoing calls were made from Katheraven`s handphone to the appellant`s pager No 96069940 between 3pm and 3.04pm followed by a return call from appellant`s home telephone No 4525161 at 3.05pm. That was about the time when Sgt Andrew was negotiating with Katheraven on the price of 1 kg of cannabis. At 3.13pm there was another call from the appellant`s home which came through Katheraven`s handphone. Following that, Katheraven informed Sgt Andrew that the supplier was about to leave his home. Sgt Andrew and Katheraven arrived at Block 646 Ang Mo Kio Street 61 at about 3.30pm. Katheraven got out of the car and walked towards Block 648 Ang Mo Kio. The telephone records showed that Katheraven`s handphone had been used to page the appellant twice between 3.36pm and 3.40pm. Soon after that time, Katheraven came back to Sgt Andrew and delivered the drugs to the latter, and immediately thereafter he was arrested.
The records further showed that throughout this period, there were no calls to or from anyone, except the appellant, on Katheraven`s handphone. The only person with whom Katheraven was in contact at that time was the appellant. The inference is irresistible that these calls were made in relation to the drug transaction and the appellant was involved in the drug transaction. The appellant did not really deny that these calls were made; he denied that they were made in relation to a drug transaction.
In addition, there were the four telephone calls made by the appellant to Katheraven`s handphone between 7.20pm and 8.09pm on the evening of 13 January 2000, which were answered by Cpl Anan. These telephone calls were not denied by the appellant; he only disputed the contents of their conversations on the telephone. We have related both Cpl Anan`s evidence on the conversations and the appellant`s evidence thereof earlier and it is not necessary to rehearse them here. Suffice it to say that the trial judge rejected appellant`s account of these telephone conversations as unbelievable and contrived. We see no reason to interfere with his findings. The appellant`s versions of their conversations were inherently improbable.
 The appellant`s defence 
 
 
 
The appellant`s defence was that he was innocently caught up in a drug transaction between, on the one hand, Katheraven and, on the other, Joe and Thambi, and was threatened by them into contacting Katheraven and collecting from him the payment for the drugs he had taken. This defence was rejected by the trial judge. The trial judge found that it was inconceivable that Joe and Thambi would hold the appellant liable to pay for the drugs which Katheraven had taken simply because they were friends. They had Katheraven`s number and could have simply called him themselves instead of asking the appellant to do so. There was no compelling reason for the appellant to get involved in the payment for the drugs as he alleged. The trial judge also found that the appellant`s evidence was inherently inconsistent. Further, the trial judge noted that the appellant said that Joe and Thambi did not tell him the type of drugs involved and the amount to be paid; yet the appellant was able to provide these details in his statement to ASP Fan. For our part, we can find nothing in these findings which are wrong. On the contrary, they are plainly correct.
In our judgment, the evidence against the appellant was overwhelming, and the trial judge`s finding that the charge against the appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt was fully supported by the evidence. We agree with his finding. We therefore dismiss the appeal.

: The plaintiff, Madam Vasuhi d/o Ramasamypillai, whose husband died of a heart attack, sued the defendants (hereinafter referred to as `TTSH`) for negligence in the treatment of her husband`s heart condition. TTSH denied any negligence on the part of their doctors and maintained that they provided the deceased with proper treatment for his condition.
 Background 
 
 
 
Madam Vasuhi`s husband, Karunanithi s/o K Kalandavelu (hereinafter referred to as `the deceased`), a security guard, had a long history of heart trouble, asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus. He suffered a heart attack in 1984. He had a second heart attack on 1 August 1997 and was warded in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
The deceased took a number of tests while he was in the hospital. On 5 August 1997, a signal average ECG was done. This showed a high risk of ventricular tarchicardia and ventricular fibrillation. An echocardiogram was done on 7 August 1997. This revealed that the deceased`s left ventricular function was severely impaired and that the estimated ejection fraction was only 21%, a worrying result when compared to the ejection fraction of a healthy heart. Finally, a sub-maximal exercise stress test was done on 7 August 1997. During this test, the deceased achieved his predicted heart rate without complaining of chest pain and the test was discontinued because of fatigue. After evaluating these tests and the deceased`s overall condition, Dr Alfred Cheng, the head of TTSH`s Department of Cardiology and the Director of their Coronary Care Unit, discharged the deceased on 8 August 1997, pending a further evaluation of his condition. It was arranged that he return to the hospital one month later for a review of his condition and for a maximal exercise stress test to be conducted. In addition, a coronary angiogram was scheduled for late October 1997.
Upon his discharge, the deceased was given medicine for his condition. He was prescribed aspirin to inhibit platelet aggregation, sorbitrate to improve blood flow to his heart muscles and captopril to improve his heart function. He was also provided with GTN tablets, which were to be taken if he had chest pains. He was advised that if he had any chest pain, he was to take the GTN tablet and proceed immediately to the Accident and Emergency Department of the hospital. Unfortunately, the deceased suffered a fatal heart attack in the early morning of 16 August 1997.
 The plaintiff`s case 
 
 
 
Madam Vasuhi contended that the deceased died because he was not given proper and appropriate treatment expected of responsible and reasonably competent doctors. In her statement of claim, she made the following allegations: 
(a) TTSH`s doctors failed to consider and administer thrombolytic therapy to the deceased. 
(b) TTSH`s doctors failed to consider and omitted to note that the deceased had an earlier heart attack and thus failed to recognise that the deceased had an increased risk of another severe heart attack. 
(c) TTSH`s doctors failed to consider the risk of an exercise stress test so soon after a heart attack and erroneously relied on the result of an incomplete exercise stress test. 
(d) TTSH`s doctors failed to note that the deceased may have had some on-going ischaemia which required intervention to prevent another heart attack. 
(e) TTSH`s doctors failed to arrange for a coronary angiogram prior to discharging the deceased to determine the appropriate measures to be taken, such as by-pass surgery. 
(f) TTSH`s doctors failed to advise the deceased and/or his family of the urgency of a coronary angiography even though an echocardiography showed that the deceased`s condition was serious. 
(g) TTSH`s doctors failed to arrange for the deceased to take other tests and investigations.
Experts` views on whether a coronary angiogram should have been performed before the deceased was discharged
Madam Vasuhi contended that the deceased was such a critically ill patient that he should not have been discharged on 8 August 1997 without the benefit of a coronary angiogram. Her case was summed up by her counsel, Ms Seenivasan Lalita, in paras 65 and 66 of her written submissions in the following terms: 
 
It is therefore submitted that the deceased would not have died if Dr Alfred Cheng had done a coronary angiography prior to discharge where he would have seen how bad the condition of the deceased`s heart was. The coronary angiography would have shown that the deceased was not fit for discharge. He would have to be kept on Heparin and scheduled for by-pass surgery.
 
 
 
As the deceased would have been in the care and under close observation of the hospital he would not have suffered the fatal heart attack.
 
 
 
Madam Vasuhi`s expert witness, Dr Leo Mahar, the Director of Cardiology at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, said that there was a strong possibility that the deceased had on-going ischaemia and that he required an urgent coronary angiogram. Dr Mahar added that he would have scheduled such an angiogram within a week after the deceased`s admission to the hospital. In para 15 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he opined as follows: 
 
My view is that someone of his age should be given the maximum opportunity and that would include early investigation and intervention therapy if indicated. There was a need to conduct a fairly urgent angiography as the deceased had at least two vessel coronary artery disease and was known to have poor left ventricular function.
 
 
 
TTSH`s expert witnesses, Professor Lim Yean Leng (hereinafter referred to as `Professor Lim`), the Director of the National Heart Centre, and Associate Professor Lim Yean Teng (hereinafter referred to as `Assoc Prof Lim`), the Chief and Senior Consultant Cardiologist at the National University Hospital, did not agree with Dr Mahar that there was a strong possibility that the deceased had on-going ischaemia or that an urgent coronary angiogram was called for.
Like Dr Cheng, both Professor Lim and Assoc Prof Lim took the view that what the deceased required was an elective coronary angiogram and not an urgent coronary angiogram. The difference between an urgent coronary angiogram and an elective coronary angiogram was explained by Professor Lim in the following terms: 
 
In cardiology, we talk of immediate or urgent (as soon as possible or a matter of days). If not, we talk of elective or delayed. The length of the delay depends on the category of patients.
 
 
 
Dr Cheng, who said that the deceased did not have signs of on-going ischaemia, explained that he contemplated an urgent coronary angiogram for the deceased on 14 August 1997. However, after evaluating the deceased`s case, he thought that an elective angiogram was more appropriate than an urgent angiogram. In para 16 of his affidavit of evidence-in chief, he explained: 
 
In view of the results of the negative submaximal exercise stress test and the lack of any other clinical indications or symptoms such as continuing chest pain, there was no clinical indication for early coronary angiography for the deceased. Hence, I scheduled the deceased for elective coronary angiography at the Singapore General Hospital, which was then fixed for 23 October 1997, which was the next available date.
 
 
 
Professor Lim, who endorsed Dr Cheng`s view that the deceased required an elective coronary angiogram, made it clear that he would not have required an urgent angiogram to be performed if the deceased had been his patient. When cross-examined, he said as follows: 
 
 
Q: ... [W]ould you have considered this patient a candidate for an urgent angiogram? 
 
A: If the emphasis is on the word `urgent`, the answer is `no` but on the possibility of helping the patient further, an angiogram will help. With the record presented with the patient having no subjective symptoms of ischaemia, usually pain, and no clear cut evidence of ischaemia, there is no urgency to proceed with an angiogram. The decision made in this case was for an elective angiogram. 
 This was appropriate 
. 
 
Q: For this patient, you would not have arranged for an urgent angiogram? 
 
A: In this case, the patient is post-infarct, a specific group. He was kept seven days in the hospital. This is the usual practice for uncomplicated cases, ie those with no further chest pain, no failure or dangerous electrical arrythmia. Then, we investigate the further management strategy. 
 The deceased was a patient for an elective angiogram. I would not have arranged for an immediate angiogram 
. [Emphasis added.]
  
 
 
Professor Lim stood his ground when it was pointed out to him that the deceased had an ejection fraction of only 21%. When cross-examined, he answered as follows: 
 
 
Q: This patient had two heart attacks, congestive failure on the third day, electrical instability, an ejection fraction of 21% and an inconclusive sub-maximal test. Based on these, I put it to you that the patient should have been given an earliest angiogram. 
 
A: If this patient is stable with no symptomatic angina or ischaemia and his heart failure has been treated, he is managed as a stable patient to be discharged for further management. 
 I agree with the management of his case 
. [Emphasis added.]
  
 
 
Assoc Prof Lim, who also took the view that the deceased showed no signs of on-going ischaemia that warranted an urgent angiogram, said as follows during cross-examination: 
 
 
Q: The reasons why an angiogram should have been done include two heart attacks complicated by heart failure on the third day, uninterpretable stress test results ... 
 
A: These are reasons why an angiogram needs to be done but do not qualify for an urgent angiogram ie before the patient can be sent home. Urgency depends on whether the patient has spontaneous or inducible ischaemia. There was no such evidence in this case.
  
 
 
Assoc Prof Lim also rejected the contention that the results of the echocardiography performed on 7 August 1997 should have alerted Dr Cheng that an urgent coronary angiogram was required. When cross-examined, he said as follows: 
 
 
Q: After the echocardiograph report, he should not have been discharged? 
 
A: The timing of the angiogram is not determined by the result of the echocardiograph. It identifies a high risk patient and we want to study further. But the timing of the angiogram becomes more urgent if the patient has evidence of inducible or spontaneous myocardial ischaemia. In this case, there was no such evidence. 
 Notwithstanding the echocardiograph report, I would have discharged the patient 
. [Emphasis is added.]
  
 
 
 
 
 Experts` views on whether there were sufficient grounds for the deceased to be discharged on 8 August 1997 
 
 
 
 
 
As both Professor Lim and Assoc Prof Lim thought that the deceased did not require an urgent angiogram, their view that TTSH had sufficient grounds for discharging the deceased on 8 August 1997 report, will next be considered.
Dr Cheng, who discharged the deceased from hospital, explained that while the deceased was ill, his condition was not such as to warrant his continued hospitalisation pending the taking of further tests. He pointed out that by 8 August 1997, the deceased did not have any chest pain and his blood pressure was satisfactory. His lungs were also clear. There were no ECG changes during the sub-maximal stress test and the deceased achieved 75% of his predicted heart rate without any chest pain during the said stress test. In his considered opinion, there was no indication of on-going myocardial ischaemia. As such, the patient was clinically stable and could be discharged from hospital.
Dr Cheng`s decision to discharge the deceased on 8 August 1997 was endorsed by Professor Lim, who accepted that there was a possibility that the deceased had on-going ischaemia but stressed that this did not mean that the patient could not be discharged. During cross-examination, he explained: 
 
 
Q: Was it acceptable practice to discharge him? 
 
A: With no subjective evidence of ischaemia, it is acceptable practice to discharge him. This may be regarded as conservative management ... 
 
Q: You said there was a possibility that the deceased had ischaemia? 
 
A: Everyone can have this. A person with a heart attack has a higher possibility of ischaemia.
  
 
 
Admittedly, Professor Lim would not have placed much reliance on the sub-maximal stress test results. However, his evidence should be read in its proper context as he made it absolutely clear that he would have discharged the deceased without putting him through a sub-maximal exercise stress test on 7 August 1997.
As for Dr Mahar`s view that the sub-maximal exercise stress test results could not be interpreted and should not have been relied upon for the purpose of deciding whether or not it was safe to discharge the deceased, Assoc Prof Lim endorsed Dr Cheng`s view that the results could be interpreted. In paras 5 and 6 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Assoc Prof Lim said as follows: 
 
 
5 It is recommended practice for a cardiac patient to undergo a sub-maximal stress test for risk stratification purposes and the test is designed to continue until the patient achieves 75% of his expected maximum heart rate or until the onset of symptoms. This was done for the deceased on 7 August 1997. 
 
6 The results of the sub-maximal exercise stress test show that there was no inducible ischaemia and this would indicate that the deceased was safe for discharge. It is wrong to suggest that there was anything significant in the raised ST segments of the ECG. This is not unexpected for patients who have had a Q-wave heart attack. In these patients, it is only when the ST segments are depressed during the exercise stress test or there are onset of ischaemia symptoms would it indicate that there is inducible ischaemia.
  
 
 
Assoc Prof Lim agreed that it was safe for the deceased to be discharged on 8 August 1997. Indeed, after reviewing the position taken by Dr Cheng in the treatment and discharge of the deceased, Assoc Prof Lim concluded that the management of the deceased was well within accepted practice.
 Experts` views on when the elective angiogram should have been performed 
 
 
 
If what the deceased required was an elective coronary angiogram and not an urgent coronary angiogram, a question arises as to whether the elective coronary angiogram should have been performed before the deceased died on 16 August 1997, eight days after he was discharged from the hospital.
The deceased`s elective coronary angiogram was scheduled for 23 October 1997. Dr Cheng explained that while the waiting time for an elective coronary angiogram is presently very much shorter than in 1997 because TTSH now have their own angiography facilities, it ought to be noted that in 1997, TTSH did not have in-house facilities for angiography and their patients had to be sent to the Singapore General Hospital for a coronary angiogram to be performed. He testified that while an urgent coronary angiogram could have been performed immediately in 1997, the waiting list in that year for an elective angiogram was about two months. Hence, the deceased`s coronary angiogram was scheduled for 23 October 1997, which was the next available date for such an angiogram.
All three expert witnesses thought that the date given to the deceased for his coronary angiogram was rather late although Professor Lim and Assoc Prof Lim conceded that they had no knowledge of the logistics involved in arranging for such an angiogram for TTSH`s patients in 1997.
Professor Lim said that he would not have scheduled a coronary angiogram for the deceased too soon after his heart attack on 1 August 1997. This is because the benefits of such an angiogram must be balanced against the risks of an early coronary angiogram. He said that unless an urgent angiogram was required, it would be preferable to give the deceased`s heart some time to repair itself after the heart attack of 1 August 1997. During cross-examination, he explained as follows: 
 
 
Q: When would you have done the elective angiogram? 
 
A: There is a small additional risk of complications following a mild heart attack in this group of patients versus someone who has not had a heart attack. This risk arises because of recently damaged areas of the heart. The damaged areas can rupture, clot and are electrically more irritable. In the past, unless you had good reasons, you try not to do an angiogram during this period. Nowadays, we are prepared for an angiogram even during a heart attack. By the 1980s, we can do an angiogram and angioplasty during the said period where the benefits outweigh the risks. 
 However, all things being equal, you try not to give a patient an additional risk 
. [Emphasis is added.]
  
 
 
Professor Lim said that if the deceased had been his patient, he would have scheduled the elective coronary angiogram some two to three weeks after the deceased`s second heart attack on 1 August 1997. He added that if there had been a waiting list, the coronary angiogram would have been performed in three weeks.
Dr Mahar opined that the view that one should allow two to three weeks for a damaged heart to heal before performing a coronary angiogram is no longer held in Australia and the United States. However, Professor Lim maintained that in the absence of conditions warranting an urgent coronary angiogram, he would prefer to let a patient`s heart have two to three weeks to heal after a heart attack before having a coronary angiogram performed.
Assoc Prof Lim also agreed that an acceptable date for the elective coronary angiogram to be performed in this case would have been two to three weeks after the heart attack on 1 August 1997.
 The Bolam test 
 
 
 
A discussion of the duty of a doctor to a patient ought to begin with a consideration of the 
 Bolam 
 test, which was stated by McNair J in 
Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee
 
[1957] 2 All ER 118
[1957] 1 WLR 582
, in the following terms: 
 
I myself would prefer to put it this way: A doctor is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art ... Putting it the other way round, a doctor is not negligent, if he is acting in accordance with such a practice, merely because there is a body of opinion that takes a contrary view.
 
 
 
The 
 Bolam 
 test has been subject to much scrutiny, and especially so, in recent times. (See, for instance, 
Hucks v Cole
 
[1993] 4 Med LR 393
, a decision of the English Court of Appeal, 
Edward Wong Finance Co v Johnson Stokes & Master
 
[1984] AC 1296
, a decision of the Privy Council, and 
Rogers v Whitaker
 
[1992] 175 CLR 479
, a decision of the High Court of Australia.) All the same, in 
Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority
 
[1998] AC 232
[1997] 4 All ER 771
, the 
 Bolam 
 test was accepted by the House of Lords as `[t]he locus classicus of the test for the standard of care required of a doctor or any other person professing some skill or competence`.
In the face of widely differing views from medical experts, it would be appropriate to bear in mind the following words of Lord Scarman in 
Maynard v West Midlands Regional Health Authority
 
[1985] 1 All ER 635
[1984] 1 WLR 634
: 
 
I do not think that the words of the Lord President (Clyde) in 
 Hunter v Hanley
 1955 SLT 213 at 217 can be bettered:
 
 
 
`In the realm of diagnosis and treatment there is ample scope for genuine difference of opinion and one man clearly is not negligent merely because his conclusion differs from that of other professional men ... The true test for establishing negligence in diagnosis or treatment on the part of a doctor is whether he has been proved to be guilty of such failure as no doctor of ordinary skill would be guilty of if acting with ordinary care ...`
 
 
 
... Differences of opinion and practice exist, and will always exist, in the medical as in other professions. There is seldom any one answer exclusive of all others to problems of professional judgment. A court may prefer one body of opinion to the other, but that is no basis for a conclusion of negligence.
 
 
 
It does not follow that a defendant doctor or hospital will avoid liability for negligent treatment merely because there is evidence from a number of medical experts to the effect that the treatment accorded to a patient accords with what other doctors might have done. In 
 Bolitho 
 (supra), Lord Browne-Wilkinson put the matter in its proper perspective when he said as follows (at 
[1998] AC 232
, 241-242; [1997] 4 All ER 771, 778): 
 
In the 
 Bolam
 case itself, McNair J [1957] 1 WLR 583, 587 stated that the defendant had to have acted in accordance with the practice accepted as proper by a `responsible body of medical men` ... [T]he court has to be satisfied that the exponents of the body of opinion relied upon can demonstrate that such opinion has a logical basis. In particular, in cases involving, as they so often do, the weighing of risks against benefits, the judge before accepting a body of opinion as being responsible, reasonable or respectable, will need to be satisfied that, in forming their views, the experts have directed their minds to the question of comparative risks and benefits and have reached a defensible conclusion on the matter.
 
 
 
In 
Hucks v Cole
 
[1993] 4 Med LR 393
, the Court of Appeal accepted that a defendant doctor was negligent in failing to treat with penicillin a patient who was suffering from septic places on her skin though he knew them to contain organisms capable of leading to puerperal fever despite the fact that a number of distinguished doctors gave evidence that they would not, in the circumstances, have treated the patient with penicillin. In that case, Sachs LJ pointed out at p 397 that where the evidence shows that a lacuna in professional practice exists by which risks of grave danger are knowingly taken, then, however small the risk, the court must anxiously examine that lacuna, and particularly so if the risk can be easily and inexpensively avoided. His Lordship added that if the court finds, on an analysis of the reasons given for not taking those precautions that, in the light of current professional knowledge, there is no proper basis for the lacuna, and that it is definitely not reasonable that those risks should have been taken, its function is to state that fact and where necessary to state that it constitutes negligence. His Lordship had no doubt that in such a case, the practice will be altered for the benefit of patients.
It ought to be noted that a judge should not be too quick to substitute his opinion for that of medical experts. In 
 Bolitho 
 (supra), Lord Browne-Wilkinson cautioned against such speed when he said as follows (at 
[1998] AC 232
, 243; [1997] 4 All ER 771, 779): 
 
I emphasise that in my view it will very seldom be right for a judge to reach the conclusion that views genuinely held by a competent medical expert are unreasonable. The assessment of medical risks and benefits is a matter of clinical judgment which a judge would not normally be able to make without expert evidence ... [I]t would be wrong to allow such assessment to deteriorate into seeking to persuade the judge to prefer one of two views both of which are capable of being logically supported. It is only where a judge can be satisfied that the body of expert opinion cannot be logically supported at all that such opinion will not provide the benchmark by reference to which the defendant`s conduct falls to be assessed.
 
 
 
 
 
 My findings 
 
 
 
 
 
When closely examined, Madam Vasuhi`s case rests mainly on the assertion that TTSH`s doctors failed to realise that the deceased was a high risk patient for whom conservative treatment was inappropriate and that TTSH`s doctors were negligent when they failed to perform a coronary angiogram before discharging the deceased on 8 August 1997.
Some of Madam Vasuhi`s allegations of negligence can be dismissed at the outset. To begin with, the complaint that TTSH`s doctors failed to administer thrombolytic therapy to the deceased is without cause. Such therapy, which involves the intravenous injection of a drug into a patient`s blood stream to dissolve blood clots that may be occluding the coronary arteries, may not help a patient such as the deceased, who was admitted to the hospital more than 11 hours after the onset of chest pain. Heart muscle which has been deprived of blood supply for more than 11 hours would probably be necrotic and the restoration of blood flow would not be beneficial. Besides, the blood clots, if any, would be much more difficult to dissolve. The potentially serious and even life-threatening effects of such therapy, including the risk of stroke and haemorrhage, must be balanced against the minimal benefits to such a patient. It is for the doctor managing the case to decide whether or not to administer thrombolytic therapy and in the circumstances of this case, TTSH cannot be faulted for not administering the said therapy to the deceased.
Madam Vasuhi`s second assertion, namely, that TTSH`s doctors failed to note that the deceased had an earlier heart attack in 1984, is baseless as it was evident that TTSH`s doctors knew that they were treating a patient who has had a previous heart attack. The previous heart attack had been recorded at the time of admission and in the medical case-notes after the deceased was hospitalised.
Madam Vasuhi`s next assertion that TTSH`s doctors failed to consider the risk of an exercise stress test so soon after his heart attack must also be rejected. It was not alleged that the stress test in question caused or was a contributory cause of the deceased`s death. In any case, Dr Mahar did not say that it was wrong for the sub-maximal exercise stress test to have been carried out on 7 August 1997. He merely said that the results of this test were uninterpretable.
Madam Vasuhi`s assertion that an electrophysiology study and a nuclear scan should have been done is also groundless. Dr Mahar accepted that an electrophysiology study would not have shed much light on whether or not the deceased had on-going ischaemia. As for a nuclear scan, it appears that, as a general rule, the next stage of inquiry for a patient such as the deceased is a coronary angiogram and not a nuclear scan.
As for the suggestion that the use of an implantable defibrillator could have been considered, it was not the practice to use implantable defibrillators in 1997.
If the unsubstantiated allegations of negligence referred to above are left aside, whether or not TTSH are liable to Madam Vasuhi for the death of her husband depends on the answers to the following questions: 
(a) Was it proper for the deceased to be discharged on 8 August 1997? 
(b) If it was proper, was the deceased`s death caused by any unjustifiable delay on the part of TTSH`s doctors to arrange an elective coronary angiogram for him?
On the evidence, I am satisfied that it has not been established that Dr Cheng was negligent in deciding on an elective coronary angiogram for the deceased. While Dr Mahar would have arranged for an urgent coronary angiogram for the deceased, Prof Lim, Assoc Prof Lim and Dr Cheng furnished sound and very acceptable reasons for adopting the view that an elective coronary angiogram was what the deceased required.
As Dr Cheng was entitled to take the view that the deceased did not require an urgent coronary angiogram, Madam Vasuhi`s complaint that he failed to inform the deceased or his family members that the deceased required an urgent coronary angiogram or that an urgent coronary angiogram could have been performed at an earlier date at another medical establishment must be dismissed.
I am also satisfied that Dr Cheng was not negligent in relying on the available test results and on his own assessment of the deceased`s condition for the purpose of deciding whether or not to discharge the deceased from the hospital on 8 August 1997. It was alleged that Dr Cheng did not have all the facts before him when he discharged the deceased from the hospital. In particular, she alleged that Dr Cheng did not review the echocardiogram report of 7 August 1997 before discharging the deceased. She pointed out that Dr Cheng had wrongly stated the date of the echocardiogram as 11 August 1997 in, inter alia, his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. Dr Cheng explained that the error was a typographical error. He said that he must have seen the echocardiogram report because its findings were mentioned in the Inpatient Discharge Summary dated 8 August 1997. I believe Dr Cheng and hence, this matter need not be considered any further.
The criticism that Dr Cheng relied primarily on the sub-maximal exercise stress test for the purpose of deciding whether or not to discharge the deceased has not been overlooked. Dr Cheng denied that he based his decision to discharge the deceased primarily on the results of the sub-maximal exercise stress test. When cross-examined, he said as follows: 
 
 
Q: You relied primarily on the sub-maximal stress test when discharging him. 
 
A: No. I made an assessment of the patient`s suitability for discharge from hospital on the basis of his clinical condition, his symptoms or lack of them, clinical examination, supported by investigations such as the exercise stress test. Other tests would be taken into consideration such as the echocardiogram and the signal averaged ECG. Based on all these, I decided to discharge him.
  
 
 
As for the assertion that the sub-maximal exercise stress test results should not have been relied on because the test was incomplete, Dr Cheng explained that this was not true. In para 14 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he stated as follows: 
 
[I]t is not correct to suggest that the stress test was incomplete. The sub-maximal exercise stress test is meant to be terminated at 70-75 per cent of the predicted maximal heart rate or the onset of symptoms. Based on the ECG readings, the deceased achieved a total exercise time of 9 minutes and 33 seconds and reached a heart rate of about 76% of his age predicted heart rate.
 
 
 
During the exercise stress test, the deceased did not develop any chest pain and there was no significant ST segment depression which would have indicated evidence of significant myocardial ischaemia.
 
 
 
As it has not been established that Dr Cheng was negligent in discharging the deceased on 8 August 1997 or in deciding that the deceased did not require an urgent angiogram, the only remaining question is whether the deceased`s death was caused by any delay on the part of TTSH in arranging for the elective coronary angiogram.
As has been mentioned, Dr Cheng scheduled the deceased`s coronary angiogram for 23 October 1997. Whether or not TTSH should have arranged for the deceased`s elective coronary angiogram to be performed at an earlier date, it should be borne in mind that in 
 Bolitho 
 (supra), the House of Lords reiterated that where a breach of a duty of care is proved or admitted, the burden still lies on the plaintiff to prove that such breach caused the injury suffered.
In 
 Bolitho 
`s case, a child who had respiratory trouble was admitted to hospital. On the following day, his breathing deteriorated at 12.40pm and a nurse summoned the doctor in charge of his case by telephone. The doctor did not turn up but the child recovered. However, at 2pm, he suffered another bout of acute respiratory difficulty. The nurse reported this to the doctor by telephone. The doctor again did not turn up. The child apparently recovered and looked much better after a while. At 2.30pm, the child collapsed due to a failure of his respiratory system, as a result of which he had a cardiac arrest. By the time, his respiratory and cardiac functions were restored, the child had sustained severe brain damage. Eventually, the child died and his parents sued the health authority for damages for negligence. The trial judge held that the doctor had been in breach of duty in failing to attend to the child when summoned by the nurse. Negligence having been established, the question of causation had to be determined. The issue before the court was whether the cardiac arrest would have been avoided if the doctor in charge or any suitable deputy had attended to the child at an earlier stage. It was common ground that intubation so as to provide an airway in any event would have ensured that the respiratory failure which occurred did not lead to cardiac arrest and that such intubation would have had to be carried out before the final episode of respiratory failure. Five experts gave evidence that after the second episode of respiratory failure, any competent doctor would have intubated. On the other hand, the defendants` experts took a different view. One of them testified that the child`s symptoms did not show a progressive respiratory collapse and there was only a small risk of total respiratory failure, a small risk which had to be balanced against submitting the child to the invasive procedure of intubation, which was not a routine risk-free process. In the face of such conflicting expert evidence with respect to whether intubation should have been done, the trial judge accepted that it had not been established that the defendants` admitted breach of duty had caused the catastrophe to the child. His decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal [1994] 1 Med LR 381. The plaintiff`s appeal to the House of Lords was dismissed. Lord Browne-Wikinson said that it could not be suggested that it was illogical for the defendants` expert witness to favour running a small risk of total respiratory collapse rather than to submit the child to the invasive procedure of intubation.
It is clear from 
 Bolitho 
`s case that even if it is accepted that in the present case, the deceased should have been given an earlier date for an elective coronary angiogram, it must be established that the deceased`s death was caused by the delay. As has been mentioned, both Prof Lim and Assoc Prof Lim testified that if the deceased had been their patient, they would have arranged for his elective coronary angiogram to be performed some two to three weeks after his heart attack on 1 August 1997, which is sometime between the middle of August 1997 and one week thereafter.
It must be stressed that what is crucial is not what Professor Lim or Assoc Prof Lim might themselves have done but whether or not they furnished sound and acceptable reasons for their suggested timing for the deceased`s elective coronary angiogram to be performed. In this regard, both of them provided cogent reasons as to why it was preferable for the elective coronary angiogram to be performed some two to three weeks after the deceased`s heart attack on 1 August 1997. I thus accept that TTSH cannot be faulted even if the elective coronary angiogram for the deceased had been scheduled for the third week of August 1997.
Regrettably, the deceased passed away during the early morning of 16 August 1997, only eight days after his discharge from the hospital. As such, even if the logistics of arranging an elective angiogram for TTSH`s patients in 1997 are not taken into account, the fact remains that the deceased died well before the acceptable deadline for TTSH to send him for an elective coronary angiogram. Professor Lim summed up the position as follows in his letter dated 19 December 2000 to the Chairman of the Medical Board of the defendant hospital: 
 
The patient suffered a cardiac arrest eight days after he was discharged. With the results of the investigations prior to discharge, 
 I personally would not have arranged for a diagnostic coronary angiogram to be performed within these eight days
. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
As the deceased died before the expiry of the period within which TTSH may be expected to have arranged for him to have an elective coronary angiogram, it cannot be said that TTSH`s delay in arranging the angiogram in question was a cause of the deceased`s death. In fact, Professor Lim went so far as to say that even if the elective coronary angiogram had been performed on 14 August 1997, he would, on the basis of the findings in the autopsy report, not have kept the deceased in hospital after the angiogram. Neither would he, without more, have, as Dr Mahar suggested, prescribed heparin for the deceased while further investigations were being conducted. During cross-examination, he said as follows: 
 
 
Q: If an angiogram had been done on 14 August 1997, you would have admitted him to hospital? 
 
A: No. A person reading it will say that this person may benefit from surgery. There will be a long consultative process. No heparin will be prescribed unless his condition is unstable. Whether this patient is unstable depends on chest pains and objective symptoms of angina. This patient is a post-infarct 14-day patient. 
 
Q: If an angiogram had been done on 14 August 1997, it would have shown the condition of the heart as in the autopsy report? 
 
A: Yes but he could still have died on the 16th from ruptured haemorrhagic plaque ... This would be so even with heparin.
  
 
 
In view of my finding that the deceased`s death was not caused by any delay on the part of TTSH in arranging an elective coronary angiogram for him, it is unnecessary for me to consider the lengthy arguments raised by both parties as to whether a heart by-pass operation would have benefited the deceased. All the same, it ought to be noted that on this issue, the experts were sharply divided. While Dr Mahar was more optimistic about the benefits of such an operation for the deceased, both Professor Lim and Assoc Prof Lim said that the additional tests required before a decision on such an operation can be made could not have been completed before the deceased died on 16 August 1997. Assoc Prof Lim added that revascularisation surgery for the deceased would have been highly risky because of his poor left ventricular systolic function and the fact that he had systemic lupus erythematosus.
In the final analysis, whether or not the approach of TTSH`s doctors to the treatment of the deceased is acceptable depends on whether or not a conservative approach to the treatment of the deceased was justified. Given the circumstances of the case, it has not been established that the approach adopted by TTSH`s doctors was wrong. Madam Vasuhi`s claim against TTSH is thus dismissed with costs.

: This was an appeal only on sentence. After hearing the appellant`s counsel and the DPP, I allowed the appeal and reduced the appellant`s sentence from 15 to nine months` imprisonment. I now give my reasons.
 Salient facts 
 
 
 
The appellant pleaded guilty in the court below to one charge of committing criminal breach of trust (`CBT`) of a sum of $10,485.22 while being employed as a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
The agreed statement of facts which the appellant admitted to without qualification revealed that he was employed as a sales representative of Chin Bee Trading between 30 November 1998 and 1 July 2000. During this time, he was entrusted with making sales of provisions and collecting cash from his erstwhile employer`s various customers. Between 31 January 2000 and 1 July 2000, he collected various sums of money totalling $10,485.22 from 21 of his then employer`s customers, but he failed to hand over the money to the company`s cashier as he should have done. He was arrested on 6 November 2000 on which occasion he promptly admitted to having misappropriated the money.
The appellant was unrepresented in the court below. In mitigation, he said that he was the sole breadwinner of his family and asked for leniency.
In sentencing the district judge took into account the appellant`s plea of guilt as well as his lack of antecedents. He noted, however, that no restitution had been made by the appellant nor did he indicate that he was able to make restitution. Upon a consideration of all the factors, the district judge sentenced him to 15 months` imprisonment.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Before me, his counsel`s main grouse was the complaint that the district judge had not informed the appellant of the significance and relevance of restitution to his sentence. The argument ran that, as the appellant was unrepresented in the court below, it was the duty of the district judge to inform the appellant of the role of restitution in sentencing, and then to ask if he intended to make such restitution. The district judge`s failure to instruct the appellant in this regard, counsel urged, rendered his consideration of the lack of restitution as a factor in passing sentence erroneous.
I found counsel`s arguments in this regard to be simply untenable. The contention that it was the duty of the district judge to educate the appellant of the manifold factors that play a part in the exercise of sentencing discretion strikes at the very root of the independence of the trial judge as an impartial umpire. I had declared this to be the position in 
Rajeevan Edakalavan v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 815
 , the pertinent facts of which were similar to those in the present case, and I reiterate the views I had stated therein that: 
 
[i]t is not the duty of the judge to inform the accused of the defences or other options that may be open to him and advantageous to his case. That is the duty of the counsel who is appointed to defend him in court, if the accused so chooses to be represented. The onus does not shift to the judge (or the prosecution, for that matter) simply because the accused is unrepresented. That will be placing too onerous a burden on the judge. Furthermore, the judge will be performing two completely incompatible and irreconcilable roles - one as the adjudicator, the other as the de facto defence counsel. The judge`s position of impartiality and independence will be gravely undermined. There will evidently be a conflict of interest and an issue of bias ([para ] 22).
 
 
 
In my opinion, the above statement of the law applied with equal force to the present case. While 
 Rajeevan 
`s case concerned the duty of a judge vis-.-vis unrepresented accused persons with respect to the substantive offence and thus the plea of guilt itself, there is nothing to prevent the same principles from being applied at the sentencing stage as well. The judge`s role, at any stage of the process, is always to serve as an independent and unbiased adjudicator, a role which he would be hard placed to discharge if he had to proffer or extend his own legal advice to either of the parties before the court. It is pertinent that justice not only be done, but be seen to be done and the latter I find would be impossible to achieve if judges were burdened with the added duty of advising accused persons of every possible defence strategy.
This view is supported by art 9(3) of the Constitution which states that every accused person has the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. That an accused person chooses not to exercise this right cannot have the effect of shifting the burden of his defence onto the judge whose task can conflict with that of the defence. Indeed, this is precisely the reason why arguments that an accused person was ignorant of this or that point of law and thus prejudiced because he or she was unrepresented have not been well received in previous cases: see eg 
Packir Malim v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 429
  and 
Virgie Rizza V Leong v PP
 (Unreported) . If an accused person voluntarily chooses not to avail himself of his constitutional right to an advocate, it cannot be that the judge`s duty towards him then suddenly becomes more arduous than it would have been had counsel been appointed, for an unfair advantage would then accrue to accused persons who do not consult their own lawyers. Indeed, to accept counsel`s submissions in this case would create an incentive for accused persons not to instruct their own lawyers, knowing that they can depend on the judge for legal advice, with the latter`s failure to do so then amounting to easy grounds for an appeal. Further, there is the added difficulty of where one should draw the line should such a duty be held to exist for the question then arises as to how much and to what degree of detail of the law the judge should seek to impart to the accused before he may be said to have discharged his duty adequately. Certainly where the plea of guilt itself is concerned, the duty of the judge has always been to ensure that the plea is valid and unequivocal, that the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea and that the accused intends to admit without qualification to the offence alleged against him. But this duty on the part of the judge exists irrespective and regardless of whether or not the accused is represented and more importantly, does not impugn on the judge`s function as an objective referee. Simply to ensure that an accused person understands the nature and consequence of his plea or that the facts are admitted to without qualification do not carry any risk of unfairness or prejudice for the judge is there merely seeking to satisfy himself that all the elements of the charge have been made out. On the other hand the same cannot be said of the further duty to advise an accused person of possible defences or factors that play a part in sentencing for the danger of bias then becomes a very real possibility. As a result, such an extended duty ought not be held to exist concurrently, for the task of lending advice is one which has traditionally been and should rightfully be reserved for defence counsel alone. It is simply absurd to expect that a judge should in every case be burdened with the duty of ascertaining from the accused whether he would like to make restitution, and, if so, if he would like his sentencing to be adjourned until such further date that he has completed making his restitution! Indeed I find it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for a judge who had previously so advised an accused person to be perceived as having meted out a fair sentence when one is eventually passed.
In the light of the above reasons, I found that there was no duty on the district judge in this case to advise the appellant of the significance or relevance of restitution in sentencing. As such, the failure by the judge to do so did not vitiate the subsequent discretion exercised by him in passing sentence. In any event, the fact in this case remained that the appellant had, up to the time of the hearing in the court below, failed to make any restitution of the misappropriated moneys whatsoever. It will be recalled that he left the company`s employ on 1 July 2000 and was not arrested until more than four months later in November. Throughout this time, he failed to effect any restitution whether partial or full, as a result of which I could only infer that he felt little or no compunction or remorse for his misdeeds during that time. In 
Krishan Chand v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 291
 , it was said that the fact of restitution goes to some extent towards showing remorse, genuine good character and reformation on the part of the offender. Restitution made voluntarily before the commencement of criminal proceedings or in its earliest stages thus carries a higher mitigating value for it shows that the offender is genuinely sorry for his mistake. On the other hand, where the sole motive for restitution is the hope or expectation of obtaining a lighter punishment, then the fact of restitution must be of little mitigating value. As such, I found that, even if the district judge had asked the appellant in this case if he intended to make restitution and he had replied that he did, the reasons behind such a response would remain highly questionable. In my view, restitution as a mitigating factor is of decisive significance only when it is made voluntarily for only then would it be a display of true moral conscience on the part of the accused. As the DPP rightly pointed out, the best test of that genuine moral conscience occurs precisely when an accused is unrepresented for only then can the judge be absolutely certain that any restitution made was truly the result of unadulterated remorse on his part, rather than the contrived action of one previously advised on the law.
Counsel then sought to stress tirelessly before me the fact that his client had indeed made partial restitution of $5,000 to Chin Bee Trading since the time of his sentencing in the court below. A look at the documents tendered by counsel, however, revealed that such restitution was made only a week before the hearing of this appeal, which gave me much reason to query the motives behind it. In my view, little or no mitigating weight should be placed on the fact of this restitution as it was something which arose only after the end of the hearing in the court below, thus rendering it a form of fresh evidence for which leave of court was necessary in order for it to be introduced on appeal. As no motion was filed by counsel to obtain the requisite leave, I found that the evidence of the subsequent restitution made by the appellant was inadmissible. Even if I did admit it in any case, the view espoused above that little weight should be given to it as a mitigating factor applied with full force as it was patent that any restitution was made only and obviously on the advice of counsel, evidently in the hope of getting a lighter sentence on appeal. If anything, such mindset appeared to me to demonstrate calculated purposefulness rather than genuine remorse on the appellant`s part. As such, little weight should be attributed to it as a mitigating factor. In the premises, I found that any intention at all by the appellant to make restitution, even if it did exist, existed only after he had instructed counsel in this appeal, and as such bore little consequence to his mitigation where his sentence was concerned.
Counsel next led me through a whole line of sentencing precedents and sought to draw from there some sort of mathematical formula from which the proper sentence in each case could be calculated with scientific accuracy. He cited, among others, the case of 
Sim Yeow Seng v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 44
  and made reference in particular to the following passage at p 46 of the judgment: 
 
... [I]n the absence of aggravating circumstances, the usual punishment for a first offence under s 408 of the Penal Code, where the accused pleads guilty and where the sum involved lies between $5,000 and $10,000 is an imprisonment term of nine months coupled with a fine.
 
 
 
He further quoted from the case of 
Gopalakrishnan Vanitha v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 307
  in which the amounts misappropriated were $11,369.73, $12,440 and $30,113.29 respectively and in which I had remarked that, for these amounts, the sentence ranged from nine to 15 months` imprisonment. As the amount misappropriated in the instant case was but a mere $485.22 above $10,000, counsel submitted that the range of sentence applicable to his client should be that for amounts below $10,000 as elucidated in 
 Sim Yeow Seng 
, and not the higher spectrum of sentences reserved for amounts above $10,000.
With respect, I found counsel`s attempt to reduce the law of sentencing into a rigid and inflexible mathematical formula in which all sentences are deemed capable of being tabulated with absolute scientific precision to be highly unrealistic. If the appropriate sentence in each case was indeed nothing more than a computation of numbers and figures, then judges are better off delegating the task of sentencing to their secretaries and clerks who I venture to think are possibly more adept at these things than judges. In my view, the regime of sentencing is a matter of law which involves a hotchpotch of such varied and manifold factors that no two cases can ever be completely identical in this regard. While past cases are no doubt helpful and sometimes serve as critical guidelines for the sentencing court, that is also all that they are, ie mere guidelines only. This is especially so with regard to the unreported cases, in which the detailed facts and circumstances are hardly, if ever, disclosed with sufficient clarity to enable any intelligent comparison to be made. At the end of the day, every case which comes before the courts must be looked at on its own facts, each particular accused in his own circumstances, and counsel be kept constantly and keenly apprised of the fact that it is just not possible to categorise cases based simply on mere numerals and decimal points.
Having considered all the various factors in the present case, however, I agreed with counsel that the sentence of 15 months` imprisonment was indeed somewhat excessive. The mitigating factors present were not uncompelling. While no restitution was made by the appellant before he was sentenced, he did nevertheless readily admit to his offences when arrested, as well as indicate his intention to plead guilty right from the day of his first mention in court, thus saving the authorities much time and effort which would otherwise have been expended in further investigation and prosecution. The appellant`s plea of guilt in this case was also clearly not merely a tactical one for the moneys misappropriated in this case were in the form of cold cash as a result of which some measure of difficulty would predictably have been encountered by the prosecution in establishing the appellant`s guilt had he chosen to claim trial. At the same time, this was also not a case in which the appellant had been caught red-handed in which case his surrender would have been but a mere recognition of the knowledge that the game was up. As such, I was inclined to the view that significant value ought to be placed on the plea of guilt in this case. Also of some mitigating worth was the appellant`s lack of antecedents. While the breach of trust in the present case concerned not one isolated incident but occurred 21 times over a period of five months, the amounts pilfered were not substantial. Admittedly, this was hardly a case in which the accused could be called a first offender, given that he had helped himself to the moneys 21 times. That this was the first time that he had been caught thus appeared to me to be the more accurate phrase to describe his situation instead. While I have no doubt that a recalcitrant offender who repeatedly commits the same offence over and over again in spite of his numerous previous convictions should be sentenced to the maximum punishment prescribed by law, even if the amounts or items stolen on each occasion were minuscule so as to take him out of circulation altogether, the present case was not one in which such drastic action was warranted on the facts. This was after all the appellant`s first and maiden conviction, if I may call it such, and while the total sum of $10,485.22 taken might have been an amount that a small enterprise like Chin Bee Trading could ill afford to lose, the amount was in objectivity an insubstantial one when compared generally with the other cases which have come before the court.
In 
Teng Lai Soon v PP
 (Unreported) , for example, three separate amounts of $33,112.86, $59,084.66 and $22,781.07 were misappropriated, yet the sentences imposed by the High Court were a mere 14 months` imprisonment on each of the three charges. In 
Yeo Eng Wah Francis v PP
 (Unreported) , cash of $116,671.40, more than ten times the amount involved in the present case, was misappropriated over a period of one year, for which the sentence imposed was 24 months` imprisonment. More recently is the case of 
 Gopalakrishnan Vanitha v PP 
 (supra), in which the amounts involved have already been set out above. In that case, no restitution was made by the accused who further claimed trial to all three charges against her. The sentence of six months` imprisonment on the two lesser amounts and 12 months` on the largest sum imposed by the trial court was left undisturbed by the High Court on appeal.
Also worthy of comparison is the case of 
PP v Asok Kumar
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 358
 . Although the actual amount misappropriated in that case was never specifically ascertained by the court, it seemed clear that the figure fell plainly within the hundred thousand dollar range. In addition, the respondents in that case were also directors and thus fiduciaries who held executive positions vis-.-vis the victim company. Moreover, they had claimed trial to the charges against them, which charges were for the more serious offence of CBT by an agent under s 409 of the Penal Code, an offence whose maximum punishment of life imprisonment is significantly higher than the seven years` maximum prescribed under s 408. Despite the patently more aggravating circumstances, the High Court was nevertheless content to send the respondents to jail for but a mere 12 months only.
It was plain from a broad consideration of the above cases, albeit serving as mere guidelines only, that the sentence of 15 months` imprisonment imposed in the present case did nevertheless fall completely out of line with the sentencing precedents laid down previously. This was especially so when all the factors, ie the relatively insubstantial amount involved, the appellant`s plea of guilt, his lack of antecedents as well as his lack of seniority in the company, in this case were taken into account collectively. The DPP sought to impress upon me that the reason why the amounts pilfered were insubstantial in this case was because that was all that the appellant had access to in his capacity as a sales representative. With respect, I could not accept that argument for to do so would result in gross unfairness to the appellant, since the state had not produced any evidence to show that the appellant would have helped himself to any more moneys than he did had he been given access to them. Next, while I accepted that the appellant might have abused the trust reposed in him by his former employers in pocketing the moneys collected on their behalf, such abuse is a factor inherent in every offence of criminal breach of trust, the essence of which is characterised precisely by the betrayal and disloyalty of one who has been entrusted with valuable property. As such, it is wrong to treat an abuse of trust as an aggravating factor in cases of criminal breach of trust. Likewise, s 408 of the Penal Code which prescribes for the more serious offence of CBT by a servant already carries with it a more severe maximum punishment than the offence of CBT 
 simpliciter 
 under s 406. As such, the fact that the accused facing a charge under s 408 was employed as a servant when committing the offence should not be regarded as a further aggravating factor against him.
In the light of the many strong mitigating factors highlighted above and the absence of any severely aggravating ones, I found that the sentence of 15 months` imprisonment imposed by the district judge was clearly not commensurate with those meted out in similar cases in the past. In the premises, I allowed the appeal and ordered that the sentence be reduced to nine months` imprisonment so as to ensure that it was congruent and consistent with current sentencing practice.

 The facts 
On 13 November 1999, at about 8.20pm, officers from the Gambling Suppression Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department conducted a raid on a factory at 31 Sungei Kadut Street 4 (`the Premises`). Inside, they found eight persons gathering around a table, engaged in a game of 
 pai kow 
. The raiding party arrested all eight persons in the office.
One of the eight persons arrested was one Chua Seong Soi (`Chua`), who was the tenant of the Premises. He was charged, under s 4(1)(b) of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49) (`the Act`), with having permitted the Premises to be used as a common gaming house. The seven other persons who were arrested on the Premises were jointly charged, under s 7 of the Act, with gaming in a common gaming house. The charge against the seven persons read as follows: 
 
You ...
 
 
 
are charged that you on the 13th of November 1999, at about 8.20pm, at No: 31 Sungei Kadut Street 4, office at the ground floor, Singapore, which is used as a common gaming house, did play a game of chance, to wit, ""Pai Kow"" by using domino tiles and cash as stakes, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act, Cap 49.
 
 
 
These seven persons were the petitioners in the present proceedings.
On 15 November 1999, the petitioners pleaded guilty to the charge. Each of them was accordingly convicted and sentenced to a fine of $1,000, in default two weeks` imprisonment. Chua, on the other hand, claimed trial.
Chua was found guilty by the magistrate`s court on 15 May 2000, and sentenced to two months` imprisonment and a $20,000 fine. He appealed to the High Court. The appeal was allowed by me on 19 September 2000. In reversing Chua`s conviction, I found that the Premises were not used 
 primarily 
 for gaming, and so did not fall within the definition of the term `common gaming house` as defined by the Act (see

39[emsp ]The law is clear. In order for premises to be `habitually` used for gaming within the meaning of the second limb of the definition of the term `common gaming house`, they must be used 
 primarily
 for gaming ... In the present case, it seemed that the trial judge below did not fully appreciate the purport and extent of the limitation. The evidence showed that the premises were primarily used for the businesses of two live and substantial companies. The gaming that occurred on the premises, if it could even be deemed to have been frequent at all, was only incidental (see 
R v Li Kim Poat & Anor
 
 
[1933] MLJ 164
 
 
[1933] SSLR 129
 ) to the business conducted on the premises. The premises could not have been said to be used primarily for gaming. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
As a result of Chua`s acquittal, the petitioners filed a petition for criminal revision on 23 December 2000. By it, they sought a reversal of their convictions, a removal of the criminal record against each of them and the return of the fines that they had paid.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a)[emsp ]When criminal revision is generally allowed
 
The principles to be borne in mind in the exercise of this power have been reiterated several times by the authorities. Oft quoted is the following passage from the case of 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
  at p 330: 
 
Thus various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
 
 
 
An example of when the power of revision was exercised is the case of 
Abdul Aziz bin Ahtam v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 96
 . In that case, the petitioner was tried in the District Court, together with one Goh and one Teo, on a charge of having cannabis in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, in furtherance of the common intention of all three of them. It was the defence of both Goh and the petitioner that Teo was the culpable party, and that they had no connection with Teo`s activities. Both Goh and the petitioner were convicted after a trial. Goh proceeded with an appeal to the High Court, but the petitioner withdrew his own appeal. Subsequently, Goh`s appeal was allowed, as it was found that the prosecution`s evidence did not support the charge against him. The petitioner in that case thereupon filed a petition for criminal revision, wherein he relied upon the same grounds on which Goh`s appeal had been allowed. In dealing with the petition, I held (at 102D): 
 
For present purposes, it would suffice to note that the petitioner would have reasonably and justifiably expected that the legal reasoning adopted in Goh`s case would also apply to him as regards the question whether he was in possession of drugs.
 
 
 
Pausing here for a moment and reverting to the facts of the instant petition, I would like to re-iterate that the same approach applies here. The legal reasoning used in 
 Chua 
`s case (supra) for ascertaining whether the Premises were a common gaming house must necessarily apply equally in the case of the petitioners.
I further held in 
 Aziz bin Ahtam 
 (supra at 102E): 
 
I concurred with the DPP that Goh`s acquittal did not necessarily mean that the petitioner would also have to be acquitted. The question was whether there would be serious injustice if his conviction on the charge of drug trafficking were to remain, in the light of the outcome of Goh`s appeal.
 
 
 
The petition in 
 Aziz bin Ahtam
 was allowed, on the ground that the evidence adduced did not establish that the petitioner had the requisite mens rea for the offence.
 
 
 
While there is no clear-cut test of what constitutes `serious injustice`, I believe that it cannot really be disputed, as seen from 
 Aziz bin Ahtam 
 (supra), that such injustice should be held to exist when a person has been convicted despite the obvious absence of an essential constituent of the offence concerned. Thus, petitions for criminal revision have been allowed in cases where the statement of facts do not disclose all the necessary elements of the offence, but where the petitioner pleads guilty anyway. See, for example, 
Chen Hock Heng Textile Printing Pte Ltd v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 745
 . I now turn to the facts of the present appeal.
 (b)[emsp ]Was a crucial element of the offence absent here?
It is well established that gaming per se is not an offence. As noted by Stevens J in 
R v Fong Chong Cheng
 
 
[1930] SSLR 139
  at p 145: 
 
It has ... to be observed that in this Colony it is not illegal to play games of chance for money.
 
 
 
Gaming, if it is to be an offence at all, must take place within a common gaming house. After my decision in 
 Chua Seong Soi v PP 
 (supra), I believe that there can really be no doubt that the Premises where the petitioners were arrested did not constitute a common gaming house. The petitioners were therefore convicted despite the absence of a fundamental element of the offence. At this point, it is worth setting out the statement of facts tendered at the hearing of the petitioners` case: 
 
 
3 On 13.11.99 at about 8.20 p.m., acting on information received, Head GSB DSP Heng Hiang Hua and informant led a party of GSB officers from Gambling Suppression Branch raided [sic] No. 31 Sungei Kadut Street 4 for illegal gaming activities under the provisions of Common Gaming Houses Act, Chapter 49. At the ground floor office found a group of people gather [sic] and gambling inside. Proceeded in the office and managed to detain 8 persons as the other fled from the scene. The following exhibits were found and seized from the table: 
 
(a) Cash S$440/-; (S`pore dollars four hundreds forty) 
 
(b) some domino tiles; 
 
(c) some dices [sic]; 
 
(d) a pair of chopsticks; 
 
(e) a piece of plastic sheet; 
 
(f) a pager; and 
 
(g) a small note book with entries. 
 
4 A further search was conducted in the office, the following were recovered and seized: 
 
(h) some packs of English playing cards; 
 
(i) a box of domino tiles; and 
 
(j) some colour chips.
  
 
 
Subsequently, all the accused persons were placed under arrest and brought to CID together with the seized exhibits for investigation.
 
 
 
As can be seen, the only part of the statement which was incriminating was that which stated that the Premises were used for `illegal gaming activities`. However, no further elaboration was given as to why the activities were illegal. Nothing was said about the Premises being used 
 primarily 
 for gaming. As such, the statement of facts did not contain any reference to the existence of the most crucial element of the offence, ie factors to indicate that the Premises were a common gaming house. I was therefore satisfied that on the facts of this case, an injustice existed which warranted the exercise of the powers of revision of this court.
Before me, it was argued by Mr Hay Hung Chun for the prosecution that the petition should nevertheless be disallowed. Much emphasis was placed on the fact that the petitioners pleaded guilty on their own accord.
It need hardly be stated that the fact that the petitioners pleaded guilty on their own accord cannot be a bar to the exercise of revisionary power. Rather, the fact that a plea of guilty has been entered will mean that the accused loses his right to appeal against conviction: see s 244 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). In such a situation, an application by way of criminal revision will be the only means by which the accused can have a wrongful conviction set aside.
It also has to be borne in mind that the determination of whether certain premises do or do not amount to a common gaming house can involve a fair amount of legal analysis. As such, an admission by an accused to the premises being a common gaming house may not necessarily be conclusive. The fact that an accused has admitted to the premises being a common gaming house does not absolve the court of its duty to ascertain whether the premises do actually fall within the legal definition of a common gaming house or not. I repeat what I said in 
 Chua Seong Soi 
 (supra at [para ]31): 
 
With respect, the plea of guilt by the other arrested persons did not in any way show that the premises were in fact a common gaming house.
 
 
 
Mr Hay further contended that the decision in 
 Chua Seong Soi 
 (supra), to the effect that the Premises were not a common gaming house, should be confined to the particular evidence led in that case. I found this argument difficult to accept. The petitioners and Chua were gambling on the same Premises. They were all engaged with each other in the same game, and they were arrested at the same time. To deem the Premises to be a common gaming house now when they were expressly deemed to be otherwise in 
 Chua 
`s case would create an inconsistency that cannot be justified.
Mr Hay nevertheless contended that the petitioners fully understood the nature of their charge. He invited me to infer that when the petitioners pleaded guilty, they must have been aware of certain facts of the case which would have brought the Premises within the ambit of the definition of the term `common gaming house`. This, argued Mr Hay, would provide sufficient justification for confining the decision in 
 Chua Seong Soi 
 (supra) to the evidence advanced in that case. I think that this argument needs to be approached from a reasonable man`s point of view. The GSB officers who raided the Premises had done so despite there being absolutely no evidence of the Premises having been used primarily for gaming. Notwithstanding the absence of any such evidence, the officers proceeded to arrest everybody in sight. It was thus plainly obvious that the GSB officers, despite their experience with and specialisation in cases involving gaming offences, were themselves unable to draw the line for ascertaining when premises can or cannot constitute a common gaming house. Even the trial court which subsequently convicted Chua could not, despite having the benefit of counsel`s assistance, correctly determine whether the Premises were a common gaming house. In stark contrast, these petitioners were laymen. They were not represented when they pleaded guilty. Prior to their pleading guilty, they did not have the benefit of legal arguments being canvassed on their behalf as to whether the Premises were a common gaming house. At Chua`s trial, some of the petitioners (who were called as witnesses for both the defence and the prosecution) testified that they thought they were pleading guilty to a charge of `gathering to gamble`, when no such offence existed in law (see 
 Chua Seong Soi v PP 
, supra at [para ]28). Standing back and looking at the overall picture, I feel considerable doubt as to whether the petitioners even knew just what a common gaming house is. Bearing in mind the ignorance displayed by all the parties towards the concept of the common gaming house, I think that Mr Hay`s argument reads too much into the petitioners` plea of guilt.
Finally, in a last bid to resist the petition, Mr Hay pointed out that the petitioners could have claimed trial and engaged counsel to defend themselves. However, for reasons known only to themselves, they chose not to do so and pleaded guilty instead. Now it would certainly be prudent for an accused person to first engage a lawyer to defend himself before going for trial. If it was within his means to do so but he nevertheless chose not to do so, and the trial judge convicted him, it would not lie in his mouth to complain on appeal that he was unrepresented below. However, the situation is somewhat different when the conviction was, as in the present case, based on a fundamental error of law. The accused`s folly in failing to obtain legal representation cannot make right what is manifestly wrong. As I remarked in the case of 
Virgie Rizza V Leong v PP
 (Unreported) : 
 
16[emsp ]... In 
Packir Malim v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 429
 , it was held that pleas of guilt by unrepresented persons are not more easily vitiated than those by represented persons. 
 Rajeevan Edakalavanand
 (supra) suggests that an unrepresented accused`s plea of guilt will not be vitiated by his ignorance of possible defences. This does not mean that criminal revision is impossible whenever an accused has pleaded guilty from ignorance of law. The essential test for revision is simply whether there has been some serious injustice ( 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
 ). An accused who unnecessarily pleads guilty has added to his own problems, but there is no reason for a court to uphold a conviction if it can be clearly demonstrated to be wrong in law or fact.
 
 
 
 
 (c)[emsp ]Delay
 
In 
 Ang Poh Chuan v PP 
 (supra), the petitioner sought criminal revision of a decision of a subordinate court judge to forfeit his vehicle. However, he had waited eight months after the decision before making his petition. In addressing the delay, I held (at p 335F): 
 
While, in a case of injustice generally, delay would not be material, it may indicate in some circumstances that there is in fact no injustice caused. On the instant facts, this court was of the view that the delay indicated that even if, contrary to what was discussed above, there was injustice, the force of that was seriously attenuated by the delay, such that no exercise of the discretion ought to be made in favour of the petitioner.
 
 
 
In the present case, the petitioners pleaded guilty on 15 November 1999. However, the petition for criminal revision was filed only on 23 December 2000. Mr Hay thus argued that there was an unreasonable delay of more than a year. Nonetheless, I think that sight should not be lost of the fact that my judgment, setting out the reasons as to why the Premises were not a common gaming house, was delivered only on 26 September 2000. As such, the effective delay here amounted to no more than three months. I was not satisfied that this time span attenuated the injustice of the case to any appreciable extent.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
It is perhaps apt at this juncture to repeat the caution which I sounded in the case of 
 Ang Poh Chuan v PP 
 (supra at p 331F): 
 
Additionally, in the view of this court, the jurisdiction [to exercise criminal revision] ought not be exercised where any grievance allegedly suffered by the applicant arises out of a change in the law. If it were otherwise, then, notwithstanding the expiry of the appeal period, it would be open to persons to challenge decisions by way of revision.
 
 
 
The High Court`s power of revision should not be exercised in such a manner that it paves the way for a flood of re-litigation every time the criminal law gets changed. That, however, was not the situation in the present case. 
 Chua Seong Soi v PP 
 (supra) did not change any law. Rather, all it did was to apply a test which has been in existence ever since the 1930 decision of Stevens J in 
 R v Fong Chong Cheng 
 (supra). After applying that test in the 
 Chua Seong Soi 
 case, I found that the Premises where Chua and the petitioners were arrested never constituted a common gaming house.
As such, the only conclusion that could be drawn was that the petitioners were convicted despite the absence of a crucial element of the offence. I therefore allowed the petition.

Sentence of reformative training for unlawful possession of another's identity card
 
:The appellant pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to a charge under s 13(2)(b) of the National Registration Act (Cap 201). He was convicted and sentenced by the district judge Kow Keng Siong (`the trial judge`) to reformative training. The appellant brought the present appeal (MA 28/2000) against his sentence. The two petitions for criminal revision (CR 4/2000 and CR 5/2000) were filed by the trial judge and the Public Prosecutor and they relate respectively to an error in the charge and the sentence that was imposed upon the appellant. After hearing the arguments from both sides, I dismissed CR 4/2000, allowed CR 5/2000 and dismissed the appeal against sentence. I now give my reasons.
 Background facts 
 
 
 
On 28 January 2000, the appellant pleaded guilty to the following charge: 
 
You, Mohamed Noor bin Abdul Majeed, are charged that you, on or about 11 August 1999, at or about 7.40pm, at Kampong Glam Police Post, Singapore, without lawful authority or lawful excuse made use of an identity card other that (sic) your own, to wit, the identity card bearing number S1616463A which belongs to one Ahmad bin Yahaya and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 13(2)(b) of the National Registration Act (Cap 201).
 
 
 
In the statement of facts, which were admitted without qualification, it was stated that the appellant had, on 11 August 1999, gone to the Kampong Glam Neighbourhood Police Post to lodge a police report pertaining to his lost identity card. However, as the appellant knew that he was unlawfully at large for failing to return to the Changi Reformative Training Centre, he decided to give a false name to the police officer attending to him. The police officer found the appellant`s behaviour suspicious and decided to conduct a check on the appellant. The check revealed that the appellant was carrying in his rear trouser pocket, a Singapore identity card belonging to one Ahmad bin Yahaya. The appellant was not able to give a satisfactory account as to why he was in possession of the said identity card which did not belong to him. The appellant was thus arrested and charged accordingly as a result.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
After the appellant pleaded guilty and was convicted of the charge, his previous criminal records were read out for consideration by the trial judge for the purposes of sentencing. The following antecedents were admitted to by the appellant: 
(i) On 7 July 1995, he was convicted for affray under s 160 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and was placed on 18 months` probation. 
(ii) On 16 February 1996, he was convicted on three charges of theft of a motor vehicle under s 379A, Penal Code, and was sentenced to reformative training. On the same occasion, the appellant consented to two charges under s 379A and s 457 of the Penal Code being taken into consideration.
The trial judge was also informed that the appellant was currently still undergoing reformative training, after being recalled from supervision for failing to comply with instructions issued to him.
After listening to the appellant`s mitigation plea, the trial judge was minded to give him another chance to reform as he was under 21 years old and was still eligible for reformative training. The trial judge then took into account the decision in 
Ng Kwok Fai v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 568
 , in which the High Court had held that consecutive terms of reformative training were not desirable. Feeling himself bound by the decision, the trial judge ordered the appellant to undergo reformative training with the sentence to commence on the same date as his existing term of reformative training.
 Criminal Revision No 4 of 2000 
 
 
 
The first petition for criminal revision was made by the trial judge himself. In preparing his grounds of decision for the appeal, the trial judge discovered that the statement of facts did not satisfy the charge preferred against the appellant. The charge had erroneously stated that the appellant had 
 made use of 
 an identity card belonging to another person when the facts revealed that the appellant was only 
 in possession of 
 the said identity card. The offence in fact committed by the appellant was therefore being 
 in possession of 
 an identity card other than his own, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. As was pointed out by the trial judge in his petition for a criminal revision, this was incidentally also an offence under the same section as that stated in the charge, ie s 13(2)(b) of the National Registration Act (`NRA`), and it carries the same prescribed punishment as the charge which the appellant had pleaded guilty to. The trial judge was of the view that the error in the charge constituted sufficient ground for the High Court to exercise its revisionary powers and hence the petition for revision was made.
The relevant statutory provisions dealing with the revisionary powers of the High Court are s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) and s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). In particular, s 268 of the CPC reads as follows: 
 
 
(1) The High Court may in any case, the record of the proceedings of which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sections 251, 255, 256 and 257. 
 
(2) No order under this section shall be made to the prejudice of the accused unless he has had an opportunity of being heard either personally or by advocate in his own defence. 
 
(3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise the High Court to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction.
  
 
 
The general position established by the local authorities is that the revisionary jurisdiction and powers of the High Court must be exercised sparingly. In all cases where the court has exercised its powers of revision, there has been some form of serious injustice which warrants the exercise. In 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
  at 330, I had summarised the governing principles in the following terms: 
 
Thus various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
 
 
 
This statement has been endorsed in subsequent cases and the same principle was reiterated in my recent decision in 
Ngian Chin Boon v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 119
 .
At first glance, the situation in the present case may appear to be somewhat similar to the factual scenario that arose in 
PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 573
 . In that case, there was also an error in the charge arising out of a clerical mistake. The accused there was to be charged under s 25(1) of the Destruction of Disease-Bearing Insects Act (Cap 79) (`DDBIA`) and had intended to plead guilty to such a charge. However, the charge that was read out in court and to which the accused pleaded guilty was, through a clerical error, for an offence under s 6(1), DDBIA, instead. As a result of the error, the sentence imposed on the accused was higher than that which would have been given had the charge been correctly stated to be under s 25(1), DDBIA. After the mistake was discovered, a petition was made to the High Court for an exercise of its revisionary powers. The High Court found that there was never any doubt which offence the accused had committed and that the accused was still willing to plead guilty to the amended charge in the correct form. The High Court then went on to hold that it has, in its revisionary capacity, the implied power to correct errors in the charge pursuant to s 256(b)(ii), CPC, and this would include the power to amend the charge to introduce the appropriate offence section. As a serious injustice was caused to the accused, who suffered a more severe sentence as a result of the error, the High Court exercised its revisionary powers and amended the charge and the sentence accordingly.
Reverting to the facts in the instant case, the error in the charge appeared to be due to a negligent oversight in the drafting of the charge. Following the decision in 
 PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd 
 (supra), it was clear that the High Court has the power to amend an erroneously stated charge when exercising its powers of revision. I was, however, of the view that the present circumstances did not warrant an exercise of the High Court`s revisionary powers as the error in the charge was so minor it could be rightly regarded as immaterial. Section 162 of the CPC provides that no error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material unless the accused was in fact misled by that error. It is further stated in s 396, CPC, that no finding or sentence made by a court shall be reversed or altered on account of any error or irregularity in the charge unless the error or irregularity has occasioned a failure of justice. In the present case, it had always been apparent to all parties which offence was committed by the appellant and as alluded to earlier, the offence was one under the same sub-section in the NRA as was stated in the erroneous charge. Therefore, unlike the situation in 
 PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd 
, the proposed amendment did not introduce a charge under a different provision and the prescribed punishment for the amended charge would remain unchanged from the present. Such being the case, the proceedings below would have taken exactly the same course even if the charge had been correctly drafted in the first place since the appellant clearly intended to plead guilty and admit to the statement of facts without any qualifications. Thus, I saw no necessity to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court with regard to this negligible discrepancy in the wording of the charge since the appellant was not misled by the error at all and neither did the error occasion a failure of justice. Accordingly, I dismissed the petition under CR 4/2000.
 Criminal Revision No 5 of 2000 
 
 
 
The next petition for criminal revision was brought by the Public Prosecutor and it related to the sentence imposed by the trial judge. In the court below, when the trial judge ordered the accused to undergo further reformative training, he also ordered the sentence to run concurrently with the appellant`s previous term of reformative training by having it commence on the same date as the earlier sentence, ie on 16 February 1996. It was submitted by the prosecution that the trial judge`s order for concurrent sentences of reformative training was inappropriate.
The detention and release of persons sentenced to reformative training is governed by Sch D to the CPC and can be summarised briefly in the following manner: 
(i) an offender sentenced to reformative training is detained in a reformative training centre (`RTC`) for a maximum period of three years (36 months) from his date of sentence; 
(ii) the offender may be released from detention into supervision any time after 18 months of detention and such supervision will continue until the end of four years from the date of his sentence; 
(iii) while under supervision, the offender must comply with the requirements as may be so specified; and 
(iv) if the offender fails to comply with any of the requirements while under supervision, he may be ordered to be recalled to the RTC for further detention until the end of three years from the date of his sentence or the end of six months from the date he is taken into custody under the order of recall, whichever is the later. Provided that such further detention will not extend beyond the end of four years from the date of his sentence.
Here, the appellant had been sentenced to reformative training for a prior conviction and was first detained in a RTC on 16 February 1996. He was detained for 34 months and 22 days before being released into supervision on 6 January 1999. The appellant`s term of supervision was to expire on 15 February 2000, which was exactly four years after his date of sentence under the previous conviction. However, during his term of supervision, the appellant disobeyed the instructions of his Aftercare Officer by refusing to go to work and therefore an order of recall dated 27 April 1999 was issued against him. Thereafter, the appellant remained unlawfully at large until he was arrested for the present offence.
In ordering concurrent sentences of reformative training, the trial judge had relied on the High Court decision in 
Ng Kwok Fai v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 568
 . In 
 Ng Kwok Fai`s 
 case, the accused was placed on probation for 18 months on 28 June 1995 after pleading guilty to a charge of rioting with hurt. On 13 October 1995, the accused pleaded guilty to an offence of unlawful assembly and was sentenced to undergo reformative training. Soon after on 28 November 1995, the accused was brought before a trial judge for breaching his probation order due to the conviction for unlawful assembly. The trial judge sentenced him to imprisonment and caning which was to run consecutive to the reformative training sentence. On appeal, the High Court held that the sentence of imprisonment and caning consecutive to reformative training was inappropriate as it ran counter to the aim of reformative training. Substituting the sentence with an order for reformative training, the court went on to hold that, as reformative training sentences should never be ordered to run consecutively since it would be wrong in principle and could give rise to problems in practice, the second reformative training was to commence on the same date as the first.
With due respect to the trial judge in our present case, it seemed to me that he had misapplied the case of 
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
. In our case, the problem of consecutive reformative training sentences did not arise at all by virtue of the operation of para 4 of Sch D to the CPC. The relevant para 4 provides as follows: 
 
 
 If any person while under supervision, or after his recall to a reformative training centre, as aforesaid, is sentenced to corrective training or reformative training his original sentence of reformative training shall cease to have effect
; and if any such person is so sentenced to imprisonment, any period for which he is imprisoned under that sentence shall count as part of the period for which he is liable to detention in a reformative training centre under his original sentence [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Paragraph 4 of Sch D to the CPC was directly applicable to our present facts as the appellant was sentenced to further reformative training after he was recalled to a RTC from supervision. Therefore, applying the provision, the earlier sentence of reformative training would cease to have effect and as such, there would be only one sentence of reformative training, which would be the one being imposed for the present offence under the National Registration Act. The reasoning employed in the 
 Ng Kwok Fai 
 case did not apply here since there was only one sentence of reformative training in question. This was reinforced by a reference to the second part of para 4 of Sch D, which contemplates a sentence of imprisonment being imposed on an offender who is under supervision or serving further detention in a RTC pursuant to an order of recall. The imposition of a sentence of imprisonment would not be possible if the holding in Ng Kwok Fai was applicable to such a situation.
Furthermore, to order the appellant`s sentence to commence on the same date as his first term of reformative training, ie on 16 February 1996, would effectively mean that the appellant has already completed serving his sentence and would have to be released practically immediately since the maximum period of detention and supervision under his first order would have already expired on 15 February 2000, four years after his date of sentence for the previous conviction. This was obviously an absurd result and would mean that the sentence given was manifestly inadequate for the offence committed.
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
 was plainly distinguishable from the present case. In the earlier case, para 4 of Sch D to the CPC was not applicable as the accused there was not under supervision or serving further detention under an order of recall when the second sentence of reformative training was imposed. The date of the second sentence was also relatively close to the date of the first sentence and the accused had only served a short term of detention under the first order of reformative training. By contrast, the present case involved a time gap of more than 47 months between the earlier sentence of reformative training and the second one. The application of the principles in 
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
 by the trial judge to the present case was therefore misconstrued.
From the above discussion, it was apparent that the order for the sentence of reformative training to commence on the same date as the appellant`s earlier term of reformative training was erroneous. The present circumstances clearly justified the exercise of the High Court`s revisionary powers, which would include the power under s 256(c) of the CPC to alter the nature of the sentence. Consequently, I allowed the petition under CR 5/2000 and ordered the sentence to be amended to commence on the date of sentencing, ie on 28 January 2000.
 Magistrate`s Appeal No 28 of 2000 
 
 
 
I now move on to deal with the appellant`s appeal against his sentence. In this regard, the appellant tendered a hand-written note setting out the mitigating circumstances in his favour. The circumstances mentioned by the appellant dealt mainly with his family problems. He alluded to his parents` divorce when he was a young child and the fact that his mother was currently undergoing treatment in a drug rehabilitation centre. His younger brother was in the Boys` Home while his younger sister was placed under probation. The appellant also had a girlfriend who had just given birth to their second child. He claimed that he wanted to be responsible by taking care of his girlfriend and their two children as well as his siblings. He pleaded for leniency, claiming that he had learnt his lesson and had changed for the better.
Generally, an appellate court will not interfere with the sentence passed below unless there was some error, whether in fact or in principle, or the sentence was manifestly excessive or inadequate. From his grounds of decision, it was clear that the trial judge had taken into proper consideration the appellant`s antecedents and his various mitigating circumstances before passing sentence. There was nothing to suggest that the sentence passed was erroneous either on the facts or on the law.
Was the sentence manifestly excessive? I did not think so. The offence committed by the appellant under s 13(2) of the NRA, of being in possession of an identity card of another person without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, was a serious offence. This was evident from the fact that the offence was deemed to be a seizable one and the heavy punishment prescribed for it, which carried a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or both. On this issue, I agreed with the submissions made by the prosecution that the severe punishments prescribed underlie the Parliament`s clear message that offences connected with the unlawful use of Singapore identity cards must be effectively dealt with to prevent their abuse and to ensure their security and integrity. This was especially important in light of the growing proliferation of abuse of Singapore identity cards by illegal immigrants gaining unlawful entry into Singapore.
Taking into consideration all the various factors, such as the gravity of the offence committed as well as the appellant`s antecedents, it was obvious that the sentence of reformative training imposed by the trial judge was not manifestly excessive at all. The appeal against sentence was therefore dismissed.
Outcome:
Criminal Revision No 4/2000 dismissed; CR 5/2000 allowed; appeal against sentence dismissed.",2000-05-25 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Introduction 
This is an uncommon case of collision at sea. It is unusual because it was not a collision between two ships. The damage was done to seismic cables by the defendants` ship Tai He. The cables were extended from the stern of the plaintiffs` ship Nordic Explorer. It happened in the afternoon of 18 September 1998 at about 1600 hours. The plaintiffs, as owners of the cables, claim damages from the owners of the Chinese ship Teng He which was at the relevant time in the same ownership as the Tai He.
The weather at the time, according to an admission in the preliminary act of the defendants, was `cloudy and hazy. Visibility was less than 1 mile due to fog.` The poor visibility is the most significant feature of this case.
The Nordic Explorer was 81.8m in length, 14.5m in breadth. She measured 3,861 tonnes gross register. She was custom-built to carry out seismic exploration for undersea oil. At the time of the time of the incident in all seven seismic streamer cables of 3.6 kilometres each were connected to her. The full length of the cables was in excess of 4 kilometres. At the relevant time the full length had not been run out. At the far end of each cable, a tail buoy was attached to each cable. Each buoy was 3 metres in length, 0.8m in breadth and weighed 350 kg. To the human eyes the buoys were not anything resembling fishing vessels. One would expect the buoys to display the bright end of VIBGYOR - that is yellow, orange or red. In this case they were painted bright yellow.
At the relevant time the seismic operations were being carried out in Bo Hai Gulf, China.
 Plaintiffs` pleaded case 
 
 
 
The plaintiffs` case stated in their preliminary act was as follows.
At all material times, the plaintiffs were carrying out seismographic research activities within Bo Hai Gulf, People`s Republic of China. On 18 September 1998, the Nordic Explorer was towing the seven seismic streamer cables and making way at about 4 to 4.5 knots on the true course of 132 degrees at latitude 38 degrees 34.15 minutes North and longitude 120 degrees 21.61 minutes East. Each tail buoy was fitted with a radar reflector and a GPS beacon showing the position of the tail buoys.
In accordance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972, the Nordic Explorer exhed three all-round lights in a vertical line in a red-white-red order, together with three shapes of ball-diamond-ball in a vertical line, as prescribed by r 27(b) for vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre. Additionally, the Nordic Explorer also executed the sound signal prescribed in r 35(c) of a prolonged blast followed by two short blasts of the ship`s horn. This was to indicate that she was towing another vessel in restricted visibility.
In addition, those on board the Nordic Explorer made continuous radio broadcasts via VHF International Safety Calling Frequency Channel 16 (`VHF Channel 16`) of the position and operations of the Nordic Explorer every half hourly in the English language, followed by a Chinese translation as follows: 
 
Securite Securite Securite. This is survey vessel Nordic Explorer, at position xx, yy, speed & heading. We are towing seven submerged high voltage steel cables. All shipping is advised to give Nordic Explorer minimum 3NM clearance for safety reasons.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs also deployed six chaseboats to protect and chase away any on-coming vessels in the vicinity of the Nordic Explorer and the seismic streamer cables towed by her.
The Tai He was a container ship built in 1989. At all material times, the Tai He was making a course of about 100 degrees from Xingang to Dalian at about 14 to 15 knots.
At approximately 1535 hours, the Tai He was checked as a target on the radar of chaseboat No 201 at a distance of about 3 nautical miles. At the given course, a collision by Tai He with the seismic streamer cables towed by the Nordic Explorer was imminent and the chaseboat No 201 proceeded immediately at full speed to the midship of the Tai He to warn her of the presence and operations of Nordic Explorer. The crew of chaseboat No 201 fired 5 red flares to attract the attention of the crew on board the Tai He and using a loud speaker, also warned the Tai He of the seismic streamer cables ahead and advised the Tai He to change her course immediately to 180 degrees starboard. Chaseboat No 201 also sounded several long blasts of the ship`s whistle. The crew on board chaseboat No 201 made repeated attempts to make contact with Tai He via VHF Channel 16 to warn them of the imminent collision. However, the crew on board Tai He failed to respond.
At about the same time, the First Officer on board Nordic Explorer fired several green flares from the mid-ship section of Nordic Explorer into the air for a duration of 5 minutes to warn Tai He of the danger ahead. Each flare burned in the sky for approximately 40 seconds before fading.
In spite of the above attempts the crew on board the Tai He refused and/or neglected and/or failed to respond.
Instead the Tai He kept her course towards the starboard quarter of the Nordic Explorer and at approximately 1606 hours ship`s time, steamed across and severed all seven seismic streamer cables towed by the Nordic Explorer. By ignoring and failing to respond to the repeated warnings given by the plaintiffs, the defendants, their servants and/or their agents were negligent in their navigation and/or management of the Tai He.
The plaintiffs gave the following particulars of negligence: 
(i) failed to keep a proper lookout; 
(ii) failed to make proper and timely use of their radar, and/or failed to observe and/or act upon its indications in due time and/or with proper or seamanlike skill and care or at all; 
(iii) failed to heed the repeated warnings broadcasted over the VHF of the operations and position of Nordic Explorer and/or taking any steps or measures to prevent and/or avoid Nordic Explorer. 
(iv) failed to keep clear of Nordic Explorer; 
(v) failed to appreciate the imminence of a collision and/or heed the repeated warnings broadcasted over the VHF channel 16 of the imminence of a collision and/or acting upon such indications so as to prevent and/or avoid a collision. 
(vi) failed to notice the red and green flares fired in its direction to warn the Tai He of the presence of the Nordic Explorer and the seismic streamer cables; 
(vii) proceeded at an excessive speed; 
(viii) failed to ease, stop or reverse their engines in due time or at all; 
(ix) failed to alter course to avoid a collision with the plaintiffs` seismic streamer cables; and/or 
(x) failed to comply with rr 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 18, 19 and 34 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 as amended.
 The defendants` pleaded case 
 
 
 
The Tai He`s pleaded case was as follows. There was no collision between the Tai He and the Nordic Explorer and/or her seismic cables as alleged by the plaintiffs or at all. Accordingly the plaintiffs had no cause of action against the defendants.
The defendants had no knowledge of the alleged contact between their vessel the Tai He and the seismic cables of the Nordic Explorer. Further or in the alternative, if there was such contact as alleged or at all, which was denied, the plaintiffs were nevertheless solely to be blamed for the contact.
The defendants made the following counter-charges against the plaintiffs: 
(a) At all material times, the plaintiffs and/or their servants or agents failed to issue and/or cause to be issued any or adequate navigational warnings to alert the traffic in the vicinity of the Bo Hai Gulf including the Tai He that the Nordic Explorer was carrying out seismographic research activities within Penglai-14 concession in the Bo Hai Gulf, China. 
(b) The plaintiffs and/or their servants or agents knew or ought to have known that the navigational warnings in respect of their seismographic activities were not being reported in the Notices to Mariners or via Navtext from the time the Nordic Explorer commenced their seismographic activities on or about 30 July 1998 to the time of the alleged incident on 18 September 1998. 
(c) The Nordic Explorer failed to take any or sufficient steps to cause her seismic cables to be submerged to such a depth and/or to remain at such a depth so as to avert any possible contact with oncoming vessels including but not limited to the Tai He. 
(d) The Nordic Explorer having caused her seismic cables to be submerged to a depth of 17 metres at 1538 hours were negligent in causing the said seismic cables to return to the operating depth of 7 metres at 1556 hours (just a few minutes before the alleged contact) when they were aware or ought to have been aware of the presence of oncoming vessels including but not limited to the Tai He. 
(e) Those on board the Nordic Explorer failed to keep any or proper lookout and/or failed to make proper use of their radar to appreciate and/or determine in proper time the presence of the Tai He and that those on board the Tai He was navigating in such a manner as to indicate that they were unaware that the Nordic Explorer was towing seven seismic cables of 3,600 metres in length and 600 metres in breadth. 
(f) Those on board the Nordic Explorer failed to effectively co-ordinate and/or deploy the six chaseboats in such a manner which would have prevented the Tai He from entering the area where the seismographic activities were being carried out. 
(g) The Tai He was at all material times proceeding on the eastbound lane of the Traffic Separation Scheme for transportation vessels on the Northern Coastal Waters as prescribed by the Chinese Ministry of Transport. The Nordic Explorer was at all material times cutting across the Traffic Separation Scheme at a fine angle and in so doing failed to keep clear of the Tai He which was proceeding in the correct eastbound lane.
 The defendants` navigation 
 
 
 
The defendants made the following admissions in their preliminary act: At about 1545 hours the Tai He was steering a course of 94[ordm ] G at a speed of about 17.5 knots when a cluster of echoes were observed. The distance of the targets was 5 to 6 miles bearing less than 1 point on the port bow. None of the plaintiffs` vessels was visually sighted at that time. Further, in relation to the plaintiffs` vessels, the Tai He altered course to 117[ordm ] G. At about 1605 hours the Tai He altered course by 5[ordm ] to port to return to the course of 094[ordm ] G. However, before her heading had reverted to 094[ordm ] G the Tai He changed course by 15[ordm ] to starboard at about 1607 hours to bring her course to 113[ordm ] G. After passing and clearing all the vessels in the cluster at about 1612 hours, the Tai He resumed course to 094[ordm ] G.
The Chief Officer of the Tai He, the navigating officer at the relevant time in his evidence gave these additional particulars. At about 1602 hours he observed on the ARPA that the Tai He passed a small target on the port side at a distance of 1 to 1.5 miles. This small target was proceeding in the opposite direction at a very slow speed. It was not possible to observe the vessel visually. At about 1605 hours, he observed again on the ARPA that the Tai He had passed a cluster of targets on his port side at a passing distance of less than 1 mile. Owing to poor visibility it was not possible to ascertain the nature of the targets. As he was able to pass the targets by a safe distance, it was not necessary to determine what type of boats they were although he suspected that they were fishing boats.
In court the Chief Officer was given a paper showing the actual course traversed by the Tai He according to her course recorder from 1545 to 1608. On that paper he marked the cluster of vessels at 1555, 1602 and 1605. He also marked the position and direction of another vessel (`the big white vessel`) at 1602 and 1605. This was marked as exh P4. It is to be noted that according to this paper the distance between the cluster and the Tai He at 1602 was 8 cables. At 1605 the distance was 7 cables. That was the closest distance. According to his marking the distance covered by the cluster between 1555 and 1602 (7 mins) was about 3 cables. From 1602 to 1603 (3 mins) the cluster travelled a distance of about 7 cables. As shown in exh P4 the `big white vessel` passed ahead of the cluster from East to West.
 Charges and counter charges 
 
 
 
I must now relate an event of 25 September 1998, that is seven days after the collision. On the day of collision the plaintiffs were unable to intercept and halt the Tai He. After the cables were severed the plaintiffs did some detective work and identified the Tai He as the ship which damaged the cables. Consequently one Mr AJ Cunningham boarded the Tai He on behalf of the plaintiffs and met the Master of the Tai He at the Port of Kobe. Mr Cunningham was accompanied by one Mr Megumi Fujisawa, who was the plaintiffs` shipping agent in Japan. The Master of the Tai He was asked whether he was aware that his ship crossed and severed the seven seismic cables. The Master called his Officers. Mr Cunningham gave him a copy of a segment of the admiralty chart depicting the Nordic Explorer and the satellite boats protecting the operations. According to Mr Cunningham the Master on seeing the chart stated that `he would never take his ship through such a congested area`. The Master was of course referring to the community of the plaintiffs` chase boats and the buoys. According to Mr Cunningham, the officer on seeing his illustration stated that `
 whilst he heard urgent navigation warnings being issued via VHF radio 
, ... he was nowhere near the Nordic Explorer or her equipment.`
It would be helpful to set out in full the report prepared by Mr Cunningham on the same day: 
 
At 10.30am Friday 25 September the author of this memo boarded M/V Tai He in order to confront the Captain of the vessel regarding the streamer incident that is the basis of PGS incident report `Incident Investigation - M/V Nordic Explorer - 18.9.98`.
 
 
 
The visit was brief in order that the Captain could manage his duties as required to conduct his port call in Kobe according to the vessels planned schedule.
 
 
 
Mr Megumi Fujisawa of Mitsubishi Logistics, who acts as PGS freight and shipping agent in Japan, accompanied the author during this visit to the M/V Tai He.
 
 
 
The aforesaid made the following statement:
 
 
 
`Captain, are you aware that at 1606 hrs Local Tme 18 September 1998 that your vessel crossed and severed 7 seismic cables belonging to our Survey Vessel M/V Nordic Explorer whilst you were transiting between Xingang and Dalian. The position of the incident was approximately 38 deg 35 min N 120 deg 20 min E.`
 
 
 
At this point the Captain called the Officer who was on watch at the time. The Officer brought with him the chart used for the purpose of navigation during that leg of their voyage.
 
 
 
The author presented a copy of a chart depicting the Nordic Explorer and the Chase/Guard boat protecting the operation. The Captain compared his chart with ours and both parties agreed that the Nordic Explorer and the M/V Tai He were within close proximity at that place, at that time and on that day. Although the Captain`s standpoint at that time was not to confirm that his vessel had been the ship that caused the damage. However it was evident to all parties present that we were less than a few miles apart at 1600 hrs on that same day.
 
 
 
The Captain stated that his 16:00 hrs position was approximately 38 deg 36.5 min N 120 deg 18 min E. Whereas our 16:06 position where the cables were cut was approximately 38 deg 35 min N 120 deg 20 min E.
 
 
 
The Officer who was on watch then stated that whilst `
 he heard urgent Navigation Warnings being issued via VHF radio, that he was nowhere near the Nordic Explorer or her equipment
`.
 
 
 
The Captain, on seeing the authors` chart stated that he `
 would never take his ship through such a congested area
` (referring of course to our community of chase boats).
 
 
 
The PGS agent observed and listened to the reactions of all crew present at the meeting and clearly heard the statements made by the Captain.
 
 
 
Those on board the Tai He prepared their own report in Chinese. The following is the translation of the report. 
 
M/V Tai He V157E moored at Kobe, Japan on 25 September 1998 at 0915. Two persons came onto the vessel. They said they were from PGS Company (see attached photocopies of their name cards) and asked for the Captain. They made representations to the Captain and said: on 18 September at 1605L, Tai He, in the midst of the XIN-DAL voyage, in the Bo Hai Gulf crossed astern of the scientific seismic exploration vessel Nordic Explorer and cut 7 cables that were towed by the vessel. Each cable was 3,500 m long, and about 1,000 m was cut. The seismic exploration vessel was 3,500 GT and there were six small Chinese boats protecting the seismic vessel. The two persons said that the seismic exploration vessel was on a course of 132[ordm ], speed was 5 knots. Visibility was about 1 mile. The seismic exploration vessel and the surrounding small boats discovered Tai He and had tried by VHF to call Tai He and fired flares. However, Tai He did not take avoidance action and caused the severance of the cables.
 
 
 
I immediately called the second officer Mei Ya Dong, Chief Officer Qu Jian Ping, assistant navigator Miao Jianquing in order to understand the situation. All 3 of them said: the visibility at the time was 4-5 miles, Tai He was on a course of 094[ordm ], speed 17.5 knots.
 
 
 
The second officer said: At a distance of about 6 miles, he observed on the radar the echo of a big vessel (port side about 8[ordm ]) and the echoes of some small boats (port side about 5[ordm ]). At a distance of about 4-5 miles, he used the binoculars and observed the big vessel and the small vessel (small dark shadows). The big vessel was behind the small boats (northwest). At 1555L, the second officer handed over the watch to the Chief Officer, and said that there was a big vessel and some small boats on the port side at a distance of 3 to 4 miles. The Chief Officer observed the radar, and then observed with a pair of binoculars. At 1554L, the Chief Officer ordered starboard 15 to the helmsman in order to give way on the right. At about 1606L, the vessel gave way to the big and small vessels. The CPA of the big vessel was more than 1 nautical mile and the CPA of the small vessel was about 0.8 nautical mile. No call was heard on the VHF and no signal flare was seen.
 
 
 
The Chief Officer and the assistant navigator said: at 1552L, the echo of a big vessel and some boats were seen on the radar. Immediately after that they used the binoculars and observed the vessels. The big vessel (white colour) was behind all the boats (orange colour), and it was not that the six boats surrounded the big vessel, as shown in the other party`s map. At 1555L, the Chief Officer order starboard 15[ordm ] to the helmsman until the ship`s heading was 117[ordm ], and then he ordered to steady the heading, and gave way to all the vessels on the port side of the Tai He. The CPA of the big vessel was at least 1 nautical mile, and the CPA of the small boats was at least 0.5 mile. No call was heard and no signal was seen. At 1606L, he ordered to go back to the original course. At 1608L, in order to give way to a crossing vessel which was 45[ordm ] on the port side 2 miles away and proceeding in a southwesterly direction. Tai He again altered course to starboard until GC113[ordm ]. When there was no danger of collision, Tai He returned to the original course of 094[ordm ].
 
 
 
We are of the view that the map of the other party was forged, and it was a sheer slanderous accusation. All their vessel and boats passed and was passed clear on the port side of Tai He Our vessel was moored again at a Chinese port. Why didn`t they come to look for us there?
 
 
 
The three navigators and the AB on duty all guarantee with their moral integrity that Tai He gave way to their investigation vessel and the boats on the left, there was no contact at all, and the CPA was more than 0.5 miles.
 
 
 
I hasten to add that all these matters by themselves are not helpful in deciding the issue of liability. They, however, show that the recollection of the officer of the Tai He one week after the incident was very different from their pleaded case and the subsequent evidence of the Chief. They demonstrated that the Chief Officer of the Tai He did not know what was happening and his propensity to fabricate in order to exculpate himself.
An objective analysis of all the evidence shows that the Chief Officer was not aware of the presence of the tail buoys in the vicinity. It is now necessary to look again at exh P4. The position of the `small boats orange` (in fact they were bright yellow) as marked by the Chief Officer of the Tai He in relation to his own vessel at 1602 hours measures a distance of one mile. At this distance he could not see the buoys because visibility was poor due to fog. He has already said that `owing to poor visibility it was not possible to ascertain the nature of the targets`. How then does he know that they were small orange boats. The situation at 1605 hours as illustrated by him would not have been any better. The next paragraph will show that this was a contrived version.
It is now necessary to look at exh P3 which was prepared by experts on my direction. It is to be observed at 1604 hours the Tai He is actually 3 cables distant from the nearest buoy. From 1601 hours the Tai He was on a converging course with the buoys. This was a mindless thing and no one aware of the moving buoys would do such a thing. The Chief Officer said that he assumed that they were fishing vessels. Fishing vessels are not small orange boats. Further, radar reflectors of the buoys would have echoed such strong images that they cannot be mistaken for fishing vessels. This leads me to conclude that the Chief Officer of the Tai He at no time was aware of the presence of buoys as such or as fishing vessels. He was merely navigating in response to the `big white vessel` as he visually observed her based on the estimate of a visibility of 4 to 5 miles mentioned in the report of 25 September 1998. That is the only rational and probable explanation for the manner of his navigation - at 1555 hours he alters course to starboard and once he gains a safe distance from the `big white vessel` he altered course to resume his original direction. That vessel (a Korean ship) was much farther away from the Tai He at that time. He would not have done so had he known that certain objects were on a converging course.
 Preliminary points of procedure 
 
 
 
It is now necessary to make certain observations on the rules of pleadings. The normal rules relating to pleadings as stipulated in O 18 of the Rules of Court do not apply to cases of collisions at sea between ships. In their stead the parties file documents called Preliminary Acts in accordance with O 70 r 17 of the Rules of Court. Preliminary acts take the place of pleadings.
The preliminary act consist of two parts. In the first part, the party sets out by way of answers standard but important information as stipulated in O 70 r 17(2) Part One of the Rules of Court. In Part Two, the party sets out any additional facts he relies on and `all allegations of negligence or other fault which the party filing the preliminary act makes`. One party does not sight the preliminary act of the other before he files his own preliminary act. Order 70 r 17 requires each preliminary act to be sealed by the court.
The preliminary acts serve three essential functions: First, they force the parties to state their version of the facts while they are fresh in their recollection; secondly, they force the parties to `plead blind` so as to `prevent them from shaping their case to meet the facts put forward by the other party`; thirdly, `statements in a preliminary act are admissions of fact, binding the party making them as strongly as any admission can.` See

In collision cases, more important than the preliminary acts are contemporaneous documentary evidence like the course recorder, the time log, the log books. Advances in technology enable the minutely detailed recording and reproduction of non-human events relating to collision. These documents facilitate an easy and accurate investigation of collisions. Further, these documents make it impossible for witnesses to fabricate or tailor their evidence to present a false case. In determining the issues before me I shall place great reliance on these documents and exh P3 which was prepared on the basis of information obtained from these documents.
Now I come to the most important practice of the admiralty court in collision cases. Although the contents of a preliminary act as admissions are binding on the party filing it, the court is not necessarily bound by them. The court must always ascertain the truth and act on it. This is the first philosophy of judicial process. The court cannot set its face against truth when it stares in front. The words of Lord Normand in 
The Geo W McKnight
 
[1947] 80 Lloyd LR 419
 at 423 eloquently express the practice of the court: `The court is not bound by the pleadings of parties and must proceed upon the evidence which it deems to be most accurate and trustworthy.` `Pleadings` here include preliminary acts.
Thus in 
The Lady Belle
 
[1933] P 275
[1933] 46 Lloyd LR 342
 the plaintiffs called no evidence and merely relied on the preliminary act of the defendants and their log books. The defendants submitted that they had no case to answer. The court held that their preliminary act was evidence and in any event their logs constituted indisputable evidence. Laugton J said that the preliminary acts `have the highest evidential value, are admissions and can be rightly used by the other side as admissions against the parties making them. The point was not perhaps of very great importance, because the same admissions and in the logs, and no one disputes for a moment that the logs are evidence.` Again in T
 he Geo W McKnigh 
t the court ignored the contents of a preliminary act and preferred to act on a letter written by the ship`s master to her owners because `there was no evidence more accurate and trustworthy than that letter`.
 Some uncontroverted facts 
 
 
 
It is appropriate now to record the following matters: 
(i) After the cables were severed, the plaintiffs retrieved the buoy-end of the severed cables. Measurement of the cut-off portion of the cables was taken. This gives the distance of the Tai He from each of the tail buoy when the cable was severed. This also gives the angle at which the Tai He slit through the water in relation to the line formed by the seven buoys. They did not form a cluster as alleged by the Chief Officer of the Tai He. This gives a distance of 4 cables from the first tail buoy and a distance of 8 cables from the last tail buoy. 
(ii) The GPS recorder of the Nordic Explorer recorded its positions at the relevant times. From this information the speed and course of the Nordic Explorer and the buoys can be accurately deducted. 
(iii) From the course recorder of the Tai He, the speed and course traced by it can be accurately ascertained.
Next, uncontroverted evidence from the plaintiffs established that there was a Korean vessel which approached the Nordic Explorers` community of vessels from her port side. The plaintiffs managed to divert that vessel. That vessel first altered course to starboard and then to port and passed astern of the 7 tail buoys. As a precautionary mean the streamer cables were dived to a depth of 17 metres. After the Korean vessel was no longer a threat to the cables and the buoys, the Nordic Explorer raised the cables. This was shortly before the Tai He slit through the water in front of the 7 buoys.
As stated earlier, on my direction the experts produced a vivid illustration of the movements of the two principal vessels and the buoys; see exh P3. This greatly facilitated the ascertainment of the true picture of what happened. It gave a bird`s-eye view of what happened.
 A major concession by the defendants 
 
 
 
By all accounts the Tai He passed in front of the tail buoys. According to the Chief Officer of the Tai He, there was a distance of some eight cables, that is close to one mile between the buoys and the Tai He. Given the length of the cables (that is 3.6 km), the Tai He by her own admission must have severed the cables unless the cables were sunk well below the draft of the Tai He. The cables were not so sunk. It is therefore an inevitable conclusion that the Tai He severed the cables.
In view of the above the defendants, at the eleventh hour, controverting their own vociferous assertion that they passed the cables and the survey vessel without contact conceded that the Tai He severed the cables. That concession by itself does not condemn the defendants since the cables being submerged were not visible to the human eye. I must therefore consider other evidence before me and derive my decision on liability. In order to do that I must set out certain rules of safe navigation which must be internalized by every competent navigator.
 Rules of caution 
 
 
 
At the time in question, the visibility was extremely restricted even though the sun had not set. There was a fog. Visibility was less than one mile. Small objects, tow lines and lights in particular in such condition would be practically inconspicuous. In other words vessels would not be visually in sight of one another. In such circumstance it would be reckless to make way at high speed. Speed must be reduced. Next the engines must be on standby in case of an emergency. Reliance on radar and VHF broadcast is imperative. Even then close-quarters situation and crossing ahead of converging vessels must be avoided at all costs. Certainty of the situation must be primary objective. Optimistic assumptions must be avoided: pessimistic assumptions should be preferred. These are the requirements of the Collision Regulations. These are also common sense rules of caution for the avoidance of collisions at sea. Strict adherence to these rules cannot be overemphasized because of the huge losses non-adherence to them can cause to property and human lives.
 Defendants were at fault 
 
 
 
Having stated the rules I hold that the defendants` servants were incompetent and indiligent in the navigation of the Tai He. They caused the Tai He to cut the cables because first they were blind to the presence of the cables, the buoys and the plaintiffs` other vessels. They should not have cut across in front of the moving buoys. There was no basis to assume that they were not under tow. Next they were indifferent to the plaintiffs` broadcast on Channel 16. They were also blind to the flares fired by the plaintiffs` vessel. It will be remembered that the master of the Tai He stated to Mr Cunningham on 25 September 1998 that `he would never take his ship through such a congested area`. Evidence before me showed that his Chief Officer did precisely that foolhardy thing when the situation was fluid and uncertain. In this regard I find that the witnesses of the defendants unreliable, untruthful and unintelligent as I shall now demonstrate.
It is to be remembered that they persisted at all times that the Tai He never severed the cables even though according to their own statements the Tai He passed in front of the tail buoys at a distance of about one mile. The cables were 3.6 km long (about 2.16 miles). In the result the cables must be cut. The Master and Chief Officer were unable to appreciate this simple logic because they were consumed by their own assumed infallibility. In consequence they threw overboard all the rules of caution I have mentioned.
It will be remembered that the Chief Officer, as illustrated in exh P4, at 1602 put the distance between the Tai He and the cluster of boats was 1 mile on his port beam when in fact it was 5 cables on his port bow on a converging course. At 1605 he gave the distance as 8 cables; in fact it was 4 cables. At 1603.5 they first buoy was not even 3 cables; and he never saw it. Obviously he was blind to their presence. He would have had no difficulty in sighting them at that distance with binoculars had he maintained an efficient radar and visual lookout.
According to the Chief Officer, the `big white vessel proceeding in her opposite direction as shown in exh P4 was in front of the tail buoys cutting across the cables. There was uncontradicted evidence that this was entirely untrue because that vessel (according to the plaintiffs a Korean vessel) passed the buoys at the rear and not in front of the buoys about ten minutes earlier.
These factors compel me to conclude that the Chief Officer was completely blind to the presence of the buoys and other vessels belonging to the plaintiff. He concocted the evidence about the cluster of vessel with the help of information provided by Mr Cunningham on 25 September 1998
There is a more likely explanation for the faulty navigation of the Tai He. It is to be noted that on 25 September 1998 those on board the Tai He prepared a report. That report contained the following statements. [Italics added]. 
 
All three of them said that visibility at that time was 4 to 5 miles.
 
 
 
At 1554 hours, the 2nd Officer handed over to the Chief Officer , informing him that a large ship and small ships, at a distance of 3 to 4 nautical miles were at port side. The Chief Officer observed on the radar and also using binoculars ...
 
 
 
A copy of the course recorder of TAI HE was attached to the report. It contained an indorsement in Chinese which in English read as follows: 
 
1555L hours on 18/9 record of TAI HE giving way with respect to 
 the survey vessel
.
 
 
 
The report at the end contained the following: `All 3 officers on watch and the AB have personally guaranteed that Tai He had passed the survey vessel and the small ships on the port side, and did not come into contact with either of the ships, which CPA was more than 0.5 nautical miles.`
The core substance of all these of course contradicted the truth and were in effect abandoned by the defendants. At no time Tai He gave way to the survey vessel. On a balance of probability the Tai He navigated merely in response to the Korean vessel`s movements and acted on extremely poor observation. . This is abundantly clear because those on board the Tai He made the wrong estimate of visibility of 4 to 5 miles. It was this erroneous estimate that was the probable cause of all the subsequent faults. These wrongs were breach of the rules of caution I have mentioned earlier.
The final and more important matter is the indifference of those on board the Tai He to the securite broadcast on Channel 16. There was no doubt at all that the broadcast was effected. Further, Mr Cunningham, in the he prepared on 25 September 1998 revealed this vital statement: 
 
The Officer who was on watch then stated 
 that whilst he heard urgent Navigation Warnings being issued via VHF radio, that he was nowhere near the NORDIC EXPLORER or her equipment
.
 
 
 
I have no doubt at all that Mr Cunningham recorded the truth. He impressed me as an honest witness. It was the plaintiffs` 
 coup de grace 
 against the defendants. The defendants` witnesses, of course, disowned that admission. They said that they never heard it. I found that the defendants witnesses had a marked propensity to dissemble - to disguise their faults and failures by tailoring their evidence. When all the evidence was analysed it became clear that those on board the Tai He were negligent and incompetent. That was the cause of the stray and negligent navigation of the Tai He. The Tai He ought to have reduced speed and maintained a better radar, visual and auditory watch. Had she done so the fact that the buoys were being towed would have been appreciated. There would have been more to properly assess the situation and the collision would have been averted altogether by a safe margin. The result was that the plaintiffs had made out their case against the defendants.
 Contributory negligence 
 
 
 
Having concluded that the defendants were negligent I now consider the charges of contributory negligence. I have found that the plaintiffs had made the `securite` broadcasts. It was not the defendants` case that there was no broadcast but that they did not hear them. To me this is unacceptable. I find that the plaintiffs employees made the broadcast and fired the flares. The Tai He crew were indifferent, if not oblivious, to the obvious objects in the vicinity. The Tai He was navigated in a fog area at high speed.
The plaintiffs` had just managed to divert the Korean vessel. The earliest time they could have realized that the Tai He became a threat was shortly after 1555 when she altered course to starboard. Effectively it was at about 1558. Then, unfortunately for them, those on board had another problem. They saw a `ghost` on the starboard bow on their radar. In the meantime before they could take stock of the real situation the Tai He was approaching a congested area at a breakneck speed of 17.5 knots in restricted visibility. It was a difficult situation to cope with - a moment of agony. This explains why the Tai He succeeded in getting away from the scene after severing the cables on 18 September 1998.
All said and done, when faced with a danger, especially when the danger is akin to a rogue elephant, the victim should take some steps for his self-protection. In this case, those on board the Nordic Explorer should have developed a knee jerk reaction of diving the cables as they did when the Korean vessel posed a threat. They should have done this even though the new situation was more complicated. They had sufficient time to do so. They failed to do so imprudently.
I find that the other allegations of contributory negligence were fustian. They lacked substance and the mark of merits.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In the result, after analyzing all the evidence and submissions I came to the conclusion that the defendants had to bear the greater part of the blame. I therefore held that they were to blame 60%. In doing so I deliberately was generous to them.

(delivering the judgment of the court): These are two appeals brought against a decision of the High Court [reported at 
[2000] 1 SLR 587
] in an action for infringement of trade mark and/or passing off where the learned trial judge dismissed the action and also dismissed the defendants` counterclaim that the plaintiffs` trade mark `SUPER COFFEEMIX` be expunged under s 39(1) of the Trade Marks Act or that the word `COFFEEMIX` in the trade mark should be disclaimed.
The first appeal, CA 184/99, is lodged by the plaintiffs against the dismissal of the action. The second appeal, CA 185/99, is brought by the defendants against the dismissal of their counterclaim. To avoid confusion, we shall hereinafter continue to refer to the parties as `plaintiffs` and `defendants` (where necessary, either as the first or second defendant as the circumstances may require).
The plaintiffs, a Singapore registered company, are the registered proprietors of the trade mark `SUPER & DEVICE COFFEEMIX` bearing registration number B2734/90 in respect of `coffee`. The plaintiffs were incorporated as a private limited company in 1991. Before the incorporation, the shareholders were operating as a partnership under the name Super Coffeemix Enterprises (the partnership). In 1994, the plaintiffs became a public listed company and its shares were traded on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.
The plaintiffs (including their predecessor, the partnership) were and are in the business of manufacturing and selling convenient food products, particularly coffee and cereal products. One of their main products is a 3-in-1 instant coffee mix, comprising a mixture of coffee, sugar and non-dairy creamer. This product, when mixed with hot water, produces an instant coffee drink. It was first introduced by the partnership in 1987. The product was sold to the public under the mark `SUPER COFFEEMIX`.
Since its first introduction, the demand for the product grew, so much so that in 1989, the partnership had to acquire new premises and machinery to cope with the increased orders. The plaintiffs (and their predecessor, the partnership) also expended considerable sums of money in promotion and advertising. Sales grew even more significantly. In 1993 the plaintiffs acquired a new and bigger factory.
The revenues from the sales of the product grew from $599,220.92 in 1987 to $8,267,930.62 in 1997. Their promotional and advertising expenses (covering all the plaintiffs` products and not just this product of 3-in-1 coffeemix) shot up from $17,363 to $6,060,247.45 during the corresponding period. Their advertisements appeared in print as well as on the television.
In the meantime, on 17 April 1990, the partnership applied to register in Part B of the Trade Marks Register their `SUPER & DEVICE COFFEEMIX` trade mark for `coffee` in Class 30. The application was allowed with a disclaimer over the word `SUPER`. In 1993, the mark was eventually registered in Part B and the registration backdated to 1990.
The first defendants are a Singapore incorporated company, while the second defendants, an Indonesian company, have their business address at Desa Tanjung Morawa B, Kabupaten Deli Serdang, Indonesia. The second defendants are the manufacturers of INDOCAFE coffee products in Indonesia while the first defendants are the distributors of those products in Singapore.
The second defendants registered their trade mark `INDOCAFE` in Part B of the Register on 23 November 1990 in respect of, inter alia, coffee. The first defendants have been selling INDOCAFE coffee products in Singapore since 1990. In July 1993, the first defendants began marketing a 3-in-1 mixture of coffee, sugar and non-dairy creamer under the `INDOCAFE` trade mark and which also bore the additional style `Coffeemix`.
We should add that when the plaintiffs first launched their `SUPER COFFEEMIX` into the market in 1987, there were other brands of coffee mix in the market. One such brand was `N-Rich` which in 1987 registered its trade mark `N-Rich` in Part B of the Register for, inter alia, `coffee mix`.
On 25 September 1995, the plaintiffs, through their solicitors, wrote to the first defendants informing the latter of the plaintiffs` rights in the trade mark, `SUPER & DEVICE COFFEEMIX`. In the letter, the plaintiffs requested the defendants to refrain from advertising, exporting, importing, distributing and selling products bearing the trade mark `Coffeemix`. However, the letter also expressly stated that there would be no objection if the first defendants were to use `Coffee Mix`as two words. After some exchanges of correspondence, the plaintiffs` request was rejected by the defendants.
The plaintiffs commenced these proceedings on 1 September 1998 against the defendants for trade mark infringement and for passing off of their goods as plaintiffs` product, SUPER COFFEEMIX. The plaintiffs sought, inter alia, an injunction restraining further infringement and passing off and an inquiry as to damages or alternatively an account of profits. They also claimed goodwill in the name `COFFEEMIX`. In their defence, the defendants denied any infringement or passing off, and counterclaimed to expunge the plaintiffs` registered trade mark or to impose a disclaimer over the word `COFFEEMIX` on the ground, inter alia, that it is descriptive of the nature of the product.
On the plaintiffs` product the mark is presented in this manner: the word `SUPER` is enclosed in a laurel device and below that is the word `COFFEEMIX` in big bold capital letters. The defendants` mark consists of `INDOCAFE` with the words `FROM THE HOUSE OF` in the form of an arch over it and the word `Coffeemix` below it in bigger print but not capital letters.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The learned trial judge held that `to constitute infringement of a registered trade mark, the infringing mark must be used as a trade mark indicative of the origin or identity of the goods.` Furthermore, its use must be likely to deceive or cause confusion.
While the defendants conceded that their mark `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` is used in a trade mark sense, the trial judge nevertheless held that the word `Coffeemix` on the packaging of the defendants was not used in a trade mark sense. He referred to the fact that the plaintiffs do not object to the defendants using the word `coffeemix` in two words and said, if `coffeemix` in two words are descriptive, they must be so even when joined together as one word.
The trial judge also referred to the fact that the plaintiffs themselves did not use the word `Coffeemix` in the trade mark sense in their promotional materials and advertisements. He did not think the defendants` mark is confusingly similar to the plaintiffs` registered trade mark and, relying upon s 46(2) of the Act, he ruled that there was no infringement.
As regards the claim in passing off, the trial judge felt that in order for the plaintiffs to succeed they must prove that the word `COFFEEMIX` is distinctive of their product and none others as at the date of the alleged infringement, ie July 1993. Relying upon the results of a survey carried out on behalf of the plaintiffs where 
(i) the vast majority of the interviewees who were aware of `SUPER` and `SUPER COFFEEMIX` did not regard `COFFEEMIX` as a brand; 
(ii) they did not regard the word `coffeemix` to refer only to the plaintiffs` products, and none others; and 
(iii) the plaintiffs` products were known either as `SUPER` or `SUPER COFFEEMIX` and not `COFFEEMIX` alone,
as well as the results of a survey carried out on behalf of the defendants which were to a similar effect, the trial judge decided that the plaintiffs had not established that the word `COFFEEMIX` had acquired a secondary meaning, indicating that that word mark had become distinctive of the plaintiffs` product. He also held that the survey results showed that there was really no confusion.
The learned trial judge dismissed the defendants` counterclaim to have the trade mark expunged or to have the word `COFFEEMIX` disclaimed on the ground that the defendants were not `aggrieved` persons within the meaning of s 39(1) of the Act. He did not go into the merits of the counterclaim.
 Issues on appeal 
 
 
 
Before us the plaintiffs contend that the trial judge was in error in the following main respects: 
(i) that the word `Coffeemix` on the defendants product, `INDOCAFE Coffeemix`, is not used in the trade mark sense; 
(ii) that the defendants` mark `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` is not likely to deceive or cause confusion and that the proviso to s 46(2) is applicable to the case.
The plaintiffs also submit that the trial judge was wrong to have found that the defendants had not committed the tort of passing off.
In relation to CA 185/99, the defendants` contention is that the trial judge was wrong to have held that the defendants were not an aggrieved party and that the counterclaim should not have been dismissed.
 Trade mark 
 
 
 
The plaintiffs do not dispute that `COFFEEMIX` has a descriptive quality. They concede that they have been using the word `Coffeemix` in a descriptive context together with other words like `3-in-1 instant` or `3-in-1` to connote that the product is a mixture of coffee, sugar and creamer. But they argue it does not follow that just because a mark is descriptive it cannot be a trade mark: see 
Crosfield & Sons` Application
 
[1909] 26 RPC 837
 at 857 and 
Thermawear v Vedonis
 
[1982] RPC 44
. Or that it cannot become distinctive: see 
Reddaway v Banham
 
[1896] AC 199
. Part B of the Register caters specifically for such descriptive marks. If a mark is an inventive one, it would have come under Part A of the Register.
We should mention that when the plaintiffs first applied for registration of the mark `SUPER & DEVICE COFFEEMIX` they sought registration under Part A of the Register and were willing to disclaim the use of the words `SUPER` and `COFFEE` separately. The Registrar refused registration in Part A on the ground that the mark had a direct and close reference to the character and quality of the goods. Instead, the plaintiffs were asked to consider registration under Part B and to furnish the evidence as to use. That was done. On 5 February 1993, the Registrar accordingly accepted registration under Part B, with a disclaimer in respect of the word `SUPER`.
We agree that while the word `COFFEEMIX` may be descriptive, it could no less be used as a trade mark. Part B of the Register is intended to cater for such descriptive marks. Looking at the packaging of the plaintiffs` product, this is the single most prominent word on it. It is obvious that the plaintiffs intended the word `COFFEEMIX` to be also a trade mark jointly with `SUPER`, consistent with the registration of the complete mark to be `SUPER & DEVICE COFFEEMIX`. A word mark can consist of one word or multiple words. Here it is a two-word mark `SUPER` and `COFFEEMIX`.
The crucial question for determination is whether the word `Coffeemix`, as used by the defendants on their product, is in the trade mark sense. It is only if the defendants have used the term `Coffeemix` on their product in the trade mark sense that there would be infringement. While the trial judge recognised that the complete trade mark of the defendants is `INDOCAFE Coffeemix`, he seemed to have accepted the defendants` contention that the word `Coffeemix` in itself on the product could not be a trade mark. In coming to the view that the single word `Coffeemix` is not used by the defendants as a trade mark, the trial judge would appear to have placed considerable emphasis on the fact that the word is descriptive and that the plaintiffs themselves had used the word `Coffeemix` to describe the product in their promotional literature and advertisements. He also seemed to place much importance on the fact that the word `Coffeemix` was followed by the words `3-in-1` indicating that the product comprised coffee, sugar and creamer.
With respect, we find the logic of the argument, that while the whole trade mark of the defendants` product is `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` the word `Coffeemix` is nevertheless not used as a mark, difficult to follow. The word `Coffeemix` is used as a part of the trade mark `INDOCAFE Coffeemix`. We do not see how it can be argued that the word `Coffeemix` viewed separately on the defendants` product is not being used as a mark.
We would further add that as far as the defendants are concerned, there is clear evidence that they have always intended to use `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` as the trade mark for their product. First, immediately after the plaintiffs` solicitors demanded that the defendants refrained from continuing with the infringement of their trade mark, the second defendants proceeded in Indonesia to apply for registration of `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` as a trade mark there. The second defendants even attempted to register `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` as a trade mark in Part A of the Register here without disclaiming `Coffeemix` initially. Secondly, the defendants` witness (PW2: Hadi Sofian Minaria, the Vice-President of the second defendants) admitted in his evidence in court that the defendants are using the words `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` in the trade mark sense.
In our opinion, whether a word which is essentially descriptive, when used on a product, is used in the descriptive sense or in the trade mark sense would depend very much on the way it is presented on the product. We think the intention of the manufacturer is an important factor, though that is not necessarily decisive. Here, having regard to the fact that on the defendants` product the word `Coffeemix` is presented most prominently, bigger in dimension than any other words on the package, and the admission by the defendants that they intended the style `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` to be used in the trade mark sense, we have to disagree with the learned trial judge that `Coffeemix` is not used by the defendants in the trade mark sense. We find that the word `Coffeemix` is used by the defendants in the trade mark sense.
The trial judge in coming to his decision that the word `Coffeemix` is not used in the trade mark sense relied upon two Australian decisions. First is 
 Johnson & Johnson Australia Pty Ltd v Sterling Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd 
 101 ALR 700; (1991) 21 IPR 1, where the respondent`s trademark was `Panadeine Caplets` and `Panadol Caplets` and they contended that the appellants had infringed their trademark by the use of the word `Caplets` on their packaging for Tylenol products. The Federal Court of Australia found that the appellants had used the word `Caplets` in the descriptive sense in respect of the shape and dosage and not as indicative of origin or identity and thus had not used the term as a trademark.
The second case is 
Pepsico Australia (t/a Frito-Lay Australia) Pty Ltd v Kettle Chip Co Pty Ltd
 
[1996] 33 IPR 161
, where the word in issue was the descriptive word `Kettle`. It was not disputed that the trademark `KETTLE` had acquired a secondary meaning indicative of the origin of the goods of the respondents. However, the Federal Court of Australia found the phrase `Double Crunch Kettle Cooked Potato Chips` used by the appellants on the front and back of their packaging merely described the process by which the `Thins` potato chips of the appellants were produced. It held that the appellants had not used the word `Kettle` as a trademark indicating the origin of the appellants` chips.
It must, however, be borne in mind that in both these cases, the relevant words `Caplets` and `Kettle` were not presented in the same manner as the word `Coffeemix` is on the defendants` packaging.
The UK trade mark case involving an identical name, 
COFFEEMIX TM
 
[1998] RPC 717
, where Simon Thorley QC sitting as the Appointed Person dismissed an appeal against the Registrar`s refusal to register `COFFEEMIX` for coffee preparations, coffee based beverages, etc was relied upon by the trial judge as indicating that `Coffeemix` could not have been used by the defendants as a mark. It is important to note that in this UK case, there was no evidence of any prior use. It did not relate to any question of infringement. It merely decided that `Coffeemix` is descriptive. That cannot be disputed. We would agree with the plaintiffs` counsel that the absence of prior use distinguished the UK 
 Coffeemix TM 
 case from our present case where the Registrar of Trade Marks, having been satisfied as to prior use, registered the plaintiffs` mark. In any event, in our opinion, this UK case cannot help answer the question whether the defendants have used the word `Coffeemix` in the trade mark sense in relation to their product.
 Is there an infringement of plaintiffs` mark? 
 
 
 
As we have found that the defendants have used the word `Coffeemix` in the trade mark sense, the next question to consider is whether by using `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` the defendants have infringed the plaintiffs` mark `SUPER & DEVICE COFFEEMIX.`
A mark is infringed even though the whole of it is not adopted by another trader, so long as an essential feature of the mark is so used by that trader. In determining whether there is infringement, one must look at the whole mark, both its distinguishing as well as its essential features. Here we would quote from 
 Kerly`s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names 
 (12th Ed) (hereinafter referred to as `
 Kerly`s 
`), where the learned authors summarised the position as follows (para 14-21): 
 
A mark is infringed by another trader if, even without using the whole of it, he uses one or more of its essential features. The identification of an essential feature depends partly on the court`s own judgment and partly on the burden of the evidence that is placed before it. Ascertainment of an essential feature is not to be by ocular test alone; it is impossible to exclude a consideration of the sound of words forming part or the whole of the mark. Thus, if a word forming part of a mark has come in trade to be used to identify the goods of the owner of the mark, it is an infringement of the mark itself to use that word as the mark, or part of the mark, of another trader. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
What is the essential feature of a mark is for the court to decide: 
De Cordova & Ors v Vick Chemical Co
 
[1951] 68 RPC 103
 at 105.
The fact that the defendants have inserted their own name to the word mark of the plaintiffs` does not necessarily mean that the defendants have not infringed the mark of the plaintiffs. The ultimate question is how significant that insertion is to the whole mark and whether it has sufficiently distinguished the defendants` mark from that of the plaintiffs`. A case which illustrated this is 
Associated Rediffusion v Scottish Television
 
[1957] RPC 409
 where the plaintiffs registered their mark `TV Times` in Part B. The defendants proposed to call their publication `Scottish T/V Times` or `Scottish Television Times`. The plaintiffs moved for the grant of an injunction to restrain the defendants from doing so. The court held that the juxtaposition of `TV` and `Times` was the essential feature of the plaintiffs` mark and the defendants had copied that essential feature. The fact that the defendants had added the word `Scottish` did not detract from this infringement.
Looking at the mark of the plaintiffs, it seems to us that the word `COFFEEMIX` is an essential feature of the registered mark and the defendants have, by using the identical word as a part of their mark, infringed the mark of the plaintiffs.
 Relief under s 46(2) 
 
 
 
We now turn to consider the question whether relief should be granted to the defendants under s 46(2) of the Act. That subsection provides that no injunction or other relief shall be granted to the plaintiffs if - 
 
the defendant establishes to the satisfaction of the court that the use of which the plaintiff complained is not likely to deceive or cause confusion or to be taken as indicating a connection in the course of trade between the goods or services and some person having the right either as proprietor or as registered owner to use the trade mark.
 
 
 
The burden clearly falls on the defendants to show that his case comes within that subsection.
The trial judge was satisfied that though both the plaintiffs` and the defendants` marks have a common word `Coffeemix`, he did not think, even assuming that the defendants did use the word `Coffeemix` as a mark, that it was likely to cause confusion. This was how he viewed the two marks: 
 
... the plaintiffs` mark is `SUPER COFFEEMIX` all in capital letters; the defendants` mark is `INDOCAFE Coffeemix`. Judging `both by their look and by their sound` they look different and sound different. The differences become apparent when one looks at the respective packagings. The defendants` packaging has a brown background with the words `FROM THE HOUSE OF INDOCAFE` on the front and back. In the plaintiffs` packaging, it is `SUPER` that is emphasized on the front and back.`
 
 
 
How a court should compare two marks to determine whether they are likely to cause confusion is put as follows by the learned authors of 
 Kerly`s 
 at para 17-07: 
 
In comparing the marks, the Registrar or the court, ... must, as appears from the authorities referred to below, take into account all the circumstances of the case and must consider whether, as a whole, the applicant`s mark is substantially different from the opponent`s.
 
 
 
The test in relation to the reasonable probability of deception under the predecessor to s 12(1) of the 1938 Act was summed up by Parker J in a case involving the comparison of two words, as follows: [ 
Pianotist
 
[1906] 23 RPC 774
 at 777]: `You must take the two words. You must judge them, both by their look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. In fact you must consider all the surrounding circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners of the marks.
 
 
 
In all cases as stated above, it should be borne in mind that a decision on the question whether a mark so nearly resembles another as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion is not an exercise of discretion by a tribunal but a finding of fact.`
 
 
 
The authorities also indicate that where two marks have common elements, the court would pay more regard to the parts that are not common. This was highlighted by Lord Russell in 
Coca Cola Co (Canada) v Pepsi-Cola Co (Canada)
 
[1942] 59 RPC 127
 as follows: 
 
Where you get a common denominator you must in looking at the competing formulae pay much more regard to the parts of the formulae which are not common although it does not flow from that that you must treat the words as though the common part was not there at all.
 
 
 
This same comment was echoed by Evershed MR in 
Broadhead`s Application
 
[1950] 67 RPC 209
 at 215.
A similar sentiment was also expressed in the earlier case, 
Harrods` Application
 
[1935] 52 RPC 65
: 
 
It is a well-recognised principle that has to be taken into account in considering the possibility of confusion arising between any two trade marks, that, where those two marks contain a common element which is also contained in a number of other marks in use in the same market, such a common occurrence in the market tends to cause purchasers to pay more attention to the other features of the respective marks and to distinguish between them by those features. This principle clearly requires that the marks comprising the common element shall be in fairly extensive use and, as I have mentioned, in use in the markets in which the marks under consideration are being or will be used.
 
 
 
There is really no one decisive test to determine similarity or deception. Neither do the decided cases provide any useful criteria on the amount of resemblance before it may be held sufficient to deceive or cause confusion. We think that is to be expected. It depends on the facts of each case. In 
Seixo v Prozende
 
[1866] LR 1 Ch 192
 Lord Cranworth recognised that when he said `What degree of resemblance is necessary ... is from the nature of things incapable of definition 
 a priori 
.` The standard also depends on the nature of the product. 
Harker Stagg`s TM
 
[1953] 70 RPC 205
, would appear to indicate that where pharmaceutical products were involved, the court would be more inclined to protect the public from the consequences of deception and confusion.
Reverting to the present matter, the question is whether, looking at the defendants` product packaging as a whole, is it likely to be confused with that of the plaintiffs` product. On the packaging of both parties, it is obvious that the most prominent word is `COFFEEMIX` though it is presented in an even more striking manner on the plaintiffs` packaging than the defendants`. To recap: on the plaintiffs` it is set out in bold capital letters in yellow; the other word `SUPER` pales in comparison. In the case of the defendants`, although the word `Coffeemix` is not in bold capital it is clearly the main word on the packaging while the other word `INDOCAFE`, which is in smaller font than `Coffeemix`, is in bold capital and is much more conspicuous than the way `SUPER` is presented on the plaintiffs` packaging. Above the word `INDOCAFE` are the words `FROM THE HOUSE OF` presented in the form of an arch; although these words are in even smaller font than `INDOCAFE`, they are visibly clear.
Emphasis is also placed by the plaintiffs on the other words that appear on the defendants` packaging. The expression `3-in-1` appearing on the defendants` packaging is not unlike that of the plaintiffs`. But the other things that appear on the packaging are quite different. The plaintiffs` packaging depicts three cups of coffee on a saucer and the defendants`, one cup and a saucer. The designs and colours of the cups and saucers are also different. Generally, the entire colour schemes of the two packaging are quite different.
References are also made by the plaintiffs to the similarities between the designs of the sachets of the plaintiffs` and the defendants` products. While there are similarities there are also very clear differences.
Taking an overall view, which we must, we would agree with the trial judge that the public is not likely to confuse the product of the defendants` with that of the plaintiffs`. The law expects the consumers to use ordinary care and intelligence: see 
Morecambe & Heysham Corp v Mecca
 
[1966] RPC 423
. In the case of an educated consumer he would be able, without difficulty, to differentiate one from the other. In the case of an illiterate consumer, or a Chinese educated consumer, as the plaintiffs contend their customers generally are, who goes by what he sees on the packaging, then as the graphic designs of the two packaging are quite distinct, it is doubtful that he is likely to be misled. We would further say that the fact that a consumer is Chinese educated does not mean that he does not possess the usual faculties to differentiate. In any case, as the finding whether a mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion is a question of fact, and as the trial judge had held that it is not likely to confuse, in the circumstances of the present case there is hardly any sufficient basis for us to disagree with him.
We would make one other observation. While the parties intended the word `COFFEEMIX` (whether fully in capital letters or otherwise) to have the character of a trade mark, and have presented it as such, we do not think the consumers have viewed it as such. The consuming public have really treated it as a product name, not unlike `Corn-Flakes` `Ice-Cream` or `Condensed Milk`. We are fortified in this view by the results of the surveys commissioned by the parties.
First is the survey carried out by Frank Small & Associates in October 1993 at the request of the plaintiffs. One of the objects was to study the usage of `3-in-1 Coffee Mixes`. Five hundred housewives were selected for the exercise. The survey showed that consumers were aware of the different brands of coffee mix in the market though the `Super` brand would appear to be more well known and more well used than the other brands - one in four housewives preferred Super 3-in-1 coffee mix than the other brands. Maxwell House even referred to their 3-in-1 product as `CoffeeMix` in one word. This survey is interesting because in the plaintiffs` mind they recognised that even in October 1993 there were many brands of coffee mix and the aim of the survey was to determine how well known/well used was the Super brand of coffee mix.
In July 1998, about two months before the institution of this action, a survey was carried out by Taylor Nelson Sofros (TNS), again commissioned by the plaintiffs. This showed that out of 500 persons polled, only 1% of the respondents who replied were aware of `COFFEEMIX` as a brand on first mention and 4% were aware of it as a brand. Only 75 persons (out of 500) believed that there was some connection between `coffeemix` of other brands and `SUPER COFFEEMIX`. Nine of the 75 thought so on the basis that the products belonged to the same company or manufacturer and only three thought that the products were from the same brand.
A third survey, the AMI survey, commissioned by the defendants in January 1999, shows that out of 300 persons polled: 
(a) 74% of the respondents perceived the word `Coffeemix` as a coffee product. 
(b) Only 3% of the respondents associated the word `Coffeemix` with the brand SUPER. 
(c) 57% of the respondents did not think that Indocafe Coffeemix and Super Coffeemix originate from the same manufacturer and 35% did not commit an answer to the question. 
(d) Only 7% of the respondents thought that Indocafe Coffeemix and Super Coffeemix originate from the same manufacturer. However, only a small minority of them attributed the confusion to the word `coffeemix`, and even so, these respondents were referring to `coffeemix` as a product.
It was clear that by 1993 there were many other brands of coffee mix. While most of the other brands had referred to their 3-in-1 product in two words (except for Maxwell House) and none so prominently as that shown on the plaintiffs` and the defendants` product, that could not detract from the fact that the market would have known that there were many brands of coffee mix. The plaintiffs said that they would not object if the defendants had used the word `Coffeemix` in two words. We are unable to see how that could really have made a difference. Whether `Coffeemix` appears as one or two words, both visually and audibly, they are to all intents and purposes the same. To us, it seems like a distinction without a difference. It is really a case of splitting hairs.
In this regard we would add that the plaintiffs have relied on three cases to argue that like in those three cases, there would be confusion in our present case. First is 
Eno v Dunn & Co
 
[1893] 10 RPC 261
, which was a passing off case and where the court granted an injunction to restrain the defendant from using the word `Fruit Salts` on their product `Dunn`s Fruit Salts`. The plaintiffs` product was called `Eno Fruit Salts`. Kekewich J said: 
 
It seems to me quite conceivable - and I am bound to bring my knowledge of mankind, sitting as a judge of fact in the position of a juryman, into it - that persons walking into a chemist`s shop, intending to buy Eno`s Fruit Salt, and seeing these tablets on the counter, would say perhaps, `that is a more pleasant form, I will try the tablets this time`; directly you get that into your mind - I confess I have desire to add that as my opinion, after the decision of the House of Lords and all was said by the different judges, it was the duty of Messrs Dunn to avoid the possibility occurring, and they must have been perfectly aware that they would be attacked if they tried to use anything that infringed on Mr Eno`s right, if they tried to deceive the public ...
 
 
 
The second is 
Perry v Truefitt
 
[1862] 6 Beav 66
, again a passing off case, which was concerned with the `Medicated Mexican Balm`. There the plaintiffs` product was called `Perry Medicated Mexican Balm` and the defendants`, `Truefitt`s Medicated Mexican Balm.` The court held that `Medicated Mexican Balm` had become a trade mark and the defendants had no right to use that.
The third case is 
Associated Rediffusion v Scottish Television
 
[1957] RPC 409
 which we have referred to above.
With regard to 
 Eno v Dunn and Perry v Truefitt 
 we would make these observations. First, those two cases related in a sense to medicinal product. Second, they are very old cases and the social and educational conditions of the population then in England would be quite different from what those conditions were in Singapore a hundred years later in 1993. Third, whether there would be confusion or deception would depend on the circumstances of each case, and in the light of the considerations referred to in [para ] 43-51 above, we are satisfied that the defendants have made out a case under s 46(2). The third observation also applies equally to the case 
 Associated Rediffusion v Scottish Television 
. We would further add that whereas in that case, the term `TV Times` was used by the plaintiffs solely, in our case here, by 1993, when `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` came into the market, the term `coffeemix` whether in one or two words had been used widely by other manufacturers of coffee mix.
 Passing off 
 
 
 
We now turn to the claim in passing off. To succeed in this claim, the plaintiffs here must prove that first, they have acquired goodwill in relation to the product under the `COFFEEMIX` mark alone; second, there is misrepresentation, and third, there is damage: see 
Reckitt & Colman Products v Borden
 
[1990] 1 All ER 873
.
The trial judge held that the plaintiffs must prove that the word `COFFEEMIX` was distinctive of their goods, and none others at the relevant date, namely, July 1993 which was the date the defendants introduced their 3-in-1 `Coffeemix` into the market. The plaintiffs contend that the test applied by the trial judge was too high and thus erroneous.
From the sales and advertising figures tendered at the trial, it is clear that the plaintiffs had by July 1993 acquired goodwill in the mark `SUPER COFFEEMIX` in relation to the 3-in-1 instant coffee product. The critical question that remains is whether the plaintiffs had by then also acquired goodwill in the mark `COFFEEMIX` by itself. On this, there is hardly sufficient evidence to show that the public had regarded `COFFEEMIX` alone as the mark which linked the product to the plaintiffs. The evidence on sales and advertising cannot assist the plaintiffs on this as they relate to the entire mark `SUPER COFFEEMIX` and not to `COFFEEMIX` alone. The plaintiffs never sold or promoted their product simply as `COFFEEMIX`. As mentioned before, the TNS survey showed that only 1% of the respondents who replied were aware of `COFFEEMIX` as a brand on the first mention and 4% were aware of it as a brand. The AMI survey also showed pretty much the same picture. Only 11% of the respondents perceived the word `Coffeemix` as a brand, and only 3% associated the word `Coffeemix` with the `SUPER` brand.
In the evidence of Gordon Stewart (PW3), the Managing Director of TNS, he gave the following answer to the specific question: 
 
 
Q: The findings in para 15.1 and 15.2 do not show that the word `Coffeemix` denotes the plaintiff`s product? 
 
A: Correct.
  
 
 
There is another problem in the way of the plaintiffs` claim in passing off. The plaintiffs must show that that part of the mark alone `COFFEEMIX`, which is descriptive in nature, has become distinctive of the plaintiffs` product. Distinctiveness is a term of art in the law of passing off. 
 Wadlow on The Law of Passing Off 
 (2nd Ed) explains it in this way at para 6.02: 
 
Matter such as a name, mark or get-up is said to be distinctive if it denotes the goods of the plaintiff to the exclusion of other traders. It is the significance which the relevant public attaches to the supposed mark which is all important. Matter which is not relied on by the public in this way is not in law distinctive, irrespective of how novel, striking or different it may be.
 
 
 
As mentioned before, the word `Coffeemix` is clearly descriptive. Unlike an inventive word it would be harder to acquire distinctiveness in relation to a descriptive word. The evidential burden placed on a plaintiff in such a case would be higher, but it would not be impossible to establish it: see the decisions of this court in 
CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac Marina
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 550
  and 
Lifestyle 1.99 Pte Ltd v S$1.99 Pte Ltd
 
 
[2000] 2 SLR 766
  at [para ] 34-46.
PW3`s evidence on this is very telling (NE61-62): 
 
 
Q: See your para 16.3, of the 36 people, 18 associated `Coffeemix` with plaintiffs` brand, this means that the other 18 associated `Coffeemix` with some other brands? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On this finding alone, it would show that the word `Coffeemix` does not refer to plaintiffs` goods only and none other? 
 
A: Correct.
  
 
 
Furthermore, where a mark is descriptive, minor differences would be held to be sufficient to distinguish: see 
Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminster Window and General Cleaners
 
[1946] 63 RPC 39
. The plaintiffs` product is known as `SUPER COFFEEMIX` and the defendants`, `INDOCAFE Coffeemix`. This should suffice to differentiate. And if we examine the get up of the packaging of the two products, they are also different, both in terms of design and colour scheme. While it may well be that when a person purchases `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` he may not have in front of him a `SUPER COFFEEMIX` product to make an accurate comparison, we seriously doubt he would be confused. Furthermore, in the context of a population which is becoming more literate, there would not be any real difficulties to differentiate.
In this regard, there is a further point we wish to make. It relates to both the elements of misrepresentation and damage. From July 1993, when the defendants` product appeared on the market, up to the date of the trial, was a period of more than five and a half years. Yet there is no evidence that during that long period any consumer had been deceived, having bought `INDOCAFE Coffeemix` when he was thinking of `SUPER COFFEEMIX`. This shows that either the consumers were not bothered which particular brands of coffeemix they purchased or they were more discerning than the plaintiffs are prepared to accept.
In the premises, we agree with the learned trial judge that the plaintiffs failed to establish a claim in passing off.
 Counterclaim on disclaimer 
 
 
 
We now turn to CA 185/99. Here the defendants contend that the word `COFFEEMIX` in the plaintiffs` registered trademark should be disclaimed under s 39(1)(a) of the Act, read with s 16 or s 20. Initially, at the trial, the defendants also sought to have the entire trade mark expunged from the Register. Towards the close of the trial, they asked only for a disclaimer in respect of the word `COFFEEMIX`. We will now set out the relevant statutory provisions:
 
 
39
 
(1)
 
Subject to the provisions of this Act -
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
 
the court may on the application in the prescribed manner of any person aggrieved by the non-insertion in or omission from the register of any entry, or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause, or by any entry wrongfully remaining on the register, or by any error or defect in any entry in the register, make such order for making, expunging or varying the entry as it thinks fit;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16
 
(1)
 
Subject to this section, the registration of a trade mark shall not be deemed to have become invalid by reason only of any use after the date of the registration of a word or words which the trade mark contains, or of which it consists, as the name or description of an article, substance or service.
 
 
 
 
(2)
 
Subsection (3) shall have effect where -
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
 
there is a well-known and established use of the word or words as the name or description of the article, substance or service by a person or persons carrying on a trade in that article, substance or service, not being used in relation to goods or services connected in the course of trade with the proprietor or a registered user of the trade mark or, in the case of a certification trade mark, in relation to goods or services certified by the proprietor; or
 
 
 
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3)
 
Where the facts mentioned in subsection 2(a) or (b) are proved with respect to any word or words, then -
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
 
if the trade mark consists solely of that word or those words, the registration of the trade mark so far as regards registration in respect of the article or substance or of any goods of the same description, or of the services or of any services of the same description, as the case may require, shall be deemed for the purposes of section 39 to be an entry wrongly remaining on the register;
 
 
 
 
 
(b)
 
if the trade mark contains that word or those words and other matter, the court or the Registrar, in deciding whether the trade mark shall remain on the register, ... may, in the case of a decision in favour of the trade mark remaining on the register, require as a condition that the registered proprietor shall disclaim any right to the exclusive use of that word or those words ...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20
 
If a trade mark contains parts not separately registered by the proprietor as trade marks, or if it contains matter common to the trade, or otherwise of a non-distinctive character, the Registrar or the court, in deciding whether the trade mark shall be entered or shall remain upon the register, may require as a condition of its being upon the register that the proprietor shall disclaim any right to the exclusive use of any part or parts of the trade mark, or of all or any portion of such matter, to the exclusive use of which the Registrar or the court holds him not to be entitled, ...
 
 
 
 
Provided that no disclaimer on the register shall affect any rights of the proprietor of a trade mark except such as arise out of the registration of the trade mark in respect of which the disclaimer is made.
 
 
 
 
The defendants assert that there is `a well known and established use` by the trade of the word `Coffeemix` as the name or description of the product consisting of coffee-sugar-creamer, 3-in-1, within the meaning of s 16(2)(a) and that the word `Coffeemix` is also common to the trade and of a non-distinctive character within the meaning of s 20.
There are two main issues arising out of the counterclaim, namely: 
(i) whether the trial judge was correct to hold that the defendants are not an aggrieved party within the meaning of s 39(1); 
(ii) whether the word `Coffeemix` on the plaintiffs` registered trade mark should be disclaimed under s 16 and/or s 20.
 Aggrieved party 
 
 
 
Following from his finding that the defendants had not infringed the plaintiffs` mark, the trial judge, relying upon 
Cheng Kang Pte Ltd v Sze Jishian
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 214
 , dismissed the counterclaim on the technical ground that the defendants were not an `aggrieved` person within the meaning of s 39(1)(a) as the defendants were not someone whose `legal right are affected` by the mark being entered onto the Register.
We think, with respect, that the trial judge had taken too narrow a view of the term `aggrieved` parties. In 
Appollinaris Co`s TM
 
[1891] 2 Ch 186
[1891] 8 RPC 137
, Fry LJ explained the scope of the equivalent English provision as follows: 
 
In our opinion, when one trader uses the fact of registration as any part of his case against another trader in any legal proceedings, that second trader is aggrieved, and this is not the less so because the trader may have other means of defending himself. If the owner of the registered trade mark says to a defendant in a litigation, `I am the owner of this registered trade mark, and therefore you are doing me a wrong`, the person attacked ought to be at liberty to reply two things: first, `You ought not to be on the register,` and secondly, `Even if you ought, I have done you no wrong.` The completeness of the second line of defence ought not to preclude the attacked person from availing himself of the first.
 
 
 
That this statement of Fry LJ still represents the law can be seen from the fact that in 
 Kerly`s 
, at para 11-07, it is stated that: 
 
An alleged infringer of a mark is always a person aggrieved by its registration.
 
 
 
Even a trade rival would be an aggrieved person - per Fry LJ in 
 Apollinaris Cos TM 
 at [1891] 2 Ch 186, 229; (1891) 8 RPC 137, 160. This was reaffirmed by Lord Herschell in 
Re Powell`s TM
 
[1894] 11 RPC 4
 where he said at pp 7-8: 
 
My Lords, I should be very unwilling unduly to limit the construction to be placed upon these words; because, although they were no doubt inserted to prevent officious interference by those who had no interest at all in the Register being correct, and to exclude a mere common informer, it is undoubtedly of public interest that they should not be unduly limited, inasmuch as it is a public mischief that there should remain upon the Register a mark which ought not to be there, and by which many persons may be affected, who, nevertheless, would not be willing to enter upon the risk and expense of litigation.
 
 
 
Whenever it can be shown, as here, that the applicant is in the same trade as the person who has registered the trade mark, and whenever the trade mark, if remaining on the register, would, or might, limit the legal rights of the applicants, so that by reason of the existence of the mark upon the register, he could lawfully do, it appears to me that he has a locus standi to be heard as a person aggrieved.
 
 
 
In 
Daiquiri Rum TM
 
[1969] RPC 600 at 615
 Lord Pearce explained as follows the philosophy behind the Trade Marks Act and why the word `aggrieved` should be given a broad sense: 
 
In my opinion, the words were intended by the Act to cover all trade rivals over whom an advantage was gained by a trader who was getting the benefit of a registered trade mark to which he was not entitled. At common law a trader could ask the courts to protect him from the improper use of his mark by others who would pass off their goods as his. But to do this he had to establish by cogent evidence from the purchasing public and the trade that the mark had come to denote his goods and his alone. To avoid the paraphernalia of proof and to help traders by enabling them to see more clearly where they stood in respect of particular marks the Trade Marks Acts were passed. It is, and was intended to be, a great advantage to a trader to have his mark registered under the Acts. That advantage to him is to some extent a corresponding disadvantage to his rivals. He was only intended to have it if the necessary qualifications are fulfilled. If they are not, the mark is not to be entered on the register. If it subsequently appears that it is wrongly on the register, it is to be removed. For to permit it to remain would give him, at the expense of his rivals, an advantage to which he is not entitled. Thus, the general intention and policy of the Act show, I think, that Parliament intended the words to have a wide meaning. If an erroneous entry gives to his rival a statutory trade advantage which he was not intended to have, any trader whose business is, or will probably be, affected thereby is `aggrieved` and entitled to ask that the error should be corrected.`
 
 
 
It seems to us that the trial judge was mistaken in his appreciation of the decision in 
 Cheng Kang 
 where the learned judge there (Rubin JC, as he then was) in fact agreed, after reviewing the authorities, that a wide definition should be given to the term `aggrieved` person. The trial judge`s approach, that a defendant who succeeds in defending an action for trade mark infringement and/or passing off would not be an `aggrieved` person because his legal rights would not have been affected, would run counter to the reasoning propounded by Fry LJ in 
 Appollinaris Co`s TM 
. We would add that counsel for the plaintiffs, in his written case, did not support the narrower view taken by the trial judge.
 Is s 16(2) or 20 applicable? 
 
 
 
The first question to consider is the scope of s 16, which is certainly not a straightforward provision. The English equivalent of the provision is s 15 of their Trade Marks Act, 1938. Fortunately, in 
Daiquiri Rum TM
 
[1969] RPC 600
 the House of Lords had the occasion to consider their s 15. This was what Lord Reid said (at p 609-610): 
 
Section 15 has been said to be obscure and ambiguous. I think that is much too harsh a criticism. Its structure may be unusual, and it does require some analysis to arrive at its meaning, but I think after careful study its meaning becomes reasonably clear. It refers to trade marks which consist of or include a word or words, and deals with the case where, after registration of such a trade mark, such word or words have come to be used as the name or description of `an article or substance`. If the word or words have come to be so used by the public at large, that does not matter; but if they have come to be regularly so used by a person or persons carrying on a trade in that article or substance, then subsection 2 has to be applied.
 
 
 
It may be helpful to bear in mind the facts in 
 Daiquiri Rum 
. There, the trade mark Daiquiri Rum was registered in 1922. Thereafter, the word `Daiquiri` came to be regularly used in England by those selling cocktails as the name of a cocktail of which the main ingredient was light rum, which was more often BACARDI rum than rum sold under the trade mark. That having been proved, the House held that the registration was an entry wrongly remaining on the register and ordered its removal.
In relation to s 20, the defendants based their case on the fact that part of the trade mark, namely, `Coffeemix`, contains matter common to the trade or that it is of a non-distinctive character. The defendants have equated `common to the trade` in s 20 with that of `well known and established use` in s 16(2)(a). There is clear evidence that the owners of `N-Rich` applied to register in Part B their mark in June 1987 in respect of, inter alia, `instant coffee mix`. This meant that the owners of `N-Rich` would have tendered evidence to show that they had used that mark to sell coffee mix for a period of two years before their application for registration.
As early as in February 1989, a media report stated that there were five brands of coffee mix on sale in Singapore under the heading `when coffee, sugar and milk come in one`. They were: 
(i) N-Rich Instant Coffee Mix; 
(ii) Owl 3-in-1 Instant Coffee Mix; 
(iii) Super Coffeemix 3-in-1 Instant Coffeemix; 
(iv) GoldRoast 3-in-1 Instant Coffee Mix; 
(v) Randall`s Coffee Mix.
Apparently, a year later, Nescafe and Maxwell House also introduced a coffee mix product. All these were there before the plaintiffs applied to register their mark. At some point in time Maxwell House even called their product `coffeemix` in one word.
Subsequent to the plaintiffs` application to register the mark, other manufacturers had also introduced such a 3-in-1 product. They included the following: 
(i) Mr Caf,`s 3-in-1 Instant Coffee Mix; 
(ii) Ye Ye 3-in-1 Instant Coffee Mix; 
(iii) Hosen 3-in-1 Coffee Mix; 
(iv) Goldkili 3-in-1 Instant Coffee Mix; 
(v) INDOCAFE Coffeemix 3-in-1 Coffeemix; 
(vi) Coffeeking 3-in-1 Coffeemix; 
(vii) Eagle King 3-in-1 Coffeemix; 
(viii) Boss Coffee 3-in-1 Coffeemix.
However, there is also evidence that by the time of the trial, some of the earlier brands, eg Randall`s, N-Rich and Maxwell House, had ceased production of the product.
Apart from the three surveys mentioned earlier, evidence on one other survey was also tendered to court. This was carried out in October 1992 on behalf of the owners of the `Owl` brand where out of nine brands of coffee mix identified, seven of them used the term `3-in-1 coffee mix`. The October 1993 survey by Frank Small & Associates listed eight brands of such products and they all used the expression `3-in-1 coffee mix`. The TNS and AMI surveys also depicted a similar picture.
What all these surveys show is that in 1993, as well as in 1998/99, the term `coffee mix` was used to indicate or describe a product consisting of coffee, sugar and creamer which upon mixing with hot water produced an instant coffee drink. In the light of the evidence, we are satisfied that the term `coffee mix` was and is common to the trade, and it is well known and established in the trade to indicate or describe the product. While we recognise that the plaintiffs have combined `coffee mix` into one word, we would reiterate that we are unable to see what difference there is whether the term `coffee mix` is presented in two words or one word. The audio impact is identical and the visual impact is hardly distinguishable.
The question that remains is, in the light of what has been established, whether this court ought under s 39(1)(a) read with s 16(2), or under s 20, order a disclaimer in respect of the word `coffeemix`. Furthermore, even if it is shown that s 16(2)(a) and/or s 20 are satisfied, does this court still have a discretion not to order such a disclaimer? It seems to us that by the use of the terms such as `may` and `as it thinks fit` in s 39(1)(a), the court has a discretion in the matter. In s 20, one also finds a similar discretionary expression `may require`. The court is, therefore, entitled to consider all the circumstances in coming to its decision.
The authorities would appear to indicate that whether the court should exercise its discretion to order the expunging of a registered mark, or that a word in the mark be disclaimed particularly when deception is shown, depends not so much on the conduct of the applicant but on a balancing of the interests of the public on the one hand and those of the registered mark owner on the other. The merits or demerits of the applicant are irrelevant in this regard: see 
Hill`s TM
 
[1893] 10 RPC 113
.
In the local case 
Davidoff Extension SA v Davidoff Commercio e Industria Ltd
 
 
[1987] SLR 462
  the mark `Davidoff` was registered by the respondents. In truth, this name originated from the applicant, an established Swiss company, and that name, in association with the applicant, had gained an extensive reputation. The respondents applied for registration of the mark in September 1978 and the application was approved in October 1980. In the meantime, the applicant`s products were introduced into Singapore in 1979. The respondents` actual use of the mark in Singapore commenced only in September 1982. At the time of their application for registration, the respondents were aware of the prior claim to proprietorship of the mark by the applicants. They were not able to explain their choice of the `Davidoff` trade mark. FA Chua J ordered the mark be expunged from the Register. He said: 
 
It is clear from the authorities that the court always has a discretion under s 39 to rectify or not in the light of all the circumstances of the case. The merits or demerits of the applicants are of little relevance, at least where a likelihood of confusion is established, as the question is not between the applicants on the one hand and the respondents on the other, but between the public and the respondent.`
 
 
 
In Australia, the High Court in 
Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd v GF Heublein & Bro Inco
 
[1960] 103 CLR 422
 had the occasion to consider a provision in the Australian statute where it was provided that the court may, if there had been no bona fide user of a registered trade mark for three years, order its removal. It ruled that the primary consideration to the question of expunging was public interest rather than the unmeritorious conduct of the applicant and that such public interest would generally be better served by rectifying the register.
In relation to the present application, the fault that one can place at the door of the defendants is only in respect of their delay in applying to disclaim the word `coffeemix`. They could have done so in 1993 when they introduced their coffeemix brand in Singapore or in 1995 when the plaintiffs wrote to ask them to refrain from using the word `coffeemix` as one word. As the authorities indicate, the conduct of the applicant is not a relevant consideration. In Continental Liqueurs the delay on the part of the applicant in applying for the removal was raised as a ground for the court to take into account in exercise of its discretion whether to order a removal. The Australian High Court reaffirmed the views expressed in 
 Hill`s TM 
 that the issue was really one between the respondent and the public and not only between the respondent and the applicant and ordered the removal none the less.
We would, therefore, order that the word `coffeemix` in the plaintiffs` mark be also disclaimed. While we recognise that this would mean that both the words in the plaintiffs` mark are disclaimed, this would not be unlike the position on those trade marks such as `Singapore Airlines` and `British Airways`. Neither does it mean that any other manufacturer/trader is at liberty to pass off their `coffee mix` product as that of the plaintiffs`. It will all depend on the get up of the packaging, which in turn will determine if there is misrepresentation.
 Judgment 
 
 
 
In the result, the appeal in CA 184/99 is dismissed. We would allow the appeal in CA 185/99 and order that the word `coffeemix` in the registered mark of the plaintiffs be disclaimed. On the question of costs, we would award the defendants only 75% of the costs of the appeal, as the defendants have failed on the point that the word `Coffeemix` is not used as a mark by them. The security for costs in CA 184/99 (with interest, if any) shall be paid out to the defendants or their solicitors to account of the latter`s costs. As for CA 185/99, the defendants shall be entitled to the costs of the appeal as well as those for the hearing below. The security for costs in CA 185/99 (with interest, if any) shall be refunded to the defendants.

 The claim 
This is a claim for conversion of a parcel of marine gas oil (MGO) which was in the tanks of a tanker ship called `Tokai Maru`. There is an additional claim for conversion of bunkering equipment and provisions. The claimants, Kohap (Hong Kong) Ltd, were sub-time-charterers of the tanker. The defendants were the owners of the tanker. There is an alternate claim for breach of duty based on bailment.
 The ship purchases 
 
 
 
The principal players of this case are two businessmen: Albert Lim Liang Chai and Johnny Tay Siong Siew. Their business was shipowning and ship-operation. To get a full factual matrix it is necessary to travel back in time a little.
On 22 November 1991 three tankers were sold by companies controlled by Albert Lim to companies controlled by Johnny Tay. The particulars are as follows:

Johnny Tay`s companies will be collectively called `the Cotan companies`.
Johnny Tay and Madam Yap Hong Luan [commat] Ernie Surjati Djapri (`Ernie Yap`) were the directors of the Cotan companies which purchased the three vessels. As such they signed a guarantee for the outstanding amount in respect of each purchase.
 The main charterparty 
 
 
 
The defendants, Sea Sources Trading Pte Ltd, the owners of the Tokai Maru at the relevant time were a Singapore company. By a time charterparty dated 2 February 1994 they chartered out the ship to Cotan Petroleum Pte Ltd. It was for a period of one year with an option for another year. The time-charter was in the standard form of SHELLTIME-4 with additional clauses.
Clause 13 provided, inter alia, that `The master (though appointed by the Owners) shall be under the orders and direction of the vessel, agency and arrangements and shall sign bills of lading as charterers or their agents may direct`.
Clause 18 and 46 of the main charterparty permitted sub-letting of the ship.
Clause 48 provided, inter alia, that `the vessel is to be delivered in a suitable condition for loading of the charterer`s intended cargo and to be redelivered in the condition as delivery`.
Clause 49 provided that `The cargo is to be discharged into fishing vessels in the open Pacific and Indian Ocean and Arafura Sea and other acceptable area according to and charterers` instructions to the Master of the vessel during the voyage.`
Clause 57 provided that `The owner will agree to provide 16 crews members, ie including four Korean-Chinese crews subject to availability`.
 The sub-time-charter 
 
 
 
Cotan Petroleum Pte Ltd as charters/owners let, that is to say sub-let the tanker to `Kohap (Hong Kong) Limited or nominees`. The sub-time-charter charterparty was also in SHELLTIME-4 form. In the result, the main charterparty and the sub-charterparty contained several common clauses.
The charterers did not reveal the particulars of the sub-charter or the sub-charterparty - nor even their name to the owners. This was normal because charterers as a rule would not want the owners to know the rate of hire of the sub-charter. Further, if the owners got to know the sub-charterers there is a risk of the owner and sub-charterer by-passing the charterer in future business.
 Withdrawal of the vessel 
 
 
 
The tanker was delivered to the time-charterers and, therefore, in turn to the sub-charterers on 17 March 1994. The tanker operated mainly in international waters. While the tanker was on charter service, the charterers paid to the owners the hire for the first month but failed to pay hire for the second month. On account of this the owners withdrew the tanker from charter - that is to say they brought the charter to an end alleging breach by charterers.
At the time of the withdrawal there remained on board the `Tokai Maru` a cargo of marine gas oil (MGO) and equipment which had been placed on board the tanker pursuant to terms of the sub-charter and the charter. They were: 
(a) marine gas oil (MGO) 
(b) refrigerator oil 
(c) bunkering equipment 
(d) provisions 
(e) two water makers
The agents of the sub-charterers Wonjin International asked the charterer to arrange for the transfer of the MGO and equipment. This did not materialise. (More will be said about this later). The sub-charterers` personnel, however, left the tanker.
 Indebtedness of Cotan Companies and set-off 
 
 
 
At this time the Cotan companies were indebted to Albert Lim`s companies fully $500,000. It had been outstanding for some time. The debt was in respect of the tankers purchased by the Cotan companies from Albert Lim companies as stated in [para ] 3. It is to be remembered that Johnny Tay and Ernie Yap by reason of the personal guarantees were jointly and severally liable to Albert Lim companies for the debts.
In these circumstances, Albert Lim, on behalf of the owners arranged for the sale of the MGO on board the `Tokai Maru`. At the time of the withdrawal the amount of bunkers on board was 905.39 m.t. From this he deducted 39.612 mt as this was the quantity of bunkers on board at the time of delivery. The quantity sold was therefore 865.778 m.t. He further arranged for the proceeds of the sale of the MGO $212,433.53 to be set-off against the moneys due to Hozun Oil in respect of the sale of the `Sea Endeavour`.
In late May 1994 the name of `Tokai Maru` and its ownership were changed. The new name was `Endurance 1`. Following this the tanker was chartered out. There was a mention that the new charter rate was US$3,500 per day.
 Wonjin claims against Cotan 
 
 
 
The next significant events were a fax on 10 May 1994 and two faxes on 16 May 1994 from Wonjin International to Cotan Petroleum on asking for the transfer of the MGO and other things and holding the latter liable for the MGO and other things that remained on board the `Tokai Maru` Then on 10 June 1994 Wonjin International issued three invoices to Cotan Petroleum. They were in respect the MGO, the refrigerator oil, the bunkering equipment and provisions on board the `Tokai Maru`. The invoices gave the bank account particulars to which Cotan Petroleum was required to remit the value. Cotan Petroleum never remitted the money.
Nothing significant happened for more than a year. Johnny Tay and the Cotan companies had paid nothing to Wonjin International or Albert Lim`s companies. He also had other creditors chasing him, that is the Cotan companies.
 Seawell sues Johnny Tay 
 
 
 
In these circumstances, Seawell Petroleum Pte Ltd on 22 June 1995 issued a writ against Johnny Tay and Ernie Yap claiming S$138,888.96 - Suit 1060/95. This was based on the guarantee signed by them on the debt of Cotan Energy &Trading (S) Pte Ltd on account of the purchase of the `Sea Enterprise`. An application for summary judgment was taken out - Johnny Tay filed an affidavit to resist the indefensible claim. This was what he said on the affirmation of his affidavit. [All italics supplied by me]. 
 
On 31 March 1995, the sellers rendered to the buyers a statement of account showing that S$541,755.68 was still owing from the sellers to the buyers under the said agreements as at 31 March 1995. There is now produced and shown to me in a bundle marked TSS-3, a copy of the buyers statement of account dated 31 March 1995 and invoices attached thereto. The defendants dispute the statement of account alleging that S$541,755.68 was due to the buyers in respect of the sale of the 3 vessels. The defendants will contend that the correct amount remaining unpaid to the sellers in respect of the sale of the 3 vessels to the buyers was S$527,777.62, which is the aggregate sum of 20 monthly instalments of S$26,388.88 each. Within the said statement of account itself, the buyers had given to the sellers credit a sum of S$212,433.53. The said sum of S$212,433.53 was allegedly the proceeds of sale of 865.748 mt of marine gas oil (hereinafter `MGO`) which was laden on board the mt Tokai Maru which was then owned by Sea Sources and chartered to Cotan Petroleum. The sale of the MGO took place between 15 May 1994 and 19 May 1994. The defendants will contend that the true value of the MGO at the time of the sale was US$175 per metric ton. The quantity of MGO remaining on board the mt Tokai Maru at all material times was 1064 k/l which was about 906.500 mt. The value of 906.500 mt of MGO which remained on board the mt Tokai Maru was therefore US$158,637.50, equivalent to S$244,777.62 at the then prevailing exchange rate of S$1.543 to US$1.00. There is now produced and shown to me in a bundle marked TSS-4 a copy each of the following:
 
 
 
 
(a) Time charterparty dated 2.2.94 and made between Sea Sources and Cotan Petroleum. 
 
(b) Tokai Maru Report AFTER DISCHARGING dated 30.4.95. 
 
(c) Telerate Bunker Fuel Service printout for 16.5.95.
  
 
 
On or about 14 May 1994, Sea Sources withdrew the mt Tokai Maru from charter to Cotan Petroleum. The defendants will contend that the withdrawal was wrongful and in breach of contract. 
 At the time of the withdrawal of the vessel, there were on board the Tokai Maru goods and materials which were the property of Cotan Petroleum
:
 
 
 
 
(a) 
 2 water makers 
 
 
(b) 
 bunkering equipment 
 
 
(c) 
 provisions on board 
 
 
(d) 
 refrigerator oil 
  
 
 
 
 The said goods and materials were never returned to Cotan Petroleum after the Tokai Maru was withdrawn from charter to Cotan Petroleum
. I am advised by the defendants` solicitors and I verily believe that in the circumstances., Sea Sources had wrongfully converted to their own use the said goods and materials. The value of the property listed in items (a) to (d) above are as follows:
 
 
 
 
(a) S$47,800.00 
 
(b) US$93,768.50 
 
(c) US$12,269.00 
 
(d) US$534.00
  
 
 
There is now produced and shown to me in a bundle marked TSS-5 a copy of each of the following:
 
 
 
 
(i) Watermac Engineering Pte Ltd`s Invoice No 5921 for S$15,000.00 
 
(ii) Aqua-tech Engineering & Supplies Pte Ltd`s Invoice No 5061/A for S$32,800.00 
 
(iii) 
 Invoice No TK-02 from Wonjin International Co Ltd to Cotan Petroleum for bunkering equipment for US$93,768.50 
 
 
(iv) 
 Invoice No TK-03 from Wonjin International Co Ltd to Cotan Petroleum for provisions for US$12,269.00 
  
 
 
On the basis of the sellers` statement of account dated 31 March 1995 TSS-3, the sellers should have given credit to Cotan Energy for 26.32% of the sum of S$212,433.53. 26.32% of S$212,433.53 is S$55,915.13. If the value of the MGO was S$212,433.53, the amount owing by Cotan Energy to the plaintiffs should be reduced by S$55,915.13. The defendants, however, contend that the true value of the MGO was S$244,777.62. 26.32% of S$244,777.62 is S$64,425.46. The amount owing by Cotan Energy to the plaintiffs should therefore be reduced by S$64,425.46.
 
 
 
Further, the defendants will contend that the plaintiffs should also give credit to Cotan Energy for 26.32% of the value of the goods and materials referred to in para 7 above. The value of the said goods and materials converted to Singapore currency at the date of the withdrawal of the Tokai Maru is about S$212,239.05. The defendants will contend that the sellers had wrongfully converted the said goods and materials to their own use towards payment of the monies which were owing from the sellers to the buyers in respect of the sale of the 3 vessels. In the circumstances, the defendants will contend that Cotan Energy was entitled to be credit a sum representing 26.32% of S$212,239.05 ie S$55,861.32. The amount owing by Cotan Energy to the plaintiffs should therefore be further reduced by S$55,861.32.
 
 
 
It is to be remembered that credit has already been given for S$212,433.53 to reduce the indebtedness of Cotan Investments to Hozun Oil. In the event, on 18 October 1995 summary judgment was given for the full amount of $138,888.96. More than that, it is to be noted that Cotan Petroleum asserted as the owner of the goods and material on board the `Tokai Maru` and that the owner had converted Cotan Petroleum`s goods. Invoices issued by Wonjin International was the basis of that assertion. There was no suggestion that Johnny Tay had asked the defendants to deliver the goods to the plaintiffs or Wonjin. The next day, 19 October 1995, Cotan Petroleum issued a writ against the `Endurance 1` ex `Tokai Maru` claiming damages for breach of contract, alternatively for wrongful withdrawal of the `Tokai Maru` and conversion of two water makers. The other goods and materials were omitted.
 The action 
 
 
 
The writ in this action was filed on 5 January 1996 against the owners of `Tokai Maru`. The indorsement of claim read as follows: 
 
The plaintiffs claim against the defendants as bailees or sub-bailees of the plaintiffs` goods, which were on board the ship or vessel `Tokai Maru` now known as `Endurance 1`, damages for conversion of the said goods on or about 14 May 1994.
 
 
 
The relevant segment of the statement of claim read as follows:
 
 
On or about 24 April 1994, Sea Sources withdrew the vessel from the Head Charterparty with Cotan.
 
 
 
On or about 10 May 1994, Sea Sources were given notice by Cotan that the plaintiffs wished to transfer the plaintiffs` goods which were on board the vessel to another vessel.
 
 
 
On or about 14 May 1994, upon the instructions of the plaintiffs, the mt `Ionian Light` attempted to take re-delivery of the plaintiffs` goods from the vessel.
 
 
 
Sea Sources, however, by their servants or agents on board the vessel, refused to re-deliver the plaintiffs` goods to the mt `Ionian Light` but sailed away and made off with the plaintiffs` goods
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The plaintiffs` goods which were on board the `Tokai Maru` on 14 May 1994 comprised:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
 
1,064.021 kilolitres (905.39 mt) of MGO;
 
 
 
(b)
 
Provisions as appears in the list attached hereto marked `Annex C`;
 
 
 
(c)
 
Bunkering and other equipment as appears in the list attached hereto marked `Annex B`.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the premises, Sea Sources have refused to return the plaintiffs` goods and/or have sold or otherwise disposed of the plaintiffs` goods. Sea Sources have thereby converted the plaintiffs` goods to their own use.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
(a)
 
On 15 May 1994, Sea Sources sold or permitted their nominees, Hozun, to sell 343.233 mt of MGO to Sentek Marine & Trading Pte Ltd (`Sentek`).
 
 
 
(b)
 
On 16 May 1994, Sea Sources sold or permitted Hozen to sell 318.644 mt of MGO to Sentek.
 
 
 
(c)
 
On 19 May 1994, Sea Sources sold or permitted Hozun to sell 203.871 mt of MGO to Sentek.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alternatively, Sea Sources have in breach of their duty as bailees failed to deliver the plaintiffs` goods to them.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By reason of the aforesaid, the plaintiffs have suffered loss and damage.

The defence denied that the defendants were the plaintiffs` bailees. It was denied that the plaintiffs, that is the sub-charterers, entrusted the goods to the defendants. It asserted that the MGO was not at the material time the property of the plaintiffs and therefore entitled to the MGO. The defendants admitted that they sold the MGO but asserted that they did so `with the consent and/or knowledge of the main charterers and/or agents but denied the MGO belonged to the plaintiffs`. The defence went on to assert that a lien on the MGO in respect of moneys due to them under the time-charter with Cotan Petroleum. Denial of the plaintiffs` claim and asking them to prove their right was thus the essence of the defendants. Denial was the principal plank of the defendants` case. And then, the defendants brought third-party proceedings against Cotan Petroleum and Cotan Investments seeking payment of the money which was credited to Cotan Investments.
 Hozun Oil`s action 
 
 
 
While plaintiffs` action was making its course Hozun Oil & Trading Pte Ltd filed a suit (DC Suit 5187/95) against Johnny Tay and Ernie Yap. This was under their guarantee in respect of the indebtedness of Cotan Invesments (S) Pte Ltd on the purchase of the `Sea Endeavour`. The amount claimed was $64,750.77. This amount was arrived at after the credit of S$212,239.05. The writ was filed on 22 December 1995. Summary judgment was entered for $64,750.77 on 29 March 1996.
 The Endurance 1 
 
 
 
It would be salutory now to state in a summary form the decision in the suit Cotan Petroleum brought against the defendants, 
The Endurance 1
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 661
 . It was an admiralty action in rem against the `Tokai Maru` which had been renamed `The Endurance I`. There was a change of ownership which had been held to be of no consequence. The action was filed on 19 October 1995 by Adm 582/95. Cotan Petroleum claimed US$571,200 (US$800 x 714 days) for breach of charterparty in failing to provide a vessel according to the requirements of the time-charter. In the alternative they claimed US$836,400 (US$1,200 x 697). They made a further claim for conversion of two water makers valued by them at S$47,800.
The trial judge held that the defendants were in breach of the time-charter in failing to provide a vessel in conformity with the contractual specifications. Cotan Petroleum, however, did not terminate the time-charter on that breach. The defendants wrongfully withdrew the vessel because the notice they gave was outside the terms of the time-charter. For this the trial judge awarded damages at US$800 and not US$1200 per day from 8 April 1994 to 16 March 1996. They were also awarded the replacement costs of the two water makers as damages for conversion. Cotan Petroleum was also given costs on an indemnity basis. There was an appeal to the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal varied the orders made below. The finding of the trial judge that there was breach of the time-charter as to the specifications of the vessel was held to be plainly wrong. The holding that the withdrawal of the vessel was wrongful was right. But the damages were recalculated to US$260,000 at US$800 for 325 days omitting the option period. There was a conversion of the water makers because demand for them had been made by Cotan Petroleum in May 1995. But the damages should be reassessed taking into account depreciation. The Court of Appeal cancelled the order as to costs made by the trial judge. One-third of the costs was awarded to Cotan Petroleum. One-third of the costs of the appeal was given to the defendants.
 The law - conversion and bailment 
 
 
 
The law applicable to the resolution of the issues in this case is as follows. The common law concept of conversion is too elusive to be expressed in words. This is because of the multifarious forms in which it may manifest itself. It is like a hydra with many heads. There can be conversion by taking, by wrongful detention, by wrongful delivery, by wrongful disposition or by wrongful interference. It may be based on possession, ownership or possessory title. In every case of conversion it is a vital importance to hold in the forefront of the mind the exact form of conversion that is asserted by the plaintiffs. Sometimes the idea of conversion is inextricably interwoven with the concept of bailment. It is so in this case. The claim in this case was founded on conversion stemming from bailment and sub-bailment. It is therefore necessary to take a close look at the principles of the law governing bailment and conversion as they affect this case.
Take this scenario: P entrusts a thing to M. M in turn entrusts it to D with the knowledge and consent of P. M is in the middle. In such situation there is a bailment and a secondary bailment by sub-bailment. This situation spawns three bailments: P to M, M to D, as well as a direct bailment between P and D. This was the situation in this case - a bailment and a sub-bailment. In that situation it is clear law that D, the sub-bailee owes a duty of care to P as well as to M. P, the first bailor, as well as M can directly sue D the sub-bailee for breach of duty of care as bailee: See 
The Pioneer Container
 
[1994] 2 AC 324
 and 
The Winkfield
 
[1902] P 42
.
In a situation of a bailment and a sub-bailment, the principal bailor, as a rule, cannot directly and independently demand delivery of the thing bailed from the sub-bailee who received it from the sub-bailor without consent and authorisation from the sub-bailee. Otherwise there will be scramble for possession. There will be conflicting claims and safe dealings will become impossible. In particular the sub-bailee will be placed in a precarious position. There are exceptions to this rule - there may a contractual or other arrangement which obliges the sub-bailee to effect direct delivery to the principal bailor. For example, when one holds a bill of lading vesting the title to the goods in him the carrier sub-bailee must deliver it to the holder of the bill of lading and no one else: See 
The Houda; Kuwait Petroleum Corp v I & D Oil Carriers
 
[1994] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 541
, 
Sze Hai Tong Bank Ltd v Rambler Cycle Co Ltd
 
[1959] AC 577
.
Furthermore, if there a conversion of the article of bailment, both the bailor and the sub-bailor have a cause of action for conversion against the sub-bailee. The sub-bailor is entitled to recover substantial damages, that is the full value of the goods, from the converter sub-bailee. The basis of this rule was expounded in 
The Winkfield
 
[1902] P 42
 at p 55: 
 
As between possessor and wrongdoer the presumption of law is, in the words of Lord Campbell in 
 Jeffries v Great Western Ry Co
 `that the person who has possession has the property.
 
 
 
In the same case, at pp 54-55 Collins MR said: `the wrongdoer who is not defending under the title of the bailor is quite unconcerned with what the rights are between the bailor and bailee, and must treat the possessor as the owner of the goods for all purposes quite irrespective of the rights and obligations as between him and the bailor`.
The principles stated in 
 The Winkfield 
 were approved and applied in 
Chabbra Corp Pte Ltd v Owners of the Ship or Vessel Jag Shakti
 
[1986] AC 337
 (a Privy Council Appeal from Singapore).
The principal bailee, that is the bailee who is in the middle, in that event is under an obligation to account to the bailor. The rule was stated by Scrutton LJ in 
The Joannis Vatis
 
[1922] P 92
 at p 103: The sub-bailor `would be entitled to recover the full value of the cargo against the wrongdoers, but would have to account over and would be liable to the owners of the cargo for their proper share`. The cargo owner is the principal bailor. Lord Atkinson expounded the point with explicit emphasis in 
Eastern Construction Co Ltd v National Trust Co
 
[1914] AC 197
 at 210
: 
 
... it would be against all notions of justice that the bailee who recovers the full value of the goods wrongfully taken out of his possession should be able to retain it for himself. The goods were not his, they belonged to the bailor. The money recovered under the judgment represents and is substituted for the goods themselves. To allow the bailee to keep it for himself would be to compensate him in damages for a loss he has never suffered ... the bailee who in such circumstances recovers the full value of the goods must account to the bailor for the sum recovered.
 
 
 
 
 
 Clerk & Lindsell on Torts 
 
 (17th Ed, 1998), in para 13-143 presents this proposition of law: 
 
Possession with an assertion of title, or even possession alone (which is the case of a bailee), gives the possessor such a property as will enable him to maintain an action against a wrongdoer: 
 for possession is prima facie evidence of property
. [Italics supplied by me].
 
 
 
The proposition is amply supported by 
 The Winkfield 
.
There stems from the above an important derivative rule which is relevant to this case. It is this: Where there are more than one bailor of a thing and one of them recovers or otherwise deals with a third person the other bailor is barred further recovery from the third person. `The wrongdoer having once paid full damages to the bailee, has an answer to the bailor,` said Collins MR in 
 The Winkfield 
 at p 61.
This basis of the rule is estoppel and implied authorisation. Once there was a conclusive dealing or settlement the cause of action against the third party is extinguished. This is especially so if the owner transfers his rights to the bailee without reservation of title. The purpose of the rule is to prevent double jeapordy.
O`Sullivan v Williams
 
[1992] 3 All ER 385
 states and illuminates the above principles with sparkling clarity. O`Sullivan allowed his girlfriend Linda to use his car while he was away on holiday. While the car was parked outside her home it was irreparably damaged by the defendant. Both brought an action against the defendant in which the first plaintiff claimed o1,300 as the value of the car and damages for loss of use of the car since the accident at o25 per week and the second plaintiff claimed damages for nervous shock and other distress and for loss of use. O`Sullivan`s claim was settled without prejudice to Linda`s claim. The judge dismissed Linda`s claim for damages for nervous shock and other distress but awarded her o400 damages for loss of the use of the car. The defendant appealed against that award. The appeal was allowed on the ground that the settlement of O`Sullivan`s claim as bailor barred Linda`s claim as bailee. Fox LJ with the agreement of Staughton and Beldam LJJ enunciated the following principles: A bailee can sue in tort in respect of the bailed goods. The bailee can sue a wrongdoer simply by reason of the bailee`s possession. Such possession is, as against the wrongdoer, full and complete ownership. It enables the bailee to recover the full value of the chattel. He must, however, account to the bailor for the amount recovered. The bailee having recovered damages against the wrongdoer the wrongdoer has an answer to any action by the bailor. The same principle must apply to the bailee if the bailor has sued. There cannot be separate claims by the bailor and the bailee. If the bailor recovers damages and the bailee has some interest in the property enforceable against the bailor, then the bailor must account appropriately to the bailee. Either the bailor or bailee may sue, and whichever first obtains damages, it is a full satisfaction. Any other rule would expose a tortfeasor to several actions founded on the same cause of action by persons with limited interests in the chattel. Once the bailor`s claim has been satisfied, the bailee has no claim to pursue arising out of the bailment. The bailee must look to the bailor for satisfaction in respect of the interest, if any, of the bailee.
It needs to be stated at once that the rule in 
Hollins v Fowler
 
[1875] LR 7 HL 757
 is outside the pale of the bailment situation. That applies when someone, albeit innocently, receives goods fraudulently taken away from its owner. In that situation the receiver before dealing with the goods is under an absolute duty to ensure that the person has proprietory in the goods he receives. It does not apply to a bailment scenario because the goods are voluntarily placed in the hands of a bailee and thus impliedly clothes him with authority and confers on him ownership by possession. Next, cases of competing claims of bunkers in the tanks of an arrested vessel ordered to be sold by the court also are outside the pale of the principles outlined above. Such cases are not conversion or bailment cases. The court adjudicates on competing claim as it would in an interpleader summons. Repeating myself, I add that the bailment rules I have outlined do not apply to the holder of a bill of lading.
 Findings and conclusions 
 
 
 
On the basis of all the evidence viewed as a whole and the principles of law outlined above I make the following findings and conclusions. There was a bailment and a sub-bailment - first from Wonjin to the charterers and from the charterers to the owners. The plaintiffs in this case at once made an assertion and a concession to that end in the endorsement in the writ.
The bailment and the sub-bailment was first pursuant to and governed by the charter and sub-charter. When the main charter came to an end when the `Tokai Maru` was withdrawn, the bailments continued and were governed by an overlayer of the principles of the law of bailment I have outlined. There was no bill of lading in respect of the MGO or the other goods. The owners were justified in treating the charterers as owners of the MGO and other goods and dealing with them. The rule in 
 Hollins v Fowler 
 did not apply because the goods were not fraudulently taken from Wonjin International or the plaintiffs.
Under the principles of the law of bailment, the charterers were in proprietary possession of the MGO and the equipment. As such they were entitled to assert ownership rights against the owners. The charterers indeed did so. The owners too acted on the basis.
Although as a matter of law there was a sub-bailment, the plaintiffs, Wonjin International and the charterers throughout 1994 and the best part of 1995 were not aware of it. In the result Wonjin, and therefore the plaintiffs, asserted their rights only against the charterers. The charterers, as a matter of fact, accepted responsibility and dealt with the owners on their own behalf making themselves accountable to Wonjin International. At no time the plaintiffs or the Wonjin made a demand on the defendants for delivery of the MGO or the equipment.
In any event, on 10 June 1994 Wongjin International by issuing the invoices in favour of Cotan Petroleum relinquished all the rights in respect of the MGO and the equipment by exchanging them for the indebtedness of Cotan Petroleum for the values stated in the invoices. On an objective basis that was the result of issuing the invoices. Cotan Petroleum acknowledged the indebtedness. There was a binding agreement.
Above all the shipowners dealt with the charterers on the basis that the MGO and equipment belonged to the latter and sold the MGO and credit for it with the knowledge and consent of the charterers. Not only that. The charterers themselves asserted such a right at all relevant times and accepted the credit and thus confirmed the settlement on that basis. Thereupon, the plaintiffs or Wonjin lost their rights, if they had not lost them earlier to bring an action against the owners.
The action by the plaintiffs, in the circumstances was misconceived. They were confined to seek redress against Cotan Petroleum.
 Albert Lim`s evidence 
 
 
 
Albert Lim`s evidence was that in early May 1994 he had discussions with Johnny Tay about non-payment of moneys due from Cotan Investments to Hozun Oil. The amount was S$277,194.30 and it was in respect of the `Sea Endurance` sold to the former by the latter. Johnny Tay told him that the MGO on board the `Tokai Maru` belonged to Cotan Petroleum and that Albert Lim should sell the oil and set-off the proceeds against the moneys due from Cotan Investments to Hozun Oil. Purusant to that instruction Albert Lim got Hozun Oil to sell the MGO on board the `Tokai Maru`. The sale produced a sum of US$138,519.68 or S$212,443.53. On 10 June 1994 Hozun Oil wrote to Sea Sources that the sale had been effected and forwarded copies of the sale documents. Statements were sent to the buyers reflecting a credit amount of $212,443.53.
 Johnny Tay`s evidence 
 
 
 
Johnny Tay did not refute much of what Albert Lim said. Indeed he was not in a position to refute that. Johnny Tay admitted having dealt with Albert Lim. Johnny Tay admitted his companies owed $500,000 plus to Albert Lim`s companies. This meant that Johnny Tay as guarantor was also liable. He did not show the sub-charter to the defendants. He did tell the defendants about the plaintiffs. He was not in a position to pay anyone as he was tight. Wonjin asserted that it was Cotan Petroleum that stole the MGO and equipment. Wonjin`s representative, Mr Choy, came to Singapore in June 1994. It was his responsibility and he agreed to solve the problem. Choy asked Lim for payment and he agreed to pay and he would look towards the owner for all the claims. Choy agreed. The fact that the owners had taken the cargo and equipment was not the problem of Choy, Wonjin and the plaintiffs. Johnny Tay was handling the claim and he was going to claim from the owners and that was why he had agreed to compensate Wonjin. The invoices issued by Wonjin was in favour of Cotan Petroleum was evidence of sale and demand for payment. He did not pay Wonjin because he had no money. Above all, he acknowledged the contra account issued by Albert Lim and that credit was given to Cotan Investments: `We totalled up the money payable on the purchase and issued payment to which of the three companies I can say. Money went in the name of one company to one of defendants` company. They wanted us to issue to one company so we issued to one company. We did this for convenience.` In addition Johnny said this: `
 I was under the notion that the goods belonged to Cotan 
. 
 I formed this notion when they ran away with the goods 
.` [Italics are mine]. This is what Albert Lim said Johnny Tay told him that the MGO belonged to him at the time the vessel was withdrawn.
Then there was the affidavit of Johnny Tay in Suit No 1060 of 1995 against him and Ernie Yap. With full knowledge that credit had been given as shown in statements issued by Albert Lim`s compaies, he asserted with absolute positiveness that: `at the time of the withdrawal of the vessel, there was on board the `Tokai Maru` goods and materials which were the property of Cotan Petroleum: (a) two water makers, (b) bunkering equipment, (c) provisions on board, (d) refrigeration oil`. He went on to base his assertions on the invoices which he conceded before me was evidence of sale to Cotan Petroleum. He made these asertions and sought a credit when in fact credit had already been given to Cotan Investments for which was he liable.
I hold that it was because he was in debt and he was under pressure from Choy for payment of an admitted debt that he came up with the case of conversion of all the goods and materials. Cotan Petroleum`s claim for conversion of the two water makers succeeded because the Court of Appeal held that Cotan Petroleum `requested to be informed of the vessel`s location on 6 May 1995 and 8 May 1995 to enable them to take the water makers from the vessel. The owners did not reply and the water makers remained on board. On those facts the learned judge held that the owners had committed the tort of wrongfully retaining the charterers` water makers. We entirely agree with the learned judge.` This means that the charterers had not made a demand earlier and there was no demand from Wonjin or the plaintiffs directly to the owners.
At the trial of this action Johnny Tay made a major shift. He said that in May 1994, Albert Lim had begged him not to report the stealing of the cargo and to return the cargo and the goods to Wonjin. All this sounded rather bizarre because this was totally inconsistent with his view which he formed on the date of withdrawal that the cargo belonged to Cotan Petroleum. He never modified this view until after judgment was given in Suit 1060/95. Apart from that, taken in its entirety the evidence of Albert Lim was more credible than Johnny Tay`s. As a witness Albert Lim was firm and forthright; Johnny Tay was wobbly. Often Johnny Tay paused to think up an answer. Albert Lim impressed me as a witness of truth but not Johnny Tay. Johnny Tay was a supplicant to Albert Lim`s companies. There was no reason for Albert Lim to fear Johnny Tay. They were friends until Suit No 1060 of 1995 was commenced.
As to why he made a volte facie his explanation was that he was wrong in his view and realized the error only when his lawyer pointed out the error. In other words there was a mistake of law. In my judgment the new evidence was contrived to give support to the legal advice he had received. The thrust of the new thinking was that Cotan Petroleum had no right to deal with Albert Lim and his companies. As has been demonstrated what Choy, Johnny Tay and Albert Lim thought and their conduct was well within the pale of law. The subsequent shift was incorrect. It was too late for Wonjin and the plaintiffs to assert their initial rights against the defendants. That would be against the law outlined in this judgment.
 Miscellaneous points 
 
 
 
Albert Lim was asked why he did not return the cargo and the equipment to the plaintiffs when the vessel was withdrawn. He said that no demand from them or Wonjin to the defendants. Insofar as conversion is asserted in the form of wrongful detention, as distinct from wrongful dealing, demand from the claimant to the defendant and the right to demand possession must be proved. There was no such proof in this case. Johnny Tay had said in evidence that he relayed the contents of a telex from Wonjin to the defendants. Albert Lim was asked about the fax Johnny Tay said he sent to the defendants. Albert Lim said he never received them. There was no proof that they were sent to Albert Lim or the defendants. The conduct of Johnny Tay and his evidence that he thought that Cotan Petroleum was the owner was inconsistent with him having sent the faxes. There was no mention of him having sent the faxes or that Wonjin was owner subsequently. There was much evidence to the contrary. The change of mind and mind occurred after Johnny Tay and Choy realised that Johnny Tay and Cotan Petroleum were not worth power and shot. Additionally the thrust of the plaintiffs` case was the sale of the MGO by the defendants.
It was contended for the defendants that the plaintiffs` claim was not sustainable that they had an interest in the goods at any time. It was further contended that no officer of the plaintiffs came to give evidence. I reject these arguments as unsupported by law. Wonjin were the agents of the plaintiffs. Even if the plaintiffs had no ownership in the MGO and the other goods, they were as charterers entitled to assert a claim.
 Summary 
 
 
 
On the basis of the analysis and conclusions I dismiss the plaintiffs` claim. As to the MGO it was sold with the consent and knowledge of Cotan Petroleum. If it was sold without their consent, there was a settlement after the defendants gave credit to Cotan Petroleum which accepted the settlement. As to the other goods there was no demand from the plaintiffs or Wonjin to the defendants for delivery of the goods before the action. In any event they relinquished their rights when they issued the invoices to Cotan Petroleum. In these circumstances there was no need to make an order in the third-party proceedings.
It cannot be denied that the plaintiffs were placed in an unfortunate position. This was because Cotan Petroleum and Johnny Tay failed to keep their promises to Wonjin and the plaintiffs. That said, it cannot be denied that this action by the plaintiffs overleapt the relevant facts and law which were kept out of their knowledge. For Choy said in his evidence that he was unaware of what had happened. He was not given the relevant information and advice.

He was convicted after a trial and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of two months and four months respectively, with both sentences to run concurrently. Penalties totalling $1,063,936.90 were also imposed, which penalties have since been paid. The appellant appealed against both convictions and the sentences imposed. After hearing the submissions of counsel for the appellant and the DPP, I dismissed the appeals against both convictions and allowed the appeals against the sentences. I now give my reasons in writing.
 The agreed facts 
 
 
 
An agreed statement of facts was tendered at the commencement of the trial. It was undisputed that the appellant extended an interest-free loan of $6.3m, repayable on demand, to one Ong Kah Chye (`Ong`) via a loan agreement dated 28 June 1990. This was intended to be a bridging loan to be set-off subsequently by Ong selling 5.6m shares in Alliance Securities Pte Ltd (`ASPL`) worth $6.3m to CGH Land Pte Ltd, which was owned by the appellant and two of his sons. The sale was ultimately unsuccessful as CGH Land Pte Ltd withdrew its application to purchase the shares in October 1990. The appellant then sought repayment of the loan.
On 1 October 1992, the appellant received $500,000 from Ong by way of two separate account payee cheques for the sums of $400,000 and $100,000 respectively. They were accompanied by a covering letter dated 1 October 1992 stating that the cheques were for partial repayment of the loan, reducing the outstanding loan amount to $5.8m.
In the first half of 1994, after the distribution of dividends by ASPL, Ong made five separate payments totalling $290,000 to the appellant. Ong issued five cash cheques (for the sums of $60,000, $20,000, $110,000, $20,000 and $80,000 respectively) on various dates in April and May 1994. He then caused these cheques to be encashed and handed the cash to the appellant through the latter`s son Chng Beng Siong (`Chng`).
In April 1995, after the distribution of dividends by ASPL, Ong made six separate payments totalling $1.064m to the appellant. He issued six cash cheques (for the sums of $250,000, $250,000, $200,000, $200,000, $100,000 and $64,000 respectively) on various dates in April 1995. The cheques were given to Chng to be encashed and, in turn, for the cash to be handed to the appellant.
In 1996, the appellant received two payments of $200,000 each by way of cashier`s orders made payable to him. Both payments were accompanied by a covering letter dated 9 July 1996 and 22 August 1996 respectively. The appellant acknowledged receipt of the second cashier`s order. In 1999, Ong made a further payment of $5.4m to the appellant by way of a transfer of funds into Chng`s bank account.
It was not disputed that the sums of $290,000 and $1.024m were omitted from the appellant`s tax return forms for the assessment years 1995 and 1996.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The prosecution`s case essentially hinged on Ong`s evidence. In court, Ong testified that he proposed to compensate the appellant with interest after the latter complained about his interest costs and opportunity costs. The appellant was agreeable to this proposal. According to Ong, this took place during informal discussions prior to the declaration of dividends by ASPL in the first half of 1994 and 1995.
Ong testified that he proposed paying interest at a rate of 5% pa but the appellant did not confirm this rate as he did not know his borrowing costs. Ong`s understanding was that the appellant would only confirm the interest costs at a later stage. Ong testified that he did not discuss the 1994 and 1995 payments with the appellant and did not specifically inform him that they were interest payments. He had assumed that the appellant would understand their purpose on the basis of their previous discussions. Furthermore, he wanted to retain the option of treating the payments as capital repayments in the future. Ong testified that the sum of $1.064m paid in 1995 included a sum of $40,000 as reimbursement to the appellant for banking charges incurred by the latter in obtaining the loan.
In the course of the trial, the prosecution applied for and was granted leave to cross-examine and impeach Ong on his previous statements in writing pursuant to ss 147(1) and 157(c) Evidence Act (Cap 97) on the basis of the material discrepancies between his oral testimony and his previous statements to IRAS recorded on 14 February 1998 and 20 August 1998. Pursuant to the application, the statements were also admitted into evidence under s 147(3) Evidence Act.
The prosecution relied principally on these statements to prove that the appellant knew of the nature of the 1994 and 1995 payments and had wilfully omitted these interest income from his tax returns. Ong did not dispute that he made both statements nor their voluntariness. The relevant portions are set out below: 
 
Statement recorded 14 February 1998 - exh P24
 
 
 
 
4 Sometime in the first quarter of 1994, Alliance declared a 10% dividend, Chng learned of the dividend payment, and again he brought up the issue of loan repayment and the interest expenses suffered. Under pressure, and since I benefited from the dividend income from the investment funded by him, I proposed to pay him $290,000 to compensate his interest expenses. This amount of $290,000 is based on 5% pa on the sum o/standing of $5.8m. Chng accepted my proposal, but commented that he did not know the cost of funding. Chng asked for cash cheques and I did not query him. I gave him the following cash cheques from my account with Maybank. 
 
... 
 
5 Similarly, when Alliance declared a 20% dividend on 1.4.95, Chng again brought up the issue of loan repayment and the interest expenses he suffered. He ever brought up the similar issues there and then. I proposed to pay him $1,024,000 interest as per working in App A. After enjoying two years` earnings, I tried my best to sweeten the compensation of Mr Chng`s interest lost in my mind. I was prepared to spend my dividend income. Again, Mr Chng commented that he did not know the cost of fundings but accepted my proposal. Chng asked for cash cheques and I did not query him. I gave him the following cash cheques from my account with Keppel Bank.
  
 
 
Statement recorded 20 August 1998 - exh P25
 
 
 
 
3 I re-confirm that when the payment of $290,000 in 4/94 and 5/94 and $1,064,000 in 4/95 was made to Chng Gim Huat, I made it very clear that the payments were for interest calculated at 5% p.a. In actual fact, Chng always asked me to compensation for the cost of funds. I further confirm that the word `intention` as stated in App C refer to interest rate of 5%. The letter was requested by Chng so that he could make his tax declaration.
  
 
 
The IRAS investigating officer, Toh Kiau Kee, explained that the 1994 interest payment of $290,000 was computed at the rate of 5% on the outstanding capital sum of $5.8m for one year (ie 1994) while the 1995 payment of $1.024m represented the balance of the accumulated interest on the loan of $6.3m for the period between 1 July 1990 and 1 July 1994, calculated at 5% pa on a compound rate basis. These figures corresponded with Ong`s calculations contained in App A of exh P24, entitled `Interest to Chng Gim Huat (estimate)` which he had earlier submitted to the SES. The investigating officer confirmed that the interest should have been included in the tax returns for the years of assessment 1995 and 1996 respectively. The additional taxes which would have been payable for the years of assessment 1995 and 1996 were $78,174.39 and $276,471.26 respectively amounting to a total of $354,645.65.
 The defence case 
 
 
 
The appellant contended that the 1994 and 1995 payments were capital repayments and that he was not aware that they were `interest payments` at the material time. It was only in 1997 that an agreement was reached between Ong and himself to treat them as interest payments. He denied having wilfully omitted the interest payments from the tax returns with an intention to evade tax.
The appellant testified that he first started complaining about his loss of interest and opportunity costs in late 1994 when his various attempts to purchase the ASPL shares failed. Following the complaints, Ong only informed the appellant that he would compensate the latter at the appropriate time. They did not have any detailed discussion on the question of interest payments in late 1994 or 1995. He testified that it was his understanding that Ong would compensate him with interest after full repayment of the loan was made.
Concerning the 1994 payments, the appellant testified that prior to ASPL`s dividends declaration in April 1994, Ong offered to make repayment of the loan but did not confirm the amount to be paid. The appellant asked for the first repayment ($60,000) to be made in cash as he was then in need of it. Thereafter, there was no contact between them regarding the subsequent cash payments in 1994 and 1995. The appellant viewed these payments, which were not accompanied by any covering letters, as capital repayments. On 1 April 1996, the appellant wrote to Ong requesting repayment of the outstanding loan. This resulted in the 1996 repayment of $400,000.
The appellant testified that in March 1997, Ong informed him that he had mistakenly reported the 1994 and 1995 payments to the Stock Exchange of Singapore (`SES`) as interest payments in 1996. The appellant expressed his unhappiness and requested a letter from Ong for the purpose of submitting tax returns to IRAS. Ong duly provided the letter dated 17 March 1997 which recorded a retrospective agreement to treat the 1994 and 1995 payments as interest (exh D12). The annexure to exh D12 entitled `Interest Payment to CGH`, prepared by Ong, contained the interest calculations which corresponded to the calculations done by the investigating officer and the figures contained in App A to exh P24. The appellant only knew of the period and rate of interest when he saw the annexure to exh D12.
The appellant informed IRAS of the interest income via a letter dated 14 April 1997 for the years of assessment 1991 to 1995 and subsequently paid additional taxes amounting to $394,799.20.
The appellant`s son, Chng, testified on his behalf. He was aware of the $6.3m loan extended to Ong and the collateral agreement for the purchase of ASPL shares. He testified that the appellant started to press Ong for repayment in 1991. Subsequently, the appellant complained to Ong about his high cost of fundings and his opportunity costs. However he denied that Ong made any proposals to compensate the appellant`s interest costs in his presence. He confirmed that Ong gave him cash amounting to $290,000 in 1994 and cash cheques amounting to $1.064m in 1995. However he was not told of the purpose of those payments at the material time.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The appellant did not make any submission of no case to answer at the close of the prosecution`s case. The magistrate reviewed the evidence and held that there was a prima facie case based on Ong`s statements as well as other undisputed evidence and called the appellant to enter upon his defence.
The magistrate found that there were material contradictions between Ong`s oral evidence and his previous statements to IRAS (exhs P24 and P25) and granted leave to the prosecution to impeach his credit and to admit the statements into evidence pursuant s 147(3) Evidence Act. The magistrate ultimately rejected Ong`s explanations for the discrepancies and ruled that his credit had been successfully impeached. Having considered the relevant factors, the magistrate was satisfied that Ong`s previous statements in writing contained the truth and accepted them over Ong`s oral testimony.
At the close of the trial, the magistrate found that the issue of repayment of the loan was first discussed in 1991 and not in late 1994 She found that prior to the 1994 payments, the appellant had expressed frustration and concern over the non-repayment of the loan and had complained about his opportunity costs and interest costs. In her view, these complaints were intended to induce Ong to offer some form of compensation in view of the length of time for which the loan had been outstanding.
The magistrate rejected the appellant`s contention that the payments were capital loan repayments. In light of the totality of the evidence and the conduct of the appellant, the magistrate found that the appellant knew that the 1994 and 1995 payments were interest payments and that he had wilfully omitted them from his tax returns with intent to evade tax. She also found that the actions of the appellant showed that he did not want the payments to be traced back to him.
The magistrate concluded that the prosecution had proven both charges beyond reasonable doubt and convicted the appellant accordingly.
 The appeals against conviction 
 
 
 
The appellant raised four main issues in this appeal. First, the appellant contended that the payments in question did not amount to `interest income` within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134) but were compensation for the cost of funds incurred by the appellant in funding the loan. The appellant also contended that the magistrate erred in ruling that Ong had materially contradicted his two statements to IRAS (exhs P24 and P25) such that his credit was thereby impeached. Related to this, it was submitted that the magistrate erred in solely relying on Ong`s previous statements in writing without giving adequate consideration to their true effect and meaning. Finally, the appellant submitted that the magistrate erred in finding that the appellant knew that the payments were interest payments at the material times and had wilfully omitted them from the tax returns with the intent to evade tax.
 Whether the payments amounted to `interest income` 
 
 
 
Before me, the appellant contended that the payments did not amount to `interest income` within the charging provision of s 10(1) Income Tax Act. The appellant testified that he took a bank loan for the sum of $6.3m through his companies and incurred the attendant interest charges. The 1994 and 1995 payments were intended to compensate the appellant for his cost of funds incurred and not intended as interest payments. This novel argument, which rested on a fine distinction between compensation for the deprivation of the principal and compensation for the interest incurred on the principal, was not raised in the court below (the appellant was then represented by a different counsel).
Section 10(1) Income Tax Act states: 
 
Income tax shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be payable at the rate or rates specified hereinafter for each year of assessment upon the income of any person accruing in or derived from Singapore ... in respect of -
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
(d) dividends, interest or discounts;
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
The Act itself does not contain a definition of the term `interest` which has been defined in the 
 Oxford English Dictionary 
, Vol VII (2nd Ed, 1989) at p 1099 as: 
 
money paid for the use of money lend (the principal), or for forbearance of a debt, according to a fixed ratio.
 
 
 
`Interest` has also been described as `the return or compensation for the use or retention by one person of a sum of money belonging to or owed to another`: 32 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed Reissue) para 106 and as `compensation for the delay in payment`: per Farrell J in 
Bond v Barrow Haematite Steel Co
 
[1902] 1 Ch 353
 at p 363. The Scottish Lord President Lord Strathclyde in 
 Schulze v Benstead 
 1916 SC 188 at p 191 approved what I consider to be a useful working definition which has been cited in the 
 Singapore Master Tax Guide 1998 
 (17th Ed) at [para ] 893: 
 
Interest signifies a sum payable in respect of the use of another sum of money, called the principal. 
 It is also often described as a compensation for delayed payment
. There is no definition of the word `interest` in the
 Income Tax Act
. A good working definition, for tax purposes, was given in 
Schulze v Bensted (Surveyor of Taxes)
 
[1915] 7 TC 30
 as `a creditor`s share of the profit which the borrower or the debtor is presumed to make from the use of the money. 
 Otherwise stated, it is just recompense to the creditor for being deprived of the use of his money
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The appellant referred me to the case of 
Riches v Westminister Bank Ltd
 
[1947] AC 390
 where the House of Lords had to decide whether interest which had been awarded in proceedings for the recovery of debt, and included in the total sum for which judgment was given, was interest within the meaning of the Income Tax Act 1918. In an illuminating passage, Lord Wright stated at p 400: 
 
The essence of interest is that it is a payment which becomes due because that creditor has not had his money at the due date. It may be regarded as representing the profit he might have made if he had had use of the money, or, conversely, 
 the loss he suffered because he had not that use. The general idea is that he is entitled to compensation for the deprivation
. From that point of view it would seem immaterial whether the money was due to him under a contract express or implied or a statute or whether the money was due for any other reason in law. In either case 
 the money was due to him and was not paid, or in other words was withheld from him by the debtor after the time when payment should have been made, in breach of his legal rights and interest was a compensation
, whether the compensation was liquidated under an agreement or statute, ... or was unliquidated and claimable under the Act as in the present case. The essential quality of the claim for compensation is the same and the compensation is properly described as interest. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Applying the above test, their Lordships held that the interest awarded on the debt was interest within the meaning of the Income Tax Act and thus liable to tax.
Apart from the above, the characteristics of an interest payment need to be considered as well. I would align myself with Rand J`s comments in 
Reference Re Saskatchewan Farm Security Act 1944, Section 6
 
[1947] 3 DLR 689
 at p 703: 
 
... the definition [of interest], as well as the obligation [to pay interest], assumes that interest is referable to a principal in money or an obligation to pay money. Without that relational structure in fact and whatever the basis of calculating or determining the amount, no obligation to pay money or property can be deemed an obligation to pay interest.
 
 
 
This was a decision of the Canadian Supreme Court, which was subsequently affirmed by the Privy Council (see [1949] 2 DLR 145). There, the court examined certain provincial legislative measures in order to determine whether they infringed the exclusive legislative power of the Dominion in relation to interest. These measures sought to suspend principal repayments on mortgages and sale and purchase agreements in the event of crop failures without purporting to change the interest payable under those agreements. It was argued that the provisions were agricultural measures and did not relate to interest. Four out of the five Supreme Court judges, including Rand J, disagreed and held that the measures were ultra vires as the operation of the measures in substance, affected the interest payments by increasing the rate of interest payable on the reduced principal amount.
Rand J`s dictum was cited and approved by Megarry J (as he then was) in 
Re Euro Hotel (Belgravia) Ltd
 
[1975] 3 All ER 1075
. There, the issue was whether certain sums payable under a sub-building agreement were interest within the terms of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970. After reviewing the relevant case authorities, the learned judge suggested a two-stage test (at p 1084): 
 
It seems to me that running through the cases there is the concept that as a general rule two requirements must be satisfied for a payment to amount to interest, and a fortiori to amount to `interest in money`. First, there must be a sum of money by reference to which the payment which is said to be interest is to be ascertained. ... Secondly, those sums of money must be sums that are due to the person entitled to the alleged interest; ...
 
 
 
Applying the two stage test, Megarry J held that the payments in question were not interest in money as the principal sum paid out by the creditor was not paid as a loan but as an outright payment to the company for developing the property as well as to give the creditor property rights in the property. Thus, the provision of `interest` payments by the company was `not compensation for delay in payment but for delay in performance of other obligations: and the payments were not payments by time for the use of money but payments by time for non-performance of those obligations` (at p 1085).
The quality to be attributed to the sum in question is also significant. In 
 Riches v Westminister Bank Ltd 
 at p 403, Lord Wright noted the numerous decisions which have drawn a distinction between capital and income, and recognised that the `distinction depends on substance not on the mere name`. The DPP cited the case of 
IRC v Church Commissioners for England
 
[1975] 3 All ER 614
 (subsequently affirmed by the House of Lords [1976] 2 All ER 1037), where Stamp LJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, stated (at p 619): 
 
... it is, we think, common ground, or if not it is established by authority, that in determining whether sums payable annually are to be regarded as wholly or partly income for the purposes of income tax 
 one must ascertain the true legal nature of the transaction or agreement between the parties which is the source of the payments and not the labels which the parties put on the sums payable ... It is the true legal result of the transaction with which one is concerned and not its financial result
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The DPP also referred me to the case of 
Vestey v IRC
 
[1962] Ch 861
. The case involved a sale and purchase agreement to sell shares, then worth Â£2m, for a sum of Â£5.5m payable in 125 interest free yearly instalments. Known to the purchasers, the instalment payments represented interest on the unpaid balance at 2% pa. Cross J (as he then was) upheld the Special Commissioners` decision to dissect each annual instalment into a capital and an interest element. In my view, this case was of limited assistance. Without applying any principle of law, the learned judge simply adopted a common sense approach on the basis that the facts clearly revealed an interest element. In fact, Cross J`s approach in analysing the previous authorities was expressly rejected by the Court of Appeal in 
 IRC v Church Commissioners for England 
 (at p 623).
The following guiding principles can be distilled from the above authorities. First, the label attached to the payment is not conclusive of its true legal nature. Whether or not a particular payment constitutes `interest` depends on the substance of the transaction. Nomenclature does not alter the character of the payment if it is not in fact `interest` and vice versa. Secondly, the essence of `interest` is compensation for the deprivation for the use or delayed payment of money by another. Thirdly, there must be a principal sum of money by reference to which the interest payment is to be ascertained, which sum of money must be due to the person entitled to the interest.
I now return to the facts, bearing in mind that the labels attached to the payments are not conclusive of their legal nature. Here, there was an ascertainable principal sum of $6.3m, later reduced to $5.8m in 1992, which was owing to the appellant. The testimonies of the investigating officer and Ong, as well as the calculations attached as App A to exh P24 and the annexure to exh D12, both prepared by Ong, showed that the 1994 and 1995 payments were calculated by reference to the principal sum of $6.3m. The two-stage minimum criteria laid down by Megarry J in 
 Re Euro Hotel (Belgravia) 
 was clearly met. The remaining task was to decipher the true nature of the payments and to ascertain whether they were compensation for the deprivation for the use or delayed payment of money.
The appellant contended that Ong merely intended to reimburse the appellant`s interest expenses. I was unable to agree. The appellant`s defence at the trial was that the payments were capital repayments at the material times, not that they reimbursed or compensated his cost of funds. It was apparent from the appellant`s and Ong`s evidence that the concepts of cost of funds, compensation or interest were viewed interchangeably. I did not place too much weight on the expressions `compensation` or `reimbursement` which were merely polite and colloquial terms used by Ong in describing the payments.
The evidence and statements must be viewed in totality. From the agreed statement of facts, the appellant sought repayment of the loan after the abortive attempt to purchase ASPL shares in 1990. Chng also testified that the appellant started to press Ong for repayment of the loan sometime in 1991. The covering letter dated 1 October 1992, which accompanied the capital repayment of $500,000 also referred to: 
 
... our numerous discussions on repayment of the above mentioned loan, as explained to you I am not able to raise adequate funds to perform. ...
 
 
 
The magistrate accepted Ong`s evidence that, prior to the 1994 and 1995 payments, the appellant made frequent requests for repayment and complained about his lost opportunity costs, the lack of returns and the interest charges he incurred in financing the loan. It was clear that Ong was apologetic over the delayed repayment and felt that the appellant`s complaints were justified. As a result, he felt pressured and proposed to compensate the appellant. Ong had also informed the SES investigator in 1996 that the payments were `interests to compensate` the appellant and not mere reimbursements.
It was clear to me that the 1994 and 1995 payments were intended to compensate the appellant for the delayed repayment of the debt. The payments might well have achieved the secondary purpose of off-setting the interest charges which the appellant incurred, but that did not alter the nature of those payments. It was useful to recall the appellant`s evidence that his interest charges were considerably lessened in 1994 as he had already discharged part of the loan through other means. In my view, the magistrate was quite right in viewing the appellant`s frequent complaints about his interests charges as a tactic to impress upon Ong the need to make efforts to repay the sum expeditiously as well as to offer him a `fair settlement`. It was against this factual matrix that the substance of the payments was to be determined.
The appellant further argued that the payments were not intended to be profit nor accepted as profit for the loan given. I doubted if it was helpful to use the term `profit`. As stated by Stamp LJ in 
 IRC v Church Commissioners of England 
, it was the true legal nature that was important and not the financial result. The payments were meant to compensate the appellant for the delayed repayment, regardless of whether they were sufficient to offset the actual interest charges incurred by the appellant.
There was in my view, a more fundamental flaw in the appellant`s submission. There was no evidence pertaining to the appellant`s actual cost of borrowings nor any concrete evidence showing a link between the money borrowed and the interest income produced. The appellant had testified in a general manner as to the average prime rate and the overdraft interest rates in 1990 - 1994. He recalled that his companies were paying interest at a rate of between 6.5% - 8 % for the bank loans in 1994. Apart from bare assertions, there was no evidence of those loans nor the actual interest charges incurred. The absence of an evidential substratum upon which the appellant could mount his legal arguments was, in my view, fatal.
I would add that, assuming evidence of the appellant`s cost of borrowings was adduced, he was not absolved from his obligation to declare the interest income to the IRAS. While it may be possible to offset the cost of borrowings as deductions under s 14(1)(a) Income Tax Act, this would not transform the nature of those payments into something outside the scope of the charging provision contained in s 10(1)(d) Income Tax Act.
I was therefore unable to agree with the appellant`s contention that there was a legal distinction between `interest income` and `interest` which were intended to reimburse the lender`s interest charges. This submission obfuscates the nature of interest payments and is unsustainable was law. Indeed, it would be contrary to the intention of the legislature if individuals or corporations could circumvent the Act by simply framing interest income as compensation for the cost of funds. From the evidence, the 1994 and 1995 payments were clearly precipitated by Ong`s delay in repaying the loan and served to compensate the appellant for delayed repayment. That in my view, was the very essence of `interest`.
 Whether the magistrate was correct in holding that Ong`s credit had been impeached and in relying on exhs P24 and P25 over his oral testimony 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Role of appellate court as regards findings of fact
 
As this ground relates to the magistrate`s findings regarding the credit and veracity of the witnesses, it is a convenient point to reiterate the principles guiding the appellate court`s role as regards findings of fact by a trial judge.
It is trite law that an appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are plainly wrong or clearly reached against the weight of evidence. It is not enough to show that the appellate court would have come to a different conclusion on the evidence from the court below, bearing in mind that the trial judge had the opportunity of observing the witnesses to assess their veracity and credibility: 
Tan Hung Yeoh v PP
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 93
  at [para ] 23-25, 
Ng Soo Hin v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 105
  at p 118H, 
PP v Hla Win
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 424
  at p 436A. However, insofar as they involve inferences drawn from the surrounding circumstance, the appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to draw the appropriate inferences: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
  at [para ] 24.
 Whether Ong`s testimony had materially contradicted exhs P24 and P25 and whether his credit was impeached 
 
 
 
The impeachment of the credit of a witness is governed by s 157 Evidence Act which provides: 
 
The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him:
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted;
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
The purpose and accompanying circumstances of the payments went to the crux of the appellant`s knowledge of the nature of those payments and his intention. Ong`s oral testimony sought to show that there was no clear understanding or agreement that the 1994 and 1995 payments were interests payments. In court, Ong testified that: 
a he did not meet the appellant after the declaration of dividends in 1994 and 1995; 
b the appellant did not expressly accept his proposal to compensate the appellant with interest at 5% pa; 
c he did not inform the appellant of the sums of money which he proposed to pay in 1994 and 1995; 
d he did not confirm the nature of the 1994 and 1995 payments with the appellant, that is, whether they were interest or capital repayments as he wanted to leave open the option to treat them as capital repayments; and 
e he could not recall whether the appellant had asked for the 1994 payments to be in cash and that it was Chng who had asked for cash cheques in 1995.
This evidence contrasted with exhs P24 and P25 which stated that the question of interest payments was discussed by Ong and the appellant after the declaration of dividends in 1994 and 1995. The statements showed that Ong proposed to compensate the appellant by paying him $290,000 and $1.024m in 1994 and 1995 respectively, which sums represented interest payments calculated at 5% pa. The proposal was accepted by the latter on both occasions. In addition, the appellant asked for cash cheques on both occasions.
Both versions conflicted materially with each other and called for a satisfactory explanation. The magistrate did not, as submitted by the appellant, close her mind to the possibility that Ong could have been genuinely mistaken when he made those statements. A review of the grounds of decision showed that the magistrate was fully cognizant of Ong`s various explanations, including his claim that the statements contained mistakes which he subsequently discovered and sought to clarify in his oral testimony. Ong`s various explanations for the inconsistencies were canvassed and tested against other aspects of his testimony, the undisputed facts as well as other independent evidence. She ultimately rejected Ong`s explanations as being `incredible`, `unconvincing`, `implausible`, `merely fabrications in an attempt to assist the defence`, `unbelievable` and `an afterthought`. The appellant was unable to persuade me that there were grounds to disturb these findings of fact.
In particular, I fully shared the magistrate`s assessment that Ong must have discussed the question of compensation, the rate of interest payable and the exact amount to be paid as interest after the declaration of dividends in 1994 and 1995. This followed from Ong`s sincere intention to compensate the appellant with interest. Further, Ong would only have known whether he had sufficient cashflow to pay the appellant after dividends were declared. Viewed in that light, Ong could not have left the matter vague and ambiguous so that he could have the option of treating those sums as repayments. This also explained Ong`s later notification to SES that the 1996 sums were interest payments.
There were other factors which cast doubt on Ong`s explanations. Ong was aware of the seriousness of the matter by the time the statements were recorded in February and August 1998 as related SES examination and IRAS queries took place in 1996 and 1997. He had more than enough opportunities to recall the pertinent discussions and to ensure that an accurate version was conveyed to the authorities by the time he gave the statements. Ong`s claim that his recollection became more accurate was implausible in the absence of any reason explaining the dramatic improvement in his memory during the trial, more than a year later.
Ong claimed that the statements were inaccurate and misleading due to incorrect and careless sentence structure: 
 
this is definitely a wrong structure when I put it together in this 
 manner
 
 
 
this statement is trying to squeeze in too many things together until it is misleading
 
 
 
He added that he had merely copied the format and sentence structure of para 4 which described the 1994 payments into para 5 of exh P24 which dealt with the 1995 payments.
This claim bore closer examination. Both statements were personally constructed and hand-written by Ong and contained information which was wholly within his knowledge. Exhibit P24 (recorded in Feb 1998) consisted of nine paragraphs totalling five pages recorded over three and a half hours, which was a reasonable amount of time considering the length of the statement, and it was amended by Ong before he signed and confirmed it. The contents were subsequently reaffirmed in a further statement recorded in August 1998 (exh P25). Despite this further opportunity to reflect upon the relevant events, Ong did not detect any inaccuracies and did not amend his earlier statement exh P24, even though the material discrepancies would have been immediately obvious from a plain reading of exh P24. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of exh P24 had been set out above. They reflected a clear and concise sentence structure and did not support Ong`s claims that the discrepancies were due to poor structure or that para 5 was simply copied from para 4.
Ong was particularly evasive in explaining the origins of the cash payments and the cash cheques and gave vague and vacillating evidence when confronted exh P24:
 
 
Court:
 
Did Mr Chng ask for cash payments to be made in 1994?
 
 
 
A:
 
I`m not able to answer this question because I can`t recall what happened.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
Why then did you state in your statement, that Chng asked for cash cheques?
 
 
 
A:
 
As I explained earlier, it is not my practice to issue cash cheques of large amounts until it is instructed by the payee. I`m not now denying the sentence. I cannot remember how this instruction had taken place.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Court:
 
Were such instructions given?
 
 
 
A:
 
Can`t recall exactly. I assume that there were such instructions.
 
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Put:
 
It was Chng Gim Huat who told you to make payments of cash or by cash cheques in 1994 and 1995.
 
 
 
A:
 
In my statement, I stated that for 1994, Chng Gim Huat asked for cash cheques and I did not query him. I did not make any changes or clarifications for 1994. I`m only clarifying for 1995, the person I spoke to was Chng Beng Siong.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Court:
 
Is it your evidence in Court now that it was Mr Chng Gim Huat who asked for cash cheques in 1993 but Mr Chng Beng Siong who asked for cash cheques in 1995?
 
 
 
A:
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
In his testimony in court, Ong claimed that it was Chng and not the appellant, who requested for cash cheques in 1995. I agreed with the magistrate in rejecting his explanations for the discrepancy. Ong did not furnish a believable reason for his failure to explicitly mention Chng`s role in exh P24. His claim that one Kang Seow Kiam (`Kang`) reminded him of this matter in June/July 1999 was also implausible. This matter was completely unrelated to Kang. It was thus most improbable that Kang would recall this detail some four years after the events of 1995.
Having reviewed Ong`s explanations in the light of all the evidence and surrounding circumstances, I found no reason to impugn the magistrate`s ruling that Ong`s credit had been successfully impeached
 Exhibits P24 and P25 as evidence of facts stated 
 
 
 
I explained in 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
  at [para ] 24, that `[t]he successful impeachment of a witness`s credit under s 157 Evidence Act only goes to the weight of his oral testimony in court and not to its admissibility. It does not mean that the whole of his oral testimony will be expunged.` A trial judge is entitled to disregard the whole of the witness`s testimony, applying the settled principles of impeachment, but it is necessary to bear in mind my cautionary note in 
 Garmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v PP 
 [1995] 3 SLR at pp 711I-712B: 
 
... The mere fact that his credit had been impeached did not necessarily mean that all his evidence would be disregarded. The court would still have to scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine what was true and which aspects should be disregarded. These principles were stated in 
 PP v Somwang Phattanasaeng
, at p 148. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, no arguments on these principles having been raised (
 Somwang Phattanasaeng v PP
).
 
 
 
It is apparent then, that it is well within the province of a trial judge to decide which aspects of the evidence merited consideration, having regard to the entirety of the witness`s testimony, and also, where appropriate, to the case sought to be presented by the party which called him to give evidence.
 
 
 
In addition to the impeachment of Ong`s credit, the former inconsistent statement became admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein by virtue of s 147(3) Evidence Act: 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
  at pp 149-150, 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
  at [para ] 55. The appellant however, contended that the magistrate erred in relying solely on exhs P24 and P25 and completely rejecting Ong`s oral testimony.
Section 147(6) Evidence Act directs the court as follows: 
 
In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section, regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.
 
 
 
In 
PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 158
  at [para ] 27-32, I endeavoured to give some guidance on the application of this provision. The Court of Appeal subsequently cited and approved this decision in 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
 , holding that (at [para ] 56): 
 
... First, the contemporaneity of a statement with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated is important for it guards against inaccuracy, though the degree of contemporaneity required will vary with the facts in question. The recollection of the details of particular events, particularly where these occur quickly, is easily susceptible to error with time but the recollection of the existence of a relationship is not so malleable. Second there can be little guidance on the possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement but the court must be astute in spotting such instances. Third, in addition to the above matters, the weight to be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by an explanation of the inconsistency and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of the facts. Fourth, regard should be had to the context of the statement. Subsection (6) does not restrict consideration to only the making of the statement but requires consideration of all circumstances affecting its accuracy. Thus the court must consider the context of the inconsistent portions, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined. Reliance cannot be placed on a portion of the statement that is taken out of context. Finally the cogency and coherence of the facts relied upon has to be noted. An ambivalent statement does not attract much weight.
 
 
 
It was evident from the grounds of decision that the magistrate had correctly considered the factors elucidated in 
 Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP 
. She did not reject Ong`s oral testimony in total, nor did she reject Ong`s testimony simply on the basis that his credit had been impeached. The magistrate noted that Ong had provided two sources of evidence and went on to test the statements in light of the other evidence, including evidence adduced by the appellant. She was ultimately satisfied that Ong`s previous statements contained the truth and accepted it over his oral testimony.
 Weight to be accorded to exhs P24 and P25 
 
 
 
Exhibits P24 and P25 were recorded in February 1998 and August 1998. They were closer in time to the material events than the trial which took place in August and September 1999. By sheer force of logic, the statements ought to be accorded more weight although due circumspection had to be exercised in view of the lapse of time since the material events in question.
It was not the mere incidental details of particular events which were disputed. The crux of the matter concerned Ong`s proposal to compensate the appellant with interest at 5% pa and the amounts in question, the appellant`s acceptance of the proposal and his request for the payments to be made in cash cheques. These were material agreements and understandings which impacted on and in a sense, directed Ong`s subsequent conduct and were not easily susceptible to error with the passage of time.
What was susceptible to error was the chronology of events, for example, when Ong proposed to compensate the appellant and when the appellant accepted this proposal. This was not lost on the magistrate who found that the events which unfolded were consistent with and corroborated the chronology contained in exh P24. The appellant failed to persuade me that the magistrate`s findings should be faulted.
There was no suggestion that Ong had any reason to conceal or misrepresent the facts. In reality, there was an active disincentive to do so as there was a SES examination into the affairs of ASPL in 1996 and a subsequent IRAS inquiry on Ong`s interest income in March 1997. It was also undisputed that Ong and the appellant enjoyed a cordial and friendly relationship as well as a long-standing business relationship.
I had earlier addressed the explanations for the inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the statements. As I indicated above, exhs P24 and P25 were clear and concise. There was in my view, no ambiguity in their contents and no reason to disturb the weight accorded to exhs P24 and P25 by the magistrate.
 Impact of exh D12 
 
 
 
In assessing the weight to be attached to exhs P24 and P25, the magistrate considered the impact of exh D12, dated 17 March 1997. The appellant relied heavily on exh D12 to show that Ong and the appellant only reached an agreement in 1997 to treat the 1994 and 1995 payments as interest payments.
The investigating officer confirmed that exh D12 was shown to Ong at the time the statements were made. Paragraph 3 of exh P25 also referred to such a letter. Despite this, Ong furnished a version in exh P24 which incriminated the appellant. In exh P25, Ong again confirmed that when the 1994 and 1995 payments were made, the appellant was informed that they were interest sums. Having regard to all the circumstances, including the fact that this was now a criminal investigation, I agreed with the magistrate`s assessment that exh P24 contained the truth.
The magistrate could not be faulted for declining to place any weight on exh D12 in light of its origins. Ong testified that sometime in March 1997, he told the appellant that in 1996, he informed the SES that the 1994 and 1995 payments were interest payments. He also told the appellant that it had triggered an IRAS enquiry on him. The appellant became upset and asked Ong to prepare exh D12 so that he could proceed with his own tax declaration. Ong however, could not satisfactorily explain his failure to inform the appellant of this important matter in 1996. He merely asserted that it was due to an oversight. This explanation was rightly rejected. In my view, it was the appellant`s realisation that the IRAS would eventually discover his failure to declare the interest income that caused him to procure exh D12.
On the other hand, the appellant claimed that in 1997, Ong explained that he had mistakenly declared the 1994 and 1995 payments as `interest payments` during the SES examination and sought the appellant`s assistance. Exhibit D12 originated from his desire to help Ong. This explanation was quite incomprehensible and illogical. There was no reason for the appellant to assist Ong in this manner. Ong could have easily clarified the alleged mistake with SES instead of resorting to this delayed and rather complicated solution. Oddly enough, although the appellant was confronted for the first time with the possibility that the 1994 and 1995 payments were interest payments, he did not immediately enquire about the interest rates and the period of the interest. In my view, the appellant`s conduct showed that he already knew that the 1994 and 1995 payments were interest sums.
The appellant also attempted to embellish his evidence. He claimed to possess documents from SES showing that he had treated the 1994 and 1995 payments as capital repayments. However these highly crucial and material documents were never produced in court. Under these circumstances, the magistrate was rightly led to the conclusion that the appellant had fabricated this evidence as an afterthought.
 Discrepancy of $40,000 
 
 
 
The appellant also referred to the discrepancy of $40,000 between the payments received by the appellant in 1995 ($1.064m) and the amount of interest ($1.024m) reflected in the calculations contained in App A to exh P24.
In my view, this was not a real discrepancy. The magistrate accepted Ong`s evidence that the $40,000 was reimbursement for banking charges incurred by the appellant in obtaining the loan. Even though Ong`s credit was impeached, it did not mean that his entire testimony was rejected. The magistrate was entitled to accept some parts of his oral evidence as the truth. It was clear from para 5 of exh P24 that Ong proposed to pay the appellant $1.024m in interest which proposal was accepted by the appellant at the material time. That was the crux of the second charge.
In the final analysis, it seemed to me that Ong`s testimony on the material points was tainted by a motivation to paint a favourable picture for the appellant. He was afflicted with convenient bouts of amnesia and deliberate vagueness on issues which could shed critical light on the appellant`s state of mind. On the other hand, he possessed a clarity of memory on matters which tended to absolve the appellant. In light of this and since the magistrate`s findings of fact had not been shown to be clearly wrong, I concluded that the court below was entitled to rely on exhs P24 and P25 in convicting the appellant.
 Whether the appellant was aware of the nature of the payments and wilfully omitted them from the tax returns with an intent to evade tax 
 
 
 
The appellant`s knowledge of the nature of the payments was necessarily linked to the question of whether he had wilfully omitted the interest income from his tax returns with the intention of evading tax. FA Chua J in 
Ng Chwee Poh v PP
 
 SLR 603 
 [1977] 2 MLJ 203 
 at p 237, in an appeal involving a similar charge, cited and approved the meaning of the term `wilfully` set out by the trial judge in that case: 
 
This term (wilfully) has been discussed fully and defined in several decided cases. In the case of Senior 
[1899] 1 QB 283
, at p 290, Lord Russell of Killowen described the term thus; `
 wilfully` means that the act is done deliberately and intentionally, not by accident or inadvertence, but so that the mind of the person who does the act goes with it
. This interpretation was adopted in the case of 
 AB Tamboli v Agent, GIP Railway Company, Bombay
 AIR 1928 PC (Bombay) 24, at pp 26-27. Again, in the case of 
Iannella v French
 
[] 41 ALJR 389
, at p 303, Barwick CJ stated, `... ""
 wilful"" connotes intention and knowledge:...
` and further in his judgment therein, that, `
 the word contains in its connotations elements of purpose
`. Windeyer J, also in the same case, at p 399, expanded on this interpretation of the term in the words, `If the word ""wilfully"" be given the meaning and effect that I think it has in this context, 
 then an honest mistake as to the existence of any element essential to the offence is a defence
`. He also referred to the judgement of Napier CJ in the case of 
Davies v O`Sullivan (No 2)
 
[1949] SASR 208
, wherein it was stated. `
 the natural meaning (of the term ""wilfully"") ... is that the act was done intentionally, not by accident or inadvertence, but so that the mind or will of the action goes with the act ...
` with which he expressed his agreement. ... Windeyer J added that, `
 That word ""wilfully"" does not stand alone. Its importance is in the meaning which it gives to its context
`. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
And further, at p 238: 
 
 
 Wilfulness implies knowledge proved by circumstantial evidence rather than by direct evidence to be gathered from the acts and conduct of the appellant
. With intent to evade tax implies motive. What was the motive of the appellant? Was it solely to evade payment of less tax? 
 The ultimate question before the court is what is the totality of the evidence of the acts and conduct of the appellant at the relevant time
 when the appellant prepared and submitted exh P15 to 
 enable the court to infer that the omission ... was an act done wilfully
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
I was in full agreement with the above passage. Therefore, if the appellant harboured an honest mistake as to the nature of the payments, he would not be guilty of the offences charged, although he might well be guilty of a lesser offence under s 95(1)(a) or s 95(2)(a) of the Act for omitting or negligently omitting to declare the interest income. Conversely, if the direct and circumstantial evidence proved that the appellant was aware of the purpose and nature of the payments and had deliberately omitted to declare the payments with an intent to declare tax, he would be guilty of the offences as charged.
 Knowledge of nature of payments 
 
 
 
The appellant faced the uphill task of persuading me that the magistrate had clearly and manifestly erred in rejecting his testimony as being `incredible`, unreliable`, `fabricated`, `an afterthought` and `did not make sense`. Having carefully considered the appellant`s submissions, it sufficed to say that the appellant failed to convince me that the magistrate`s findings of fact, which were based on her assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses, were perverse and ought to be overturned.
Apart from the direct evidence contained in exhs P24 and P25 showing that the appellant knew that the sums paid in 1994 and 1995 were interest payments and not capital repayments, there was ample circumstantial evidence supporting the conclusion that the appellant knew the purpose of those payments at the material time.
Unlike the 1992 payment which was accompanied by a covering letter expressly stating that it was a partial repayment of the loan, the 1994 and 1995 payments were made in cash or cash cheques, and without any covering letters. The sudden, unexplained payment of large sums of money, as well as the distinctly different mode of payment, surely called for an inquiry. Afterall, the appellant had been anxious to recover his loan. Furthermore, it was the appellant`s own evidence that Ong had proposed to compensate him with interest in late 1994, even though no further details were discussed. This was then followed by the cash payments after the dividends declaration in 1995. Thus viewed, the appellant claimed ignorance and failure to clarify the purpose of those payments strongly indicated that he already knew that they were interest payments. As aptly put by the magistrate in her grounds of decision at [para ] 100: 
 
... his defence is totally unacceptable in the light of the surrounding facts and circumstances particularly when he said that he just accepted what PW4 [Ong] told him without wanting to confirm the nature of the payments. Surely, a successful businessman like the accused, would enquire if he did not know about the nature of payments in the first place.
 
 
 
The appellant relied heavily on exh D12, dated 17 March 1997, to show that they only agreed to treat the 1994 and 1995 payments as interest payments in 1997. However, as I have explained above at [para ] 69-72, the magistrate was correct in attributing little weight to this document.
 Wilful omission with intention to evade tax 
 
 
 
I was not persuaded that the magistrate erred in drawing the inference that the appellant possessed the requisite mens rea to evade tax.
The incriminating evidence came from the appellant`s concerted efforts in ensuring the untraceability of the funds. The first of which was his request for the payments to be made by cash cheques as indicated in exh P24, which was corroborated by Ong`s oral testimony and the appellant`s own evidence that he requested the first payment, amounting to $60,000, to be made in cash. This mode of payment contrasted sharply with the capital repayments which were easily traceable and which were accompanied by covering letters.
Even if I accepted that the appellant was genuinely in need of cash for the first payment of $60,000, this did not explain the subsequent payments (in 1994 and 1995) which were also made in cash or cash cheques. The appellant himself admitted that he was not in need of cash. The evidence showed that after receiving the payments, he in fact embarked on a systematic deposit of a large portion of the cash received into his accounts with Dao Heng bank in Hong Kong and Bangkok Bank in Singapore.
The appellant was evasive and refused to or was unable to explain, despite repeated questioning, why he did not request Ong to make the subsequent payments in account payees cheques or cashier`s orders which was a far safer and more convenient mode of payment. This must also be viewed in the light of Ong`s practice of not issuing cash cheques for such large sums of money in the absence of an express request by the payee.
The appellant also admitted that he personally carried a large portion of the 1995 payments amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash to Hong Kong, converted it into Hong Kong currency and deposited it into his Hong Kong bank account. This conduct was highly incriminating, especially in the absence of any satisfactory explanation for transporting and depositing the money is such a convoluted manner. The appellant denied that it was risky to transport the cash physically, and insisted that it was faster and more convenient than a telegraphic transfer of funds. During the proceedings, it emerged that the appellant was a director of one of the largest finance companies in Singapore. Considering his background in this industry, I found this explanation most astonishing and untenable.
In his written arguments, counsel for the appellant contended that until the long overdue loan had been fully repayed, and in the absence of any agreement that the loan was subject to the payment of interest, the appellant was entitled to treat such payments as repayments of the principal. His counsel referred to the Statement of Accounting Standards (SAS) 16 and GAAP Guide 1995 (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).
I found these references to be of limited assistance. First, the appellant failed to explain how these technical accounting principles applied to the facts in question. Furthermore, the extract from the Statement of Accounting Standards contained general definitions of income, revenue and interest and did not appear to be relevant to the appellant`s submissions.
The appellant cited two chapters from the GAAP Guide entitled `Impairment of a Loan` and `Installment Sales Method of Accounting`. The former referred to an accounting method which provided for a loss contingency for impaired loans, ie `when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principle and interest`. 20.05 of the GAAP Guide states: 
 
... A loan is not considered impaired if
 
 
 
 
[bull ] There is merely an insignificant delay or shortfalls in amounts of payments. 
 
[bull ] The creditor expects to collect all amounts due, including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate for the period of the delay
  
 
 
There was however, no evidence, nor any arguments before me or in the court below, that the loan was impaired. The chapter `Installment Sales Method of Accounting` cited in GAAP Guide at 22.03 was clearly inapplicable to the facts of the instant appeal. As stated in the overview to that chapter, that method provided for the `deferral of gross profit on instalment sales until cash is collected`. This appeal did not involve any instalment sales.
Whilst true that the appellant subsequently declared the interest payments to IRAS and paid the additional taxes, it was a necessary corollary of the attempt to cover his tracks as evidenced by exh D12. This did not detract from the fact that the appellant possessed the intention to evade tax at the material time.
Having reviewed the evidence, I found no reason to disturb the magistrate`s findings. Viewed in totality, the direct and indirect evidence gave rise to an irresistible conclusion that the appellant knew that the 1994 and 1995 payments were interest payments and that he had wilfully omitted them from the income tax returns for assessment years 1995 and 1996 with the intent to evade tax. I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case against the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt and dismissed the appeals against conviction.
 The appeals against sentence 
 
 
 
The appellant urged me to impose non-custodial sentences or alternatively, to reduce the period of imprisonment. The appellant contended that the sentences of imprisonment were manifestly excessive and that the magistrate failed to adequately consider the relevant factors affecting the appropriate sentences.
In sentencing the appellant, the magistrate took into account the fact that the appellant reported the interest income to IRAS before investigations began and paid the additional taxes assessed. Against that, she noted that the offences were serious in nature and were tantamount to cheating the State. She also noted that the appellant attempted to disguise the payments which he had received.
 Whether it is mandatory for the court to impose a fine or imprisonment or both 
 
 
 
Section 96(1) Income Tax Act states: 
 
Any person who wilfully with intent to evade tax -
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
shall be guilty of an offence for which, on conviction, he 
 shall pay a penalty
 of treble the amount of tax which has been undercharged in consequence of the offence or which would have been undercharged if the offence had not been detected, and 
 shall also be liable to
 a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or both. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant cited the case of 
PP v Lee Soon Lee Vincent
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 552
  and submitted that the phrase `shall also be liable` meant that the court had the discretion not to sentence the appellant to a fine and/or to imprisonment. Counsel argued that these were optional, additional sentences to the mandatory treble penalty and need not be imposed if the court was satisfied that the penalty was a sufficient punishment. The prosecution disagreed and argued that the court must impose either a fine or imprisonment or both in addition to the penalty. However the prosecution did not cite any reasons or arguments in support.
I did not consider it strictly necessary to determine this question. Even if this court had the discretion advocated for by counsel, I would not have been minded to exercise it in favour of the appellant. Nonetheless, I would venture to express my preliminary views, bearing in mind that I did not have the benefit of full submissions from both parties and that it may well be necessary for this question to be canvassed and argued more fully in a future case.
In 
 PP v Lee Soon Lee Vincent 
 at [para ] 14, I acknowledged that: 
 
In my view, prima facie, the phrase `shall be liable` (as opposed to `shall be punished`) contained no obligation or mandatory connotation.
 
 
 
However, as illustrated in that case, the use of the phrase `shall be liable` can sometimes convey a mandatory effect. There, I had to interpret the effect of s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) which read: 
 
... 
 shall be liable
 on conviction to a fine ... or to imprisonment and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine ... and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
I eventually concluded that the a term of imprisonment was mandatory for a repeat offender even though it was prefaced by the phrase `shall be liable`. There was however no dispute in that case that one or both of the prescribed punishments had to be imposed on a first offender.
In order to interpret a statutory provision, the court will normally rely on the wording of the relevant sections as they appear in the statutes and where available, the full legislative history of the provision in question: 
 PP v Lee Soon Lee Vincent 
 at [para ] 27. I was not able to locate any relevant Parliamentary debates relating to this phrase in the context of the Income Tax Act. Nonetheless, it was my considered opinion that s 96(1) prescribes a mandatory fine or imprisonment or both in addition to the mandatory treble penalty.
The phrase `shall be liable` is used throughout the Income Tax Act in prescribing the sentences of fines or imprisonment. For instance, it appears in s 94(2), which is the general sentencing provision for contravention of provisions of the Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder: 
 
Any person guilty of an offence under this Act for which no other penalty is provided shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 and in default of payment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months.
 
 
 
Similarly, s 97 which concerns offences committed by authorised and unauthorised persons, provides that such offenders 
 
... shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.
 
 
 
In the above examples, the phrase `shall be liable` must necessarily be of mandatory effect in the sense that one or both of the prescribed sentences must be imposed. To interpret it in any other manner would lead to the absurd possibility that no sentence may be imposed upon the offender at all. In my view, the same interpretation necessarily applied to the phrase `shall be liable` as it appears in s 96(1). As stated in Bennion 
 Statutory Interpretation 
 (3rd Ed, 1997) at p 942, 
 
Since drafting is presumed to be competent, it is assumed that a word or phrase has the same meaning throughout unless the contrary intention is shown. This is an aspect of the principle that an Act should be drafted and construed as a whole. It is a sound rule of construction to give the same meaning to the same words occurring in different parts of an Act.
 
 
 
Unless a contrary intention is shown or there is some doubt as to Parliament`s intention, a departure from this approach would place the court in an invidious position of having to interpret an identical phrase in a different manner in different parts of the Income Tax Act. This would give rise to uncertainties in the application and implementation of the law.
Reading the Income Tax Act as a whole, I was not able to find any indication that Parliament intended a contrary effect. I was fortified in that view by reference to s 96(2): 
 
Where an individual has been convicted for 3 or more offences under this section the imprisonment he shall be liable to shall not be less than 6 months.
 
 
 
In interpreting the effect of the phrase `shall be liable`, I bore in mind the accepted canon of statutory interpretation that the court would avoid a construction that produces an absurd result or a construction that creates an anomaly or otherwise produces an irrational or illogical result: 
 Bennion 
, supra, at p 751, 764. Applying that principle, the phrase `shall be liable to` must necessarily be interpreted in a mandatory sense in both ss 96(1) and 96(2).
How was this conclusion reached? I first noted that Parliament intended to punish offenders with multiple charges more severely since this has been specifically legislated for. It thus follows that s 96(2) prescribes a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of six months in addition to the mandatory treble penalty. This position was explicitly accepted without argument by FA Chua J in 
 Ng Chwee Poh v PP 
 at p 246. Section 96(2) would be superfluous if it is wholly discretionary in nature since s 96(1) already provides for sentences of imprisonment. Further, if s 96(2) is wholly discretionary, an offender with multiple charges would either not be sentenced to imprisonment or sentenced to a minimum term of six months on each charge. On the other hand, an offender facing a single charge of tax evasion may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years pursuant to s 96(1). Such an outcome would indeed be absurd, anomalous and illogical.
In my view, the phrase `shall pay a penalty of treble the amount of tax` did not affect the above conclusion. This phraseology simply emphasizes that the court has to impose such a penalty as opposed to the later part of s 96(2) where there is a choice of either one or both of the prescribed sentences. This does not change the meaning of `shall be liable` as it appears in other parts of the Act such that the court may decline to impose any of the prescribed sentences altogether.
The penalty appears to be of a somewhat different genus from the usual sentencing option of a fine. Otherwise Parliament could simply have legislated for a mandatory fine of three times the tax evaded. In addition, while non-payment of a fine is punishable with in default terms of imprisonment, s 90(1) provides that any tax or penalty imposed under the Act may be sued for by way of a specially endorsed writ of summons. This supported my view that the treble penalty is a mandatory order which is additional to the usual sentencing options.
 Whether the sentence was manifestly excessive 
 
 
 
I was not persuaded by the appellant`s arguments and was not inclined to substitute the sentence of imprisonment with a fine. In 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
 , I discussed the interplay between the sentencing principles of retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation; and noted that (at [para ] 21): 
 
... the foregoing principles cannot be applied merely to determine whether the proper sentence is a fine or imprisonment but also to determine whether, in addition to a fine, a custodial sentence should be imposed. Moreover, after the proper option has been determined, it seems the foregoing principle must again be applied in order to ascertain what the amount of fine or the term of imprisonment should be. In the view of Tan Yock Lin, there is a better way:
 
 
 
... what will facilitate more rational and informed sentencing is recognition that there is a dichotomy between public interest and aggravating or mitigating factors. 
 Generally speaking, only the public interest should affect the type of sentence to be imposed while only aggravating or mitigating circumstances affect the duration or severity of the sentence imposed
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The public interest was significant in this case as the charges were grave and were tantamount to a deliberate fraud on the State. Higgins J expressed the view in 
 R v Elvin & Anor 
 97 ATC 4089 (at p 4094) that while: 
 
It is not possible, ... to conclude that every substantial tax fraud should result in the incarceration of the offender. It is possible to conclude that deliberate and systematic fraud on the revenue will, in the absence of substantial mitigating factors, lead to incarceration.
 
 
 
This type of offences affect the society as a whole as any deficiencies in revenue would have to be made up by other taxpayers. Furthermore, such offences are often difficult to detect or investigate without information or co-operation from the taxpayers. In view of these considerations, a custodial sentence should normally be imposed in order to meet the needs of general deterrence.
Case authorities from other jurisdictions have provided useful guidance on the governing factors to be considered in deciding on the appropriate sentences for tax evasion offences. In 
A-G v Ma Lai Wu & Ors
 
[1987] HKLR 744
, the respondent was sentenced to suspended terms of imprisonment and fines for offences involving the fraudulent avoidance of tax. The Hong Kong Attorney General applied by way of case stated to the Hong Kong Court of Appeal. The appellate court allowed the application for review and imposed penalty fines while reducing the amount of fines imposed but did not disturb the suspended terms of imprisonment. In the course of the judgement, Silke JA, delivering the judgment of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal, stated at (p 747D-G): 
 
... While sentences imposed in other jurisdictions with differing social and economic structures and the reasons for them are not necessarily applicable to Hong Kong, each of those cases emphasized the principle that the course which should be taken by a court where there is deliberate and fraudulent evasion of tax is one of immediate imprisonment which may be coupled with a fine and a penalty. We think that, in Hong Kong, ... sentences of immediate custodial imprisonment should in future be imposed in the appropriate case.
 
 
 
 
 It is necessary for a court to take into consideration when assessing the quantum of such sentence - and this list is not intended to be exhaustive - the time span of the offences, the systems and methods used to evade tax, where or not there was re-payment of the tax evaded, the amount of that tax, the individual culpability of one or more defendants and the circumstances of each defendant.
 
 
 
 
Lenient sentences, where detection is not certain, may encourage persons to take a risk. People who commit offences such as these are favoured by the possibility of non-detection and favoured yet again if upon detection they can look forward to leniency.

In the subsequent case of 
R v Ng Wing Keung
 
[1997] HKLR 142
, the offender was sentenced to imprisonment following conviction on tax evasion charges. The offender did not suggest that the sentence was too long or was wrong in principle, but argued that the sentence of imprisonment ought to have been suspended. The Hong Kong High Court cited and applied the factors set out in 
 A- G v Ma Lai Wu & Ors 
. In upholding the sentence, Stuart-Moore J, delivering the judgment of the majority of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal, approved the approach which was adopted by the High Court below (at p 147C-148E).
As revealed from the magistrate`s findings, the offences were committed with premeditation and deliberation. The evidence revealed a careful scheme of concealment to evade tax through the use of cash cheque and overseas deposits which occurred over the course of two years. The appellant eventually received a large sum of interest totalling $1.314m. The total tax evaded was substantial and amounted to $354,645.65, a sum far in excess of the maximum fine of $10,000 prescribed under s 96(1) of the Act. With that in mind, a fine would have been manifestly inadequate. As was noted in 9(2) 
 Butterworths Annotated Statutes of Singapore 
 at p 933: 
 
Where substantial amount of tax is being evaded by deception, the usual sentence adopted by courts in many jurisdictions has been that of a custodial one.
 
 
 
The appellant cannot deny that he bore individual responsibility for the acts. He requested that the payments be made in cash cheques and subsequently wilfully omitted to declare the interest income to the tax authorities. He would also have been the sole beneficiary if the scheme had succeeded.
In my view, the strongest mitigating factor in the appellant`s favour was his voluntary and swift action in notifying IRAS of the payments before investigations began. The appellant subsequently made reparation and paid additional taxes amounting to $394,7354,645.65 which was in excess of the actual taxes payable. This was a significant indication of the appellant`s desire to make amends. I was inclined to agree that the magistrate had not given sufficient weight to this and shared the observation made by Higgins J observations in 
 R v Elvin & Anor 
 (at p 4094): 
 
... It is true that the perception that those who have profited from tax evasion can buy freedom from incarceration either from the profits of that evasion or their accumulated wealth must be avoided.
 However, as with a plea of guilty, it is a relevant matter favouring leniency. The weight to be accorded to it depends, as with a plea of guilty, on the implication as to remorse and the desire to make amends which the reparation in the circumstances discloses
. The degree of hardship accepted by the offender in making reparation is also material. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The appellant`s individual circumstances must also be considered. I noted from the mitigation plea in the court below, that the appellant started from relatively humble beginnings and had since built up a successful business. He had also made several contributions to the community, for instance, he had been the Chairman of the Management Committee of a primary school since 1983 and had also been the Honorary Chairman of a Citizens` Consultative Committee since 1994.
In the final analysis, after taking into account the above considerations, the appellant`s age (65 years old), the fact that he was a first offender as well as the fact that he had to resign from all his directorships following the convictions, I accepted the appellant`s submissions that the sentences were manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I allowed the appeals against the sentences and reduced the period of imprisonment to one month and two months on the first and second charges respectively. I ordered both sentences to run concurrently, resulting in a total sentence of two months` imprisonment. I did not disturb the orders made by the magistrate in relation to the penalties imposed.

: The appellant, Ong Phee Hoon James, was charged with five counts of having harboured illegal immigration offenders under s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Act. He was tried and convicted in the district court on all five charges. The district judge Zainol Abeedin Hussin (`the judge`) sentenced the appellant to eight months` imprisonment on each charge. Two of the five sentences were ordered to run consecutively while the remaining three terms were ordered to run concurrently. Consequently, a term of 16 months` imprisonment was imposed on the appellant.

On 1 October 1998, the appellant leased the premises at No 200 Jalan Sultan [num ]15-06, Textile Centre, Singapore (`the premises`) to a Bangladeshi national by the name of Ansar. The appellant and one Chua Guan Chye (`Chua`) had jointly purchased the premises as an investment.
At various times between July and October 1998, the five persons named in the five charges, namely Mostaffa (PW6), Baskar Khan (PW2), Miras (PW5), Md Kalum (PW3) and Zakirul Islam (PW4), were brought to the premises to stay. Each of them was told that the appellant was the owner of the premises and that they had to obtain his permission to stay at the premises. They were also informed that the rental of $150 per month was payable on the fifth day of every month.
At the trial, these five persons informed the court that they had been introduced to the appellant who had, in turn, granted them permission to stay at the premises. Thereafter, they stayed at the premises and paid the monthly rental to the appellant through various intermediaries.
On 13 October 1998, the police raided the premises and arrested 21 Bangladeshi nationals including the five illegal immigrants named in the charges. All five persons were illegal immigrants in that they had contravened s 6(1) of the Immigration Act. Section 6(1) provides: 
 
No person, other than a citizen of Singapore, shall enter or attempt to enter Singapore unless -
 
 
 
 
(a) he is in possession of a valid entry permit or re-entry permit lawfully issued to him under section 10 or 11; 
 
(b) his name is endorsed upon a valid entry permit or re-entry permit in accordance with section 12, and he is in the company of the holder of that permit; 
 
(c) he is in possession of a valid pass lawfully issued to him to enter Singapore; or 
 
(d) he is exempted from this section by an order made under section 56.
  
 
 
All of them had been charged and convicted for their illegal presence in Singapore. They were each sentenced to one month`s imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
 The defence 
 
 
 
In his defence, the appellant stated that he had never seen any of the five illegal immigrants before. He claimed that in early 1998, he and Chua had rented the premises out to one Faruk. Faruk had agreed to pay a monthly rental of $1,850. A tenancy agreement dated 1 March 1998 was signed. In the course of Faruk`s occupation of the premises, Chua collected rent from him on about five occasions. Payment for the rest of the period was given to the appellant. Faruk stayed at the premises from March until September or October 1998 although he had agreed to stay for a year. The appellant stated that he was unaware of anyone other than Faruk and one Sony (a witness to the tenancy agreement) staying at the premises during Faruk`s tenancy.
In any event, the appellant contended that he had exercised due diligence in ascertaining that Faruk was not an illegal immigrant. He stated that he had checked Faruk`s passport and had noted that it bore a stamp indicating Faruk`s entry into Singapore sometime in late February 1998. The appellant had also asked for Faruk`s work permit but was told by the latter that he did not have one as he was a businessman. The appellant also asked for and was shown Sony`s passport. The details of Sony`s work permit were recorded next to Sony`s signature in the tenancy agreement. As a precaution, the appellant inserted a clause into the tenancy agreement requiring the tenant to ensure that no illegal immigrant visited or stayed at the premises. There was also a clause forbidding the tenant to assign, sublet or part with possession of the premises.
When Faruk gave up the tenancy, he introduced one Ansar to take over the premises on the same terms. Another agreement (exh P-6) was entered into with Ansar. Ansar moved into the premises on 1 October 1998. Subsequently, the appellant heard that police raided the premises on 13 October 1998.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The judge found the appellant guilty as charged.
 Identification of the appellant 
 
 
 
The judge rejected the appellant`s defence that he had not seen any of the five illegal immigrants before. This was because the five illegal immigrants had no difficulty identifying the appellant as the owner of the premises. They claimed that they had each been introduced to the appellant when they were brought to the premises to stay.
 Due diligence 
 
 
 
The judge also did not accept the appellant`s claim that he had exercised due diligence in a manner that would afford him a defence to the offence under s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Act with which he was charged. Section 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Act provides: 
 
 
(1) Any person who - 
 
... 
 
(d) harbours any person who has acted in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the regulations; 
 
...
  
 
 
shall be guilty of an offence ...
 
 
 
Section 57(9) of the same Act provides: 
 
In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1)(d) or (e), it shall not be a defence for the defendant to prove that the person harboured or employed by him was in possession of a pass or permit issued to the person under the Act or the Regulations unless the defendant further proves that he had exercised due diligence to ascertain that the pass or permit was at the material time valid under this Act or the regulations.
 
 
 
Section 57(10) (as it was before the amendment that came into effect on 5 October 1998) provides: 
 
For the purposes of subsection (9) a defendant shall not be deemed to have exercised due diligence unless he had personally checked the passport or other travel documents of the person whom he had harboured or employed and had reasonable ground to believe that -
 
 
 
 
(a) the person harboured or employed by him had, at the material time, in force a pass or permit issued under this Act or the regulations; and 
 
(b) where such person is the holder of a valid pass, that person had, at the material time, in force a work permit under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A) or had obtained the written consent of the Controller to work in Singapore.
  
 
 
Although the appellant did take precautions to ensure that Faruk, Sony, Ansar and two of Ansar`s uncles were not illegal immigrants, these steps were not relevant as the appellant was charged with harbouring other persons, those other persons being the five illegal immigrants named in the charges. There was no evidence that the appellant had personally checked the passport of Mostaffa, Baskar Khan, Miras, Md Kalum or Zakirul Islam. Further, the appellant did not claim that he had reasonable grounds to believe that these five individuals each had a valid pass or permit that was issued under the Immigration Act or regulations. Accordingly, the judge did not think that the appellant had a valid defence in this regard.
In any event, the judge did not think that the precautionary steps taken by the appellant in relation to Faruk and Ansar were sufficient to constitute due diligence under s 57(9) of the Immigration Act. According to Chua, Faruk only had a 14-day pass. This would have been apparent to the appellant if he had checked Faruk`s travel document. In any case, there was no evidence that the appellant had re-checked Faruk`s passport after the expiry of the 14-day pass.
Although the appellant claimed to have checked Ansar`s passport and work permit and obtained photocopies of the same, the judge was not persuaded that the steps taken in relation to Ansar constituted due diligence on the appellant`s part. First, there was no indication in the passport that Ansar had entered Singapore legally. Secondly, the signature at page 3 of it did not tally with Ansar`s signature in his tenancy agreement. Further, the evidence did not indicate that the appellant had ascertained that Ansar had entered and remained in Singapore legally.
The judge went further and held that the appellant knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that Faruk and Ansar were illegal immigrants. Even if Faruk and Ansar had sub-let the premises to the five illegal immigrants without the knowledge of the appellant, the appellant should not be absolved from liablity for harbouring the sub-tenants of the premises. The judge derived support for his conclusion in this regard from the decision of the Chief Justice in 
Lim Dee Chew v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 956
  (`
 Lim Dee Chew 
`). It was stated in that case that: 
 
[W]here the owner rented his premises to an illegal immigrant who in turn rented out rooms in the premises without informing the owner ... it must surely follow that the owner should be held to be the harbourer of all of them. The owner would not be allowed to hide behind his initial illegal act to avoid liability for all the other illegal immigrants, regardless of his lack of knowledge or consent. Only if he had initially rented the premises to a person who was in Singapore legally, would he not be liable under the Act if the lawful tenant in turn rented the premises to illegal immigrants without his knowledge or consent.
 
 
 
On the basis of the above passage, the judge held that the appellant was vicariously liable for harbouring the five illegal immigrants.
 Impeachment of the appellant`s credit 
 
 
 
In the course of the trial, the judge allowed the prosecution`s application to impeach the appellant`s credit on the basis of four inconsistencies which the judge regarded as material. In substance, the inconsistencies were as follows: 
(a) In his statement to the police (exh P-10), the appellant admitted that he had never checked Faruk`s documents as Faruk had been introduced to him by a housing agent. In court, the appellant maintained that he had inspected Faruk`s passport. 
(b) In P-10, the appellant stated that he had only checked a photocopy of Ansar`s passport. However, the appellant stated in court that he had checked the originals of both Ansar`s work permit and passport. 
(c) In court, the appellant revealed in cross-examination that he did not know that Faruk was sharing the premises with other persons. He also said that when Faruk was the tenant, only Faruk and Sony would be staying at the premises. The appellant also stated that only Ansar and his two uncles would be staying at the premises when Ansar took over Faruk`s tenancy. This contradicted the following extract of the appellant`s statement in P-10 wherein he said: 
 
 
Sometime [in] late January 98, [Faruk] spoke to me to enquire whether I have a flat to let. [Faruk] used to rent my wife`s flat at Tiong Poh road together with some other Bangladeshi nationals and the neighbours complained to the URA that they were dirty and cooking was smelly ... I asked Faruk how many people will be staying at No 200 Jalan Sultan [num ]15-06 and he said that only seven to eight Bangladeshi nationals will be staying together with him there.
  
 
(d) In P-10, the appellant stated that he had met Ansar when the latter accompanied Faruk on the first day of Faruk`s tenancy. In court, the appellant alleged that he only met Ansar for the first time in mid-September 1998.
The judge did not accept the appellant`s explanations for the above inconsistencies. Accordingly, he ruled that the appellant`s credit had been impeached.
 Alibi witnesses 
 
 
 
A number of the appellant`s relatives gave evidence in support of the appellant`s alibi that he was at a birthday party on 5 September 1998. According to the prosecution witnesses, the appellant was at the premises on the same day to collect the monthly rental from them.
The judge was not persuaded by this defence. First, all the alibi witnesses were related to the appellant. Secondly, the judge doubted their ability to recall some ten months after the event the fact that the appellant had left the party after 11pm. In any case, he did not think that the appellant`s presence at the premises on 5 September 1998 was a crucial fact as the prosecution witnesses had recognised him as the person to whom they paid the rent. Further, it was possible that the prosecution witnesses had genuinely made a mistake about the appellant having visited the premises on 5 September 1998. In addition, he did not rule out the possibility that the appellant might have visited the premises after the party on 5 September 1998.
 Adverse inference 
 
 
 
The judge also refused to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution for not calling Ansar as a witness. Ansar had been repatriated to Bangladesh on 14 October 1998 by the Immigration Department. There was no evidence of a sinister motive on the part of the prosecution.
For the above reasons, the judge convicted the appellant on all five charges.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant has appealed against the decision of the judge on the following grounds: 
(a) the judge erred in law when he misinterpreted the word `harbour` in the context of the Immigration Act; 
(b) he erred in finding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the acts of Faruk or Ansar; 
(c) he erred in finding that the defence of due diligence was not established; 
(d) he erred in concluding that the appellant`s credit had been impeached on the basis of inconsistencies that were minor; 
(e) he erred in finding that the appellant had been properly identified when the circumstances indicated that he was wrongly and unfairly identified; 
(f) he erred in rejecting the alibi defence; 
(g) he erred in failing to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution for not calling Ansar as a witness.
 The meaning of `harbour` 
 
 
 
The appellant argued that `harbour` in the context of the Immigration Act meant the giving of secret refuge to an immigration offender and did not encompass the wider meaning of giving accommodation or providing a roof to immigration offenders, as contended by the respondent. Accordingly, the appellant stated that the leasing of premises to immigration offenders did not constitute `harbouring` under the said Act.
Section 2 of the Immigration Act defines `harbour` as `to give food or shelter, and includes the act of assisting a person in any way to evade apprehension`. The meaning of `shelter` in the context of the Immigration Act has been defined as `providing some form of habitation` (see 
Lee Boon Leong Joseph v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 445
 ).
In my opinion, the leasing of premises to immigration offenders constitutes the provision of shelter or habitation to such persons. The act of leasing is beyond doubt a positive act of providing shelter on the part of the landlord. Furthermore, the appellant had sufficient control over the rent (see 
 Lim Dee Chew 
 at [para ] 34). The evidence showed that he dictated the amount of rent payable and collected rent from the five illegal immigrants named in the charges. Accordingly, there was no doubt that the appellant was the `harbourer` of the five illegal immigrants.
In any case, there is no support for the restricted definition of `harbour` advanced by the appellant. The appellant argued that the definition of `harbour` is confined to the giving of secret refuge to an immigration offender. Support for this position was derived from some English decisions which examined the type of conduct that would constitute the harbouring of prison escapees. In this specific context, Goff LJ in 
Darch v Weight
 
[1984] 2 All ER 245
 stated that there has to be a provision of shelter in the sense of `
 providing a refuge for an escapee 
` before there can be a conviction for the offence of knowingly harbouring a prison escapee under s 22(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1961 [UK]. In my view, the appellant`s reliance on this case was unfounded. First, Goff LJ was referring to a specific provision of British legislation which dealt with the problem of prison escapees being sheltered and protected from the authorities by members of the public. That offence is rather different from, and in my view more severe than, harbouring illegal immigrants in the context of s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Act. Secondly, the restricted definition of `harbour` advanced by Goff LJ was justified in the circumstances because s 22(2) of the Criminal Justice Act specifically targets any person who `
 knowingly harbours 
` a prison escapee. The presence of the term `
 knowingly 
` in s 22(2) (and its absence in s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Act) called for a definition of `harbour` that included an intent to protect or afford clandestine refuge to prison escapees.
Accordingly, it was my opinion that the meaning of `harbour` that was advanced by the respondent and applied by the judge was correct.
 Vicarious liability under Lim Dee Chew v PP 
 
 
 
The appellants submitted that the judge erred when he concluded that, where an accused person knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that his tenants were illegal immigrants, he could not be relieved of liability for harbouring the sub-tenants who were also illegal immigrants The appellants stated that the judge did not pay sufficient attention to an earlier passage in 
 Lim Dee Chew 
 where it was stated that: 
 
The person who provides the shelter or food (`the harbourer`) may not necessarily be the owner of the premises. In many cases the owner of the premises may rent out the premises to a tenant who in turn may rent it to a sub-tenant. If the sub-tenant turns out to be an illegal immigrant, it cannot be that in all cases the owner of the premises will be held as the person who harboured the illegal immigrant. In my opinion this would depend on the facts of each particular case and the agreement which the owner of the premises had with the tenant.
 
 
 
The appellant submitted that the judge did not adequately consider the facts of the present case. Further, the appellant cast doubt on the passage referred to by the judge in 
 Lim Dee Chew 
 where it was suggested that criminal liability for harbouring sub-tenants could be pinned on a landlord or owner of property where the tenants were illegal immigrants even if the landlord or owner was not aware of the presence of the sub-tenants. For ease of reference, I will set out the passage again: 
 
[W]here the owner rented his premises to an illegal immigrant who in turn rented out rooms in the premises without informing the owner ... it must surely follow that the owner should be held to be the harbourer of all of them. The owner would not be allowed to hide behind his initial illegal act to avoid liability for all the other illegal immigrants, regardless of his lack of knowledge or consent. Only if he had initially rented the premises to a person who was in Singapore legally, would he not be liable under the Act if the lawful tenant in turn rented the premises to illegal immigrants without his knowledge or consent.
 
 
 
The appellants stated that such an approach was unfair as the offences with which the appellant was charged were offences with a clear mens rea element. Mens rea is presumed to be a necessary ingredient of an offence in the absence of clear words to the contrary (see 
PP v Bridges Christopher
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 162
 ). Accordingly, the imposition of criminal liability in the vicarious manner contemplated by 
 Lim Dee Chew 
 was inconsistent with this maxim of criminal law.
It was my view that the judge did consider the facts of this particular case. He concluded that the appellant was guilty of harbouring the five illegal immigrants named in the charges. He rejected the appellant`s defence that he had never seen those five persons before. This defence was rightly rejected as the five illegal immigrants had no difficulty identifying the appellant in an identification parade and in court. Further, they gave a consistent description of the appellant in their evidence. There was also no reason for the five illegal immigrants to give evidence that would be detrimental to the appellant since they had been convicted by the time the appellant`s trial began. As stated earlier, there was no doubt that the actus reus of harbouring had been committed by the appellant.
It was regrettable that the judge did not clearly address the issue of the mens rea of the appellant. He seemed to have assumed that it was sufficient that the appellant did not take any steps to check if the five persons named in the charge were legal entrants. It must be noted that the appellant is presumed to have 
 knowingly 
 harboured the five illegal immigrants named in the charges pursuant to s 57(7) of the Immigration Act which provides: 
 
Where, in any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1)(d), it is proved that the defendant has given shelter to any person who has remained in Singapore unlawfully for a period exceeding 90 days after expiration of any pass issued to him or 
 who has entered Singapore in contravention of s5(1) or 6(1), it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the defendant has harboured him knowing him to be a person who has acted in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the regulations
. [Emphasis mine.]
 
 
 
Accordingly, the judge should have asked himself if the evidence adduced by the appellant was sufficient to rebut the presumption of mens rea in s 57(7).

[1996] 2 SLR 266
  (`
 Koo Pui Fong 
`) provides some guidance as to what constitutes the requisite mens rea in the context of s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act which deals with the offence of employing illegal immigrants. I am of the view that the observations in 
 Koo Pui Fong 
are equally relevant to the offence of harbouring illegal immigrants under s 57(1)(d). It was stated in 
 Koo Pui Fong 
 that: 
 
it is wholly in keeping with common sense and the law to say that an accused knew of certain facts if he deliberately closed his eyes to the circumstances, his wilful blindness being evidence from which knowledge may be inferred.
 
 
 
In my opinion, the presumption of mens rea in s 57(7) cannot be rebutted in this case. The evidence points to the conclusion that the appellant deliberately closed his eyes to circumstances which suggested that the five persons named in the charge were illegal immigrants. First, the appellant knew that the five persons were Bangladeshi nationals. He had seen them on more than one occasion and collected rent from them regularly. Secondly, Baskar Khan, Md Kalum and Miras gave evidence that the premises were occupied by 30 to 35 Bangladeshi nationals during their stay there and that there were about 25 mattresses scattered around the premises. In such circumstances, the appellant must have been suspicious as to the immigration status of these Bangladeshi nationals. Although he had more than one opportunity to check if they had valid passes or permits, the evidence did not indicate that the appellant took any steps to verify if the persons occupying his premises were legal entrants. Accordingly, it was my view that the appellant `
 deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious or refrained from inquiry because he suspected the truth but did not want to have his suspicion confirmed 
` (see 
Westminster City Council v Croyalgrange Ltd
 
[1986] 83 Cr App R 155
 at 164). Accordingly, I was of the view that the appellant had the necessary mens rea for the offence under s 57(1)(d) read with s 57(7) of the Immigration Act.
Nevertheless, the judge went on to find that even 
 if the appellant was ignorant of the presence of the five illegal immigrants at his premises 
 he would not be allowed to hide behind his initial illegal act (in harbouring the illegal tenants, Faruk and Ansar) to avoid liability for all the other illegal immigrant sub-tenants on the basis of 
 Lim Dee Chew 
. It was clear that the judge considered the appellant`s vicarious criminal liability in this regard to be an alternative basis to found a conviction.
I would clarify the theory of vicarious criminal liability that was briefly touched upon in 
 Lim Dee Chew 
. At first glance, the approach does appear to accord with the policy of ensuring that immigrants who enter Singapore illegally do not procure accommodation easily. It also deters property owners and landlords from adopting a lackadaisical attitude towards activities on their premises.
Having reconsidered the matter and with the benefit of detailed written submissions from both parties in this case, I do not think that it is acceptable to find an owner guilty of the crime of harbouring illegal immigrant 
 sub-tenants 
when that owner was 
 completely unaware 
 of their presence. The fact that the owner may have been guilty of harbouring illegal immigrant 
 tenants 
 is a fact that relates to a separate and independent crime altogether. The imposition of criminal liability vicariously in the manner contemplated by the dictum in 
 Lim Dee Chew 
 would unfairly circumvent the mens rea requirement with respect to the illegal sub-tenants. As stated earlier, it is a fundamental tenet of criminal law that the mens rea is presumed to be a necessary ingredient of an offence in the absence of clear words to the contrary. I do recognise that an increasing number of statutory offences of strict liability have been created for the purposes of promoting greater vigilance where an important social issue is involved. This trend is not confined to Singapore but can be discerned throughout the common law world. Nevertheless, the statutory offences set out in the Immigration Act are not expressly stated to be offences of strict liability. The presumptions in s 57 of the Immigration Act that allow the guilt of the accused to be presumed from certain facts simply facilitate the prosecution in establishing the guilt of accused persons. It is open to the accused to rebut these presumptions by adducing evidence of his ignorance or innocence. Accordingly, the mens rea requirement has not been dispensed with in the context of statutory offences under the Immigration Act. As I stated in 
 Koo Pui Fong 
: 
 
[the] mens rea remains an essential component of every offence under s 57(1), but need not be proved in the specific instances set out in ss 57(6) to (8) in which the offender is presumed to have the necessary mens rea.
 
 
 
If the passage in 
 Lim Dee Chew 
 on vicarious criminal liability were to be treated as if it were a legislative provision prescribing a statutory offence, a landlord or owner may be found guilty of harbouring illegal immigrants even though he was totally ignorant of their existence. Such an approach effectively does away with the mens rea requirement. If such a drastic move is thought to be the best way to deal with the situation where an illegal immigrant tenant sub-lets the premises to other illegal immigrants without the knowledge of the landlord or owner, it is my view that Parliamentary intervention is necessary. In the absence of unambiguous legislation to that effect, I do not think that the dictum in 
 Lim Dee Chew 
 should be regarded as providing for the establishment of a criminal offence in a manner not contemplated by the Immigration Act.
 Identification of the appellant 
 
 
 
The appellant submitted that he had been wrongly identified by the five illegal immigrants. He stated that the identification parade that was formed operated unfairly against him. According to the appellant, Investigating Officer Sharon Teo (PW1) did not conduct a proper identification parade. All she did was to ask the five illegal immigrants to identify the owner of the premises by presenting Chua and the appellant before them. The appellant submitted that this casual `face-to-face` approach was not a proper identification parade. Further, there was no evidence to indicate that the appellant and Chua were of the same height, age or general appearance.
On the other hand, the respondent stated that there were no material discrepancies between the identification evidence of the five illegal immigrants and their descriptions of the appellant when they were asked to describe him during cross-examination. Baskar Khan said that `Mr Ong` wore a shirt and pants and a pair of glasses on 5 September 1998 when he came to the premises. Mohd Kalum said that `Mr Ong` was about 58 years old, wore glasses, was taller than himself and was of medium build. He also said that `Mr Ong` wore a white shirt and long pants on 5 September 1998. Zakirul Islam said that `Mr Ong` was an `aged person` of medium build who wore glasses. He also said that `Mr Ong` wore a long sleeved shirt and long pants on 5 September 1998. Miras said that `Mr Ong` wore glasses, a pair of long pants, a shirt and a sweater on 5 September 1998. Finally, Mostaffa said that on the occasions that he saw `Mr Ong`, he wore a long sleeved shirt, a tie, pants and glasses. It is noted that Mostaffa could not recognise the appellant as `Mr Ong` on 6 March 1999 at the police station. The respondent argued that this factor was not significant as he stated in court that he was sure that the person in the dock (the appellant) was `Mr Ong`.
According to the respondent, the fact that a formal identification parade was not carried out to identify the appellant did not vitiate the identification evidence of these prosecution witnesses because there was no reason to doubt or impugn their identification evidence. Their evidence in relation to other issues were consistent. These issues included the number of occupants at the premises, the number of mattresses in the premises and the place where the key to the grille of the flat was kept. Further, all of the five illegal immigrants had been convicted and sentenced for contravening the Immigration Act by the time of the appellant`s trial. They had no reason to concoct a story to the detriment of the appellant. Thus, there was no reason to disbelieve their identification evidence.
Where the reliability of identification evidence is involved, the 
 Turnbull 
 guidelines laid down by Lord Widgery in 
R v Turnbull
 
[1977] QB 224
 and adopted by the Court of Appeal in 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
  are instructive. The guidelines are as follows: 
(a) the first question that a judge should ask is whether the case against the accused depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of the identification evidence; 
(b) if so, the second question should be whether the identification evidence is of good quality, having regard to the circumstances in which the identification by the witness was made; 
(c) where the quality of the identification evidence is poor, the judge should ask if there is any other evidence that supports the correctness of the identification. If there is no other supporting evidence of the identification, the judge should be mindful that a conviction which relies on such poor identification evidence would be unsafe.
I should add that I was uncomfortable with the fact that a proper identification parade was not carried out in this case. In particular, I was disturbed by the fact that the appellant was not lined-up with several other persons of his age-group and race (see 
Chan Sin v PP
 
 
[1949] MLJ 106
 ). I understand that the practice in relation to identification parades is to include at least eight persons, other than the suspect, in the line-up. This was clearly not done in the present case. Having expressed my concerns, I must also add that a breach of the procedural requirements in the conduct of an identification parade does not automatically render the identification evidence inadmissible. Such deficiencies may affect the weight to be attached to the identification evidence. However, if there is evidence of bad faith or a deliberate flouting of procedural requirements, the identification parade will probably not be upheld (see 
Thirumalai Kumar v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 434
 ).
In my opinion, the casual `face-to-face` manner in which the identification of the appellant was carried out was improper. Accordingly, the weight that should be attached to the identification evidence of the five illegal immigrants should be minimal. However, this did not render the conviction of the appellant by the judge unsafe. In my view, the case against the appellant did not rest entirely on the identification evidence. The evidence of the five illegal immigrants in court was that a `Mr Ong` who wore glasses, a shirt and long pants had visited the premises before to collect the rent. They knew him as the landlord of the premises. Their evidence about the premises was consistent in other respects. There were other factors that suggested that `Mr Ong` was the appellant. First, the only other candidate for `Mr Ong` was Chua, who had purchased the premises jointly with the appellant. There was no evidence to suggest that any of the five illegal immigrants had seen Chua or were confused as to the appearances of the two men. Secondly, the name `Mr Ong` had a clear connection with the appellant. The inference seemed to be that the `Mr Ong` described by the five illegal immigrants was the appellant.
For the above reasons, I was of the view that the poor quality of the identification evidence did not render the conviction of the appellant unsafe.
 Due diligence 
 
 
 
The judge took pains to examine the precautionary steps taken by the appellant with respect to Faruk and Ansar. He found that the appellant did not exercise due diligence in this regard, and consequently held that the appellant knew or had reasonable ground to believe that Faruk and Ansar were illegal immigrants. On the basis of the dictum in 
 Lim Dee Chew 
, the appellant could therefore not escape criminal liability for harbouring the five illegal immigrants to whom Faruk and Ansar had sub-let the premises. I have concluded that the dictum in 
 Lim Dee Chew 
 should not be followed. Accordingly, I do not think it is necessary to examine whether the judge was right in his finding that the appellant did not exercise due diligence in relation to Faruk and Ansar.
 Impeachment of the appellant`s credit 
 
 
 
I agreed with the judge that the inconsistencies between the appellant`s testimony in court and the contents of his statement to the police were such that they cast considerable doubt on his reliability as a witness.
Although the inconsistencies might appear insignificant when considered individually, as a whole they suggested that the appellant was trying to paint a different picture of his attitude towards Faruk and Ansar in court. He tried to convey the impression that he was unaware of Faruk`s intention to rent out the premises to other Bangladeshi nationals in court, when his statement to the police indicated that he knew about Faruk`s sub-letting plans. I also shared the judge`s doubts as regards the steps taken by the appellant in checking the particulars of Faruk and Ansar. I was not satisfied that the appellant was being truthful when he claimed to have checked the relevant documents of these two persons.
There was no suggestion that the appellant`s statement to the police was involuntary. Further, the explanations offered by the appellant were highly unsatisfactory. He simply asserted that he was mistaken when he gave the statement to the police. In view of the above, I saw no reason to disturb the judge`s finding that the appellant`s credit had been impeached.
 Alibi witnesses 
 
 
 
In my opinion, the judge was correct in rejecting the appellant`s alibi defence. It must be stated that appellate intervention is warranted in limited circumstances, given the numerous findings of fact made by the judge in relation to the alibi witnesses. In any case, I saw no reason to depart from the judge`s conclusion. I agreed with his decision that the appellant`s presence on 5 September 1998 was not a crucial fact since the five illegal immigrants all claimed to have seen him on other occasions (ie when they were first brought to the flat). In any event, it was not impossible that the appellant may have visited the premises after the alleged birthday party. Accordingly, the judge`s finding should be upheld.
 Adverse inference 
 
 
 
I do not propose to deal with this ground in detail. Suffice it to say that I agreed with the judge that it was not proper to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution for not calling Ansar. Ansar was unavailable as a witness as he had been repatriated to Bangladesh. There was nothing to suggest that the prosecution had an ulterior motive for witholding the evidence of Ansar.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In view of the reasons given above, it was my view that the appeal against the conviction should be dismissed.

(delivering the grounds of decision of the court): This was an appeal against the decision of GP Selvam J dismissing the appellants` claims against the respondents in both tort and contract. The proceedings in the court below disclosed numerous disputes of fact between the parties. In similar vein, a large part of this appeal was again centred on such disputes and what the appellants in effect sought to do was to urge this court to overturn the factual findings of the learned trial judge. At the end of the hearing, we found that there was absolutely no basis for such a course and dismissed the appeal accordingly. We now give our reasons.
 Background facts 
 
 
 
The appellants were a company called Tribune Investment Trust Inc. They were one of many shell companies in the Greek corporation, George Moundreas & Company SA (`GMCO`), a leading shipbrokering firm in Greece. GMCO was effectively controlled by one George Moundreas (`GM`).
The respondents were Soosan Trading Co Ltd, a company incorporated in Korea. They are part of the Soosan Group of companies which includes Soosan Heavy Metal Industries (`SHI`), and Soosan Shipbuilding (`SS`). SS is a Chinese subsidiary of SHI which was established for the purpose of facilitating SHI`s entry into the ship repair business in China.
Around December 1995, SS decided to purchase a floating dock for its ship repair business in China. It did not however have the necessary technical or other expertise to source for the dock by itself. The respondents on the other hand, had a licence (which was required under Korean law) to engage in negotiations and to purchase equipment from foreigners. As such, it was decided that the respondents would look for and purchase a suitable dock and thereafter on-sell it to SS.
The respondents approached various ship brokers to assist them in searching for an appropriate dock. One of those approached was a certain W J Park of Dasan Corporation, a Korean shipbrokering company. Another shipbrokering company which they contacted was FEMAS.
Sometime in September 1996, the respondents became aware through one or more of its brokers, including Dasan, of a certain floating dock PD 177 owned by Dalzavod, a Russian company, which appeared to meet their requirements. Thereafter, numerous correspondence by fax and by telex, were exchanged between WJ Park and GM concerning the possible sale of PD 177. According to GM, Dalzavod had approached GMCO to buy or to find a buyer for PD 177 in August 1996. The appellants` intention, he claimed, was to purchase PD 177 from Dalzavod directly and thereafter to resell it to a sub-buyer for a profit. Dasan`s name was suggested to GM as a potential buyer of the dock whereupon GM contacted W J Park and allegedly told the latter of the intended arrangement.
On 20 September, an in-principle agreement was signed between Dalzavod and the appellants for the sale and purchase of PD 177 at USD$6.5m. GM signed on behalf of the appellants. This was a bare agreement which contemplated the drawing-up of a more formal and detailed document at a later stage. This latter document was eventually drawn up in the form of a Memorandum of Agreement (`the first MOA`), which was signed by Dalzavod and the appellants on 30 September 1996. Clause 4 of the first MOA stipulated that the contract would become null and void if notice of acceptance of the dock`s classification records and the dock was not received by Dalzavod within ten working days from the date of afloat inspection of the dock by the appellants. No afloat inspection of the dock or its records was ever conducted after the date of the first MOA. Nevertheless, notice of acceptance, albeit an apparently qualified one, was given by the appellants on 9 October 1996.
None of the events described in the preceding paragraph however were ever conveyed to Dasan or to the respondents in writing, whether via fax or telex. The following are pertinent verbatim excerpts of part of the series of written correspondence exchanged between GM (on behalf of GMCO) and W J Park (on behalf of Dasan) concerning the sale and purchase of PD 177 set out in chronological order: 
 
19 September 1996 - Telex from Dasan to GMCO
 
 
 
But they (Soosan) want to know clearly this dock can be sold without problem with Singapolian hire, which he heard this dock is now engaged in hire and may be extended for another two years.
 
 
 
If it is true it will be difficult for `Soosan` to take this dock even though contract signed between Russian owner/broker and `Soosan`.
 
 
 
23 September 1996 - Fax from GMCO to Dasan
 
 
 
... We are now in a position to fix the sale with your good clients Messrs Soosan at a price of USD 10/12 mill ... the Russians instructing the master of the dock to assist our/Soosan`s inspectors with their task.
 
 
 
27 September 1996 - Telex from GMCO to Dasan
 
 
 
As regards negotiation and price, please note that USD 10 mill should go eventually to the Russian side (in a rather complicated way). On top of USD 10 mill we must add our commission USD 500,000, your commission and address commission to Soosan.
 
 
 
1 October 1996 - Telex from Dasan to GMCO
 
 
 
... Soosan want you to cut down the price from Russian owner.
 
 
 
7 October 1996 - Telex from Dasan to GMCO
 
 
 
I sincerely request you to do your best to reduce the price from Russian owner
 
 
 
8 October 1996 - Fax from GMCO to Dasan
 
 
 
... After extremely hard efforts and strong persuasion we have obtained sellers` reconfirmation. Therefore the deal is now final and definite. We are now preparing sales contract, ie memorandum of agreement nsf 87...
 
 
 
9 October 1996 - Telex from Dasan to GMCO
 
 
 
Congratulation for getting agreement from Russian seller with USD 9.4 mil as contract amount... date of MOA will be discussed when I meet the president of Soosan ... I will reply further development to you after meeting with the president of Soosan ...
 
 
 
9 October 1996 - Telex from Dasan to GMCO
 
 
 
Soosan want to sign the contract with russian owner directly. If above not possible, Soosan can sign with GMCO in Singapore or Vladivostok together with Russian owner who also sign as witness. If above ... not possible, Soosan can sign the contract with GMCO having power of authority given by Russian owner or equivalent contract signed between GMCO and Russian owner
 
 
 
The respondents for their part contended that they had all along proceeded on the basis that they would only contract with the original, existing owners of the floating dock, ie Dalzavod. They were adamant about not wanting to go through agents or brokers for the sellers because of a prior bad experience with another broker called Meyersale, who had acted for another Russian seller, Severny in respect of the sale of a different dock some time back. According to the respondents, the arrangement then was for Meyersale to purchase the dock from Severny and thereafter to sub-sell it to the respondents. It turned out that the sale to Meyersale did not go through and Severny eventually sold the dock to a Chinese buyer instead. As such, the respondents lost the chance of buying that dock and also became weary of sub-sale arrangements conducted through brokers. Hence, the respondents intended at all times to contract with Dalzavod directly. To them, GM was merely a conduit or channel of communication between the respondents and/or Dasan on the one hand and Dalzavod on the other. Their intention was to contract with Dalzavod only, not GM, GMCO, and certainly not the appellants of whom they had had absolutely no knowledge and whose name was never mentioned in any of the written correspondence between Dasan and GM. In fact, the appellants` name surfaced for the very first time only when the draft copy of the intended Memorandum of Agreement (`the second MOA`) between the appellants and the respondents was faxed by GM to Dasan on 9 October 1996, wherein the seller was described as `Tribune Investment Trust Inc.`, ie the appellants. It appeared that this was the first time in which the respondents were suddenly made aware that they might not be purchasing the dock from Dalzavod directly but that some third party, namely, the appellants, were also involved.
Subsequently, FEMAS, the other shipbroker commissioned by the respondents, arranged for Dalzavod to meet the respondents at the latter`s office in Korea. One Lawrence Goh of Lita Shipping, the then charterer of PD 177, also flew to Seoul for the meeting. The minutes of the meeting held on 16 October 1996 recorded that Dalzavod`s representative informed the respondents that their MOA with the appellants dated 30 September 1996 (ie the first MOA) had become null and void as a result of certain `non-fulfilment` by the appellants.
On 18 October 1996, it was agreed that the respondents would purchase PD 177 from Dalzavod for USD$10.8m, out of which USD$2.8m would be paid to Lita Shipping for the purpose of discharging their existing charterparty.
The appellants subsequently commenced Suit 2178/96 in the High Court against Dalzavod for breach of the first MOA, and for inducing a breach of the purported contract made between the appellants and the respondents for the sale and purchase of PD 177. The matter was fixed for hearing before Justice MPH Rubin but a trial never took place as the appellants and Dalzavod managed to reach a settlement. Consent judgment in the amount of USD$1,674,934.54 was entered in favour of the appellants.
At or around the same time, the appellants also commenced Suit 2400/96 against the respondents, advancing the following three main causes of action: 
(i) in tort, for inducing a breach of the first MOA; 
(ii) in tort, for conspiring with Dalzavod to injure the appellants; and 
(iii) in contract, for a breach of the purported contract for the sale and purchase of PD 177 between the appellants and the respondents respectively.
GP Selvam J who heard this latter action dismissed all of the appellants` claims. It was against that decision that the appellants appealed to this court.
 The claim in tort for inducing a breach of contract 
 
 
 
Before moving on to consider the law in this area, we should mention that it appeared that the appellants had in the court below, attempted to advance an alternative claim in tort for the unlawful interference by the respondents of the first MOA. This action for `unlawful interference` is different in substance from and should not be confused with a claim for inducement of a breach of contract. The elements required to satisfy both causes of action are separate and distinct. In other words, they are two substantively different torts and should be treated as such. In this appeal, it again appeared that the appellants had conflated both the issues for inducement of a breach of contract and unlawful interference. It seemed to us that their main line of argument was in the claim for inducement although in discussing that claim, they had quite unwittingly imported a host of arguments and cases relating to the tort of unlawful interference. This, we found, was both misleading and confusing and should not have occurred. For the purposes of this judgment, we propose to deal only with the claim for inducing a breach of contract.
The law relating to most of the economic torts is clear. To knowingly procure or induce a third party to break his contract to the damage of the other contracting party without reasonable justification or excuse forms the basis of the tort of inducing a breach of contract.
An act of inducement per se is not by itself actionable. The plaintiff must satisfy a two-fold requirement in order to found a sustainable cause of action: First, he must show that the procurer acted with the requisite knowledge of the existence of the contract (although knowledge of the precise terms is not necessary); and second, that the procurer intended to interfere with its performance. Intention in this case is to be determined objectively. It is not sufficient that the resulting breach of contract was a mere natural consequence of the defendant`s conduct. In addition, the contract in question must also be shown to be a valid one: it must not be illegal or in restraint of trade, nor must be it capable of being rescinded, although it has been held that the tort is applicable to contracts of all kinds: see 
 Clerk & Lindsell on Torts 
 (1995, 17th Ed), at pp 1177-1183.
The relevant mental state is thus that of intention: the defendant must intend to interfere with the plaintiff`s contractual rights, in the sense of doing so knowingly. Malice or spite in the form of a personal animus against the defendants or an illegitimate motive however is not required. It is sufficient if the defendant knows of the existence of the contract or turns a blind eye to its existence or is reckless as to the consequence of his actions in the sense of being indifferent whether or not a breach happens: see eg 
Emerald Construction Co Ltd v Lowthian
 
[1966] 1 All ER 1013
[1966] 1 WLR 691
; 
JT Stratford & Son v Lindley
 
[1965] AC 269
 and 
Thomson v Deakin
 
[1952] Ch 646
. It is not necessary that the defendant should have been aiming to hurt or injure the plaintiff although some deliberate conduct on the defendant`s part is normally required to ground liability. Mere negligent invasions of contractual rights however are not actionable. The normal form of the tort involves direct persuasion being brought to bear on the contract-breaker, but it is possible to commit it where A and B enter into a contract which, to A`s knowledge, is incompatible with B`s contract with C: see eg 
British Motor Trade Association v Salvadori
 
[1949] Ch 556
[1949] 1 All ER 208
.
 Was there a valid contract between the appellants and Dalzavod in this case?
In order to sustain an action for inducement, the first thing that needs to be proved is thus whether or not there was even a valid contract between the appellants and Dalzavod which was capable of being breached. GP Selvam J in the court below appeared not to have made a specific finding in this respect. The learned judge`s discourse on the appellants` claim in tort is contained in but a brief, single paragraph, in which he appeared to have merely assumed, without deciding, the existence of a valid contract between Dalzavod and the appellants. Senior counsel for the respondents on the other hand disputed that finding by pointing to the minutes of the meeting in Seoul on 16 October 1996 which recorded that Dalzavod had confirmed that the first MOA was null and void. Interestingly, despite the learned trial judge`s finding in their favour in this regard, the appellants had, in their skeletal submissions before the court, raised all sorts of, pre-emptive arguments relating to the validity and/or enforceability of the first MOA. These arguments include the applicable law of the MOA, the authority of Dalzavod`s representative to enter into the MOA, the notice of acceptance requirement in clause 4 of the MOA as well as the appellants` obligation to open a letter of credit in favour of Dalzavod pursuant to the terms of the MOA. Obviously the intention here was to show that the first MOA created a valid and binding contract between Dalzavod and the appellants in which Dalzavod agreed to sell and the appellants agreed to buy PD 177 at a price of USD$6.5m. In presenting these arguments, the appellants had to a large extent relied on documents and affidavits which were filed in a completely separate action, namely Suit 2178 of 1996. It will be recalled that this action, between the appellants and Dalzavod, never proceeded to trial as the parties reached a settlement after private negotiation through their lawyers.
It was our opinion that the appellants` arguments on the validity and enforceability of the first MOA did not merit any consideration whatsoever for the simple reason that none of them were canvassed at the trial below and were in fact only being raised for the first time on appeal. It appeared that only passing references were made to the alleged contract formed between Dalzavod and the appellants in the trial below. No mention whatsoever was made of the authority of Dalzavod`s representative to enter into the contract, or of the notice of acceptance requirement or of the obligation to open a letter of credit. From this, it appeared to us that the approach taken at the trial stage of the proceedings was to pursue primarily the claim in contract. The claim in tort on the other hand was put in purely as a fall-back or alternative cause of action, and as it turned out, never really fully-developed by the appellants in argument in the court below. As a result, we did not think it was open to them to raise these new arguments in respect of the tort claim on appeal, especially when many of these arguments necessitated findings of fact by the court, a task which an appellate court is not well-placed to carry out. We also could not ignore the fact that a large part of the appellant`s arguments in this respect relied for their basis on affidavits and other documents filed in Suit 2178/96. These affidavits and other documents were not admitted at the trial below, and any attempt by the appellants to rely on these documents now amounted to an attempt to adduce fresh evidence on appeal, a course which was not open to the appellants to adopt without first obtaining the prior leave of the court which clearly they had not done. In our view, it is trite law that evidence adduced in a separate suit, unless specifically admitted, is not automatically admissible or relevant in a suit involving different parties. Similarly, it is a general rule of evidence that save for matters of a public nature, no one should be affected by a judgment to which he was not a party or privy.
What the appellants were in effect attempting to do in this case was to urge the Court of Appeal to make findings of fact in respect of a completely different suit involving different parties. More specifically, the appellants were seeking the court`s ruling on many of the substantive issues raised in Suit 2178. In our view, this is not the function of the High Court nor that of the Court of Appeal, for the action before us concerned only the appellants and the respondents. Dalzavod was not and never was a party to this action nor was it ever called to give evidence in this action. As such, it was not open to GP Selvam J, and a fortiori, to the Court of Appeal, to comment on the substantive merits of the appellants` case against Dalzavod in Suit 2178, especially when that action never proceeded to trial because of a settlement by the parties. The appellants further attempted to use the consent judgment entered in their favour in Suit 2178 as justification of the merits of their case against Dalzavod, and consequently, as being conclusive proof of the existence of a valid contract between Dalzavod and themselves. We found this manoeuvre to be completely untenable. It will be recalled that the consent judgment in Suit 2178 was one entered into without a determination by the court of the merits of each party`s case. The matter never went to trial, and as such, no court was given the opportunity to adjudicate or rule on the substantive merits of both the appellants` claim and Dalzavod`s defence. Whatever settlement was privately negotiated between the parties and their lawyers could have no binding whatsoever on a third party like the respondents who were neither privy to that arrangement nor a party to that action. It is trite law that a judgment inter partes, though binding between them, does not and cannot affect the rights of third parties. Further, a judgment is also not evidence of any fact which was neither directly decided nor a necessary ground of the decision. As such, given that the judgment entered in Suit 2178 was a consent judgment, the appellants` postulations of the reasons why Dalzavod agreed to settle that action in the appellants` favour were pure baseless speculations which did not merit any consideration.
Having dismissed the new arguments raised by the appellants before us, we were left only with the evidence which was in fact properly adduced before the court below to determine if the appellants had proven the existence of a valid contract between themselves and Dalzavod on a balance of probability. Looking at all the objective evidence admitted before the trial judge, we were of the view that they had not. It is important to remember that the appellants were the plaintiffs in this case. As such, the burden was on them to establish every element of their claim to the requisite standard of proof. The only evidence adduced in the court below of a valid contract between the appellants and Dalzavod was the first MOA dated 30 September 1996 and the appellants` apparent acceptance of it via a fax transmission. No evidence however was led regarding the authority of the signatories to the first MOA to bind their respective principals. Neither was any documentary evidence adduced to show if or when Dalzavod received the notice of acceptance from the appellants. In addition, no witness from Dalzavod was called to testify as to the existence of a contract between them and the appellants. On the contrary, the minutes of the 16 October 1996 meeting in Seoul seemed to indicate that so far as Dalzavod was concerned, they had taken the view that any purported contract between themselves and the appellants was null and void. A look at the purported notice of acceptance also revealed that it was not unconditional. As such, there was the question of whether the notice, even if received, constituted good or valid notice under cl 4 of the MOA. In light of the foregoing doubts, we found that the appellants had not satisfied the burden of proving the existence of a valid contract between Dalzavod and themselves which was capable of being breached.
The appellants further made the argument that counsel for the respondents failed to cross-examine GM at the trial on his evidence relating to the appellants` claim against Dalzavod. In our view, accepting this argument would mean placing too onerous a burden on the respondents as the appellants themselves did not fully develop their argument on the tort claim at the trial below. The gist of their case was grounded mainly in contract (ie breach of the contract between the appellants and the respondents). GM`s own affidavit made only cursory or incidental references to a possible claim in tort. In the premises, it is unreasonable to expect the respondents to lead evidence from the appellants` witness in order to prove the latter`s case in tort for them. The burden is at all times on the plaintiffs, in this case the appellants, to prove their cause of action on a balance of probability, a burden which we found not to have been discharged in the present case.
In the result, we found that the appellants had not proven the existence of a valid and binding contract between themselves and Dalzavod which was capable of being breached by the latter, at the respondents` instigation. On this ground alone, the claim in tort for inducement of a breach of contract could not be sustained.
Nevertheless, we propose to go on to consider what the position would be had a valid contract been found to exist between Dalzavod and the appellants. In this connection, the next question to be asked is whether or not the respondents had, at the material time, knowledge of this contract.
 Did the respondents have knowledge of the contract between the appellants and Dalzavod?
In our view, questions relating to the actual state of mind of a person are essentially questions of fact. The law relating to the treatment of findings of fact by an appellate court is clear and beyond doubt. For the sake of brevity, it suffices to say that an appellate court, not having heard the evidence first-hand, and not having had the opportunity of observing the witnesses on the stand, should be slow to overturn findings of fact made by the trial judge. Such a course should only be taken in cases where the findings reached were clearly beyond the weight of the objective evidence before the court or were plainly wrong.
Turning to the facts of the present case, the trial judge found that there was no evidence whatsoever to show that the respondents were aware or had knowledge of any contract between the appellants and Dalzavod. In arriving at this view, the learned trial judge must have accepted the evidence of the respondents` witness, one Mr SK Hyun. Mr Hyun, a Team Leader in SHI at the relevant time, had stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that at the meeting between Dalzavod and the respondents in Seoul on 16 October 1996, the respondents` representatives, including himself, had specifically questioned Dalzavod`s representatives as to the apparent contract between Dalzavod and the appellants concerning the sale of PD 177. The answers given by Dalzavod at this meeting were threefold: namely, that Dalzavod was still the legal owner of PD 177, that the MOA entered into between Dalzavod and the appellants and dated 30 September 1996 had been cancelled, and that Dalzavod and Lita (the charterers) were the only parties entitled to make any decisions concerning the sale of the dock. All this was amply corroborated by the minutes of that meeting which recorded categorically that Dalzavod `explained and clarified` that the first MOA was null and void due to `non-fulfilment by the Buyer` and that Dalzavod was absolutely free to `develop this deal` with the respondents. The appellants themselves impliedly admitted to this when GM, in his affidavit, averred that Dalzavod did not mention to the respondents about the first MOA because they (Dalzavod) were intent on disregarding their obligations to the appellants. Certainly the respondents cannot be faulted if Dalzavod was bent on refusing to paint a true picture of their contractual relationship with the appellants. Moreover, if there was ever any doubt about what had transpired at the meeting in Seoul, the appellants could have cross-examined Lawrence Goh of Lita, a perfectly independent witness, on it as the latter was present at that meeting throughout. This however, they failed to do, and in consequence, must now be taken to have accepted that Dalzavod did in fact assure the respondents that they did not have a valid contract with the appellants.
The appellants also sought to place huge emphasis on the fact that S K Hyun might have seen the first MOA sometime between 10 and 12 October 1996, that is, at a time before the meeting between Dalzavod and the respondents. To this end, they relied on a fax sent by GMCO to Dasan dated 10 October 1996 enclosing a copy of the first MOA, and a corresponding reply from Dasan to GMCO of even date stating that Hyun `noticed and agreed that [GMCO] have contracted with russian owner formally`. As a result of this exchange of correspondence which the appellants contended the trial judge overlooked, they submitted that the respondents must have known that there was a valid contract between Dalzavod and the appellants. In our view, this argument misses the point altogether. The fact that Hyun had sight of the MOA is insufficient to impute knowledge of the contract between Dalzavod and the appellants to the respondents for two reasons: firstly, the first MOA on its own does not evidence a concluded contract between Dalzavod and the appellants as notice of acceptance by the appellants is further contemplated. In this respect, there was no evidence to show that S K Hyun was ever informed by the appellants that the requisite notice of acceptance had been given to Dalzavod. Secondly, it was precisely because the respondents had sight of the first MOA that they made the effort to check and clarify with Dalzavod during the meeting in Seoul regarding the true status of that MOA. It was perfectly reasonable for the respondents to rely on Dalzavod`s representation and assurance at the meeting that the first MOA had been cancelled. There was no reason for the respondents to doubt Dalzavod as Dalzavod was known to the respondents to be the original Russian owners of PD 177. Moreover, Dalzavod had also taken the trouble to fly all the way from Moscow to Seoul to discuss the sale of the dock and had even brought along a representative from Lita to facilitate the negotiations. The meeting which took place was neither a clandestine nor secret affair arranged between Dalzavod and the respondents to the exclusion of the appellants. SK Hyun gave evidence that he twice invited the appellants, via Dasan, to attend the meeting in Seoul so as to clarify the position altogether, but the appellants did not show up. This evidence was not challenged by the appellants in cross-examination. Counsel for the appellants sought to explain before us that such an invitation could not have been extended to GM as it would have been embarrassing for him, the purported middle-buyer who stood to make a huge profit from the transactions, to attend a meeting between the end-supplier and the end-buyer of the dock. In our view, this argument simply could not stand. Whether or not GM might be embarrassed would have been of no concern to either Dalzavod or the respondents. In fact, it might have been precisely because both Dalzavod or the respondents had started to suspect that something was amiss that they decided to call all three parties together to clear matters up. That GM himself might have felt embarrassed about attending the meeting in Seoul did not mean that Dalzavod or the respondents could not have invited him to attend it. It was further unreasonable to expect, and perhaps even impossible for, the respondents to have liased with the appellants directly when they had had no prior information about the latter at all! It will be recalled that all the correspondence emanating from Dasan relating to the purchase of PD 177 had been with GM on behalf of GMCO. The appellants` name only appeared for the first time when the first MOA was sent to Dasan on 10 October 1996. As such, when GM failed to turn up for the meeting, the respondents had every reason to believe Dalzavod when the latter told them that the appellants, a hitherto non-existent participant in this whole episode and who must have been a complete stranger to the respondents, had not fulfilled their obligations to Dalzavod. In our view, it was further reasonable for the respondents to trust the assurance given to them by Dalzavod, the original owners of the dock, rather than the word of any of their brokers particularly after their bad experience with Meyersale in respect of the earlier, aborted sale of the previous dock.
Taking all of the above considerations into account, we found that there was nothing to impugn the trial judge`s finding that the respondents had no knowledge of the contract between the appellants and Dalzavod. It must be remembered that this was not a case in which the respondents did not know of the exact terms of the contract, which if so, would not be a valid defence to the tort of procuring a breach of contract. The fact of the matter here was that the respondents did not even know of the 
 existence 
 of the entire contract to begin with. At the same time, the lack of knowledge in this case also did not amount to an indifference on their part as to whether or not a breach might be caused. The fact was that it was perfectly reasonable for the respondents not to have applied their minds to the issue at all when they had heard from the proverbial horse`s own mouth that there was no contract to begin with.
 Did the respondents intentionally induce a breach of the contract between Dalzavod and the appellants?
Again, it will be recalled that questions of intention are primarily questions of fact for the trial judge as a result of which the usual rules relating to their treatment on appeal apply with full force. In this regard, the learned trial judge has found that no such intention had been proven by the appellants. With respect, we found that this conclusion must be right. First, the evidence showed that it was Dalzavod who had solicited the respondents and not the other way round. This was in fact admitted to by the appellants themselves. GM, in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, averred that Dalzavod had solicited an invitation to attend discussions in Seoul. The appellants for their part relied on the fax dated 7 October 1996 from FEMAS to Dalzavod suggesting a meeting between the respondents and Dalzavod to discuss the possible purchase of the dock. This, they contended was clear evidence that it was the respondents who had solicited Dalzavod and who had induced Dalzavod to breach their contract with the appellants. In our view, this contention placed undue emphasis on one single piece of correspondence and ignored the larger context in which the correspondence was made. The respondents gave evidence, which was amply supported by documentary proof as well as independent evidence from Lawrence Goh, that FEMAS had written to Dalzavod about the respondents` interest in PD 177 from as early as June 1996. The fax of 7 October 1996 was thus merely a follow-up to their earlier contacts relating to the sale and purchase of PD 177. It was not something which arose out-of-the-blue or unexpectedly. In any case, by the appellants` own evidence, the respondents only had sight of the first MOA at the earliest, on 10 October 1996. The FEMAS` fax was sent on 7 October 1996. Hence, on that date, the respondents could not possibly have had any inkling of the existence of any apparent contract between Dalzavod and the appellants, in which event they could not also possibly have written to Dalzavod with the intention of inducing them to breach their contract with the appellants.
Scrutiny of the subsequent conduct of the parties also revealed that it was Dalzavod who participated more actively in the negotiations with the respondents which eventually culminated in the signing of the MOA between them on 18 October 1996. First, Dalzavod wrote to FEMAS requesting that the respondents send an invitation to them as well as to Lita. Next, it was Dalzavod who took the trouble and expense to fly all the way to Seoul to meet the respondents. They even bothered to bring Lawrence Goh of Lita along for this purpose, a move which clearly exemplified that they, of their own volition, were bent on securing a deal with the respondents. The respondents did not in any way apply any pressure or force on Dalzavod. Neither was any inducement held out as the price for the dock was never once discussed prior to the meeting between the parties in Seoul. If Dalzavod chose to ignore their contractual obligations to the appellants because of motivations of price, the respondents should not be faulted for that.
In the light of the foregoing, we found that the appellants had not proven both the elements of knowledge and intention on the part of the respondents. The case of 
 Emerald Construction Co Ltd v Lowthian 
 (supra), relied on by the appellants can easily be distinguished from the present. In that case, officials of a trade union called upon building contractors to end their system of `labour-only` sub-contracts whereby the plaintiffs supplied workers to them. Various industrial action tactics were used to pressurise the building contractors into terminating their sub-contracts with the plaintiff company. The trade union officials knew of the existence of the sub-contracts but did not know what its precise terms were until after the action had started. One of those terms gave the contractors the option to cancel if the plaintiffs did not maintain reasonable progress. The plaintiffs` claim for an interlocutory injunction succeeded against the trade union. It was held by the English Court of Appeal in that case that the trade union officials had deliberately sought to get the sub-contracts terminated, regardless of whether or not such termination would result in a breach. At least three points of distinction can be drawn between that case and the one before us. First, the proceedings in the 
 Emerald Construction 
 case concerned an application for an interlocutory injunction. As such, all that the plaintiff needed to show was an arguable case or a serious issue to be tried. Second, it was never disputed by the trade union in that case that they had known all along of the existence of the sub-contracts. In fact, it was precisely because they knew of these labour-only contracts that they wanted them terminated. Finally, the evidence of an intention to procure the termination of the sub-contracts was both obvious and compelling in that case. The trade union had written two letters of ultimatum to the main contractors setting out a clear and unequivocal demand that the sub-contracts be terminated almost immediately, failing which a strike by the workers would occur. As it turned out, the ultimatums were not complied with and the workers did eventually go on strike, at the instigation of their union. In these circumstances, the inference was irresistible that the trade union`s clear objective was to procure the discharge of the sub-contracts. It would seem that the union itself did not really dispute this. In fact, their primary argument in resisting the application for the injunction was merely that they had assumed, mistakenly as it turned out, that the sub-contracts could be lawfully terminated at short notice. Unlike the facts of the case before us, the union officials in 
 Emerald Construction 
 had the means of finding out the actual terms of the sub-contract but did not bother to do so before calling on its workers to go on strike. Even when those terms were eventually brought to their attention, the union officials persisted in doing nothing to end the strike, evincing a clear intention on their part to bring the sub-contract to an end, by whatever means possible. On our facts on the other hand, the respondents had, by checking with Dalzavod directly and by inviting GM to come up to Seoul clear things up, done all that was within their power to ensure that there was no valid subsisting contract between the appellants and Dalzavod. With scarce knowledge of who the appellants were, the respondents in this case did not have the means to check or to clarify with them what the true position was. In the premises, there was absolutely nothing to show that the respondents had knowledge of any contract nor possessed the requisite intention to induce a breach of it.
Finally, it is proposed to say a word or two on policy. It must be remembered that the respondents were not fiduciaries of the appellants. As such, there was no duty on their part to act in the utmost interest of the appellants to their own detriment. The events which took place in this case were all part of the normal course of everyday commercial transactions conducted between large business enterprises at arm`s length. The law does not and should not impose a duty of due diligence on businessmen who conduct large-scale buying-and-selling transactions on a daily basis. While the economic torts exist to protect persons in relation to their trade, business and livelihood, as well as proscribe the infringement of valid and subsisting legal rights, this must be balanced against the need to promote free competition in a free market economy which, without doubt, is instrumental to the success of every capitalist nation. The courts must be slow to make strict laws which could potentially stifle common and ordinary trade practices. Viewed in this light, it will be seen that the respondents in this case did nothing to warrant the imposition of tortious liability on them. They were genuine prospective buyers of a floating dock, had a legitimate purpose for wanting one, and had been pursuing their object from as early as ten months before they finally concluded the deal with Dalzavod. There was nothing sinister or surreptitious in their actions, and what they finally obtained was in effect the result of their own legitimate efforts. From the facts as found by the trial judge, there was absolutely nothing to support the appellants` allegation that the respondents had `hijacked` the contract for the sale of PD 177 from them. In fact, if it had really been the case that the appellants had a valid contract for the sale of an unencumbered PD 177 to the respondents at US$9.4m, then it is unfathomable why the respondents would have forked out an additional US$1.4m for the exact self-same dock when no further advantage or benefit would accrue to them from doing so (given that the respondents eventually paid US$10.8m for the dock). A fortiori, if all that they had was only a mere suspicion that the appellants might also be negotiating to buy the dock from Dalzavod, then in a laissez-faire commercial environment, surely there is nothing to stand in their way of making a better offer to the sellers and securing the contract for themselves. While a defendant who shuts his eyes to the obvious will not be protected, the court will not and should not on the other hand `bedevil the tort` of inducement with equitable doctrines of constructive notice and the like: see Browne-Wilkinson J in 
Swiss Bank Corp v Lloyds Bank Ltd
 
[1979] Ch 548
 at p 572.
For the foregoing reasons, we found that the appellants` claim for inducement of a breach of contract could not be upheld.
 The claim in tort for conspiracy to injure 
 
 
 
Moving on to the allegation that the respondents had conspired with Dalzavod to injure the appellants, we also found, for much of the same reasons alluded to above, that the appeal on this head of claim was without merit and dismissed it accordingly.
The tort of conspiracy comprises conspiracy by unlawful means and conspiracy by lawful means. Again, the appellants were not entirely clear as to exactly which of the two they were proceeding under. The cases cited in their bundle of authorities related to both forms of the tort. It would seem however that their main argument before us was premised on the tort of conspiracy to injure by lawful means. As such, we propose to consider only this form of the tort.
As before, the law in this area is both clear and beyond doubt. A conspiracy by lawful means is constituted when two or more persons combine together with the aim of injuring the plaintiff, resulting in damage. The crucial requirement is that the plaintiff must prove a `predominant purpose` by the conspirators to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff: see eg 
Quah Kay Tee v Ong & Co Pte Ltd
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 390
 .
Applying the above principles to the case at hand, it will be seen that any conspiracy between the respondents and Dalzavod to injure the appellants could only be founded if it was first shown that the respondents knew of a valid and existing contract between Dalzavod and the appellants. Without knowledge of this contract, it becomes completely absurd to suggest that the respondents conspired with Dalzavod to harm the appellants. In this regard, the findings and views made in the earlier section of this judgment on the claim for procurement of a breach of contract apply with equal weight and we will not repeat them here. Suffice it to say that the appellants had not adduced sufficient evidence to show, firstly, that there was even a contract between the appellants and Dalzavod, and secondly, that the respondents had knowledge of this contract. As such, it was impossible to show any predominant purpose on Dalzavod and the respondents` part to cause injury or damage to the appellants. Even if the above had been proven, we are of the view that the respondents would have been entitled to rely on the defence of justification to avoid liability anyway on the ground that their purpose in contracting with Dalzavod was to legitimately further their own self-interest. They had had a bad experience arising from the Meyersale incident, and now wished to contract with the original sellers directly instead of having to go through an intermediate sale to a middleman. For this peace of mind, they were willing to pay a premium, which also afforded them the added assurance that the Lita charterparty would be taken care of and the dock be delivered free from encumbrance as quickly as possible. This was important to the respondents as it was pertinent that SS`s business in China could commence without further delay. In our view, all this was done purely for the sake of enabling the respondents to pursue their own private commercial interests, which they were fully entitled to do. There was neither a motive nor reason for the respondents to want to injure the appellants when the appellants were, at that time, virtual strangers to them, bearing in mind that the name `Tribune Investment` had appeared from out of the blue on the copy of the second MOA that was enclosed to the respondents on 10 October 1996. If anything, such an occurrence would indeed have given the respondents much cause for concern, suspicion and doubt, especially after their bad experience with Meyersale, and would all the more have inclined them towards wanting to contract with Dalzavod directly. We thus found the claim in conspiracy to be completely without merit and dismissed it accordingly.
 The claim in contract 
 
 
 
The central issue in this claim was whether or not a valid contract for the sale and purchase of PD 177 was ever reached between the appellants and the respondents in the first place. There was no doubt that no formal written agreement was ever entered into or signed by the parties at any time. The existence of any contract must thus be culled from the written correspondence and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time.
The principles of law relating to the formation of contracts are clear. Indeed the task of inferring an assent and of extracting the precise moment, if at all there was one, at which a meeting of the minds between the parties may be said to have been reached is one of obvious difficulty, particularly in a case where there has been protracted negotiations and a considerable exchange of written correspondence between the parties. Nevertheless, the function of the court is to try as far as practical experience allows, to ensure that the reasonable expectations of honest men are not disappointed. To this end, it is also trite law that the test of agreement or of inferring consensus ad idem is objective. Thus, the language used by one party, whatever his real intention may be, is to be construed in the sense in which it would reasonably be understood by the other.
In a recent local decision, 
SAL Industrial Leasing Ltd v Teck Koon (Motor) Trading (a firm)
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 325
 , this court held to the same effect that the question whether or not there was an intention by the parties to enter into a legally binding contract is an objective one. The following passage from 
R v Lord Chancellor`s Department, ex p Nangle
 
[1991] ICR 743
 at p 751 was quoted with approval: 
 
... [T]he question whether there is an intention to create legal relations is to be ascertained objectively, and where the terms of the relationship are, as here, to be derived solely from the documents, depends upon the construction of those documents. It is possible for a party to believe mistakenly that he is contractually bound to another when in fact he is not, and conversely to believe that he is not when he is. His belief is immaterial. While this remains a subjective belief uncommunicated to the other party, this is plainly correct. But where such a belief is expressed in the documents it must be a question of construction of the documents as a whole what effect should be given to such a statement.
 
 
 
Before us, the appellants did not challenge the trial judge`s statement of the law in this area. As before, their only discord appeared to us to be one of fact, cleverly disguised nevertheless in the form of an allegation that the trial judge had misinterpreted the facts and thus applied the law wrongly. In our view, the trial judge`s exposition of the law was sound, its application correct, and there was absolutely no basis for any of the appellants` contentions.
The material pieces of correspondence between the parties have been described and set out in the earlier part of this judgment and do not bear repeating. Taking an objective look at the faxes which were exchanged, we found that it was beyond doubt that the respondents, through Dasan, had clearly proceeded on the basis that any contract, if or when made, would be between themselves and the `russian owners or sellers` of the floating dock. The written communication is replete with references to `Russian owners and/or sellers`. At the same time, Dasan was constantly asking GM to attempt to get the selling price of the dock reduced from the Russians. The reasonable inference to be drawn from this must be that GM was conducting himself as an agent for the Russians, who were the actual sellers and who were going to sell the dock to Dasan`s principals, ie the respondents. If the contract that was contemplated was indeed one between the appellants and the respondents, then whither the need for any reference to the Russians at all in any of the dealings between the appellants and the respondents? For surely whatever agreement reached between Dalzavod and the appellants would have been of no concern to the respondents who on their part would also have had no business querying it. Indeed, if the arrangement had in fact been as the appellants alleged it to be, ie a sale from Dalzavod to them followed by a subsequent re-sale to the respondents, it would have been so easy for GM to simply state so in any of his correspondence to the respondents. This however, he failed to do. Not once did he even mention the appellants` name in any of his correspondence with Dasan nor was any reason advanced for this shroud of secrecy. In fact, even when he finally faxed to Dasan the draft copy of the second MOA for the respondents` approval and signature on 10 October 1996, he did not bother to make any reference to the appellants whatsoever in the main text of his letter. He was content to slip the name `Tribune Investment`, a name which had hitherto never before appeared, insidiously into the body of the second MOA which was attached merely as an enclosure to the main letter. Certainly any reasonable person looking at the nature and content of the correspondence passing between the parties would have no difficulty or hesitation coming to the conclusion that GM was content on keeping up the faÃ§ade which he had created and to perpetuate what, he knew was an obvious mistaken assumption on Dasan, and therefore the respondents` part. Dasan`s diametrically opposing interpretation of the true state of affairs can further be seen in the fact that in their fax of 9 October 1996, they had congratulated GM for securing an agreement from the `russian sellers for USD$9.4m`. Clearly, Dasan, and hence the respondents had believed all along that they were contracting with the russians directly.
The most telling sign of GM`s deceit however can be gleaned from his fax of 27 September 1996, wherein he had stated that USD$10m would have to go to the Russian side and wherein he had asked for a commission for himself of USD$500,000. If indeed there was to be a separate sale from Dalzavod to the appellants first, then we fail to see any reason why the appellants should have had to trouble the respondents with a breakdown of how the purchase price of the dock from the respondents was going to be dealt with vis-Ã -vis Dalzavod. There can be absolutely no explanation why GM would talk about USD$10m going to the Russians at all if the respondents were not even going to be privy to any contract concerning the Russians. In any case, the statement about USD$10m going to the Russians was an outright lie, for GM knew fully well, after the in-principle agreement signed between Dalzavod and the appellants on 20 September 1996 that the latter had managed to secure the dock for a mere USD$6.5m. The fact that GM had in his fax of 27 September asked for a commission further showed that he had deliberately misled Dasan, and hence the respondents, into thinking that GM or his principal GMCO were merely acting as agents for the russian sellers. If GM or GMCO were going to be the sellers of the dock in so far as the respondents were concerned, then what need or basis was there for them, as sellers, to be asking for a commission (bearing in mind that the appellants were really only a shell company which was controlled wholly by GM)?
Looking at all the evidence as a whole, we surmised that the true factual scenario was probably this: Dalzavod had approached GMCO, a large shipbrokering firm in Greece, to look for a prospective buyer for PD 177. The respondents on their part had similarly approached several brokers, including Dasan, to source for a floating dock for them. They were clear however, after their earlier unpleasant experience with Meyersale, that they only wanted to contract with the owners directly. When GM learnt from Dasan of the respondents` interest in PD 177 and of their willingness to offer some USD$9.5m for it at the start, he, knowing that Dalzavod were willing to let go of the dock at a much lower price than that offered, decided to make a quick buck for himself by creating a sub-sale arrangement. He knew that if he had merely carried out his task as agent or broker for Dalzavod, his commission from the sale would only be in the region of around USD$500,000. If he could thus supplant a middleman into the picture to buy the dock from Dalzavod first before on-selling it to the respondents however, then his profit would soar to a whopping USD$2.9 to 3m. Thus the whole ingenious web of deceit which followed.
In view of the inescapable findings reached above, we found that at no time could there ever have been consensus ad idem between the parties. While GM`s intention might have been for the respondents to contract with the appellants, the respondents` intention was at all times to contract with Dalzavod only. Put simply, the parties were talking at cross-purposes, and as such could hardly be said to have come to a mutually binding agreement. Admittedly, the identity of the person with whom one is contracting or proposing to contract is often immaterial. Nevertheless, where the mistake is fundamental, and affects the entire foundation on which the formation of the contract is based, then it cannot be said that a contract was ever concluded between the parties for there was never at any time a meeting of the minds. It must be remembered that this was not a case of an over-the-counter cash sale or a sale concluded at a public auction. In these instances there is no doubt that the identity of the buyer would be completely irrelevant to the seller for the seller is only concerned with selling his wares at the agreed price. It does not matter to him who is buying the goods. The facts of this case on the other hand were fundamentally different. The respondents knew from the start that they only wanted to contract with the owners of the dock directly. This fact was communicated to the appellants via Dasan, who in all their correspondence with the appellants, had made it crystal clear that they as well as the respondents were acting in the belief and expectation that they would be contracting with Dalzavod. Admittedly, the test is not entirely subjective, ie the question is not simply `with whom did the offeror intend to contract?` but also `how would the offer have been understood by a reasonable man in the position of the offeree?`. We found however that it was clear that any reasonable person would easily have gathered from a plain reading of Dasan`s faxes that the respondents intended to contract with Dalzavod only. Indeed it surprised us that GM actually made the protest of not knowing this fact. In our view, he probably did, and as such, the whole ploy to delude the respondents from the start. His explanation that he had orally informed Dasan at an early stage that he was acting for Greek principals was disbelieved by the trial judge and in our view, rightly so, for no where in the entire stack of written correspondence between Dasan and GMCO were the words `Greek principal` ever mentioned. It must not be forgotten that GM was a shrewd and experienced businessman who had been in the business of shipbrokering for a long time. If he had really been acting for Greek principals, then in light of the fact that the term `Russian sellers`, who were not even the intended contracting party, had appeared countless of times in the written communication, a fortiori the name of the alleged Greek principal should surely have been mentioned at least once in writing.
The case law in this area is again consistent with the principles set out above. To this end, the seminal case of 
Cundy v Lindsay
 
[1878] 3 App Cas 459
 is relevant. In that case, a letter was written by a fraudulent person named Blenkarn ordering a quantity of handkerchiefs from the respondents. He signed his name in a way which allowed it to be confused with an established firm named Blenkiron & Co who carried on a business in the same street. The goods were sent to Blenkiron & Co at the address given by the rogue Blenkarn, who quickly sold it off to the appellants and disappeared shortly after that. It was held that there was no contract between the rogue Blenkarn and the respondents for the latter`s intention had been to deal only with Blenkiron & Co. As such, the property in the handkerchiefs remained throughout with the respondents. To summarise, the principle espoused in that case is simply that a person cannot make another a contracting party with himself, when he knows or ought to know that the other intends to contract not with him but with another. In our view, this was exactly what GM tried to do in this case, as a result of which, no valid contract could possibly be said to have been formed between the appellants and the respondents, for when an offer meant for A is purportedly accepted by B, any apparent contract formed is void and cannot confer rights on anyone.
For the above reasons, we found that the appellants had not made out their claim in contract. In reaching the above conclusions, we had, to the benefit of the appellants, made the fundamental assumption that Dasan had the requisite authority to conclude a contract on behalf of the respondents. The trial judge for his part found that this was in fact so and held that Dasan had apparent or ostensible authority. With respect, we found that there was considerable doubt as to whether or not Dasan may be said to have had the requisite authority to finalise deals on the respondents` behalf. It seemed to us that the objective evidence pointed otherwise. Firstly, none of Dasan`s faxes to GM or GMCO were ever copied to the respondents. Next, it was also telling that not once did Dasan or W J Park ever sign off as agent for and on behalf of the respondents. The concept of ostensible or apparent authority was explained by Lord Keith in 
The Ocean Frost; Armagas Ltd v Mundogas SA
 
[1986] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 109
 at p 112 as follows: 
 
Ostensible authority comes about where the principal, by words or conduct, has represented that the agent has requisite actual authority, and the party dealing with the agent has entered into a contract with him in reliance upon that representation. The principal in these circumstances is estopped from denying that actual authority existed. In the commonly encountered case, the ostensible authority is general in character, arising when the principal has placed the agent in the outside world is generally regarded as carrying authority to enter into the transaction in question. Ostensible general authority may also arise where the agent has had a course of dealing with a particular contractor and the principal has acquiesced in this course of dealing and honoured transactions arising out of it.
 
 
 
It is clear from the above exposition of the law that the representation must come from the principal and not the agent. There is no concept of a self-authorising agent. Andrew Jamieson in 
 Shipbrokers and The Law 
 (1997) states the position as such: 
 
The essential requirement is that there must be some sort of representation from the principal. 
 This requirement could not be satisfied solely by virtue of the fact that the principal had appointed a shipbroker. The position of shipbroker simply does not justify a finding that the broker has authority to bind his principal
. [Emphasis ours.]
 
 
 
In our view, there was nothing in the evidence in this case to show that the respondents had ever at any time held out any representation to the appellants or to anyone that Dasan had the authority to contract on their behalf. Whatever WJ Park or Dasan may have conveyed or said to GM or GMCO is irrelevant in determining ostensible authority for what one must look for is a representation emanating from the principals, in this case, the respondents. Having considered the evidence, we found that like FEMAS and the other shipbrokers approached by the respondents, Dasan was probably only appointed as an agent of the respondents for the limited purpose of sourcing for a suitable dock. At no time were they given the authority nor were they represented as having the authority to enter into contracts on the respondents` behalf. The fact that more than one shipbroker was appointed by the respondents to search for a dock also militated strongly in favour of the finding that none of them could have been given the added power or authority to conclude a deal binding the respondents. Hence, we are of the view that no valid contract between the appellants and the respondents could have been found to exist.
Having found against the appellants on liability, we see no need to consider the question of damage suffered..
Before moving on to consider the last segment of the appellants` claim however, we should perhaps say a brief word on a constant strand of argument which had been run by the appellants throughout this appeal. The appellants took issue with the fact that the learned trial judge had not drawn an adverse inference against the respondents for their failure to call certain witnesses whom the appellants contended were material to the defence. The regime for drawing adverse inferences is derived from s 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). Whether or not in each case an adverse inference should be drawn depends on all the evidence adduced and the circumstances of the case. There is no fixed and immutable rule of law for drawing such inference. Where, as was the case here, the trial judge is of the view that the plaintiffs themselves had not made out their claim to the requisite standard, then no drawing of an adverse inference against the defendants is necessary. The drawing of an adverse inference, at least in civil cases, should not be used as a mechanism to shore up glaring deficiencies in the opposite party`s case, which on its own is unable to meet up to the requisite burden of proof. Rather, the procedure exists in order to render the case of the party against whom the inference is drawn weaker and thus less credible of belief.
In this case, the trial judge had no doubt that the plaintiffs had failed to make out even a prima facie case on any of the numerous claims put forth by them. In particular, GP Selvam J, who had the opportunity of observing the demeanour of the witnesses on the stand, took the view that the plaintiffs` chief witness, GM, was unreliable as a witness, and whose evidence could not be believed. In the light of this observation, we are of the view that the learned judge was right in exercising the discretion not to draw an adverse inference against the respondents. In any event, there was nothing to show that the respondents` primary witness, SK Hyun was not a material or relevant witness to the proceedings. Mr Hyun was a Team Leader in SHI at the material time and was also the person tasked with sourcing for a floating dock for the respondents. It was also Hyun who liased with Dasan throughout the entire episode concerning the sale and purchase of PD 177, and who was frequently referred to as the `President of Soosan` in most of the correspondence between Dasan and GMCO. In the light of these incontrovertible facts, there was nothing to suggest that the respondents had failed to call witnesses material to their defence or that an adverse inference should have been drawn by the trial judge against them.
 The inquiry into damages in respect of the mareva injunction obtained by the appellants against the respondents 
 
 
 
Soon after the commencement of this action, ie Suit 2400/96, the appellants on 13 December 1996, obtained an ex parte mareva injunction against PD 177 ownership of which had by then been transferred to the respondents. The injunction was discharged on 31 December 1996 following a discharge application by the respondents at which Choo Han Teck JC found that there was no risk of dissipation of assets by the respondents. GP Selvam J in the court below ordered that there be an inquiry as to the damages suffered by the respondents in consequence of the injunction. The appellants were dissatisfied with that order and contended before us that no such inquiry should have been ordered.
It is established practice that every applicant for a Mareva injunction is invariably required to give an undertaking to abide by any order for damages which may be made if the defendant suffers loss as a result of the Mareva order. The appellants in this case were not exempted from this requirement. Where the injunction is eventually discharged, as was the case here, then the parties covered by the undertaking have the right to ask the court to enforce the undertaking against the other party, and the court can do so either by assessing the damages summarily or by directing that the latter pay damages awarded on an inquiry as to damages. The trial judge in this case opted for the latter, more common alternative.
The court, in deciding whether or not to enforce a plaintiff`s undertaking, has a discretion. The discretion is to be exercised by reference to all the circumstances of the case. In determining whether or not an order for inquiry should be granted, the court should first deal with the question whether or not the injunction was rightly granted. The two factors which the court should consider when deciding whether to enforce the undertaking in damages by ordering an inquiry are firstly, whether or not the plaintiff has succeeded on the merits of his claim, and secondly, whether there was a real risk of dissipation of assets. Where the discretion is being exercised after judgment, then the fact that the plaintiff has lost his claim militates strongly in favour of an order for inquiry: see Steven Gee, 
 Mareva Injunctions and Anton Piller Relief 
 (4th Ed, 1998) at pp 157-164.
The only pertinent questions to be asked in this case are thus whether or not there was a real risk of dissipation of assets by the respondents at the relevant time, and whether or not the respondents had adduced at least some evidence to show an arguable case that they had in fact sustained a loss falling within the terms of the appellants` undertaking. With respect to the question of risk of dissipation, we found that no such risk had been shown by the appellants to exist, and this was the most likely basis on which the learned Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck allowed the respondents` application to discharge the Mareva injunction in the first place. A perusal of SK Hyun`s affidavit filed for the purposes of the discharge application clearly bore this out. There, it was described that the respondents were part of a large Korean multi-national group of companies engaged in diversified businesses spanning many countries. The assets of the Soosan Group total some USD$755m. The Group, including the respondents, was, at least in 1996 when the action was commenced, highly capitalised and had a good name and reputation in Korea. In the circumstances, there was absolutely nothing to suggest that the respondents were going to dispose of their assets at the relevant time. The appellants` contentions to the effect that the respondents` only asset in Singapore at the material time was PD 177 and that a Singapore judgment would not be enforced by the Korean courts were also without merit for the simple reason that they knew from the start of the paucity of assets belonging to the respondents in Singapore. They further knew that the respondents had intended PD 177 to be used for related businesses in China. Yet in spite of all this, they nevertheless proceeded to commence proceedings against the respondents in Singapore knowing fully well that the parties to this case, being Greek and Korean respectively, had absolutely no connection to Singapore whatsoever. As such, we had no doubt that the appellants must be taken to have assumed the risk of obtaining a judgment which would eventually go unsatisfied or be content with securing but a Pyrrhic victory. It was through no fault of the respondents that they had no other asset in Singapore. This was the position well before the events in this case took place and remained so after the ensuing saga unfurled. It was certainly not something brought about by the respondents in a deliberate attempt to frustrate potential judgments obtained against them. In any case, even if it was true, as the appellants contended that it was, that a Singapore judgment will not be enforced by the courts in Korea, the appellants still had not shown that the respondents did not own other assets in countries in which a judgment of a Singapore court can and will be enforced. In the light of all these reasons, it was clear that the appellants had not shown that there was a substantial risk of dissipation of assets by the respondents at the time when the mareva injunction was sought. As for the question whether or not the respondents had made out an arguable case of loss consequent on the mareva, we found that they had. As a result of the injunction, the respondents lost the use of PD 177 for nearly three weeks. Surely this must have caused some loss to them, especially when it was undisputed at the trial that the respondents required the dock urgently for the purposes of SS` ship repair business in China. In the premises, we took the view that the order for inquiry should not be disturbed.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the above reasons, we found this entire appeal to be completely devoid of merit and dismissed it accordingly.

: This was an appeal against the decision of District Judge Siva Shanmugam. On 2 September 2000, the appellant, Pandiyan Thanaraju Rogers, was convicted after a trial of one charge of corruption punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed) (`PCA`). He was sentenced to six months` imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $1,700. The appellant was granted leave to lodge a petition of appeal against the conviction and the sentence out of time. He also filed a motion for leave to adduce fresh evidence at the hearing of the appeal. After hearing the submissions of counsel for the appellant and the DPP, I dismissed the motion and the appeals against conviction and sentence. In addition, I enhanced the sentence to nine months` imprisonment. I now give the reasons for my decision.
 The charge 
 
 
 
The charge against the appellant read: 
 
You, Pandiyan Thanaraju Rogers, are charged that you on a day in April 1994, at Blk 38 Upper Boon Keng Road [num ]25-2402 Singapore being an agent to wit, a Staff Sergeant in the Singapore Police Force, did corruptly accept from one Manjit Singh, a gratification of a sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000) as an inducement to do an act in relation to your principal`s affairs, to wit, to render assistance to the said Manjit Singh in his police case, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.
 
 
 
The offence carries a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.
 The case for the prosecution 
 
 
 
On 17 February 1994, Manjit Singh (`Manjit`), formerly a staff sergeant with the Singapore Armed Forces, was seriously assaulted while on his way to collect a debt on behalf of a moneylending business which was registered in the name of his wife. While he was hospitalised, his friend Silver Packiam (`Silver`) brought the appellant to visit him. The appellant was then a staff sergeant and second in command of Team D, Secret Society Branch, CID. He was introduced as a CID officer whom Manjit could consult. At that time, Manjit needed assurances and wanted to be kept apprised of the details of his assault case.
Upon his return from hospital, Manjit received threatening calls which he believed were connected to the assault. He was in fear and informed the appellant of his worries about the assailants. Manjit also mentioned his concern that the Singapore Armed Forces (`SAF`) may investigate the assault which could in turn affect his pension. He was aware that under the MINDEF General Orders, he was not permitted to take part directly or indirectly in the management of any commercial enterprise while still in the service of the SAF. The appellant gave Manjit his name card and told Manjit to contact him if he encountered any problems with police matters. On a subsequent occasion, the appellant asked Manjit, through Silver, for a loan of $2,000. Manjit acceded to the request. The appellant was aware that, as a police officer, he was only permitted to obtain loans from approved institutions and was not permitted to take a loan from a person believed to be an illegal moneylender.
The prosecution admitted into evidence, without any challenge as to their voluntariness, the appellant`s statements recorded on 28 October 1999 and 1 December 1999 by CPIB officer SSI Chin Yen Yen (`SSI Chin`) (exh P3). In exh P3, the appellant stated that he started visiting Manjit soon after their introduction. During the visits, Manjit frequently consulted him for professional advice on the case. Manjit was very worried about the assailants and sought the appellant`s advice. On his part, the appellant reassured Manjit and helped in whatever ways he could.
It was stated in exh P3 that the appellant subsequently asked Manjit for a loan through Silver. By then he knew that Manjit was involved in a moneylending business. Based on his long experience in the police force and the fact that Manjit was an SAF officer, the appellant suspected that it was an unlicensed and illegal moneylending business. He was aware that Manjit thought that he could assist the latter in his assault case. Manjit did not specify a dateline for repayment, or charge him interest for the loan which remained substantially unpaid.
Manjit was a witness for the prosecution. In court, he first stated that he was unable to recall if a conversation took place between them when the $2,000 was handed to the appellant; he later testified that the appellant simply took the money and left. The prosecution was granted leave pursuant to s 147(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) (`EA`) to cross-examine Manjit on his previous statement to CPIB officer SSI Fong Hong Chin (`SSI Fong`), recorded on 28 October 1999 (exh P5). Manjit claimed that exh P5 was given involuntarily. After a voir dire to determine its voluntariness, the district judge admitted exh P5 into evidence for cross-examination and as substantive evidence pursuant to s 147(3) of the EA.
In exh P5, Manjit described the conversations which took place between them at the material times. He stated that the appellant endorsed Silver`s assurance that, since the appellant was from CID, he would be able to help if Manjit encountered any `problems` in future. At the same time, the appellant handed over his name card, telling Manjit to look for him if he needed anything or encountered any problems with regard to police matters. When the money was handed to the appellant, the appellant repeated that Manjit could approach him for help if he encountered any problems with any matters in the future. The appellant also said that he would `check for [Manjit]` in relation to the assault case. Manjit felt obligated to the appellant since he was a police officer; furthermore, the appellant had promised to keep Manjit posted on his assault case and to help with any problems in the future. Manjit stated in his statement that he was under the impression that the appellant could keep him updated on the case and to help him in whatever ways. When confronted with exh P5, Manjit retracted the portions which implicated the appellant, claiming that they were inaccurate and had been made up on the directions of the CPIB officers.
 The case for the defence 
 
 
 
The appellant had joined the Singapore Police Force in 1971. At the time of the alleged offence in 1994, he was facing a financial crisis. He had been declared a bankrupt in 1990 and was considered a credit risk. As a result, he had to resort to taking loans from friends and relatives.
The appellant did not deny receiving $2,000 from Manjit but claimed that it was an innocent loan. Soon after they were introduced, he told Silver that he needed to borrow $2,000. Silver agreed to help by asking Manjit for a loan on his behalf. It was a friendly loan without interest, guaranteed by Silver. He explained that he borrowed the money from Manjit as Manjit was Silver`s close friend. He did not think that there was anything wrong with him taking a loan from Manjit as he merely suspected and had no proof that Manjit was an illegal moneylender. Furthermore, the loan was guaranteed by Silver. It was not disputed that Manjit did not specify a dateline for the return of the loan, nor chased him for its return. Nonetheless, the appellant asserted that he had indicated that the loan would be repaid in July or December of that year.
The appellant stated that he gave only general and not professional advice to Manjit. He denied taking advantage of his office by promising to assist Manjit in his police case. He claimed that he had not helped Manjit in any way and had in fact told Manjit that any queries should be directed to the relevant investigating officer in charge of his case. He did not want to be seen to be interfering with the investigations as this would have breached proper procedures. He did not at any time contact the investigating officer to find out the status of Manjit`s case. As for the loan, he had thus far repaid Manjit $300. As regards his statement exh P3, he refuted the incriminating portions of exh P3, explaining that they were inaccurate and did not reflect what he had meant to say.
 The decision of the district judge 
 
 
 
The district judge rejected Manjit`s allegation that exh P5 was recorded involuntarily or inaccurately and preferred the evidence contained in his previous inconsistent statement over his sworn testimony in court. The district judge described Manjit as a clever, cunning and an unreliable and dishonest witness. He was found to be not forthcoming in his answers and to have deliberately withheld evidence for fear of being charged for corruption.
The district judge also found that the appellant`s statement, exh P3, was accurately recorded. On the totality of the evidence, he held that all the elements of the charge had been made out. In his view, the transaction contained an objectively corrupt element and the appellant possessed the requisite guilty knowledge that what he was doing was corrupt. Accordingly, he was convicted of corruptly accepting a sum of $2,000 as an inducement to render assistance to Manjit in his police case.
 The motion to adduce fresh evidence 
 
 
 
At the commencement of the appeal, Mr Damodara, counsel for the appellant, sought to adduce fresh evidence comprising: 
(1) a certified true copy of a certificate of service dated 29 January 1994 issued by the SAF certifying that Manjit was released from service due to optional retirement on 30 January 1994; 
(2) a letter dated 27 September 2000 issued by the Ministry of Defence stating that Manjit`s net commuted pension gratuity was credited into his bank account on 4 February 1994.
Mr Damodara argued that the documents proved that, at the time of the assault on 17 February 1994, Manjit was no longer in active service with the SAF and had already received his pension payment. He submitted that this would in turn show that the district judge wrongly convicted the appellant on the erroneous basis that Manjit parted with the $2,000 in return for the appellant`s assistance in ensuring that there were no repercussions against him for his involvement in the moneylending business while still in active service with the SAF.
It is settled law that three conditions must be satisfied before fresh evidence may be received pursuant to s 257 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68): 
(1) non-availability - that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; 
(2) relevance - that the evidence would probably have an important influence on the result of the case though it need not be decisive; 
(3) reliability - that the evidence must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.

[1991] 2 MLJ 1
  at 4A; 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  at 343G-I.
The reliability of the documents was not in issue before me in light of the DPP`s concession as to their authenticity.
In my view, the motion could be dismissed solely on the ground that the intended evidence was irrelevant and would not have an important influence on the outcome of the case. The district judge had concluded that the appellant was 
 
enjoying a reciprocal relationship with [Manjit] in that he was receiving a loan from [Manjit] in exchange for exercising his powers and connections in office to reassure [Manjit], to keep [Manjit] appraised [
 sic
] of developments in his assault case and to render assistance whenever possible.
 
 
 
From a review of the evidence and the district judge`s grounds of decision, it was obvious that Manjit`s concern over the possible impact on his pension was not his sole or even his prime motivation for acceding to the appellant`s request for $2,000. To recall, Manjit was extremely concerned and worried about the assault and had been receiving threatening phone calls. He was in a state of considerable distress as a result. The assistance which the appellant alluded to, and which Manjit envisaged, was general in nature and not specific to Manjit`s concern over his pension. Although the district judge alluded to Manjit`s concern about his pension in his grounds of decision, it was only a passing reference; his decision was patently not based on the date Manjit retired or received his gratuity. Rather the district judge concluded that the appellant accepted the loan from Manjit despite his suspicions that Manjit was an illegal moneylender and, in so doing, gave assurances and promises of assistance to Manjit. Under those circumstances, the dates of Manjit`s discharge from the SAF and his receipt of the pension gratuity were wholly irrelevant to the question of the appellant`s corrupt intent at the time he received the $2,000 from Manjit and bore no impact whatsoever on the district judge`s eventual findings.
In any case, regardless of the actual date of discharge, Manjit had admitted in the proceedings below that he was already involved in the moneylending business as of September 1993 when he was still in active service with the SAF. In my view, this underpinned Manjit`s concern about his pension. The point was not pursued by the appellant at the trial, where it was never the appellant`s defence that he knew or believed that Manjit was unconcerned about the assault case and the effect it might have upon his pension.
Turning finally to the requirement of non-availability, I was also not satisfied that the information contained in the documents could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial. In his supporting affidavit, the appellant stated that he coincidentally met Manjit after his conviction and casually asked him when he left the SAF. It was only after his query that Manjit later reverted with the documents in question. Mr Damodara contended that it was not within the appellant`s control to obtain the documents from the Ministry of Defence as they related to the employment of Manjit who was a prosecution witness.
I observed that what was purportedly critical to the appellant, however, were not the documents per se but the information contained therein. It was apparent to me that the appellant had simply not taken any earlier steps to obtain the information pertaining to the date of Manjit`s discharge from the SAF. If the appellant genuinely believed that the date Manjit left active service was of crucial importance to his defence, he could have requested for the requisite documentary records through the investigator, the prosecution or even the court before or during the trial. At the very least, his counsel could have posed the appropriate questions to Manjit when he was on the stand. In fact, the defence did not dispute or challenge Manjit`s testimony that he retired from the SAF in March 1994. No satisfactory explanation has been proffered as to why such steps could not have been taken with reasonable diligence prior to or during the trial.
I fully recognise that the court may in some instances, allow additional evidence to be called even though it could not be strictly said that the evidence was not available at the time of the trial, if it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. Such evidence may be taken if it is necessary in the interest of justice. This situation will arise only in the most extraordinary and extenuating circumstances, which may include the fact that the offence is a serious one attracting grave consequences and the fact that the additional evidence sought to be adduced was highly cogent and pertinent and the strength of which rendered the conviction unsafe: 
 Juma`at bin Samad v PP 
 (supra at p 347G); 
Lee Yuen Hong v PP
 
 
[2000] 2 SLR 339
  at [para ]66. In my view, such extenuating circumstances did not exist in the present case. As I explained earlier, the evidence sought to be adduced would not have had an important influence on the actual outcome of the case. Accordingly, I dismissed the appellant`s application to adduce the documents in question.
 The appeal against conviction 
 
 
 
Turning to the appeal against conviction, the following two main grounds of arguments were raised before me: 
(1) that the district judge erred in relying on Manjit`s previous inconsistent statement to the CPIB - exh P5; 
(2) that there was no objectively corrupt element in the transaction.
 MANJIT`S PREVIOUS STATEMENT - EXH P5
Manjit`s previous inconsistent statement, exh P5, was a critical piece of evidence incriminating the appellant. In urging me to overturn the conviction, Mr Damodara argued that the district judge failed to consider the fact that exh P5 was admitted after a voir dire, and he also erred in accepting exh P5 as the truth, without giving due regard to the relevant considerations when assessing the weight to be attached to the statement.
At the outset, I noted that it was wholly unnecessary for the district judge to have conducted a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of exh P5. This was recently confirmed by the Court of Appeal in 
Thiruselvam s/o Nagaratnam v PP
 
 
[2001] 2 SLR 125
  at [para ]45, 47 where it was held that there was nothing in s 147(3) of the EA which required the admissibility of a previous inconsistent statement of a witness to be subject to the test of voluntariness. The voluntariness of the statement is, however, a factor to be taken into consideration when determining the weight to be accorded to the statement.
The other factors to be considered in assessing the weight to be accorded to the statement are set out in s 147(6) of the EA and elaborated in 
Selvarajan James v PP
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 750
 , 
PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 158
  and 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
 . These considerations relate to the accuracy of the statement and refer to the contemporaneity of the statement; whether the maker had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts; the explanations for the inconsistency; the context of the statement; and the cogency and coherence of the statement.
Upon a review of the district judge`s grounds of decision, I was satisfied that the district judge was at all times mindful of these factors, especially the long lapse of time between the material incident and the recording of exh P5. The district judge nonetheless eventually concluded that exh P5 contained the truth and could be relied upon. Although exh P5 was recorded on 18 October 1999, some six and a half years after the incident, Manjit was then able to provide a fairly coherent and cogent detailed account of his conversations with the appellant. The drastic erosion of Manjit`s memory some eight months later in the court proceedings was therefore quite surprising. While the long lapse of time was a cause for caution, particularly in relation to the details of dates and the sequence of events, what was not so malleable, however, was the tenor and contents of the conversations, Manjit`s impressions of the precipitating events, his motivation for handing $2,000 to the appellant and whether the loan was repaid. Although the appellant had laid much emphasis on SSI Chin`s evidence that the witnesses had difficulty recollecting the events in 1995, this did not advance his case since Manjit`s statement was recorded by a different officer, SSI Fong.
In cases of this nature, there is always a possibility that the giver of the alleged bribe might have a motive to conceal or misrepresent facts to lessen his own culpability. Looking at exh P5 in totality, however, it was readily apparent that Manjit had simultaneously incriminated himself by revealing his role and intention in acceding to the request for $2,000. The argument that Manjit might have chosen to conceal or misrepresent certain facts to evade his own culpability thus held somewhat less weight. This was to be contrasted to his demeanour in court where he was found to be not forthcoming and intentionally withholding evidence for fear of being charged for corruption.
In the proceedings below, Manjit asserted that exh P5 was untrue as he was threatened; that he wanted to avoid inconvenience and to leave CPIB quickly. These explanations were rightly rejected by the district judge after careful consideration. Manjit had been a staff sergeant in the SAF for some 20 years and was unlikely to be affected by such alleged threats or considerations. Furthermore, Manjit had read, amended, signed and affirmed the truth and voluntariness of the statements. The district judge had the benefit of observing all the relevant witnesses in court. He found the CPIB witnesses who had testified as to the recording of the statement to be truthful while describing Manjit as a `clever and cunning witness` and `an unreliable and dishonest witness`. In this regard, it is trite law that an appellate court would be reluctant to disturb the findings of fact made by the trial judge, especially when they were based on his findings as to the demeanour and veracity of the witnesses. I therefore found no basis for diminishing the weight to be accorded to exh P5 on the strength of Manjit`s bare allegations.
In any event, exh P5 was not the only evidence which incriminated the appellant. It was corroborated by the appellant`s statements, exh P3 where the appellant admitted his suspicion that Manjit was an illegal moneylender; that Manjit frequently consulted him for advice and was very worried about the assault; that he reassured Manjit and helped him whatever ways he could; that he thereafter asked Manjit for a loan; that he knew that Manjit thought that he could assist Manjit in his assault case; that Manjit did not charge him any interest, nor specified a deadline nor chased him for the return of the $2,000.
When the appellant was cross-examined on exh P3, he sought to challenge its accuracy, claiming that they did not accurately reflect what he intended to say. I observed that this contention was gravely impaired by his failure to put the allegation to the recording officer. Furthermore, the appellant was no ordinary lay witness. He was a highly experienced investigating officer who must have been aware of the necessity to ensure the accuracy of the statement, especially in light of the serious nature of the allegation.
For the foregoing reasons, I found that the district judge was fully entitled to conclude that exh P5 contained the truth of the matters stated therein and to rely on it over Manjit`s oral testimony in court.
 WHETHER THERE WAS AN OBJECTIVELY CORRUPT ELEMENT IN THE TRANSACTION
In order to determine whether the $2,000 was accepted corruptly, there must be: (1) an objectively corrupt element in the transaction which is to be established by ascertaining the intention of the receiver and whether such intention tainted the transaction with an objectively corrupt element given the factual matrix. This was an objective inquiry essentially based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man and to be answered only after the court had inferred what the appellant intended when he entered the transaction; and (2) guilty knowledge that what he was doing was corrupt by the objective and ordinary standard: 
Chan Wing Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 426
 ; 
PP v Low Tiong Choon
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 878
 ; 
Fong Ser Joo William v PP
 
 
[2000] 4 SLR 77
 .
Mr Damodara next contended that the district judge erred in finding that there was an objectively corrupt element in the transaction. He argued in particular that the sum of $2,000 was merely a loan and not a gift; that the appellant had only dispensed general advice and only intended to render emotional support; that there was no evidence that he used or was going to use his position as a police officer to assist Manjit; that there was no evidence of the specific assistance which he was supposed to render.
I saw no merit in his submissions and accordingly rejected it for reasons which I shall shortly elaborate upon. There was no doubt in my mind that there was sufficient evidence supporting the finding of an objectively corrupt element in the transaction.
Turning first to the surrounding circumstances at the relevant time, the appellant was clearly aware of Manjit`s anxiety, fears and concerns over the assault case. Manjit frequently asked and consulted the appellant on the case, sought assurances and wanted to be kept apprised of developments in the matter. He was under the impression that the appellant could keep him updated on the case. The appellant knew that Manjit looked upon him for help. He told Manjit that he would `check` on the assault case for him and repeatedly assured Manjit that since he was from CID, he could assist Manjit if he encountered any `problems` in the future; or if Manjit encountered any problems with regards to police matters. He also passed Manjit his name card and repeated his earlier assurances. When the money was given to the appellant, he again repeated this assurance. Viewed in totality, it was obvious that the appellant had deliberately made these repeated representations and assurances to Manjit; and would have realised that Manjit parted with the $2,000 in exchange for the appellant`s possible future assistance with regard to the case which Manjit was interested in. The facts certainly do not bear out the appellant`s claims that he was acting in the role of a Good Samaritan and was merely furnishing general advice and emotional support to Manjit.
I therefore agreed with the district judge`s findings that the appellant had allowed himself to be placed in a position where he would be beholden to Manjit and to provide him with future assistance as and when required. In many of the recent cases involving corruption, particularly on the part of police officers, the gratification was given to purchase the receiver`s goodwill and as a form of retainer for future unspecified services as and when required. The lack of any specific representation by the appellant as to the precise assistance to be rendered by him was not fatal to the charge. There is no necessity in law for an express request for a bribe or an express reference to a favour to be shown. Such a requirement has been held to be undesirable and unduly restrictive: 
PP v Tang Eng Peng Alan
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 131
  at 135I. The transaction has to be viewed in a broad and pragmatic perspective. The prosecution need not prove that the receipt of money was an inducement for a specific corrupt act or favour, it being sufficient that it was given in anticipation of some future corrupt act being performed. As I had stated in 
 Fong Ser Joo William v PP 
 (supra at [para ]25); 
Hassan bin Ahmad v PP
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 791
  at [para ]20: 
 
it only sufficed ... that the payments were not made innocently, but to purchase the recipient`s servitude.
 
 
 
This finding was further reinforced by the appellant`s own knowledge that he was prohibited from taking a loan from a person believed to be an illegal moneylender. The appellant`s explanations in this regard were highly unsatisfactory, he claimed that it was not wrong since he only had an unconfirmed suspicion of this matter. The appellant`s response is ludicrous, especially in light of his position as a senior and highly experienced police officer. The deliberate contravention of the prohibition under the circumstances was a further factor which supported the court`s findings as to the corrupt nature of the transaction: see 
 Chan Wing Seng v PP 
 (supra at [para ]20-23).
As was rightly noted by the district judge, the terms of the loan and the circumstances under which it was granted shed critical light on its true nature. In this regard, Mr Damodara highlighted the prosecution`s ambiguous position as to the nature of the payment, that is, whether it was a loan or a gift. This submission was misconceived. The distinction was not really material since both loans and gifts are included in the definition of `gratification` in s 2 of the PCA. What distinguishes the particular loan or gift is the corrupt element.
In this case, the appellant was in need of money and could not readily obtain other sources of financing due to his poor credit risk. He then sought the loan from someone who was a virtual stranger at the material time. The appellant and Manjit`s families may well have subsequently become close but that was wholly irrelevant. Despite their lack of acquaintance then, Manjit did not stipulate a specified deadline for repayment nor was any interest charged. This omission was particularly revealing since Manjit was himself involved in moneylending activities. Although Silver was the guarantor, Manjit did not at any time enforce the guarantee even though the loan had remained substantially unpaid to date. All these characteristics were highly unusual and militated against it being an ordinary loan. Taken together with the surrounding circumstances, they provided ample support for the finding that the $2,000 was accepted as an inducement to assist Manjit in his assault case.
It was also pointed out on behalf of the appellant that he had in fact sought the loan from his friend Silver. Mr Damodara argued that it was Silver`s idea to approach Manjit; and that Silver had approached Manjit on his own accord. In my view, the fact that Manjit may have been brought into the picture by a third party was completely irrelevant. The main question was whether at the time of the transaction, that is, when the money was handed to the appellant, the appellant possessed the requisite guilty mind. The offence need not necessarily be premeditated, so long as the requisite guilty mind was present at the point in time when the money was received.
Similarly, whether the appellant repaid or attempted to repay the loan in 1995 was also irrelevant to the charge which was for corruptly obtaining the gratification in question in the first place: see 
PP v Tang Eng Peng Alan
 (Unreported) at p 136A).
Mr Damodara also submitted that the appellant had merely rendered general advice and that there was no evidence that the appellant actually used his position as a police officer to render assistance to Manjit. This submission was misconceived. It is plain from the operation of s 9 of the PCA that it is not necessary for the appellant to have actually rendered any assistance. In 
 Fong Ser Joo William v PP 
 (supra at [para ]26) which also involved a charge under s 6(a) of the PCA, I had expressly recognised that it is not necessary to prove the actual act of showing favour. Rather, it is the receipt of the gratification, together with the intention of the giver and the recipient, that is crucial.
The appellant did not make any specific arguments in relation to the district judge`s finding that his actions were so obviously corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard that he must know that his conduct was corrupt. I nonetheless went on to consider this critical aspect of the appellant`s mens rea. Ultimately, the question of the giver`s and receiver`s intention as well as the question whether the receiver possessed the guilty knowledge is a question of fact. In this regard, an appellate court would be slow to disturb those findings, especially where they were based on the demeanour of the witnesses, unless they are shown to be clearly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. On this issue, the district judge had arrived at his findings after a review of all the evidence and the appellant`s demeanour in court. Suffice to say that I was satisfied that the district judge`s finding was not reached against the weight of the evidence.
As explained above, I was satisfied that the appellant had accepted the gratification corruptly and accordingly dismissed the appeal against conviction.
 The appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
The appellant was sentenced to six months` imprisonment by the district judge and ordered to pay a penalty of $1,700. During the appeal, I was informed that the appellant was no longer pursuing the submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Damodara pleaded that the appellant had been facing family and financial difficulties and had tried to repay the $2,000 in question. I had no hesitation in rejecting those arguments. In my view, these reasons were hardly mitigating in nature and could not merit a reduction in the sentence.
Although the DPP did not appeal against the sentence, I nevertheless went on to review the adequacy of the sentence imposed and enhanced the sentence to nine months` imprisonment. In my view, the sentence imposed by the district judge was manifestly inadequate and inconsistent with the sentences imposed in similar cases of corruption.
Crimes involving corruption on the part of police officers are extremely grave in nature and are viewed severely by the courts. The appellant was a senior and highly experienced officer, having served in the police force for some 29 years. At the material time, he occupied a fairly important position, being the second in command of Team D, Secret Society Branch, CID. Yet he was prepared to undermine the integrity of his office for his personal benefit and, in the process, betrayed the public`s trust and confidence in the police force. This was an aggravating feature of the offence. The district judge had imposed a sentence which was on the lower end of the scale. In my view, the sentence that he had imposed was more appropriate for cases involving corruption on the part of non-police officers. Where police officers are implicated, the courts have consistently imposed a sentence which is longer than six months in duration. As seen in recent cases, the sentences meted out to police officers convicted of corruption have ranged from nine months upwards. In 
 Fong Ser Joo William v PP 
 (supra) and 
 Hassan bin Ahmad v PP 
 (supra), the officers concerned were sentenced to nine months per charge; in 
Lim Poh Tee v PP
 
 
[2001] 1 SLR 674
 , the sentence of 30 months on a single charge was upheld on appeal; in 
Sim Bok Huat Royston v PP
 
 
[2001] 2 SLR 348
 , I had enhanced the sentence from nine to eighteen months on appeal. The facts of the present case do not warrant a different approach from that adopted in the above cited decisions. It appeared to me that the district judge had failed to fully consider the aggravating features of the offence or the usual tariffs applicable in cases of this nature. I had observed that in passing sentence, the district judge noted that the offence in question was committed some six years ago. I fail to see, however, how this factor could merit a sentence below that which was appropriate to the circumstances at hand.
Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal against sentence and enhanced the sentence to nine months` imprisonment.

 The facts 
 
 
 
The Ministry of the Environment (`the Ministry`) had been carrying out a project, involving the replacement of sewerage pipes, at the Penjuru Road pumping station (`the project`). The Ministry awarded the main contract for this project to Eng Tat Engineering Pte Ltd (`Eng Tat`). The appellant was a director of Eng Tat.
As the works on the project progressed, the Ministry made periodic progress payments to Eng Tat. The steps involved in the making of such progress payments were as follows: 
(1) Eng Tat would submit monthly progress claims to the Ministry. Each progress claim would show the amount of work done between the last progress payment and the present claim. 
(2) One Wong Seng Toong (`Wong`), who was then the project officer in the Ministry, would look at each progress claim before certifying that the work stipulated therein was done. Wong would then recommend that the progress payment be made to Eng Tat. 
(3) Upon Wong`s recommendation, the Ministry`s Head of Sewerage Department, one Yeo Seow Eng, would approve the progress payment. The progress payment would then be made to Eng Tat.
This project was completed in December 1995. By then, Eng Tat had already submitted all their progress claims to the Ministry, and the Ministry had in response to these claims made a total of 19 progress payments to Eng Tat. The 19th progress payment was made on 2 November 1995.
However, on 6 July 1996, the Ministry made a 20th progress payment, in the sum of $220,000, into Eng Tat`s account. Since the project was already completed by then, there was no work done to justify this 20th progress payment. Unlike all the other prior progress payments which the Ministry had made, this 20th progress payment did not appear to have been preceded by any corresponding progress claim from Eng Tat.
Lying at the very heart of this case was the question of how the payment of $220,000 came to be made to Eng Tat.
 The trial below 
 
 
 
Following the above turn of events, the appellant was charged in the district court below. The charge read as follows: 
 
You ... are charged that you, on or about the 2nd day of July 1996, in Singapore, together with Wong Seng Toong and in furtherance of the common intention of you both, cheated one Yeo Seow Eng, the Head of Sewerage Department, Ministry of the Environment, by deceiving the said Yeo Seow Eng into believing that the 20th Progress Payment Certificate for a sum of two hundred and twenty thousand dollars ($220,000) for the Replacement of Pumping Main for Penjuru Road Pumping Station project and certified by Wong Seng Toong was true and correct when in actual fact it was not so, and by such deceit you dishonestly induced the said Yeo Seow Eng to approve and deliver $220,000 to Eng Tat Engineering Pte Ltd, which amount would not have been delivered had he not been so deceived and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 420 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 
 
 
 
 THE PROSECUTION`S CASE
 
The prosecution`s case was that the 20th progress payment was made as a result of a fraudulent scheme which Wong hatched, and to which the appellant was privy.
Sometime in early 1996, after completion of the project, Wong observed that the aggregate of all the progress claims made by Eng Tat came up to only $1.11m. However, the contract price for the entire project was $1.38m, ie the aggregate of the progress claims that could be made by Eng Tat could not exceed $1.38m. As such, there was still room for Eng Tat to put in further claims totalling up to $270,000. Upon observation of this fact, Wong came up with a plan to cheat the Ministry.
Around April or May 1996, Wong arranged to meet the appellant at Aljunied Road. At this meeting, Wong spoke to the appellant about his plan. The plan would require Eng Tat to mark up the sum which it would claim against the Ministry for the total work done on the project. This would induce the Ministry to pay Eng Tat more than what Eng Tat was contractually entitled to. The excess payment was then to be split between Wong and the appellant. At first, the appellant said that he needed time to think about it. Subsequently, he agreed to join in the plan.
Pursuant to the plan, Wong procured Yeo Seow Eng`s approval for the sum of $220,000 to be paid to Eng Tat. In procuring such approval, Wong thus deceived Yeo.
The $220,000 was accordingly credited into Eng Tat`s account on 6 July 1996. After this, sometime between July and September 1996, the appellant met Wong on two occasions. On each occasion, the meeting took place near the Bedok MRT station. During each meeting, the appellant handed Wong $50,000. The total sum which the appellant paid to Wong thus amounted to $100,000.
That, however, was not the end of the scam. About two years later, sometime in April or May 1998, the appellant prepared a draft final bill of quantities (`BQ`), which he submitted to the Ministry for approval. The draft final BQ was meant to evidence the work done by Eng Tat for the 
 entire 
 project. The Ministry was then to vet the draft final BQ, so as to ascertain whether the sum claimed by Eng Tat for the total work done was warranted. If the Ministry found that the sum due for the total work done exceeded the aggregate amount of progress payments that had been made, the Ministry would pay Eng Tat the shortfall. If the Ministry found that the sum due for the total work done was less than the aggregate amount of progress payments made, Eng Tat would have to refund the excess accordingly. Now, as there was an excess payment of $220,000, something had to be done to somehow account for the overpayment. The appellant thus prepared a draft final BQ (P10) with inflated claims.
Unfortunately for the appellant, the plan to cheat the Ministry ran into a hitch at this very last stage. Wong, who had previously been the project manager for the Ministry, left the Ministry in late 1997. It was Wong who had been certifying the progress claims previously made by Eng Tat, and who had recommended that the progress payments be made. It was Wong who fraudulently put in the recommendation that the 20th progress payment be approved. Presumably, Wong should also have been the one to vet and approve P10. With Wong gone, the appellant had to submit P10 to another officer, Devaraj.
When Devaraj received P10, he handed it to one Kenny Ong, a Technical Support Officer with the Ministry, for the purpose of checking. Kenny Ong discovered that the quantities stipulated in P10 were erroneous. Upon this, Devaraj called a meeting with the appellant. At this meeting, the appellant gave Devaraj the impression that P10 had already been approved by Wong.
Nevertheless, Kenny Ong proceeded to revise P10, reducing the claim stipulated therein by the sum of $237,903.41. P10, as amended, was returned to Eng Tat, and Eng Tat accepted the same without any queries. Subsequently, a revised draft final BQ (P9) was prepared, which took into account the corrections that Kenny Ong had made.
As a result of the revisions made to P10 by Kenny Ong, Eng Tat had to refund the excess money (ie $237,903.41, less a 0.22% contractual variation) to the Ministry.
 THE DEFENCE
The defence advanced by the appellant below can be summarised as follows. 
(1) Firstly, he denied ever having been privy to Wong`s plan to cheat the Ministry. 
(2) Secondly, he claimed that the $100,000 paid to Wong was actually a loan advanced by Eng Tat. The loan was made because Wong had pestered the appellant for money. Thinking that Wong was suffering from cancer, the appellant took pity on him and consulted Eng Tat`s managing director, Lim Lek Kiang. Lim had then agreed to Eng Tat extending a loan to Wong. 
(3) The appellant also contended that the sums in P10 were not inflated pursuant to any conspiracy to cheat the Ministry. Rather, he said that the figures in P10 were only estimates, which the appellant arrived at after having relied on documents found in the office.
 THE FINDING BELOW
At the trial, Wong was the main prosecution witness. The prosecution also called several other witnesses, including Kenny Ong and Devaraj. The main witness for the defence was the appellant himself. After hearing the evidence, the judge rejected the appellant`s version of facts. The appellant was thus convicted and sentenced to 15 months` imprisonment.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant appealed against the conviction and the sentence. The prosecution, on the other hand, cross-appealed for the sentence to be enhanced.
 The appeal against conviction 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 SECTION 34 OF THE PENAL CODE: THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE APPELLANT BE PRESENT
 
Wong was convicted under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), which reads: 
 
Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
 
 
 
The appellant was also convicted under this same provision, but read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Section 34 reads: 
 
When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.
 
 
 
At this juncture, it is apt to provide a brief summary of the law relating to s 34 of the Penal Code. When a `criminal act` has been committed, the accomplices of the doer of the criminal act can still be held liable for that criminal act even if they did not harbour the specific intention to do that criminal act: see 
Wong Mimi v PP
 
 [1972-1974] SLR 73 
 
[1972] 2 MLJ 75
 ; 
PP v Neoh Bean Chye
 
 [1972-1974] SLR 213 
 
[1975] 1 MLJ 3
 . The elements needed to bring s 34 into play are as follows: 
(1) The parties sought to be held liable under s 34 must all have shared a common intention. 
(2) The criminal act that was perpetrated must have been `in furtherance` of that common intention: see 
Ong Chee Hoe v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 688
 . 
(3) All the parties sought to be held liable under s 34 must have in some way participated in the criminal act.
Before me, the principal argument raised by Mr Wee on behalf of the appellant was one of law. It was argued that the element of participation was not satisfied in the present case. The appellant had no part to play in Wong`s act of submitting the fraudulent 20th progress claim to Yeo Seow Eng.
Furthermore, Mr Wee argued that it was a requirement that he had to be 
 present 
 when Wong submitted the 20th progress claim to Yeo Seow Eng. The appellant was not present at Wong`s office when the progress claim was prepared, neither was he present when Wong submitted the claim to Yeo Seow Eng. As such, argued Mr Wee, s 34 could not come into play. In advancing such an argument, the appellant relied on the Singapore Court of Appeal decision in 
PP v Gerardine Andrew
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 736
 . In that case, the court held at [para ]34: 
 
Section 34 operates on the basis of joint liability and its essence lies in the doing of a criminal act which furthers the common intention of the participants. The participants are regarded by virtue of this joint liability as principals in the crime. In abetment on the other hand, the actual offence is committed by someone else other than the abettor. The very nature of s 34 demands a closer association with the actual commission of the offence, as compared to abetment where the person is punished for aiding or abetting the principal. There is therefore no requirement that an abettor must be present at the immediate scene of the crime in order for there to be liability for abetment. In our view, to hold that an accused can be liable under s 34 despite being absent when the commission of the offence occurred would render much of the abetment provisions in the Penal Code otiose. It cannot have been the intention for s 34 to take over the provisions of Ch V of the Penal Code which provides for the substantive offence of abetment. In our view, therefore, in order for an accused person to be liable under s 34, there must be a requirement 
 that he was physically present
 when the commission of the offence took place. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
However, the trial judge below and the prosecution relied on a passage from the Indian case of 
Jaikrishnadas Manohardas Desai v State of Bombay
 (Unreported) , which was expressly referred to in the 
 Gerardine 
 case. In 
 Jaikrishnadas 
, Shah J, delivering the judgment of the court, remarked at p 892: 
 
To establish joint responsibility for an offence, it must of course be established that a criminal act was done by several persons; the participation must be in doing the act, not merely in the planning ... But this participation need not be in all cases by physical presence. In offences involving physical violence, normally presence at the scene of offence of the offenders sought to be rendered liable on the principle of joint liability may be necessary, but such is not the case in respect of other offences where the offence consists of diverse acts, which may be done at different times and places ...
 
 
 
As it was rightly pointed out, the Court of Appeal in 
 Gerardine 
 did not expressly endorse the above statement of Shah J in 
 Jaikrishnadas 
. However, common sense dictates that the statement must be correct. To begin with, the court should, at the very outset, isolate what is the `criminal act` referred to by s 34, viz the offence which has been perpetrated, for which it is sought to make the other accomplices of the doer of that `criminal act` liable under s 34. Where the `criminal act` is a single act, eg when a death blow is dealt to the victim, the position is relatively simple: the murderer`s accomplices must at least have been present when the blow was dealt before they can be said to have participated in the act.
However, the word `act` is defined by s 33 of the Penal Code as including `a series of acts`. A good example of such an instance may be provided by the following example. Both X and Y come up with a scheme to cheat the victim, Z. X prepares a forged document and hands it to Y, and Y in turn presents this document to Z so as to cheat Z. The `criminal act` comprises two subsidiary acts: the preparation of the document by X (during which Y may be absent) and the presentation of the document by Y to Z (during which X may be absent). Both subsidiary acts are instrumental in the deception of Z. The argument in the appellant`s case was that the requirement of presence extended even to such criminal acts which are constituted by a series of subsidiary acts. However, such an argument begs the following important question: to which of the subsidiary acts constituting the criminal act should the requirement of `presence` be imposed? It seemed that the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant was that all the accomplices have to be in each others` company when 
 each 
 of the subsidiary acts is being performed. With respect, such a construction of s 34 is not only unwarranted, but it is also wholly contrary to good sense. To take the example just given, X has clearly participated in the fraudulent scheme, by preparing the fraudulent document. One cannot conceive of how the objective of s 34 would in any further way be advanced through the pedantic insistence that X, in order to be convicted under s 34, must also be present when Y presents the fraudulent document to Z.
It is of utmost importance to remember that the authorities all establish that the key element required for s 34 is 
 participation 
 by all the accomplices sought to be implicated. The requirement laid down in 
 Gerardine 
 (supra), to the effect that the accomplices must be present at the time of commission of the offence, stems from the fact that that there must be some form of participation by all the accomplices. This can be seen from the following question which the court in 
 Gerardine 
 posed to itself at [para ]24: 
 
The long line of authorities on this makes it clear that in order for an accused to be liable under s 34, he must have participated either actively or passively in the criminal act ... What constitutes participation in the criminal act for the purposes of s 34? Can there be participation in the criminal act notwithstanding the fact that an accused was not physically present when the act constituting the offence was committed?
 
 
 
Looking at 
 Gerardine 
 (supra) in context, it was in answer to the above question that the court held that the requirement of presence was necessary. However, in a case where the `criminal act` consists of a series of subsidiary acts which have been performed by several accomplices, the very fact that an accomplice has contributed to the `criminal act` by performing one of the subsidiary acts that constitutes the `criminal act` must surely constitute sufficient participation. This accomplice need not be present when the other subsidiary acts are being performed by the other accomplices. To demand that presence is necessary even in such a case would only serve to create a lot of unnecessary confusion.
Reverting to the facts of the present case, the task now was to isolate what the `criminal act` was, for the purpose of s 34. The judge below held: 
 
 
55 In the present case, there are diverse acts such as the proposal of Wong`s plan to the accused, the accused`s agreement to participate, the preparation of the 20th progress certificate, the presentation of the certificate and the subsequent payment of $220,000 into Eng Tat`s account. There is also no specific scene of crime as the acts took place at a number of places.
  
 
 
With respect, the trial judge`s application of s 34 was erroneous. The `criminal act` in the present case was the deception of Yeo Seow Eng into approving the progress payment of $220,000, this being the offence under s 420 of the Penal Code. The `criminal act` was completed when Yeo Seow Eng was deceived and the 20th progress payment was transferred to Eng Tat`s account. The acts of the appellant, which included paying off the $100,000 to Wong and submitting P10 to the Ministry almost two years later, were performed long after the `criminal act` had crystallised. The appellant`s acts could thus not be considered to be constituent parts of the `criminal act` as defined by s 34. This was not a situation where the `criminal act` consisted of a series of acts, with one of the accomplices doing some of the acts and the other accomplice doing the rest. This was a case where the `criminal act` was done solely by one person only, and that was Wong.
In this respect, the case of 
Edmund Nathan v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 782
 , cited by the prosecution, was quite distinguishable. In that case, the appellant solicitor clearly participated in the criminal act, as it was he who prepared the S & P document with the inflated sale price, which document had been instrumental in his client`s act of deceiving the bank. In the present case, the act of deceiving Yeo Seow Eng was executed wholly by Wong, without the appellant having any hand in it.
The end analysis in respect of s 34 was thus as follows: the appellant played no part in the execution of the `criminal act` (the criminal act being the preparation and tendering of the false progress claim and the consequent deception of Yeo Seow Eng). That act was done entirely by Wong. The appellant was not even present at the time of the preparation or submission of the false progress claim to Yeo Seow Eng. That being the case, it could not be said that the appellant `participated` in any way in Wong`s criminal act. The conviction under s 34 therefore could not be sustained.
 ABETMENT?
Nevertheless the judge below remarked: 
 
 
58 In passing, I note that even if s 34 is not applicable, the accused can be found guilty under an abetment charge.
  
 
 
Section 107 of the Penal Code reads: 
 
A person abets the doing of a thing who -
 
 
 
 
(a) instigates any person to do that thing; 
 
(b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or 
 
(c) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
In response to the judge`s comment, the following contention was raised in the appellant`s case: 
 
 
56 ... [Wong`s] proposal was for the Appellant to submit an inflated bill of quantity to him first, then PW1 would use the inflated bill of quantities as the basis of his approval for payment. The fact as it turned out is that the Appellant did not submit the bill of quantities to PW1 at all. It was after PW1 had ""gone on long leave"" that the Appellant submitted it to another officer nearly two years after the payment. This begs the question whether an act done so long after the commission of the principal offence can be said to be an act in abetment of that offence.
  
 
 
The appellant`s contention may well have been true, but only in so far as it related to abetment by aiding under s 107(c). After all, explanation 2 to s 107 reads: 
 
Whoever, either 
 prior to or at the time of
 the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to 
 aid
 the doing of that act. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
The act of abetment by aiding must thus be performed before or at the time of commission of the offence, and not after: see 
Varatharajalu v PP
 
 
[1960] MLJ 158
 . In the present case, the appellant`s very first overt act pursuant to Wong`s plan to cheat the Ministry was his handing of the $100,000 to Wong. This act occurred only 
 after 
 the Ministry had been cheated by Wong.
However, on the evidence and on the findings of fact by the judge below, this case quite clearly disclosed that there must have been at least an abetment by conspiracy on the appellant`s part. In 
NMMY Momin
 
[1971] Cr LJ 793
, the Supreme Court of India held at p 796: 
 
Criminal conspiracy postulates an agreement between two or more persons to do, or cause to be done, an illegal act or an act which is not illegal, by illegal means ...
 
 
 
Unlike criminal conspiracy under s 120A of the Penal Code, abetment by conspiracy requires some further act to be done pursuant to the conspiracy. (See also Explanation 5 to s 108 of the Penal Code.) According to Koh Clarkson and Morgan`s 
Criminal Law in Singapore and Malaysia
 
[1989] at pp 311
-312, the essential elements of abetment by conspiracy are: first, the person abetting must engage, with one or more other persons in a conspiracy; second, the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and third, an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that thing.
 
 
 
Following from the above passage, it is clear that two requirements would be needed in the present case before the appellant could be held liable for abetment by conspiracy under s 107(b). 
(1) There must have been an agreement between him and Wong to cheat Yeo Seow Eng. 
(2) Some further act had to have been done pursuant to that agreement.
As regards the first requirement, ie the question of whether there was an agreement, I have no doubt that such an agreement did exist. It would have been of no use to Wong to simply siphon the money from the Ministry to Eng Tat, unless there was an insider in Eng Tat assisting him. The insider would be needed to conceal the payment, as well as to hand Wong his share of the proceeds from the fraud. Thus, before 2 July 1996, which was the date when Wong deceived Yeo Seow Eng, it was highly likely that Wong had already entered into an agreement with someone from inside Eng Tat to commit the act of cheating. In this respect, the trial judge made an unequivocal finding of fact that that someone was the appellant. This finding was premised on the evidence of Wong, who testified that, prior to his act of deception on 2 July 1996, the appellant had agreed to assist him in his fraudulent plan. Wong testified that, after meeting the appellant at Aljunied, the latter agreed to help Wong by allowing Eng Tat to be used as a channel by which the $220,000 could be siphoned from the Ministry.
In this appeal, Mr Wee for the appellant argued that Wong`s testimony was unreliable for the following reason. In court, Wong said that he first came up with his plan to cheat the Ministry 
 after 
 seeing the document P9, which was the final BQ showing all the work that had been done by Eng Tat on the project. However, it was undisputed that P9 came into existence only around the middle of 1998. As explained above, P9 was an amended version of (and therefore could only have been produced after the preparation of) the inflated draft final BQ P10, which was in turn prepared in April or May 1998. This could not be reconciled with Wong`s evidence that his scheme to cheat the Ministry was hatched as early as sometime in April or May 1996.
Be that as it may, Wong explained in court that he was mistaken about P9. He thought that P9 had been prepared by him, when it was in fact prepared much later by somebody else. This explanation evidently found favour with the judge below, who held: 
 
 
42 Whilst Wong might have been mistaken about P9, his evidence on the material aspects remained constant. He gave clear evidence that he had a plan to obtain some money from the contract. There was also clear evidence from him that his plan would require the amounts in the BQ to be inflated. There was no change in his testimony that he told the [appellant] to adjust or inflate the BQ and submit it later to him and that in the meantime, he would arrange for the 20th progress payment certificate for the sum of $220,000 to be approved and to be credited into Eng Tat`s account.
  
 
 
The judge further held: 
 
 
44 The defence submitted that since Wong had lied on P9, that `must surely impinge upon his testimony on the alleged meeting in Macpherson Road.` In this regard, I exercised caution before deciding whether to accept his evidence. I gave careful consideration to his testimony. I noted he was not broken down on the material aspects of his evidence despite the lengthy cross-examination by the defence. I did not think that he was lying when he said that the accused had agreed to his plan and that pursuant to this agreement he was able to get Yeo`s approval to release $220,000 through the fictitious 20th progress payment.
  
 
 
The judge was amply justified in so holding, especially considering the fact that by the time of the trial, Wong had already been convicted and was serving time in prison. Wong had nothing to gain by lying. I therefore saw no reason to disturb the judge`s finding of fact.
In any case, the surrounding evidence also pointed to the appellant having been privy to an agreement with Wong to cheat the Ministry. In 
Er Joo Nguang v PP
 
 
[2000] 2 SLR 645
 , I remarked at [para ]35: 
 
So far as proof goes, conspiracy is generally a matter of inference, deduced from certain acts of the accused parties, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose in common between them. Both the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the parties 
 before and after
 the alleged commission of the crime will be useful in drawing an inference of conspiracy: see 
 Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 (supra). An inference of conspiracy would be justified only if it is inexorable and irresistible, and accounts for all the facts of the case. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
In the present case, it was not in dispute that after the $220,000 was credited to Eng Tat`s account, the appellant gave Wong $100,000 cash. In the court below, the appellant came up with the rather flimsy excuse that the money was a loan extended by Eng Tat to Wong. The following evidence was given by the appellant in his examination-in-chief: 
 
He continued to ask me for money ... I went to Lim [meaning Lim Lek Kiang, the Managing Director of Eng Tat]. I spoke to him. He told me the company had no money to give to him and it was also not company policy to give money ...
 
 
 
Subsequently I approached the Managing Director again. I told Lim, Wong had called again and asked for help ... Finally Lim said due to sympathy he could lend some money and he asked me to inform Wong he had to return the money when he was well, that it was company policy not to give money but it was a loan.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
As to why my company lent money to person whom I hardly knew, it not my decision to lend him the money and we believed he was asick [
 sic
] suffering from throat cancer, we had sympathy for him as the treatment was very expensive. Today I know I have been taken for a ride.
 
 
 
The story that the $100,000 was a loan was wholly unconvincing. Firstly, $100,000 is not a small sum. Yet, this `loan` was given without any record of the debt, and without any terms pertaining to interest, security or time for repayment.
Furthermore, as noted by the judge, there was no reason why Eng Tat would want to extend such a loan, given its financial state. At the relevant time, Eng Tat was running on overdraft for most of the month. The appellant even had to pump in $10,000 to Eng Tat to keep Eng Tat on its feet. In the course of cross-examination, however, the appellant changed his evidence, and said that the loan came not from Eng Tat but from Eng Tat`s Managing Director, Lim Lek Kiang. As might have been expected, Lim Lek Kiang was not called to cast light on the matter.
From the above, the irresistible conclusion must be that the $100,000 was not a `loan`, but rather Wong`s share of the booty that was obtained by the joint plan of both Wong and the appellant to cheat the Ministry.
Apart from the shady circumstances surrounding the alleged `loan`, there were also other factors pointing to the appellant having been privy to Wong`s fraudulent plan. Firstly, after the unsolicited sum of $220,000 was credited into Eng Tat`s account, the appellant did nothing to return the sum to the Ministry, but allowed Eng Tat to keep the money for over two years. Secondly, there is the fact that the appellant sought to tender a draft final BQ (ie P10) that had been inflated to the tune of $237,903.41. One could of course suggest that the similarity between this sum and the 20th progress payment of $220,000 that had been fraudulently procured by Wong was just a mere coincidence. But given the overall facts of this case, to advance such a suggestion would be naïve.
It was thus my view that the trial judge was justified in finding that prior to Wong`s act of deception on 2 July 1996, Wong had already entered into an agreement with the appellant to cheat the Ministry. The act done pursuant to that agreement was Wong`s submission of the fraudulent progress claim to Yeo Seow Eng. The elements of abetment by conspiracy were thus made out.
As such, this was an appropriate case for this court to exercise its powers of revision under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), and to substitute the conviction under s 34 with a conviction for abetment, by conspiracy, of Wong`s act of cheating. The punishment for abetment is found in s 109 of the Penal Code, which reads: 
 
Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
 
 
 
The power to effect such a substitution is conferred by s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which states: 
 
At the hearing of the appeal the court may ...
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
(b) in an appeal from a conviction ... 
 
(ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence ...
  
 
 
The nature of the power encapsulated by this provision was explained in the case of 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
  at 412: 
 
The scope of such power allows the court in appropriate cases, where it finds that the accused did not commit the offence with which he was charged but had committed an offence on which no charge has been preferred against him to alter the finding below and in consequence to substitute a conviction of the latter offence for that under appeal. In effecting this substitution the court is convicting the accused of an offence with which he has not been charged.
 
 
 
An objection raised by Mr Wee was that such a substitution should not be made in this appeal, as it would cause prejudice to the appellant. The offence of abetment by conspiracy, argued Mr Wee, was materially different from a charge involving s 34 of the Penal Code.
The issue of prejudice in cases such as the present was dealt with in 
Jimina Jacee d/o CD Athananasius v PP
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 205
 . In that case, I held (at 218) that prejudice will generally not arise if substitution of the conviction under one offence for a conviction under another will not affect the substance of the evidence given in the proceedings below, and if the defence advanced in the trial below, if believed, would be a complete answer to the offence as substituted.
In the present case, the appellant`s defence was that he was never party to Wong`s plan to cheat the government, and that there were explanations for his dubious acts subsequent to the payment of the $220,000 to Eng Tat`s account. If this defence were true, it would be a complete answer to a charge of abetment of Wong`s plan by conspiracy. However, the facts of this case showed quite clearly that the defence was unfounded. The trial judge made a clear finding of fact that prior to the submission of the fraudulent 20th progress claim, the appellant and Wong did enter into an agreement to cheat the Ministry. It was therefore my view that the appellant would suffer no prejudice from the proposed substitution.
To recapitulate, the charge under which the appellant was convicted read as follows (for ease of reference, the charge is organised into sections): 
 
You ... are charged that you, on or about the 2nd day of July 1996, in Singapore,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 together with Wong Seng Toong and in furtherance of the common intention of you both, cheated one Yeo Seow Eng, the Head of Sewerage Department, Ministry of the Environment, by deceiving the said Yeo Seow Eng 
 
 
  
 
 
into believing that the 20th Progress Payment Certificate for a sum of two hundred and twenty thousand dollars ($220,000) for the Replacement of Pumping Main for Penjuru Road Pumping Station project and certified by Wong Seng Toong was true and correct when in actual fact it was not so, and by such deceit
 
 
 
 
 
 
 you dishonestly induced the said Yeo Seow Eng 
 
 
  
 
 
to approve and deliver $220,000 to Eng Tat Engineering Pte Ltd, which amount would not have been delivered had he not been so deceived and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 420 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 
 
 
The first highlighted portion of the charge should be substituted with the following words: 
 
abetted Wong Seng Toong to commit cheating, in that you conspired with Wong Seng Toong to deceive one Yeo Seow Eng, the Head of the Sewerage Department, Ministry of the Environment
 
 
 
The second highlighted portion should be replaced with the following phrase: 
 
the said Yeo Seow Eng was induced
 
 
 
The reference to s 34 in the charge should also be substituted with a reference to s 109 instead.
 The appeal against sentence and the cross-appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant also appealed against the sentence, on the ground that 15 months` imprisonment was manifestly excessive. Mr Wee argued that the appellant did not gain personally from the fraudulent transaction, nor did the Ministry suffer any loss from it. Once the errors in P10 had been discovered, the excess payment was returned to the Ministry.
It was not in the least bit surprising that this argument garnered no sympathy for the appellant. The only reason why the appellant did not gain anything was quite simply because the scheme to cheat the Ministry did not go according to plan. Had Wong still been the project officer in charge in the Ministry, Wong would have approved P10, with the result that the overpayment of $220,000 would never have been discovered. The appellant would then be richer to the tune of over a hundred thousand dollars. The appeal against sentence was therefore dismissed.
With regards to the cross-appeal, it was contended by the prosecution that in cases where the accused person has cheated a government department or agency, the punishment had ordinarily been at least 18 months` imprisonment. I would, however, point out that the sentence imposed by the judge below was not to be interfered with merely because it was inadequate. It had to be 
 manifestly 
 inadequate before interference was justified. Bearing that in mind, it would serve no useful purpose to quibble over the difference between 15 months and 18 months. In any case, it should be noted that the protagonist who initiated the entire scam was Wong and not the appellant; the appellant got drawn into it only after Wong hatched his plan. Furthermore, the appellant was a first time offender.
Accordingly, the sentence was not disturbed.

: The plaintiffs are a partnership carrying on business as a law firm. The partners in the plaintiffs are David De Souza, Cedric Tay Yat Hock and Goh Kok Yeow. The defendants in Suit 858/2000 are the owners of The Straits Times (`TST`), the principal daily English newspaper in Singapore. The defendant in Suit 859/2000 is a journalist with TST.
In these actions, the plaintiffs claim damages from both defendants for libel in respect of the publication of an article (`the Article`) which appeared in the 27 September 2000 edition of TST. The plaintiffs assert that the words, together with the photographs and graphical representations (collectively called `the graphic`) of the Article are, in their natural and ordinary meaning, defamatory of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs also assert that the said material, when read in the light of an earlier article published in the 26 September 2000 edition of TST (`the 26 September article`), is also defamatory of the plaintiffs in their innuendo meaning.
On 4 December 2000, the plaintiffs filed separate applications in these actions under O 14 r 12 for the determination of: 
(1) the natural and ordinary meaning; and 
(2) the innuendo meaning,
of the words and the graphic of the Article.
The plaintiffs have pleaded in their statement of claim that the words and the graphic, in their natural and ordinary meaning and/or in their innuendo meaning, meant that: 
(1) the plaintiffs are participants and/or are directly or indirectly involved in the suspected illegal and/or fraudulent activity of Lernout & Hauspie and/or its co-founders and/or its licensees which activity is being investigated into by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission; and 
(2) the plaintiffs` conduct when contacted by the defendants prior to the publication of the words, the graphic illustration and the captioned photograph was evasive, thus lending further weight and credence to the above allegation.
The senior assistant registrar who heard the applications below disagreed with this and held that the 27 September article was not defamatory of the plaintiffs. Consequently, he ordered the plaintiffs` statement of claim in both actions to be struck out on the ground that there was no reasonable cause of action against the defendants in both actions and accordingly dismissed those actions.
Before me, the plaintiffs appealed against the whole of that decision.
 The 27 September article 
 
 
 
The subject matter of these actions was published in the `Money` section of the 27 September 2000 edition of TST, at p 88. The Article can be divided into two parts: (1) the words; and (2) the graphic. Together they cover 32%, or almost a third, of the entire page. The graphic appears at the top of the Article. It comprises a flow chart indicating transactions between a number of companies with accompanying words and a photograph that appears to be the name plate of the plaintiffs` office. The words of the Article comprise a headline in large bold print, a sub-headline in medium bold print and the text of the Article.
The principal subject of the Article is a Belgian company known as Lernout & Hauspie (`L&H`). The following self-explanatory description is found on its internet home page: 
 
Lernout & Hauspie is the world`s leading provider of speech and language technology products, solutions, and services to businesses and individuals worldwide. It is our mission to break down language barriers through advanced translation technology and to enable people to interact by voice-in any language-with the machines that empower them. Through such enhanced communication, we believe people will lead richer, more fulfilling lives.
 
 
 
The graphic itself has a headline and it proclaims `Belgian-Singapore Connection`. This is followed by a flowchart which indicates a circular flow of transactions between various entities inside four boxes. Beginning with the principal subject, the first box states as follows: 
 
Lernout & Hauspie (L&H)
 
 
 
Belgian maker of Speech recognition software.
 
 
 
Listed on Nasdaq. Asia-Pacific HQ in Singapore
 
 
 
An arrow emanates from this box towards the second box which states as follows: 
 
L&H co-founders Messrs Lernout & Hauspie
 
 
 
are among the investors who started FLV Fund.
 
 
 
A second arrow emanates from this box to the third box which says: 
 
FLV Fund
 
 
 
Listed in Brussels
 
 
 
A third arrow emanates from this box to the fourth box which states: 
 
15 Singapore registered companies
 
 
 
Accompanying this third arrow are the following words: 
 
Paid millions last year for stakes in some companies. Sold the stakes months later to a South Korean company.
 
 
 
These words would be understood to mean that FLV Fund had, in the previous year, paid the `millions` for stakes in the 15 Singapore-registered companies which it subsequently sold to a South Korean company.
From the fourth box, a fourth arrow emanates towards the first box with the following words next to it: 
 
Pays US$57 million, boosting L&H`s Singapore revenue from US$29,000 in 1998 to US$80.3 m last year.
 
 
 
These words would be understood as asserting that the 15 companies had paid out US$57m in total to L&H, causing its revenue to rise from US$29,000 to US$80.3m the previous year.
There is a fifth arrow emanating from the first box towards the fourth box and this is accompanied by the words: `Sells software rights`. This would be understood to mean that the software rights were sold by L&H to those 15 companies in consideration for the US$57m.
At the bottom of the fourth box relating to the 15 companies are the following words: `Common address in law firm De Souza Tay & Goh in Shenton Way`. Underneath those words is the photograph of what appears to be the name plate of the plaintiffs` office.
Finally, at the bottom left corner of the graphic are the following words in bold print: 
 
FLV FUND`S INVOLVEMENT IN THE SINGAPORE COMPANIES RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT L&H`S FAST SALES GROWTH MAY NOT BE ALL THAT IT APPEARS - Asian Wall Street Journal
 
 
 
This would be understood to be a quote from the Asian Wall Street Journal.
Below the graphic is the headline of the Article which states, in large bold print: `L&H licensees: Two sat on 678 boards`.
And below that is a sub-headline in smaller bold print which states: 
 
They were directors for just a couple of weeks in many instances; the figures are high but legal, says lawyer
 
 
 
Below all that, the text of the Article appears. I reproduce it in full below (with paragraph numbers added for ease of reference): 
 
 
1 Two of the shareholders of Lernout & Hauspie`s (L&H`s) licensees here have been directors of a total of some 670 companies in the past few years, according to official records. 
 
2 The pair are Messrs Soh Leng Woon and Lee Li Ching, according to a check with the Registry of Companies and Businesses yesterday. 
 
3 Going by their identification numbers, both are in their mid-30s. 
 
4 They are listed as shareholders of at least three L&H licensees in Singapore: I-Mail, I-News and I-Office. 
 
5 These companies are among the 15 sharing a single address in Shenton Way, which L&H said paid it US$57 million (S$100 million) last year for rights to L&H`s speech-recognition software. 
 
6 They and another four also relatively unknown companies helped propel L&H`s revenue from Singapore to US$80.3 million last year from a mere US$29,000 the year before, making the Republic the Nasdaq-listed company`s biggest customer. 
 
7 L&H said it had experienced a jump in revenue from Asia. But a cloud has been cast over this with the launch of a probe into the recent surge in its Asia sales by the US` Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
8 The Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) had reported the investigation which has since been confirmed. 
 
9 It had also said that some of these Singapore companies had in fact received millions in investments from a venture-capital fund set up by the two L&H co-founders. 
 
10 In Singapore, L&H Asia-Pacific president Louis Woo, when asked about what the 19 companies registered here did or who owned or managed them, told The Straits Times: ""I`m not familiar with the shareholders of these companies."" 
 
11 Official records show that Messrs Soh Leng Woon and Lee Li Ching have been directors briefly - a couple of weeks in many instances - of over 500 and 178 companies respectively. 
 
12 A lawyer said these are high figures but legal. 
 
13 ""So long as the law allows, why can`t a citizen lend his name for a fee? But he is liable should anything go wrong in the company,"" he said. 
 
14 It is not uncommon for people to be appointed directors to form companies and then replaced when long-term shareholders are found. 
 
15 Many of the 678 firms are not listed in the telephone directory, and some could be shell companies. 
 
16 Details on the 15 Singapore licensees of L&H`s software are hard to come by. What is known is that they have a common registered address in a law firm at UIC Building in Shenton Way. 
 
17 Ms Tan Lee Chin who works in the law firm, is listed as their secretary and director but she declined to comment when contacted by The Straits Times. 
 
18 Attempts to reach the partners of the law firm, De Souza Tay & Goh, were unsuccessful. 
 
19 Other lawyers said it was common for companies to use law firms or accountancy firms as their registered addresses. 
 
20 Explained one: ""It`s a matter of convenience. They may not be active here and they appoint the law firm`s lawyers as company secretaries and sleeping directors. The address is for the purpose of official correspondence and public notices."" 
 
21 L&H has declined to say where the 15 licensee companies operate. 
 
22 An AWSJ report quoted a L&H spokesman in Belgium saying they have operations ""in Belgium and other parts of the world"". 
 
23 But he could not provide exact addresses for the operations of any of the companies, said the journal. 
 
24 He also said that the journal`s report had raised doubts unfairly about whether the start-up companies had real operations. [Paragraphs are numbered for ease of reference.]
  
 
 
At the last page of that edition of TST there is a reference to the Article (`the blurb`). It occupies a small central block at the top of the page. It is placed there to attract the reader`s attention to the Article and direct him to the relevant page. The blurb comprises (1) a colour photograph of what appears to be the entrance to the plaintiffs` office showing their name plate; and (2) a caption which reads as follows:

 NATURAL AND ORDINARY MEANING OF THE ARTICLE
 
The plaintiffs pleaded that the words and the graphic of the Article have the same meaning in their natural and ordinary meaning and innuendo meaning. I first consider the natural and ordinary meaning of the Article. In 
Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 529
 , the Court of Appeal stated that the general principles pertaining to the determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of words in a defamation action were well established. The court summarised these principles as follows (at [para ]53 and 54): 
 
 
53 The principles applicable in determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of in a defamation action are well-established. The court decides what meaning the words would have conveyed to an ordinary, reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense: 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong
 
 [1984-1985] SLR 516 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 334
  and 
 Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew 
, supra. The test is an objective one: it is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by an ordinary, reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. The meaning intended by the maker of the defamatory statement is irrelevant. Similarly, the sense in which the words were actually understood by the party alleged to have been defamed is also irrelevant. Nor is extrinsic evidence admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the context of the entire passage in which they are set out. The court is not confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words, but takes into account what the ordinary, reasonable person may reasonably infer from the words. The ordinary, reasonable person reads between the lines. This court in the latter case said at pp 318-319: 
 
`In determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of, the sense or meaning intended by the appellant is irrelevant. Nor for such purpose is the sense or meaning in which the words were understood by the respondent relevant. Nor is extrinsic evidence admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the context of the entire speech made by the appellant on that occasion. It is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by reasonable members of the audience at the Bedok car park on that evening using their general knowledge and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of the words, but includes any references or implications which could reasonably be drawn by such persons ...` 
 
54 Lord Reid said in the oft-cited case of 
Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1964] AC 234
 at p 258: 
 
`What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also part of their natural and ordinary meaning. Here there would be nothing libellous in saying that an inquiry into the appellants` affairs was proceeding: the inquiry might be by a statistician or other expert. The sting is in inferences drawn from the fact that it is the fraud squad which is making the inquiry. What those inferences should be is ultimately a question for the jury, but the trial judge has an important duty to perform ...`
  
 
 
This passage has time and again been approved by our courts and also by this court: see 
Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and another action
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 337
  at p 346. In that case, this court also held that, in considering the inferences to be drawn, it is relevant to bear in mind the observations made by the English Court of Appeal in 
Skuse v Granada Television Ltd
 
[1996] EMLR 278
 at p 285:
 
 
 
`...
 
 
 
 
(2) The hypothetical reasonable reader [or viewer] is not naïve but he is not unduly suspicious. He can read between the lines. He can read in an implication more readily than a lawyer, and may indulge in a certain amount of loose thinking. But he must be treated as being a man who is not avid for scandal and someone who does not, and should not, select one bad meaning where other non-defamatory meanings are available.
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
(3) While limiting its attention to what the defendant has actually said or written, the court should be cautious of an over-elaborate analysis of the material in issue. We were reminded of Diplock LJ`s cautionary words in 
Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1968] 2 QB 157
 at p 171: ""... In the present case, we must remind ourselves that this was a factual programme, likely to appeal primarily to a seriously minded section of television viewers, but it was a programme which, even if watched continuously, would have been seen only once by viewers, many of whom may have switched on for entertainment. Its audience would not have given it the analytical attention of a lawyer to the meaning of a document, an auditor to the interpretation of accounts, or an academic to the content of a learned article. In deciding what impression the material complained of would have been likely to have on the hypothetical reasonable viewer we are entitled (if not bound) to have regard to the impression it made on us.""`
  
 
 
From the foregoing the following general principles for determining the natural and ordinary meaning of words in a defamation action may be distilled: 
(1) It is an objective test involving the determination of the meaning that would be conveyed by the words to an ordinary, reasonable person: 
(a) using his general knowledge and common sense; 
(b) who is not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. 
(2) The following considerations are irrelevant: 
(a) the meaning intended by the maker of the statement; and 
(b) the sense in which the words were understood by the plaintiff. 
(3) Extrinsic evidence is not admissible in construing the meaning of the words. 
(4) The nature of the audience is to be taken into account.
There are of course specific principles formulated for various circumstances that have arisen in the authorities and these will be considered in the analysis below.
In the Article, the direct references to the plaintiffs are as follows: 
(i) Three statements, one in the graphic and two at paras 5 and 16 of the text (read with paras 17 and 18), that the 15 Singapore-registered companies involved in the matter have a common address in the plaintiffs` premises at Shenton Way. 
(ii) One of the plaintiffs` employees, Ms Tan Lee Chin, is the secretary and director of the 15 companies. She declined to comment when contacted by TST (para 17). 
(iii) Attempts by TST to reach the partners of the plaintiffs were unsuccessful (para 18).
As for the blurb, there is no reference to the plaintiffs in the caption, but the photograph shows the name plate of the firm. However, the combination of the size and font of the letters and the lack of contrast in the photograph, the name is not easily made out at a glance.
The literal meaning of the direct references to the plaintiffs in the Article are clearly not defamatory. Neither is it the plaintiffs` case that they are. Instead, they rely on the inferences that may be drawn from the words and graphic of the Article. The plaintiffs agree with the defendants that the main focus of the Article is the investigation mounted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (`the SEC`) into the suspected criminal activities of L&H and their licensees. However, the plaintiffs argue that the effect of the Article is to suggest an insidious link or connection between the plaintiffs and such criminal activities and in the process they were `
 tarred by the same brush 
`.
It is therefore necessary to first consider what this brush has tarred in respect of the villain of the piece, L&H. The bold headline is the first thing that catches one`s attention. It states `L&H licensees: Two sat on 678 boards`. From there one would either glance at the graphic immediately above it, or the sub-headline below it. The message conveyed by the graphic and the sub-headline is that L&H had channelled their funds, via an incestuous network of companies, back to themselves disguised as sales of their software. In this manner, L&H had fraudulently boosted their revenue from such sales in a single year from a minuscule US$29,000 to US$80.3m. Proceeding to the text, paras 1 to 6 describe how two of the shareholders of three of L&H`s licensees in Singapore had been directors of some 670 companies in the past few years. Those three licensees shared the same `address` in Shenton Way as 15 other companies that had paid L&H US$57m in 1999 for their software. Together with four other obscure companies, they accounted for the US$80.3m revenue that L&H reported receiving in that year. Paragraphs 7 and 8 state that the SEC had launched a probe into this surge in sales and therefore `
 a cloud has been cast 
` over the matter. The remaining paragraphs provide further details of the story, alternatively highlighting the unusual nature of the arrangement and quoting from lawyers who said that such arrangements were not unusual.
The first question is whether the Article is defamatory of L&H. A statement that a person is under investigation by an enforcement agency is not capable of meaning that such person is guilty of the crime being investigated, but it may bear the defamatory meaning that the person is under suspicion or that there are reasonable grounds for suspicion: 
Lewis v Daily Telegraph
 
[1964] AC 234
[1963] 2 All ER 151
. In the present case, there is a reference to a probe by the SEC which is described as casting a cloud over the jump in revenue. Added to this is the emphasis in the Article on the fact that two individuals had acted as directors of 678 companies, many of which appear to be shell companies. These two individuals are in turn linked to 15 companies with the same `address` which had paid L&H US$57m for software licences. I would conclude that the Article would be interpreted by the ordinary, reasonable reader to mean that L&H had used these companies to manipulate financial transactions to create the impression that they had achieved a high sales turnover in 1999 and were therefore guilty of fraudulent conduct. At the very least, the Article is defamatory of L&H in that it means that there are reasonable grounds for suspicion that they are guilty of fraud.
I next have to determine whether there is anything in the Article that would reasonably suggest that the plaintiffs had anything to do with such fraudulent practices. The plaintiffs argue that the link is in the mention that the 15 Singapore licensees have a `
 common address 
` in the plaintiffs` office. Further, the Article mentioned that one of the plaintiffs` employees, Ms Tan Lee Chin who was the secretary and director of the 15 companies, had declined to comment when contacted by TST and that attempts to reach the partners of the firm were unsuccessful. These give the impression that the plaintiffs were being evasive and deliberately avoided contact, thereby indicating they had something to hide. Counsel for the plaintiffs then stated that the reports of evasiveness were not true and he gave reasons for saying that. However, as this has absolutely no relevance in respect of the determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the Article I need not deal with those reasons. Additionally, the plaintiffs contend that the photograph in the blurb at the back page further links the plaintiffs to the allegations against L&H.
The defendants submit firstly that the Article did not contain anything that was defamatory of the plaintiffs. They submit that even if there were parts of the Article that could singly or collectively cast the plaintiffs in a bad light, the bane in those parts were neutralised by the antidote in other parts. In particular the defendants point out that in paras 12, 13 and 14, some lawyers were quoted who said that the holding of a large number of directorships was legal and a common practice. Also in paras 19 and 20 other lawyers were quoted as saying that it was common for companies to use law firms or accountancy firms as their registered addresses as a matter of convenience.
In my opinion the natural and ordinary meaning of the Article is not any of the two meanings pleaded in the statement of claim. Neither does it contain any lesser defamatory meaning. In coming to this conclusion, I have borne in mind the principles summarised by the Court of Appeal in 
 Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings 
 (supra). While I have arrived at this determination from reading the Article as a whole, the following points were relevant: 
(1) a reasonable reader would not think that there is anything wrong with a law firm permitting its address to be used as the registered office of a large number of companies; 
(2) this is especially so in the light of the remarks quoted from lawyers that such a practice was legal and that it was commonly done; 
(3) a reasonable person would not associate the law firm with the operations of the companies; 
(4) the reference to the plaintiffs` employee, Ms Tan Lay Chin, being the secretary and director of 15 of the companies and declining to comment when contacted by TST does not necessarily mean that she was being evasive. In the context of the Article, especially the statement of the lawyer at para 14 of the Article (that interim directors are often appointed), a reasonable person would not infer any connection between Ms Tan, who is merely described as an employee, and the nefarious activities of those companies; 
(5) similarly, in respect of para 18 of the Article, the fact that TST had made unsuccessful attempts to reach the partners of the firm need not necessarily have a defamatory meaning and in the context of the Article cannot reasonably be construed to have such a meaning. If the partners had been reached but declined comment, that could have given a different picture. But it would not be reasonable for a reader to infer that the partners had been evasive merely because TST had not been successful in contacting them.
 INNUENDO MEANING OF THE ARTICLE
The plaintiffs next rely on innuendo (or `true` or `legal` innuendo). The basis for this is an article published the previous day (`the 26 September article`), of which the Article is a follow-up. The 26 September article is found at p 70 of that edition and states as follows (with paragraph numbers added): 
 
US regulator`s probe may lead to Singapore
 
 
 
15 companies sharing a local address pay $100m to Belgian firm, whose surge in Asian sales sparks scrutiny
 
 
 
 
1 A BELGIAN software company, Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products (L&H), was paid a whopping US$57 million (S$100 million) by 15 companies whose official address is a law firm in Shenton Way. 
 
2 This sum totalled nearly 17 per cent of the global revenues of the speech-recognition software company. 
 
3 It was payment for licensing rights to its software, says L&H. 
 
4 In fact, revenue from Singapore and other parts of Asia boosted the company`s sales - which grew more than 60 per cent last year. 
 
5 Singapore, in particular, saw turnover jumping from a lowly US$29,000 the year before to US$80.3 million, making the Republic the company`s biggest customer. 
 
6 However, the figures have drawn the attention of US regulators. 
 
7 The Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) has reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking into the recent surge in Nasdaq-listed L&H`s South-east Asian sales. 
 
8 Yesterday, the business daily said nearly all of L&H`s revenue in Singapore came from the 15 companies and another four with a common address in Geylang. 
 
9 The paper`s latest report is a follow-up to its earlier disclosures about L&H, a global leader in speech and linguistic technologies with its Asia-Pacific headquarters at the International Business Park in Jurong East. 
 
10 Responding to the AWSJ article, L&H Asia-Pacific president Louis Woo told The Straits Times that the 15 companies did pay the US$57 million to the company. 
 
11 However, he declined to provide details about them. 
 
12 ""You should talk to them about it. As far as we are concerned, they are our customers,"" said Dr Woo. 
 
13 The documents filed with the Registry of Companies named a Ms Tan Lee Chin at the Shenton Way law firm as their secretary and director. 
 
14 She was not available for an interview. 
 
15 And when reached by telephone yesterday, she would say only, ""I have nothing to say."" 
 
16 The partners of the law firm were not available for comment. 
 
17 The other officer of the companies is a Belgian national with a Belgium address. 
 
18 AWSJ said nearly all the 19 companies were launched last year. 
 
19 Eight of them had financial ties to a Belgian venture-capital fund that was linked closely to L&H. 
 
20 The FLV Fund, which was set up by a group of investors including Messrs Lernout and Hauspie, last year paid millions for 49 per cent stakes in some of the Singapore companies. 
 
21 Said the AWSJ: ""FLV Fund`s involvement in the Singapore companies raises the possibility that L&H`s fast sales growth may not be all that it appears."" 
 
22 Dr Woo told The Straits Times he reserved comment on the article as the SEC probe was in progress. 
 
23 But he insisted: ""The bottom line is that the fundamentals of L&H are there and we are doing the right things."" 
 
24 Also, the company had commissioned an independent audit of its worldwide operations and this would be completed soon. 
 
25 ""I believe we will be vindicated,"" he said. 
 
26 L&H chief executive Gaston Bastiaens has resigned. 
 
27 In Belgium, new chief executive John Duerden said last week that L&H would cooperate fully with the SEC in its probe. 
 
28 Meanwhile, Reuters reported yesterday that shares in the FLV Fund fell sharply on the Brussels-based Easdaq market amid concern about the fund`s exposure to L&H. 
 
29 The fund, which said 31 of its 52 portfolio companies made use of L&H technology, plummeted 57 per cent to an all-time low of US$5.25 before recovering slightly to US$8.40. 
 
30 It released a statement yesterday, saying that the ""commotion"" caused by a story in the Europe edition of the Wall Street Journal had not affected the value of its portfolio or the operations of the fund. 
 
31 L&H itself was 9.06 per cent lower at a mid-price US$14.18 on Easdaq.
  
 
 
Apart from paras 14 to 16, there is substantively no additional information in the 26 September article. If it is also defamatory of L&H, it does not add much to the damage done by the Article published the following day. Paragraph 14 states that Ms Tan (named in the previous paragraph as the secretary and director of the 15 companies) was not available for an interview. Paragraph 15 goes on to say that when reached by telephone, she said that she had nothing to say. Paragraph 16 states that the partners of the law firm were not available for comment. However, the same information is repeated in the Article, the only significant difference being that the 26 September article quoted Ms Tan as saying `
 I have nothing to say 
`.
Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that such a statement in the circumstances raises the inference that Ms Tan had something to hide in respect of the 15 companies. Counsel further submitted that the statement in para 16 that the partners of the law firm were not available for comment implies that they were evasive about the matter. A person who had read the 26 September article would therefore have this background information and upon reading the Article the following day, which identifies the plaintiffs as the law firm in question, would form the view that they were involved, directly or indirectly in the matter.
I agree that the statement in para 15 quoting Ms Tan as saying that she had nothing to say, read in conjunction with para 16 that the partners of the firm were not available for comment, does in the context of the 26 September article, raise an inference that Ms Tan and the partners had something to hide. However, as I have described above, the Article contained quotes from lawyers who had stated that it was common for people to be appointed directors of a large number of companies and to act as interim directors. The Article had also said that it was common, and a matter of convenience, for companies to use law firms or accountancy firms as their registered office. The Article stated that a lawyer explained that such addresses are for the purpose of official correspondence and public notices.
In 
Charleston v News Group Newspapers
 
[1995] 2 AC 65
[1995] 2 All ER 313
, the House of Lords held that where a publication is not defamatory if considered as a whole, the plaintiff cannot succeed (
[1995] 2 AC 65
 at 69; [1995] 2 All ER 313 at 315-316): 
 
... on the ground that some readers will have read part only of the published matter and that this part, considered in isolation, is capable of bearing a defamatory meaning.
 
 
 
In arriving at this conclusion, Lord Bridge of Harwich said (
[1995] 2 AC 65
 at 70-71; [1995] 2 All ER 313 at 316-317) that there was: 
 
... a long and unbroken line of authority the effect of which is accurately summarised in 
 Duncan & Neill on Defamation
, 2nd ed. (1983), p. 13, para. 4.11 as follows:
 
 
 
`In order to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of the words of which the plaintiff complains it is necessary to take into account the context in which the words were used and the mode of publication. Thus a plaintiff cannot select an isolated passage in an article and complain of that alone if other parts of the article throw a different light on that passage.`
 
 
 
The locus classicus is a passage from the judgment of Alderson B. in 
Chalmers v. Payne
 (Unreported) , who said:
 
 
 
`But the question here is, whether the matter be slanderous or not, which is a question for the jury; who are to take the whole together, and say whether the result of the whole is calculated to injure the plaintiff`s character. In one part of this publication, something disreputable to the plaintiff is stated, but that is removed by the conclusion; the bane and antidote must be taken together.`
 
 
 
This passage has been so often quoted that it has become almost conventional jargon among libel lawyers to speak of the bane and the antidote. It is often a debatable question which the jury must resolve whether the antidote is effective to neutralise the bane and in determining this question the jury may certainly consider the mode of publication and the relative prominence given to different parts of it. I can well envisage also that questions might arise in some circumstances as to whether different items of published material relating to the same subject matter were sufficiently closely connected as to be regarded as a single publication. But no such questions arise in the instant case ...
 
 
 
Thus it is necessary to examine the Article as a whole and in the context in which the words were used. If there is anything in a part of it that is, of itself, defamatory of the plaintiffs, one must consider whether there is anything elsewhere that would put the Article in such a perspective that a reasonable reader would not reach the conclusion that it is defamatory of them. In the present case I have to consider the Article in its entirety, together with the information available to the person who has also read the 26 September article. Considering the matter from that perspective, I conclude that the antidote in the Article would clearly remove any bane carried by the innuendo in the 26 September article.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In conclusion, I would hold that both the natural and ordinary meaning of the Article and its innuendo meaning based on the 26 September article are not defamatory of the plaintiffs. Accordingly their appeals are dismissed. I will hear counsel on the question of costs.

Purpose of s 6(b) Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed)
 
: Before me, this appeal was adjourned no less than four times. It was originally scheduled for hearing on 9 January this year. On that occasion, I was informed that the appellant was unable to attend due to medical reasons. I was told that the appellant had recently undergone a triple heart-bypass operation. I adjourned the hearing till March. On 13 March, I was again informed that the appellant was unable to attend court. He was hospitalised and a medical certificate was tendered in his absence. I therefore allowed counsel`s application for a further adjournment.
Finally, when this appeal was fixed for hearing on 26 June, I decided not to adjourn the hearing any longer without first having an opportunity to see the appellant himself. When counsel again asked for another adjournment with a medical certificate in support, I declined, and informed counsel I wished to see the appellant appear in court the very same afternoon. I also refused counsel`s application to withdraw the appeal, for the very simple reason that I did not think it appropriate to do so in the absence of this appellant.
The appellant did not appear, despite his counsel`s numerous attempts to locate him. In this instance, I revoked bail and issued a warrant of arrest for him. On 27 June, I saw counsel and the deputy public prosecutor (`DPP`) again, who informed me that the appellant was still at large, but the police and officers from the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (`CPIB`) were working on this matter. I reiterated my position that I would not be granting leave to withdraw the appeal. In the meantime, I adjourned the appeal until such time as the appellant was arrested.
On 9 July, the appellant turned himself in at Mr Edmond Pereira`s office, and asked Mr Pereira to represent him in this appeal and take over the case from Mr Subhas Anandan, who had been representing him previously. Mr Pereira subsequently informed the police of the appellant`s presence, and he was arrested at Mr Pereira`s office.
On 10 July, I granted Mr Subhas`s application to be discharged, and Mr Pereira`s corresponding request that he be the appellant`s counsel on record. I also heard the appellant`s appeal against sentence. After giving this matter considerable thought, I dismissed the appeal, but enhanced the appellant`s sentence to 48 months, together with a fine of $100,000 in default another 24 months. I now give my reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The appellant was convicted by District Judge Jasvender Kaur of one charge of bribing one Lim Poh Tee (`Lim`), then Acting Inspector of the Violent Crime Squad at the Jurong Police Division Headquarters, under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed) (`PCA`), to provide assistance and insider information relating to arrests arising from his illegal moneylending activities. Lim was convicted in the same trial of a corresponding corruption charge of providing the appellant with such assistance and information relating to such illegal activities.
I heard Lim`s appeal against sentence in the early part of the year and dismissed it. The facts culminating in the appellant`s arrest, charge and conviction of his offence were substantially similar to those which I set out in my grounds of judgment dismissing Lim`s appeal (see 
Lim Poh Tee v PP
 
 
[2001] 1 SLR 674
 ), which allows me the luxury of not regurgitating the facts again in this appeal.
It is no secret that the appellant is the now infamous `Ah Long San`, a well-known illegal moneylender operating from the vicinity of Geylang. By his own admission, he started his business from as early as 1980, and it soon spread island-wide. Throughout the years, the appellant charged interest varying from 5% to 20%. In 1990, the appellant claimed he gave up illegal moneylending to become a legitimate businessman. At present, he owns a karaoke lounge and a coffeeshop.
According to him, the reason for giving up this lucrative, though illegal, business was that the law was catching up on him. He had been fined on several occasions for being an illegal moneylender and no longer wished to pursue the business for fear of being arrested and imprisoned.
In her judgment, the district judge doubted if the appellant had ever given up his illegal moneylending business. Right up to the late 1990s, it was common knowledge that a loan shark by the nickname Ah Long San operated island-wide. In fact, the police knew of Ah Long San and his activities, and had been keeping a close watch on him.
It is convenient at this juncture to briefly recall the appellant`s conviction. The appellant and Lim frequented the Lido Palace Nite Club (`Lido Palace`) on several occasions since 1996. These visits were always at the expense of the appellant. In return, Lim not only tampered with the administration of the criminal justice system by abusing his authority to release one Lee Hwee Leong (`Lee`), suspected of working for the appellant in his illegal moneylending business, from custody but also recruited junior police officers to provide him with information on loan shark cases with the intention of passing on such information to the appellant so as to allow the latter and those under him to evade the clutches of the law. The appellant subsequently footed their entertainment bills when these junior officers frequented Lido Palace. By doing so, the appellant insidiously cloaked the entertainment provided in a veil of normalcy and acceptability, shrouding his ulterior motive under the fa+ade of being a generous man.
The district judge convicted the appellant and Lim in a joint trial as follows (at [para ]232 of her grounds of decision): 
 
I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that both [the appellant and Lim] knew each other by late 1996 at the latest; that [Lim] got himself involved in Lee`s case because he had been asked by [the appellant] to help out; that [Lim] invited [other junior officers] to Lido Palace after Lee`s case; that he introduced [the same junior officers] to [the appellant] and intentionally made it known to him that they were investigating moneylending cases at Jurong; that [the appellant] provided free entertainment to [Lim] to make him beholden to him with the corrupt intention of seeking his assistance in the event he required his help in his moneylending activities; and that [Lim] thereafter requested [the same junior officers] to forward him information on loan shark cases reported at the station to pass to [the appellant] to enable him to alert his runners to escape conviction. I therefore found that the entertainment was given and accepted corruptly.
 
 
 
For his offence, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months. He appealed against his sentence.
 Appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
Counsel`s arguments were straightforward. He contended that the imposition of a custodial sentence of 18 months upon the appellant`s conviction of a single charge under the PCA was manifestly excessive. Comparing like cases, he argued that, given the relatively small amount of the gratification, in the form of paid entertainment by the appellant for Lim and his fellow police officers, the sentence meted out was highly disproportionate. Similar cases drew more lenient sentences, and there were no special reasons why the present case warranted a heavier punishment: 
PP v Tan Liang Ann
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 893
  and 
Tang Keng Boon v PP
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 535
 .
Particularly, counsel drew my attention to two cases. The first was 
Meeran bin Mydin v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 522
 . In this case, the accused pleaded guilty to two charges of corruption for bribing an immigration officer to assist him in obtaining social visit passes for various Indonesian nationals to enter Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint. On each of the charges, he was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment. I heard his appeal and dismissed it. Equally, in 
Lim Sze Leng v PP
 (Unreported) , the accused was sentenced to 15 months` imprisonment on each of his three charges for bribing officers at the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre to smuggle tobacco into the centre.
In his reply, the DPP urged me to disregard the cases relied upon by counsel because of the extreme gravity of the appellant`s offence, and the public interest involved. There were several aggravating factors pertaining to the appellant which were also absent in those cases cited.
I accepted the grave issue of public interest at stake in the present case. Eradicating corruption in our society is of primary concern, and has been so for many years. This concern becomes all the more urgent where public servants are involved, whose very core duties are to ensure the smooth administration and functioning of this country. Dependent as we are upon the confidence in those running the administration, any loss of such confidence through corruption becomes dangerous to its existence and inevitably leads to the corrosion of those forces, in the present case the police force, which sustain democratic institutions. I highlighted this in 
 Meeran bin Mydin v PP 
 (supra), approving the words of the trial judge in that case (at [para ]18): 
 
Acts of corruption must be effectively and decisively dealt with. Otherwise the very foundation of our country will be seriously undermined.
 
 
 
In 1960, this very same position was emphasised by the then Minister for Home Affairs when the PCA was presented before Parliament for its second reading: 
 
The Prevention of Corruption Bill is in keeping with the new Government determination to stamp out bribery and corruption in the country, especially in the public service. 
 The Government is deeply conscious that a Government cannot survive, no matter how good its aims and intentions are, if corruption exists within its ranks and its public service on which it depends to provide the efficient and effective administrative machinery to translate its policies into action.
[Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
Over the years, whilst we have had considerable success in keeping mainstream corruption in check, there are still instances of corruption which seep through our system. On my part, I have sought to deter corruption through harsher punishment for lawbreakers in this area, but success has not been total, and the judiciary still hears a steady stream of such cases. In many instances, the cases involve reprehensible public servants, contrary to their responsibility of acting as instruments preserving the efficiency, peace and stability of this nation. This not only erodes the confidence of the general public in their duty of service, but also reflects poorly on those public servants who stick by the law. Specifically for police officers, their role as guardians of our streets, our crime-fighters, to police our society becomes a ridicule.
In dismissing the previous appeal by Lim, who was a very senior police officer, I drew attention to the severity of his offence of accepting the appellant`s gratification (supra at [para ]31): 
 
As was correctly observed by the district judge, it was highly reprehensible that Lim intentionally drew two junior officers into the web of corruption and in that way rendered more police officers beholden to [the appellant`s] corrupt gratification. Not content with personally betraying the trust reposed upon him, he sought to similarly corrupt other junior officers who would have looked up to him as a role model and for guidance. He was after all a senior officer and a key appointment holder at Jurong Police Division Headquarters with subordinate officers under his command. By insidiously cloaking the entertainment in a veil of normalcy and acceptability, Lim was effectively recruiting a cadre of police officers who would be similarly beholden to [the appellant]. He further instigated the junior officers to act contrary to their duties and to assist [the appellant] and his associates to evade criminal liability. His conduct showed that he was prepared, not merely to make enquiries into investigations on [the appellant`s] behalf, but to actively interfere in the course of police investigations and to subvert the due administration of the criminal justice system. I further noted that Lim had demonstrated absolutely no remorse for his conduct and had cast spurious and unsubstantiated allegations against various law enforcement officers in the course of his defence. Lastly, Lim had a prior conviction for a wholly unrelated offence of corruption.
 
 
 
In my judgment dismissing Lim`s appeal, I endorsed the general principle that in most cases the giver of gratification bears equal culpability to that of the receiver. Sentences meted out should therefore be similar in terms. There are cases where a giver will not warrant a similar punishment as that of the receiver, such as when a giver was under compulsion or some form of pressure to give. In that situation, it is reasonable to punish the receiver more harshly than the giver. Conversely, there are instances where a giver bears equal, if not more, culpability than the receiver, and this is when the giver intends to corrupt the establishment of law and order for his private gain, and/or gives or offers bribes to pervert the course of justice. In these cases, the giver deserves more punishment. In my view, the appellant fell squarely into the latter category.
In the light of these considerations, there was no way in which the appellant`s sentence could be viewed as manifestly excessive. In comparison with Lim, who was given a two-and-a-half year imprisonment sentence, only the contrary conclusion seemed logical to me; that the appellant`s sentence was manifestly inadequate.
I found it difficult to understand why the district judge did not slap the appellant with a harsher sentence. After all, the severity of the appellant`s actions was made clear in her judgment (at [para ]240): 
 
... He did not have the mitigation of having pleaded guilty or having shown an iota of remorse. This was also not a case of a frightened man who had on the spur of the moment offered a small bribe for a minor offence. On the contrary, [the appellant] deliberately corrupted the establishment of law and order in order to aid his illegal moneylending activities. Again, I did not find the smallness of the gratification to be an important consideration. What was important was that [the appellant`s] objective was to deliberately undermine the impartiality of the police enforcement system by providing the free entertainment at a lavish nightclub.
 
 
 
I could not, and did not, for a moment underestimate the appellant`s act of corruption. His acts alone defined the root of the whole web of corruption spun around law enforcement officers, instigating them to forgo their sworn duty in favour of various temptations. In the present case, he had bribed Lim so that he could not only evade criminal prosecution but also perpetuate his own criminal activities, and advance his illegal deeds to benefit himself. Lim then sought the assistance of other junior officers. It was my understanding that these junior officers were then subjected to probes by the CPIB. None of these would have occurred without the appellant`s active participation in the first place. Short of taking the law into his own hands, the appellant was implicitly buying into the police force to forward his criminal activities. His elaborate bribery scheme was well disguised, and enabled him, by his criminal activities, uncontrolled freedom from the law. It perverted the course of justice, and made a mockery of the police force.
The consequences of the appellant`s actions were far-reaching. If not appropriately stopped, or deterred, the entire foundation of our criminal justice system, and the very institution policing such activity, would be compromised. Morale would be affected, so would the integrity of the other enforcement agencies in Singapore. The very nature of the police and their responsibilities require that we repose trust and confidence in them, and the appellant`s success in corrupting one, or some, albeit a tiny proportion, of the force necessarily demands that we punish all responsible parties, particularly the sole instigator, severely.
It is a fundamental precept of our criminal justice system that every man must be held accountable to the rule of law, without exception. The appellant`s conduct struck at the very heart of this precept by attempting to subvert the due administration of criminal justice by interfering with the proper course of police investigations. Looking at this case in essence, the appellant was seeking to buy the integrity of the police force, and it was this integrity which formed the cornerstone of the maintenance of law and order in Singapore. As Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) warned in 
Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP
 
 
[1989] SLR 909
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 136
 : 
 
Public confidence in policing and the investigating of crime will diminish unless police officers perform their duties without fear or favour.
 
 
 
The appellant was no angel in disguise. His previous antecedents spanning the last three decades involved not only unlicensed moneylending but also disorderly behaviour and using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duties. While there was no previous offence for corruption, the present offence arose from his moneylending business, and was closely related to his previous convictions for unlicensed moneylending. All these demonstrated the need for a sentence which would sufficiently deter him from future criminal conduct. He was clearly a recalcitrant offender and his present conviction simply demonstrated his increasing disregard of the law.
In the course of his submissions, the DPP conceded that I could not, and should not, take into account the appellant`s roles in previous cases where several other police officers were convicted of accepting bribes from him, not least because he was never charged with those offences as a giver. These cases included 
Hassan bin Ahmad v PP
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 791
 , 
Fong Ser Joo William v PP
 
 
[2000] 4 SLR 77
 , 
PP v Sim Bok Huat Royston
 (Unreported) . I should therefore make clear in no way was my consideration in the present instance blinded by the fact that the appropriate sentence for the appellant was not to punish him for those roles. No doubt the appellant may have been responsible for numerous acts of notoriety involving not one officer, but a segment of the police force, thus raising the stakes, but I was mindful that any sentence imposed cannot be done in a vacuum, and must always be based on established principles of law. Therefore, since the appellant was never charged, nor convicted in those previous cases, I was careful not to let the opposite view affect my judgment here. Any punishment here was to fit the crime, not the criminal.
Similarly, whilst I was conscious of the fact that the appellant still faced 28 outstanding charges against him, 23 of them under the PCA, this did not cloud my decision in considering his appeal. It was, for all intents and purposes, irrelevant. Whether or not he will be found guilty or not of those charges was still a matter not known, and until then, I should give him the benefit of the doubt and consider him innocent until proven guilty by a court of law.
This brought me to the appropriate sentence for the appellant. Needless to say, I found the district judge`s sentence overly lenient. The PCA was enacted for a single purpose, namely to provide for the more effectual prevention of corruption in Singapore. Section 6(b), the offence which the appellant was charged and convicted of, stipulated a maximum sentence of five years, and/or a fine not exceeding $100,000. This underlined the severity of the offence, in the hope that like-minded individuals would consider the consequences before embarking on any such act. On my part, giving effect to the punishment prescribed under s 6(b), I was of the view that a sentence of 48 months and a fine of $100,000 (in default 24 months` imprisonment) would be the appropriate sentence.
There are four pillars of sentencing: retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation. Criminal courts play their part by ensuring that the sentences of offenders mirror these pillars. The sentence imposed on the appellant not only served to punish him, it also sought to deter potential offenders, through fear of punishment, and to influence offenders who have been appropriately sentenced not to offend again. At the same time, it was meant to restore the faith that our police force is crime and corruption free.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
Money is not everything, and certainly cannot buy the appellant out of troubles with the law. The time has come for the appellant to pay his dues to a law-abiding country. The enhanced sentence was meant to stop his illegal moneylending activities, incapacitate him from doing further harm to the society at large, and put an end to the embarrassment which his actions have caused to the police force.

: This is a tragic case of a schizophrenic man killing his elder brother, his caretaker and provider, in their home. The accused, now 40 years old, pleaded guilty to the following charge: 
 
That you, ONG WEE TECK sometime between 9.00 p.m. on 7 December 2000 and 1.05 p.m. on 9 December 2000 at Blk 767 Yishun Ave 3 [num ]01-315, Singapore, did commit culpable homicide not amounting to murder, by causing the death of one Ong Wei Cheong, male/46 years old, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 304(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 
 
 
The statement of facts set out the circumstances leading to the discovery of the deceased`s body in the ground floor flat, the fateful events in the morning of 8 December 2000 as told by the accused in his statements to the police, the postmortem findings of Dr Teo Eng Swee, a Consultant Forensic Pathologist from the Department of Scientific Services and the opinion of Dr Stephen Phang, an Associate Consultant from the Woodbridge Hospital/Institute of Mental Health, contained in his report dated 30 December 2000. The statement of facts read: 
 
 
1 The accused is Ong Wee Teck, NRIC No. S1493815-Z, male, 39 years of age. He was unemployed and residing at Block 767 Yishun Ave 3 [num ]01-315 at the time of the offence. 
 
2 The deceased is Ong Wee Cheong, NRIC No. S0180305-J, male 46 years of age. He worked as a hawker helper. He was the accused`s elder brother. 
 
3 At the time of the offence, the accused was residing at Block 767 Yishun Ave 3 [num ]01-315 (hereinafter referred to as ""the flat"") with his 15-year-old son, Ong Keng Peang, and the deceased. The deceased was providing for the accused and his son since the accused was not gainfully employed.
  
 
 
 
 The Incident
 
 
 
 
 
4 Ong Keng Peang last saw the deceased alive on 7 December 2000. After having dinner with the accused and the deceased, Ong Keng Peang left the flat at about 9pm. Ong Keng Peang returned to the flat on 8 December 2000 at about 12:30pm but could not gain entry as he did not have the keys and no one answered the door. He then left. 
 
5 Later that day at about 11:30pm, Ong Keng Peang returned to the flat again. This time, the accused opened the door. Seeing that the accused was alone in the flat, Ong Keng Peang asked where the deceased was. The accused told Ong Keng Peang that he had killed the deceased because the deceased wanted to poison him. Ong Keng Peang saw masking tape all around the door frame of the rear utility room, which was the deceased`s bedroom. Ong Keng Peang then asked the accused why there was masking tape on the door frame and the accused said that it was to prevent the stench from coming out of the room. 
 
6 Feeling frightened, Ong Keng Peang left the flat and tried to look for the deceased at the coffeeshop where he worked. When Ong Keng Peang could not find the deceased, he sought help from his friend, Lim Wei Jian. Together with Lim Wei Jian, Ong Keng Peang eventually went to look for his grandmother (the accused`s mother) at about 3:45am on 9 December 2000. He related to his grandmother what had happened and she told him to go to sleep first and report the matter to the police later in the morning. 
 
7 On 9 December 2000 at about 12:30pm, Ong Keng Peang and Lim Wei Jian went to a Neighbourhood Police Post and reported to the police that the accused had said that he had killed the deceased. Ong Keng Peang also informed the police that his father was insane and his grandmother had gone to look for his father at Block 767 Yishun Ave 3 [num ]01-315. The police then told him to proceed to the flat to wait for them. 
 
8 The police arrived at the flat at about 1:05pm on 9 December 2000. The iron grille was padlocked and the accused answered the door. The accused later opened the door to let the police in, and told them that there was someone at the rear and asked them to go and take a look. The police found masking tape sealing the entire door frame of the rear utility room. The police saw blood all over in the rear utility room and called for reinforcement. 
 
9 The police had to use force to push open the door to the rear utility [
 sic 
] fully as it was blocked by an unused refrigerator placed behind the door inside the room. The police found the deceased lying naked on the floor in the rear utility room next to the window and there was a lot of blood on the floor and on the walls around him. The body was in a crouching position. The head was on the floor (face down), the forearms and hands were to either side of the head. There was a pool of blood around the region of the head. The thighs were folded under the abdomen. The deceased was pronounced dead at about 1:50pm on 9 December 2000, and the accused was placed under arrest.
  
 
 
 
 The Accused`s Statements
 
 
 
 
 
10 The accused said in his statements to the police that on 8 December 2000 at about 8:00 a.m., the deceased came home after having breakfast. He gave the accused $10 and told the accused to go and have his coffee. The deceased then went to the bathroom in the kitchen to take a shower. Suddenly, the thought of killing the deceased came into the accused`s mind and the accused went to the kitchen to take a chopper from the wash basin. He then pushed open the bathroom door with force and saw the deceased standing there naked. The accused then slashed the deceased`s head with the chopper. The deceased was shocked and asked him ""How can you slash me?"" and asked the accused to send him to the hospital. The deceased struggled with the accused and tried to grab the chopper from the accused. The accused continued to slash the deceased with the chopper. The deceased asked the accused why he was attacking him and who would take care of their mother and the accused`s son. After a while, the accused stopped the attack. The deceased was bleeding profusely. 
 
11 The accused then came out of the bathroom and placed the chopper on the kitchen wash basin. He sat down at the kitchen table to smoke a cigarette. The deceased, who was lying on the bathroom floor, got up and went to the rear utility room and closed the door. The accused heard him falling down to the ground in the room. The accused then went to take a bath and used the deceased`s shirt and water to clean the bloodstains in the bathroom and the kitchen. Later, he used masking tape to seal up the door of the utility room.
  
 
 
 
 Post-mortem Findings
 
 
 
 
 
12 Dr Teo Eng Swee, the Consultant Forensic Pathologist from the Department of Scientific Services, examined the body at the scene on 9 December 2000 at about 5:45pm and found that the body was cold and rigor mortis was dissipating. Dr Teo conducted an autopsy on 11 December 2000 at about 9:30am and found 25 slash or incised wounds on the deceased`s head, neck and various parts of the body. The left side of the mandible was fractured, related to the incised wound on the left mandibular region of the face. There were also incised wounds of the skull. Dr Teo certified that the cause of death was 
 positional asphyxia 
, which was contributed to by the head injury (intracranial haemorrhage) as well as blood loss (haemorrhage due to incised wounds). Dr Teo is of the opinion that it would be difficult for a person to breathe in the position in which the body was found, and the deceased was probably unable to move himself out of that position because of the injuries he sustained. A copy of the post-mortem report A2039/2000 is annexed at 
 Tab A 
.
  
 
 
 
 Psychiatric Assessment
 
 
 
 
 
13 The accused was arrested on 9 December 2000 and remanded at Changi Prison Hospital for psychiatric observation from 11 December 2000 to 2 January 2001. 
 
14 Dr Phang is of the opinion that the accused suffered from an acute relapse of 
 schizophrenia 
, a major form of mental illness, at the time of the incident. He was labouring under 
 florid paranoid delusions of a persecutory and bizarre nature 
, in that he was convinced that governments desired to harm him and frame him up, via the employment of computers. At the time of the offence, the accused was convinced that the deceased had the intention to poison him, which then elicited the violent response from him, with fatal consequence. Dr Phang also elicited 
 passivity phenomena 
 which are feelings of no longer being in control of one`s own thoughts, feelings or will, and that an external (frequently mysterious) force has superceded the volitional capacity of the individual not to perform certain actions. In this case, the accused felt that the `computers` were controlling his actions at the material time of the killing, as part of an overall scheme by the `government` to frame him for murdering his brother. The accused also felt that people around him knew what he was thinking, or could read his mind, a classic schizophrenic phenomenon known as 
 thought broadcast 
. 
 
15 Nonetheless, Dr Phang is of the opinion that, at the time of the killing, the accused remained aware of the nature of his actions and he knew that it was wrong and contrary to law. The accused was therefore 
 not of unsound mind at the time of the offence 
. Dr Phang is also of the opinion that the accused was very likely to have intended to cause death, the fact that such an intention was delusion-driven notwithstanding, and was also sufficiently lucid to know that his act was likely to have resulted in death. However, his act of killing was a product of his relapsed mental illness, which constitutes an abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his act in killing his brother. The accused should qualify for the defence of 
 diminished responsibility 
. A copy of the psychiatric report MR 2379/2000 is annexed at 
 Tab B 
.
  
 
 
The accused had two previous convictions. On 9 January 1992, he was fined $200 for disorderly behaviour (under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act) and $1,000 for committing mischief (under s 427 of the Penal Code).
 The sentence 
 
 
 
Section 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) provides for mandatory imprisonment for life or for a term of up to ten years. The section also provides for a discretionary fine or caning.
On the basis of Dr Phang`s psychiatric report on the accused, the prosecution submitted that life imprisonment was the appropriate sentence here. The prosecution said it was looking beyond retribution to the need for protection of the public.
On the other hand, defence counsel submitted that life imprisonment would be too harsh for this accused who did not choose to suffer from mental illness and who was a danger only if he did not take his medication.
The accused is a divorcee with a 15-year-old son. His mother is 68 years old. His father passed away many years ago. He has nine other siblings. He deeply regretted taking his elder brother`s life and could not understand why he had done so.
Defence counsel further argued that while the accused`s family members were less than enthusiastic about taking care of him, they could apply under the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act at the appropriate time for the accused to be placed in an institution. Although they were not people of means, they could make such an application with the assistance of the Legal Aid Bureau.
Neo Man Lee v PP
 
 
[1991] SLR 146
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 369
  was a case involving a schizophrenic man convicted under s 304(a) of the Penal Code for having stabbed a woman to death in the changing room of a condominium. The accused there was arrested on 27 September 1984 and after a trial which stretched from 3 October 1988 to 25 May 1989, he was convicted and sentenced by FA Chua J to life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest. The judge there said: 
 
The doctors have reported that you are suffering from a chronic schizophrenic illness which requires a long-term maintenance drug treatment for an indefinite period and that is to minimize relapses and if you have a relapse, you may pose a danger to yourself and to society. Now, the public must be protected against you and the detention, in my view, should be as long as it is permissible under the law. A long-term imprisonment would also be for your own good because whilst in prison, you will get proper medical care and attention. I will be failing in my duty if I do not sentence you to a long term of imprisonment. You are sentenced to imprisonment for life.
 
 
 
On appeal to the then Court of Criminal Appeal, Yong Pung How CJ said: 
 
Section 304(a) is, on the face of it, rather curiously drafted, because in addition to the sentence to imprisonment for life, there is the alternative possibility of a much lighter custodial sentence up to a maximum of ten years. The only question in the present case was whether the sentence to imprisonment for life was justified.
 
 
 
The deputy public prosecutor referred us to a report on sentencing from the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal in England in the case of 
R v Rowland Jack Foster Hodgson
 
[1968] 52 Cr App R 113
 which carried the following statement by MacKenna J, with which we are in broad agreement:
 
 
 
`When the following conditions are satisfied, a sentence of life imprisonment is in our opinion justified: (1) where the offence or offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) where it appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant`s history that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future; and (3) where if the offences are committed the consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of violence.`
 
 
 
In the present case, the appellant has been suffering from schizophrenia, a major mental illness, since 1975. Both the psychiatrists` reports, which were considered by the court before sentence was passed, were to the effect that he would require a long term drug treatment for an indefinite period to minimize relapses during which he might pose a danger to society and himself. In fact, the appellant had two relapses in 1980, one in 1983, and one in 1984 when he committed the present offence; and, while he was in remand in 1987 and 1988 he had two more relapses lasting one week and one month respectively.
 
 
 
We were of the opinion that the conditions for sentence to imprisonment for life were clearly satisfied in the present case and justified a life sentence. The appellant is clearly a continuing danger not only to himself but also to the public. The trial judge was of the view, which we shared, that he should be detained as long as it was permissible under the law. We might add that, with remissions, life imprisonment in Singapore may be reduced in practice to no more than 14 years, and the appellant may in fact be out of prison in another seven years.
 
 
 
Subsequently, in 
Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 643
 , the Court of Appeal held that a sentence of life imprisonment meant imprisonment for the remaining natural life of the prisoner. After that decision, r 119A of the Prisons Regulations (Cap 247, Rg 2, 1990 Ed) was passed. Under this rule, a Life Imprisonment Review Board reviews the suitability for release of prisoners who have served 20 years of their sentence of life imprisonment at intervals not exceeding 12 months. The Board then submits a written report to the Minister who may, in his discretion, remit, with or without conditions, any part of the sentence of imprisonment to which the prisoners have been sentenced.
 Neo Man Lee, Abdul Nasir 
 and the said r 119A were re-visited in the Court of Appeal`s decision in 
PP v Tan Kei Loon Allan
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 288
 . There, an 18-year-old male pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(a) of the Penal Code for causing the death of another male by stabbing him with a knife. He was sentenced to seven years` imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane. The prosecution, which had urged the trial judge to impose the maximum permissible sentence of life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane, appealed. The Court of Appeal enhanced the sentence to ten years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Commenting on 
 Neo Man Lee 
`s case, Lai Kew Chai J (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) said (at [para ]20): 
 
Yong Pung How CJ noted specifically, however, that `with remissions, life imprisonment in Singapore may be reduced in practice to no more than 14 years, and the appellant may in fact be out of prison in another seven years`. That logic is now obviously negated in light of our decision in 
 Abdul Nasir
, and all the cases in which the life sentence was imposed must be viewed in that context.
 
 
 
The prosecution pointed out five other cases where accused persons suffering from one form of mental disorder or another were sentenced to life imprisonment under s 304(a) of the Penal Code by the High Court. Three of these were pre-
 Abdul Nasir 
 and two were post-
 Abdul Nasir 
. Of these two cases, both involving schizophrenic accused persons, one was convicted after trial and the other was convicted upon his plea of guilt. In the former case (
 PP v Carilman Aloysius Joshi 
 - CC 43/99) Chan Seng Onn JC said (at [para ]32 of the judgment): 
 
The accused never accepted that he had any mental illness. It necessarily followed that he would not take his medication voluntarily. I agreed with the submission of the DPP that the accused must be sentenced to life imprisonment so that he would not become a danger to himself and to society. Whilst under confinement in prison, he would receive proper treatment which would be for his own good.
 
 
 
The accused`s appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 22 November 1999. Defence counsel pointed out to me that the accused in that case had been admitted to Woodbridge Hospital some 17 times since 1986 and that he was given to consuming alcohol which would make his mental state worse.
I do not consider the comments made in 
 Tan Kei Loon Allan 
 as having negated or qualified the principles set out in 
 Neo Man Lee 
. The earlier Court of Appeal decision made it clear that when the stated conditions were satisfied, a sentence of imprisonment for life would be justified. There, the Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the accused, who was suffering from chronic schizophrenia, should be detained for as long as it was permissible under the law and the maximum permissible was life imprisonment. The concluding comment of the Court of Appeal that Neo Man Lee could in fact be released in seven years was no more than a passing remark alluding to the fact that the prisoner had already been in custody for almost seven years at the time of his appeal. I do not think the Court of Appeal would have sentenced the accused there any differently even if the court was of the view that life imprisonment meant imprisonment for the remaining natural life of the accused. I am fortified in this belief by the dismissal of Carilman`s appeal. I therefore applied the principles in 
 Neo Man Lee 
 to the facts of the present case.
Here, the accused`s psychiatric history went back to 1986 when he was first treated at a psychiatric outpatient clinic. He defaulted in his treatment and, while in a state of relapse, jumped from a height in 1988, injuring his spine in the process which resulted in partial paralysis of his lower limbs. He resumed psychiatric treatment until July 1991 when he defaulted again. He was admitted to Woodbridge Hospital for two periods of time - from 3 November 1991 to 9 December 1991 and from 14 May 1992 to 4 June 1992 - because of his violent behaviour. He had broken some furniture and assaulted his former wife with a knife.
The psychiatrist was of the opinion that the accused required `ongoing treatment, probably on a lifelong basis` and that the act of killing `was a product of his relapsed mental illness`. The psychiatrist concluded his assessment with the following words: 
 
I would add that the future of dangerousness remains significant, and he should be held in a secure setting, possibly by subsequently invoking the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act.
 
 
 
The accused has shown what he could do in a state of relapse - inflicting 25 incised wounds on another adult male with a chopper. He had also previously attacked his ex-wife with a knife. He had defaulted at least twice in his treatment. He was clearly a continuing danger not only to himself but also to the public.
In the circumstances, I imposed a sentence of imprisonment for life on the accused deemed to commence on 9 December 2000, the date of his arrest.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This was an appeal against the decision of Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck, who convicted the appellant, Ramis a/l Muniandy (`Ramis`) of an offence pursuant to s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Ed) (`the Act`) and sentenced him to suffer the punishment of death. We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
 The charge 
 
 
 
The charge against Ramis read as follows: 
 
That you, RAMIS A/L MUNIANDY on the 12th day of August 2000, at about 7.55 a.m., at the carpark along Marsiling Industrial Estate Road 2, beside Block 7, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, 1529.8 grams nett of cannabis, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and punishable under section 33 of the aforesaid Act.
 
 
 
 
 
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
 
 
According to the prosecution, a tip-off pertaining to an impending cannabis transaction was received by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) in the early hours of 12 August 2000. At 6.45am, a team of seven CNB officers assembled at Causeway Point in Woodlands. The team was led by Senior SSgt Qamarul Zaman (`Zaman`) and the other team members were SSgt Md Azman (`Azman`), Sgt Joe Pang Hee Lim (`Pang`), Cpl Rajkumar (`Rajkumar`), Cpl Chan Seng (`Chan`), Cpl Md Afandy (`Afandy`) and Cpl Abdul Rahman (`Rahman`).
Zaman briefed the team members about the cannabis transaction that was expected to take place between 7.30am and 8am in the vicinity of an Indian temple located along Marsiling Rise. The drug trafficker was believed to be a male Indian Malaysian who would be riding a Malaysian registered `Honda Cub` motorcycle.
The team left Causeway Point at about 7.05am and arrived at the car park of Block 120, Marsiling Rise at about 7.10am. While the rest of the officers remained at the car park, Afandy and Rahman surveyed the vicinity of the temple for suspicious characters but they did not spot any. They returned to the car park after about ten minutes. At about 7.30am, Rajkumar went to the temple to keep watch while Zaman kept watch at the bus stop diagonally opposite the temple. The remaining officers were on standby at the car park. The officers were to keep in contact by mobile phone.
At about 7.50am, both Zaman and Rajkumar spotted a `Honda Cub` motorcycle being ridden by a male Indian travelling along Marsiling Rise and thereafter turning onto Marsiling Industrial Estate Road 2. Zaman noted the registration number of the motorcycle (JFB 3451) and also noticed a `black thing` in the motorcycle`s front carrier basket. Although Zaman lost sight of the motorcycle for a while, Rajkumar walked down the pavement outside the temple towards the direction of the motorcycle so that he would not lose sight of it. He saw the male Indian park the motorcycle at the parking lots next to Block 7 of the industrial estate.
The male Indian then walked towards Marsiling Rise and stopped at the front of Block 7. At this point, he was within Zaman`s line of vision once again, so both Zaman and Rajkumar could see him. He was seen using his mobile phone and was looking at the temple as if he was waiting for someone. Rajkumar then called Azman, giving him the details of what he had just seen. Zaman also called Azman, asking him to come with the party of officers to effect arrest.
At about 7.55am, the remaining five officers, namely Azman, Pang, Chan, Afandy and Rahman, arrived in a CNB staff car at the place where the Indian male was standing and they arrested him. The male Indian was ascertained to be the appellant, Ramis.
Rahman searched him and found, inter alia, a key chain with three keys, one of which was later found to fit the ignition of the motorcycle bearing the registration number JFB 3451, which Ramis arrived on. Ramis was then taken to his motorcycle, which was covered with a dark blue raincoat. Before Zaman removed the raincoat, he asked Ramis the following question in English (which Rajkumar interpreted to Ramis in Tamil): 
 
 
Q: Do you have anything to surrender on the bike? 
 
A: Nothing.
  
 
 
Zaman then removed the raincoat, revealing a blue helmet and a `Puma` bag which was black and red in colour, in the front carrier basket of the motorcycle. Zaman asked Ramis (interpreted by Rajkumar in Tamil): 
 
 
Q: This bag belongs to whom? 
 
A: Not mine.
  
 
 
Thereafter, Zaman opened the `Puma` bag. It contained a white `Fuji Grand` plastic bag containing two blocks of compressed greenish vegetable matter in transparent plastic wrapping. Zaman questioned Ramis again (again interpreted by Rajkumar in Tamil): 
 
 
Q: What is this? 
 
A: `Roke`. 
 
Q: What is the quantity? 
 
A: I do not know. 
 
Q: Does it belong to you? 
 
A: It`s not mine. 
 
Q: Whose is it? 
 
A: I do not know.
  
 
 
Rajkumar testified that the term `roke` is the street jargon to describe cannabis.
Ramis was then brought to the CNB office at the Clementi Police Division HQ. An instant urine test conducted on him revealed traces of cannabis and amphetamine in his urine. At the CNB office, Zaman also reduced into writing the questions posed to and answers given by Ramis earlier. In addition, tests were carried out on the two blocks of greenish vegetable matter found in the motorcycle carrier basket. The first block was found to contain 782.1g of cannabis and 118.4g of cannabis mixture. The second block was found to contain 747.7g of cannabis and 193g of cannabis mixture.
Ramis was charged later in the afternoon. Pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), Ramis made the following statement: `I do not admit to the charges.`
 The defence case 
 
 
 
The accused elected to give evidence. He testified that on 12 August 2000 he entered Singapore from Johor at about 6.30am. After breakfast at Woodlands Centre, he rode to Marsiling where he parked his motorcycle next to Block 7 in the industrial estate. He arrived at 7.20am, as opposed to 7.50am as testified by the CNB officers. He waited for about 20 minutes and made two telephone calls during this time. This contradicted evidence from the prosecution witnesses that only about five minutes elapsed between the time Ramis arrived and the time of his arrest. His evidence was that from where he was standing he could not see his motorcycle throughout these 20 minutes.
Then, all of a sudden, a car stopped in front of him and he was arrested by the CNB officers. During his examination-in-chief, he testified that upon his arrest the CNB officers had to ask him where his motorcycle was, as opposed to their leading him to his motorcycle. This implied that the CNB officers had not been keeping an eye on his motorcycle. Ramis also denied that the CNB officers opened the white `Fuji Grand` bag inside the `Puma` bag found in his motorcycle carrier basket. He claimed that they did not see what was in the bag. He further denied that he used the word `roke`, saying that he knew what `ganga` was but did not know what `roke` was. His defence was that he did not know how the `Puma` bag got into the carrier basket of his motorcycle.
During cross-examination, Ramis testified that his purpose in going to the vicinity on the morning of 12 August 2000 was because one Kumar, an ex-colleague, was supposed to pick him up from there to help get him a job. Kumar had told him to wait at the parking lot area near the temple and to arrive between 7.30am and 8am but not later. However, he admitted that he had no way of contacting Kumar.
During closing submissions, counsel for Ramis at the trial, Mr Singa Retnam, submitted that neither the `Puma` bag nor a blue helmet that the CNB officers found in the carrier basket of his motorcycle belonged to him. Mr Retnam said that there could not have been drugs on the motorcycle when Ramis passed through customs that morning because the inference that should be drawn was that `there was a danger of him being caught`. In other words, Mr Retnam was implying that Ramis would not have been so foolish as to pass through customs with drugs on his motorcycle because of the risk that he might be caught. Therefore, Mr Retnam said that the `Puma` bag must have been placed on Ramis`s motorcycle carrier basket by someone else after he had parked it next to Block 7. The defence argument was therefore that Ramis could not see his motorcycle for a span of 20 minutes and nobody really knew what happened during that time period. Moreover, Ramis was wearing a grey jacket and a silver helmet whereas the male riding the motorcycle JFB 3451 was spotted by the CNB officers to be wearing a blue jacket and a blue helmet. It was thus unsafe to convict Ramis on the evidence - `that a bag of drugs found in the open basket of a motorcycle parked in an industrial estate belonged to the accused and no one else`.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The judicial commissioner considered the evidence before him and was not persuaded that the defence had raised a reasonable possibility that someone else was the trafficker. Although the defence argued that Ramis was wearing a grey jacket and silver helmet, and not a blue jacket and blue helmet as claimed by the CNB officers, what was relevant and incontrovertible was that the blue helmet and the blue raincoat were both found on the motorcycle together with the cannabis and the motorcycle belonged to Ramis who was the person who rode on it.
The judicial commissioner also accepted the evidence of Rajkumar, who testified that he had the motorcycle in his sight at all times and saw no one approaching it. The judicial commissioner rejected the defence contention that Ramis was waiting for about 20 minutes, accepting the prosecution`s evidence that the arrest was effected within five minutes of Ramis`s arrival. He held that, even if Rajkumar had had a momentary lapse of concentration, there was no reason in the circumstances why anybody would have left the bag on Ramis`s motorcycle. Therefore he did not accept this remote possibility as having sufficient weight to create any doubt that Ramis carried the bag with him as he entered Marsiling Industrial Estate Road 4.
In the event, the judicial commissioner found Ramis guilty as charged and sentenced him to death.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Ramis was charged under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Act, which reads as follows: 
 
 
(1) Except as authorised by this Act or the regulations, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore to - 
 
(a) traffic in a controlled drug; 
 
... 
 
(2) For the purposes of this Act, a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.
  
 
 
To discharge its burden of proof, the prosecution had to prove possession of the drugs on the part of Ramis for the purposes of trafficking. The prosecution sought to rely on the presumption relating to purpose of possession in s 17 of the Act, which reads as follows: 
 
Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than -
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
(d) 15 grammes of cannabis;
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose.
 
 
 
However, before the prosecution could rely on this presumption, it first had to prove the element of possession. The meaning of `possession` was discussed by Lord Pearce in 
Warner v Metropolitan Police Comr
 
[1969] 2 AC 256
, and followed by this court in the case of 
Tan Ah Tee v PP
 
 [1978-1979] SLR 211 
 
[1980] 1 MLJ 49
 . A long line of cases has since followed the ruling in these cases. Essentially, in order to prove possession, the prosecution had to satisfy two elements: firstly, it had to prove that Ramis had physical control of the cannabis and, secondly, that Ramis knew that what he had under his physical control was cannabis: see 
Lee Lye Hoe v PP
 (Unreported) , 
Zulfikar bin Mustaffah v PP
 
 
[2001] 1 SLR 633
  and 
Lim Beng Soon v PP
 
 
[2000] 4 SLR 589
 .
 Physical control 
 
 
 
The main argument in Ramis`s written submissions for the purposes of this appeal was similar to that canvassed at the trial below - that someone else had placed the drugs on his motorcycle when he left it unattended. To support this argument, two main points were raised in the written submissions: firstly, it was argued that the judicial commissioner should not have accepted Rajkumar`s evidence that he had kept the motorcycle in his sight from the time Ramis arrived in the vicinity till the time of his arrest; and secondly, it was contended that the judicial commissioner had not put enough weight on the fact that Ramis denied possession of the drugs from the time of his arrest.
However, before us, counsel for Ramis, Mr Subhas Anandan, conceded that the only argument that was worth pursuing was the fact that Ramis had denied possession. In any case, we could not find any evidence to justify overturning the judicial commissioner`s decision to accept Rajkumar`s testimony.
As for the argument that Ramis had denied possession from the moment he was arrested, it is clear that an accused`s repeated denials do not have any evidentiary value where he does not adduce any other evidence whatsoever to support his account. In the present instance, the self-serving denials and protestations of innocence emanated from only one source, namely, Ramis himself. His sole defence was his bare denial that the `Puma` bag belonged to him, but his denials were simply bare assertions. He said he did not know how it came to be in his motorcycle carrier basket. However, the incontrovertible facts were that the drugs were found in the `Puma` bag which was found on the motorcycle, which Ramis had ridden on. The vicinity was quiet and deserted on the morning of the offence. The CNB officers testified that there were no vehicles parked in the bus and motorcycle parking lots in the area. Afandy and Rahman did not spot any suspicious characters when they patrolled the vicinity of the temple. Rajkumar testified that he kept his eyes on the motorcycle throughout the entire period and that nobody approached it while Ramis was standing in front of Block 7. All seven CNB officers were unanimous in their testimony that only about five minutes elapsed between Ramis`s arrival and his arrest.
We took the view that this whole matrix of facts led to the irresistible conclusion that Ramis had the bag of drugs in his motorcycle carrier basket when he arrived in the vicinity and parked his motorcycle at the side of Block 7. Other than his bare denials, Ramis did not adduce any evidence whatsoever to support his version of events that the drugs were placed on his motorcycle by somebody else. He claimed he was in the vicinity to meet one Kumar who would get him a job. However, Kumar was not called as a witness to verify this. Moreover, Ramis admitted on cross-examination that he had no way of contacting Kumar.
It was therefore our conclusion that the drugs were already on his motorcycle when he arrived in the vicinity of Marsiling Rise. We did not accept his claim that they were placed in his motorcycle carrier basket by someone else when he was standing in front of Block 7. As such, we had no doubt that he was in physical control of the `Puma` bag and the drugs contained in it.
 Knowledge of drugs 
 
 
 
The starting point in the consideration of this issue was that we had already concluded that the drugs were already on Ramis`s motorcycle when he entered the vicinity and that he had physical control of the drugs. In the absence of any reasonable explanation by Ramis, these facts were sufficient to lead to a strong inference that Ramis knew that the bag found on his motorcycle contained drugs.
In 
 Tan Ah Tee 
 (supra), Wee Chong Jin CJ, delivering the judgment of the court, said ([1978-1979] SLR 211 at 217-218; 
[1980] 1 MLJ 49
 at 52): 
 
[E]ven if there were no statutory presumptions available to the prosecution, once the prosecution had proved the fact of physical control or possession of the plastic bag and the circumstances in which this was acquired by and remained with the second appellant, the trial judges would be justified in finding that she had possession of the contents of the plastic bag within the meaning of the Act unless she gave an explanation of the physical fact which the trial judges accepted or which raised a doubt in their minds that she had possession of the contents within the meaning of the Act.
 
 
 
He then quoted Lord Wilberforce in 
 Warner 
 (supra), who said (
[1969] 2 AC 256
 at 312): 
 
In all such cases, the starting point will be that the accused had physical control of something - a package, a bottle, a container - found to contain the substance. This is evidence - generally strong evidence - of possession. It calls for an explanation: the explanation will be heard and the jury must decide whether there is genuine ignorance of the presence of the substance, or such an acceptance of the package with all that it might contain, or with such opportunity to ascertain what it did contain or such guilty knowledge with regard to it as to make up the statutory possession. Of course it would not be right, or consistent with the terms of the Act, to say that the onus of showing innocent custody rests upon the accused. The prosecution must prove the offence, and establish its ingredients. But one starts from the point that the Act itself has exempted the great majority of cases of innocent possession, so that once the prosecution has proved the fact of physical control in circumstances not covered by an exemption and something of the circumstances in which this was acquired or held, this, in the absence of explanation, may be sufficient to enable a finding of possession to be made.
 
 
 
The strong inference, that an accused had knowledge that what he had physical control over was drugs, can be rebutted. In the words of Lord Pearce in 
 Warner 
 (supra at pp 305-306): 
 
The situation with regard to containers presents further problems. If a man is in possession of the contents of a package, prima facie his possession of the package leads to the strong inference that he is in possession of its contents. But can this be rebutted by evidence that he was mistaken as to its contents? As in the case of goods that have been ""planted"" in his pocket without his knowledge, so I do not think he is in possession of contents which are quite different in kind from what he believed. Thus the prima facie assumption is discharged if he proves (or raises a real doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no right to open it 
 and
 no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs or (b) that although he was the owner he had no knowledge of (including a genuine mistake as to) its actual contents or of their illicit nature and that he received them innocently and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity since receiving the package of acquainting himself with its actual contents. For a man takes over a package or suitcase at risk as to its contents being unlawful if he does not immediately examine it (if he is entitled to do so). As soon as may be he should examine it and if he finds the contents suspicious reject possession by either throwing them away or by taking immediate sensible steps for their disposal.
 
 
 
In the present case, Ramis`s only defence was that the bag was not his and that someone else must have put it there. We have rejected this. He did not raise the argument that he was a mere bailee. We were also not satisfied that Ramis had no opportunity to acquaint himself with the contents of the bag which was found on his motorcycle. We found that the drugs were already on his motorcycle and in his control when he arrived in the vicinity. He had ample opportunity to examine the contents of the bag. Therefore it was our view that Ramis did not raise any explanation to rebut the strong inference that he had knowledge of the drugs on his motorcycle.
We also think that it is necessary to add that this appeal revolved solely around questions of fact that were more appropriately decided by the judicial commissioner who was the trial judge. The principles governing the role of an appellate court in reviewing a trial judge`s findings of fact are settled. It is clear that an appellate court will not easily disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of evidence (see eg 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
  and 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
 ). The appellate court will be particularly slow to overturn the trial judge`s findings of fact where they hinge on the trial judge`s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence (see 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
  and 
Tan Hung Yeoh v PP
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 93
 ).
In the present case, the appeal turned on whether Ramis`s version of events or the prosecution`s version of the events was to be believed. The judicial commissioner heard the testimonies of witnesses from both sides and chose to believe the prosecution`s evidence over that of Ramis. Nothing had been adduced in this appeal to show that the judicial commissioner`s finding of fact was plainly wrong or against the weight of evidence.
Since it was our decision that Ramis had both physical control and knowledge of the drugs, we found that the element of possession was satisfied. The presumption under s 17 of the Act as to the purpose of possession then kicked in. Thus, by s 17(d) of the Act, he was presumed to have had the cannabis in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. This presumption had not been rebutted by Ramis.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In light of our findings above, we found that the judicial commissioner rightly convicted Ramis of the offence as charged. We therefore dismissed the appeal against conviction and sentence.

s 40(1)(i) Women's Charter (Cap 53, 1997 Ed)
 
: This was the first case to reach the High Court in a recent series involving the engaging by adult men in sexual intercourse with young, teenage girls whom they had met over the internet. The appellant in the present case was charged under s 140(1)(i) of the Women`s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Ed) with one count of having carnal connection with the complainant who was at the material time under 16 years of age. He pleaded guilty to the charge, and after hearing submissions on sentence, the district judge sentenced him to nine months` imprisonment. At the end of the hearing before me, I dismissed his appeal against sentence and ordered that the sentence be enhanced to a term of 12 months` imprisonment instead. I also slapped the appellant with the maximum fine of $10,000 to demonstrate the severity and abhorrence with which the court viewed his actions. I now give my reasons.
 Brief facts 
 
 
 
The salient facts of this case were not disputed and were in fact admitted to by the appellant in the court below without qualification. They were as follows. The appellant was a 45-year-old salaried director of a construction cost consultancy company. Sometime in April or May 2000, he met the complainant, then a 15-year-old secondary school student, online via the internet relay chat (`IRC`) function in a chatroom called `Singapore 30+`. Although the chatroom was principally intended for users in their thirties, the complainant told the appellant specifically that she was only 15 years old. Thereafter, the appellant and the complainant kept in touch via both the IRC and the telephone.
Subsequently, on an afternoon in June 2000, the appellant picked the complainant up from the void deck of the block of flats in which she lived and drove her to the car park of the old Changi Hospital at Halton Road whereat they engaged in sexual intercourse. He then sent the complainant home.
Thereafter, the appellant continued to keep in touch with the complainant, although they did not meet again. On 8 November 2000, the complainant invited the appellant over to her place, but before he could make it there, he was arrested by a team of police officers at the car park.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
In sentencing the appellant to nine months` imprisonment, the district judge took into account his plea of guilt, which undoubtedly saved the complainant from the trauma and embarrassment of having to testify in court. While he was further mindful of the fact that the appellant had no history of antecedents and had hitherto been of good character, the district judge felt, however, that public policy required that such young victims as the one in this case were justifiably well-deserving of protection from sexual exploitation, regardless of whether or not the intercourse was consensual. Consequently, he placed little weight on the fact that the complainant was a willing party to the act nor was it relevant in his view that she had had a long history of sexual activity with older men. General deterrence, it appeared, was upmost in the district judge`s mind when he further proclaimed that: 
 
... using the internet as a tool by unscrupulous matured men to scour for young persons to exploit sexually must be discouraged as almost every young person in Singapore has access to the internet and will be easy targets.
 
 
 
 
 
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
Before me, senior counsel submitted that the sentence of nine months` imprisonment was manifestly excessive. While he recognised that a custodial sentence was still nevertheless apposite, he urged that a lesser term be substituted instead. First, he contended that the appropriate sentence for offences under s 140(1)(i) of the Women`s Charter depended on the criminal behaviour involved and the relevant surrounding circumstances. In other words, there is a wide spectrum encompassing the different degrees of severity of the offence of carnal connection with an underaged girl. Several district court decisions on s 140(1)(i) were then cited to me which counsel said supported his view that the offence in the present case fell at the lowest end of the spectrum which in turn called for a much shorter prison sentence. With respect, I could not agree with counsel. In the first place, the decisions cited were that of a lower court, and as such, I did not find myself bound by them. That they were unreported diminished their authoritative value even further, since the detailed facts and circumstances of these cases are hardly disclosed or documented with sufficient clarity to enable any intelligent comparison to be made. At the highest therefore, they served as mere guidelines only. In any event, I was not convinced that the cases cited supported the view that a shorter prison sentence was warranted in this case. Counsel himself pointed out that the lower courts have consistently meted out sentences of between 20 months` and four years` imprisonment in cases which involved such aggravating factors as an abuse of trust or authority, a mentally challenged victim, the practise of deception or the use of force. I could not see therefore, how the sentence of nine months` imprisonment in the present case which did not involve any of these factors could be said to be unjustified, given that it is already on the lower end of the spectrum, and was indeed much lower than the minimum given by the lower courts in cases with aggravating features.
Counsel next sought to draw my attention to a host of English cases which he argued supported his proposition that the sentence in the present case was excessive. The first case was 
R v Taylor
 
[1977] 3 All ER 527
. The three appellants in that case had engaged in regular sexual intercourse with the 15-year-old complainant over a prolonged period of a few months. The complainant, however, was described by the court as being undoubtedly a wanton. She was very experienced in sexual matters and even recorded her sexual exploits with some degree of particularity in a diary. The English Court of Appeal dismissed the men`s application for leave to appeal against their sentences of four and two months` imprisonment respectively. The following passage from the judgment was relied upon by counsel (at p 529): 
 
This court now has the task of deciding how the law should be administered. It is clear from what the learned trial judge said that there is doubt amongst many at the present time, as to what is the proper way of dealing with these cases. What does not seem to have been appreciated by the public is the wide spectrum of guilt which is covered by the offence known as having unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16. At one end of that spectrum is the youth who stands in the dock, maybe 16, 17 or 18 years of age, who has had what started off as a virtuous friendship with a girl under the age of 16. That virtuous friendship has ended with their having sexual intercourse with one another. At the other end of the spectrum is the man in a supervisory capacity, a schoolmaster or social worker, who sets out deliberately to seduce a girl under the age of 16 who is in his charge. The penalties appropriate for the two types of case to which I have just referred are very different indeed. Nowadays, most judges would take the view, and rightly take the view, that when there is a virtuous friendship which ends in unlawful sexual intercourse, it is inappropriate to pass sentences of a punitive nature. What is required is a warning to the youth to mend his ways. At the other end, a man in a supervisory capacity who abuses his position of trust for his sexual gratification, ought to get a sentence somewhere near the maximum allowed by law, which is two years` imprisonment. In between there come many degrees of guilt. A common type of offender is the youth who picks up a girl of loose morals at a dance, takes her out into the local park and, behind the bushes, has sexual intercourse with her. That is the kind of offence which normally is dealt with by a fine. When an older man in his twenties, or older, goes off to a dance and picks up a young girl, he can expect to get a much stiffer fine, and if the girl is under 15 he can expect to go to prison for a short time. A young man who deliberately sets out to seduce a girl under the age of 16 can expect to go to detention. The older man who deliberately so sets out can expect to go to prison. Such is the wide variety of penalties which can be applied in this class of case.
 
 
 
While the English court accepted that the men did not corrupt the girl as she already had loose morals to begin with, the conduct of the men were still nevertheless reprehensible as it continued the `debauching of the girl, knowing how young she was`. They had further treated her like the village whore and used her continuously to satisfy their lust.
The next case cited by counsel was 
R v Asher Lloyd Alston
 (Unreported) , which concerned a 42-year-old appellant who had had carnal connection with a 13-year-old girl. In sentencing the man to six months` imprisonment, the court appeared to have been greatly influenced by the fact that the victim was a virgin at the material time.
The third and last case relied upon by counsel was 
R v Lane David Robert
 (Unreported) . The appellant in that case was 31 years old, and had had sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old girl twice. He also indecently assaulted two of her friends who were around the same age. On appeal, his sentence on the charge of unlawful sexual intercourse was reduced from 15 to nine months` imprisonment. The court noted, however, that he had gotten to know the girls `when he was in a position of trust, working for the parents of one of them`. They noted further, and this was the point counsel urged earnestly for me to adopt, that the extent to which the victims agreed to and encouraged what was done is relevant to an accused`s mitigation.
While I was grateful for the insightful discourse on the current state of English criminal law and sentencing, I nevertheless found the reliance on English authorities to be wholly misguided for the purposes of the case before me. First, it is a trite proposition that English cases, while useful and sometimes even highly persuasive, are not technically binding on Singapore courts, and especially so when the decision is only one of the English Court of Appeal rather than the House of Lords or the Privy Council. Second, and more importantly, the legislation in the present case is markedly different in the two jurisdictions in at least one material respect. The relevant English statute with which the above cases were concerned was the English Sexual Offences Act 1956, which provides that the maximum punishment for sexual intercourse with an underaged girl is two years` imprisonment. In Singapore, under s 140(1)(i) of the Women`s Charter, the maximum punishment of five years` imprisonment is more than twice that of its English counterpart. In addition, the local statute also provides for a maximum fine of $10,000. As such, the guidelines laid down in the English cases on the range of sentence which should be passed in any given sort of case cannot and should not be applied mutatis mutandis to the same facts had they occurred locally. It is obvious that the Singapore Parliament in drafting s 140(1)(i) of the Women`s Charter recognised that our social climate and conservationist culture was such that the treatment of men who preyed on the youth and relative naivete of young girls should be of the severest degree. One has to recognise that different jurisdictions hold, and are entitled to hold, different ideas about the principles and rules which their citizens are enjoined to live and abide by. For example, certain countries may place a higher emphasis on rehabilitation of the offender while to others, general deterrence and the protection of the community at large takes precedence to the rights and freedom of the individual accused. In this respect, I have no doubt that the sentencing philosophy of our legislature has always been to take a tough stand against criminals. We have been described as having one of the strictest and harshest sentencing regimes in the world, but that is something which, albeit paternalistic to some, has nevertheless worked well for us in ensuring that the safety and security of our citizens and the generations after them are never compromised.
I did not think therefore that it was useful or practicable to adopt blindly the attitudes evinced by the English courts on sentencing. On the contrary, I was mindful of the different social and moral considerations which prevail in the two countries, and in particular of the divergence between Asian conservatism and the more liberal western society. In the result, I did not find any of the sentencing figures extracted from the English cases to be directly relevant to the present case. In any event, I was of the view that those figures, even if they were to be considered, could not be taken in the abstract, but had to be looked at in proportion to the maximum sentence prescribed for the offence in question, if any meaningful comparison to the present case was to be made at all. In 
 R v Lane 
 David Robert (supra) therefore, a case which involved some measure of aggravation, the substituted sentence of nine months` imprisonment must be looked at as being in effect three-eighths of the maximum punishment permissible in England. On the other hand, a sentence of nine months in the present case was in effect only three-twentieths of the statutory maximum term of five years, thus already more than amply compensating for the admitted lack of similar aggravating features. Similarly in 
 R v Asher 
 Lloyd Alston (supra), the sentence of six months was a full quarter of the maximum sentence prescribed as compared to three-twentieths in this case. In the premises, I was not convinced that the sentence of nine months` imprisonment in the present case, given our diverse social and cultural norms, was in any way excessive. If anything, I was inclined to the view that nine months was in fact on the low side.
Counsel finally sought to highlight to me certain mitigating factors which he felt warranted a reduction in his client`s sentence. He pressed upon me, in particular, the fact that the sexual activity was consensual, that the complainant had had a long history of sexual intercourse with a string of older men and it was further implied that she had to a large extent sought out or tempted the appellant by sharing her lurid experiences with him. In addition, I was also reminded of the appellant`s early plea of guilt and the fact that social admonition and shame was by far the greatest form of punishment for the appellant, a hitherto happily-married family man.
While I appreciated counsel`s able and forceful arguments in the above regard, regretfully, I could not agree with him. In my view, issues of consent are entirely irrelevant to offences under s 140(1)(i) of the Women`s Charter, the policy of which is to afford blanket protection to young girls who are regarded by the statute as being mentally and emotionally unprepared to handle relationships of a sexual nature. Girls under the age of 16 are thus deemed by the law to be incapable of giving valid consent to a sexual act, and, in my view, rightly so, as many at that age are ill-equipped to handle the serious social consequences which often arise out of just one single night of reckless passion. These girls often lack not just the resources but the emotional strength of mind to cope with the heavy responsibilities of an unplanned pregnancy and worse, the physical and psychological trauma of having to undergo an abortion. The spectre of unwanted children, its links to juvenile delinquency and the concomitant effects on the progress of modern society all collectively favour the legislative policy of strict liability where sexual intercourse with underaged girls is concerned. Much as these girls may have procured or actively initiated the encounter, the purpose of s 140(1)(i) is to place the onus on the male adult to exercise restraint and discipline in curbing his carnality. In this respect, the law may be said to be paternalistic, and perhaps even overprotective in seeking to guard young girls from a precocious desire for sexual experience. Nevertheless the social and humane reasons for such a welfare state of the law are too compelling to be ignored. In my view, the court has to send out a clear signal to the public that men who engage in sexual intercourse with girls under 16 do so at their own peril. In particular, where the age difference between the parties is significant, the man can be expected to be punished more severely as his offence can then no longer be regarded as merely the result of the false steps of youth but rather the conscious and calculated decision of a mature adult.
I do not think it is necessary for me to lay down, as the English cases have done, the range or type of sentences that should be passed according to the nature of the offender or the circumstances of the parties` relationship. In my view, each case should be looked at and decided on its own facts, and I do not think it is possible or wise to lay down fixed or closed categories of the spectrum of sentences which should be passed. Suffice it for me to say that adult men of mature years who have carnal connection with young girls can without doubt expect to have stiff custodial sentences imposed on them.
Reverting to the facts of the present case, I felt, in spite of counsel`s assertions that his client was truly contrite and remorseful as evidenced by his early plea of guilt, that the sentence of nine months` imprisonment was still nevertheless somewhat inadequate. This was but one of an alarming number of recent cases to involve men who meet young girls over the internet and thereafter have sexual intercourse with them. While I have no doubt that the internet is and has been an efficient medium of communication and its uses and functionalities highly contributory to the progress and development of the new economy, I also had to be mindful of the fact that it is a medium that is easily accessible and is in fact frequently accessed by persons of all ages, particularly in an information-technology savvy nation like Singapore. As such, it is not surprising that it was only a matter of time before abuse of the web became rampant, and the law has to develop in such a way as to keep such abuse in check. While parents have the primary responsibility of educating and warning their children of the inherent dangers posed by the internet, the law too has an accompanying duty to ensure that our children and young persons are allowed to exploit the wonders of modern technology with as little risk as possible to the safety and security of both their minds and bodies. The easy availability of the internet and its services to the ordinary man and child in the street on the one hand and the emboldening security that it provides to the unscrupulous who are allowed to hide their true identities and remain faceless whilst preying on the young, gullible and immature on the other, both led me to the conclusion that a deterrent sentence was warranted in the present case. Indeed I felt it my duty to arrest the rising trend of such internet sex cases which, if they were not eradicated early, would result in the utter disintegration of the moral fabric of our yet conservative society.
While I accepted counsel`s argument that the extent to which a victim agreed to and encouraged what was done is relevant to an accused`s mitigation, it was not the be-all and end-all of the matter. Many other factors also have to be looked at at the same time. As already alluded to, consent per se is not a defence to an offence under s 140(1)(i) of the Women`s Charter. Quite frankly, I found the whole argument about consent to be difficult to comprehend since a lack of consent in the first place would have attracted a charge of rape under the more serious provisions of the Penal Code (Cap 224), rather than merely the statutory offence prescribed by the Women`s Charter. Similarly if there had indeed been any trickery, deception or violence, then any consent given by the woman would clearly have been vitiated, thus warranting a charge of rape as well. As a result, I am of the view that consent of the girl should not be treated as a mitigating factor in cases under s 140(1)(i) as it appears to me that such consent would in any event have been forthcoming in a majority of the cases brought under s 140(1)(i) anyway.
Having said that, I had no doubt that the complainant in the present case was no innocent virgin to begin with and admittedly, had had her fair share of sexual experiences before sleeping with the appellant. Nevertheless, the offence committed by the appellant with a girl just one-third his age remained a serious one for which the law provides no excuse. If the appellant was indeed anything as sensible and mature as his counsel made him out to be, then all the more he should have known better than to further the moral corruption of one whom he knew or thought was already debauched. Instead, he had no reservations about taking advantage of the easy opportunity which presented itself to him and exploited it fully to gratify his lust. What was most reprehensible was the fact that he remained completely devoid of guilt or remorse whether towards himself or his family after the incident as evidenced by his continuing association with the complainant over the next few months. The circumstances further suggest that he would probably have had no qualms about sleeping with her again a second time had he not been apprehended by the police before he could make it to her flat.
In the light of the appellant`s patently irresponsible behaviour, both towards the complainant and her family and society at large, I had no hesitation that a deterrent sentence was necessitated in the present case in order to serve as a stern warning to like-minded men who seek to use the medium of the internet to gain, falsely, the trust of young immature girls and thereafter to sexually exploit them. In my view, the benchmark sentence for offences of the nature of the one here committed should be one year`s imprisonment and a fine to reflect the court`s intolerance of the conduct exhibited. Upon a review of all the circumstances in this case, I was of the view that a 12-month prison term was more appropriate and substituted the sentence accordingly. I should add that such a sentence, being but one-fifth of the maximum possible, should be considered as being at the lower end of the spectrum and that the lower courts ought to have little hesitation in enhancing it further in future cases which contain more severe aggravating factors. I also imposed the maximum fine of $10,000 on the appellant in order to remind him and others of the heavy price that they would have to pay even for one solitary moment of indulgent foolishness.

: This was an appeal against the decision of the District Judge Salina Ishak in a private summons case when she convicted the respondent of one offence each under ss 352, 341 and 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The respondent was sentenced to a fine of $500 (in default two days` imprisonment) in respect of the first offence, a fine of $500 (in default two days` imprisonment) in respect of the second offence, and a fine of $1,000 (in default five days` imprisonment) in respect of the third offence. The appellant appealed against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate. Although the Public Prosecutor had not been involved directly in the proceedings, he took the unusual step of intervening in the appeal. He submitted that the appeal be discontinued. I ordered that the appeal be discontinued and now give my reasons.

 The facts 
 
 
 
 
 
Both the appellant and respondent conduct business from units in a building complex called Balestier Point. The appellant operates a health centre and was the chairman of the Balestier Point Management Corporation at the material time. The respondent is a car dealer and parked cars which were offered for sale by his business at the car park of Balestier Point.
Some time before the incident occurred, the appellant had instituted rules which imposed a charge on the transfer of season parking labels from one vehicle to another. This materially affected the respondent`s business and that of other car dealers operating in the complex, as the dealers would transfer the season parking labels from cars which they had sold to cars which were yet to be sold. With the introduction of this scheme, they were looking to incur significant transfer fees. If the parking label used on a vehicle had not been issued for that vehicle, the vehicle was liable to be wheel-clamped and a fee would have to be paid to have the clamp released. The respondent`s unhappiness about this situation was the backdrop for the offences.
On 15 September 2000, the respondent confronted the appellant and wanted to know if the appellant had caused one of his vehicles (without a valid season parking label) to be wheel-clamped. The judge accepted the appellant`s evidence of the events that subsequently transpired. The cogent facts were as follows. The respondent insisted on talking to the appellant and raised his hands to prevent the appellant from proceeding to the restroom (this gave rise to the charge under s 341). The respondent hurled vulgarities at the appellant. He said that he would `kill` the appellant if the appellant `touched` his car and that he would `get people to beat` the appellant (this gave rise to the charge under s 506). The respondent also raised his fist, at which point the appellant fled to the security counter and called the police (this gave rise to the charge under s 352).
Some police officers arrived and tried to mediate between the appellant and the respondent. The respondent offered a verbal apology but the appellant insisted on a written one. When the respondent refused, the appellant commenced the private prosecution. The police did not think it necessary to investigate further nor to charge the respondent.
 The judge`s decision 
 
 
 
The judge handed down her grounds of decision on 14 May 2001. She set out in detail the evidence of the prosecution and of the defence. She found that the appellant had proved his case beyond a reasonable doubt, but did not elaborate on how she arrived at that conclusion.
Although the appellant did not expressly argue for a custodial sentence, the key issue in this appeal (as between the appellant and the respondent) was whether the sentence imposed should have included a custodial element. It should be noted that the judge had already imposed the maximum fine in respect of the first two charges, while there is no prescribed maximum fine for the third charge. In deciding that the case did not warrant a custodial sentence, the judge was mindful in particular of the following factors: 
(1) although the police were aware of the matter, they did not conduct further investigations and the Public Prosecutor did not think it necessary to institute a public prosecution; 
(2) the appellant had brought the private prosecution because he was dissatisfied with the respondent`s verbal apology and insisted on a written one; 
(3) the respondent did not cause any physical injury or property damage; 
(4) all three charges arose from the same incident.
 The appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
The appellant`s first ground of appeal was that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and that is the only ground that is of relevance in a court of law. Firstly, in relation to an offence under s 352, the respondent cited 
 Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts 
 to show that, in the absence of aggravating factors, the usual sentence imposed was a fine. There were no aggravating factors in this case; and the fact that the respondent had acted on impulse would negative the seriousness of the crime.
Secondly, although the respondent did not refer to 
 Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts 
 in relation to an offence under s 341, it would be useful to refer to the same. Once again, factors which indicated that the crime was not a serious one were present: one, the respondent acted on impulse, not because he intended to commit a serious offence; and two, the restraint was only momentary.
Thirdly, in relation to an offence under s 506, the respondent referred to the abovementioned book to show that the circumstances of this offence rendered it less serious. For example, although the respondent had threatened to have the appellant beaten up and said he would `kill` the appellant if the appellant touched his car, this was a one-off, impulsive outburst. It did not occur in a deserted place. It did not take place in a wider context of illegal activity.
The appellant`s remaining grounds of appeal were either irrelevant or unsubstantiated.
 Public Prosecutor intervention 
 
 
 
There were two parts to the DPP`s submission. The first was that the Public Prosecutor had a right to intervene to have the proceedings discontinued. The second was that the appeal was without merit. This second issue has been dealt with above.
The starting point was art 35(8) of the Constitution, which states: 
 
The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.
 
 
 
Section 336(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) further provides: 
 
The Attorney-General shall be the Public Prosecutor and shall have the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this Code.
 
 
 
Since the provisions refer to `any proceedings for any offence` and `criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this Code` without qualification, they apply to private prosecutions as well. It would seem that these provisions squarely contemplate the risks particular to private prosecutions, where the complainant may allow his `private passions and prejudices to creep into the conduct` of a criminal appeal ( 
Ponniah v Lim
 
 
[1960] MLJ 152
 ). A private prosecution is a prosecution by a private individual which, if successful, relies on the state machinery to mete out the sentence imposed. In addition, a criminal offence is based on the notion of a wrong committed against society or social values. It follows that a private prosecution should not defeat the interests of state and society (such interests in this context being determined by the Public Prosecutor).
The case law on this subject is also clear. 
Hawa bte Haji Mohamed Hussain v Miranda

[1988] 3 MLJ 397
  and

  involved straightforward applications of art 35(8) and s 336(1).
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the reasons stated above, I ordered that the proceedings be dismissed.

Approach of court
 
: This appeal raised an issue in relation to the operation of s 122(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). In the court below, District Judge Kow Keng Siong ruled against the appellant on this issue. With this and other issues on conviction and sentence, the appellant appealed. I heard his appeal and dismissed it. These were my reasons.
 Background facts 
 
 
 
The appellant was convicted of two charges of outrage of modesty under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`Penal Code`). He was sentenced to six months` imprisonment on the first charge, and to 18 months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane on the second charge, the sentences to be consecutive, totalling 24 months and four strokes.
The complainant was the stepdaughter of the appellant. The appellant married the complainant`s mother, one Mdm Noraidah, sometime in November 1992. The complainant and her younger sibling, Fairoz, were from Mdm Noraidah`s previous marriage, which ended in a divorce. In 1993, Mdm Noraidah gave birth to a baby daughter, Nurulatika.
Since young, the complainant and her brother were cared for by her grandmother, Mdm Hajjah Zainon bte Abdullah (`Mdm Zainon`). They lived in Mdm Zainon`s flat at Empress Road. The appellant and Mdm Noraidah stayed in their flat in Clementi, but visited the children often.
In 1997, the appellant and Mdm Noraidah shifted to their new home at Choa Chu Kang. Shortly thereafter, Mdm Noraidah died in a tragic accident in Johor Bahru. The appellant was with Mdm Noraidah at the material time, but was unhurt. The complainant and her sibling continued to be cared for by their grandmother.
In June 1998, the appellant remarried. The alleged incidents of outrage of modesty took place before Mdm Noraidah`s death.
 Case for the prosecution 
 
 
 
The prosecution charged the appellant with two counts of molest over a three-year period as follows: 
(1) that sometime between May or June 1993 he did use criminal force on the complainant, then aged 10, by pressing his body against her body; and 
(2) that sometime in May 1996 he did use criminal force on the complainant, then aged 13, by using his fingers to touch her vagina.
The evidence advanced by the prosecution was simple. On 22 May 1998, the appellant met several members of his deceased wife`s family at his home in Choa Chu Kang for a family meeting. The appellant`s brother was also present. Somewhat unfortunately, the amicable mood at the commencement of the meeting degenerated into a confrontation and certain allegations were made by Mdm Zainon and Mdm Normalah, who was Mdm Noraidah`s sister, against the appellant. Against this background, the appellant filed a police report.
Defending their allegations, a report was also filed by the complainant. It transpired that the allegations made by Mdm Zainon and Mdm Normalah were accusations of impropriety by the appellant against his stepdaughter, and the police report was to the same effect. It was also not disputed that the complainant`s report was written on her behalf by her uncle, Mr Norazrin, who was a former police officer.
The complainant`s police report led to investigations of the alleged molest incidents. The first occurrence took place sometime in May 1993 outside her grandmother`s flat. The complainant was only ten then. Mdm Zainon was in Mecca, and the appellant and Mdm Noraidah had moved in to stay with the children temporarily. According to the complainant, the appellant told her to lean against the wall along the corridor, and lifted her skirt before pressing his penis against her groin. Both were clothed at all times and the appellant did not expose himself to her. Yet, the complainant felt very disgusted by the whole experience, but kept the incident to herself. She did not know what to expect, nor was she certain that what the appellant did was correct or acceptable.
When Mdm Zainon returned from Mecca, the complainant related the abovementioned incident to her. She also added that there was some rubbing involved. Mdm Zainon expressed her disbelief, contrary to the complainant`s insistence that it was true. In the end, she told the complainant not to continue `this nonsense`, and the complainant complied.
The second molest incident occurred several years later, when the complainant brought her younger brother to visit her mother and their stepsister. The complainant was then 13. Whilst she was in her mother`s bedroom, the appellant entered, and told the complainant to lie down on the mattress. He then unzipped her jeans, and told her to relax. Following this, he put his hands into her underwear and used his fingers to touch her vagina. The whole episode lasted for a short while. All this while, the complainant was too frightened to do anything.
After touching her, the appellant instructed the complainant not to reveal what had occurred. The complainant zipped her jeans and walked out of the room. Despite her requests to leave the house immediately, this was rejected by Mdm Noraidah, who insisted on sending her and her younger brother home later. The complainant claimed she was angry with Mdm Noraidah for this, but was helpless. She did not reveal the molest incident to her mother for fear that she would not be believed, since it implicated her stepfather, nor did she want to hurt her mother`s feelings. Her mother might end up scolding her for it.
On her return home, the complainant went straight to her room and started crying. She felt disgusted, frustrated and violated by the appellant`s actions. Noticing her granddaughter`s behaviour, Mdm Zainon questioned her, and the complainant confided in her grandmother. She was asked to confirm the truth of her events, which she did without hesitation. Upon hearing this, Mdm Zainon was visibly upset. After a short silence, she instructed the complainant not to reveal the incident to anyone, including her mother. She also made the complainant promise not to tell anyone.
As a child often would, the complainant disobeyed her grandmother, and told her close friend, one Evelyn, about the appellant`s actions the very next day, but no details of the molest were disclosed. Evelyn had noticed that the complainant looked extremely upset and had been crying throughout the day. As a result, she pressed the complainant constantly for the reason. When asked if the complainant had made a police report, the complainant replied in the negative, indicating that her grandmother had forbidden her to do so.
After Mdm Noraidah`s unfortunate accident, the complainant thought time should just heal all wounds, and never brought up the incidents again. After all, there were now less reason for the appellant to visit her at her grandmother`s flat, as the appellant had remarried soon afterwards.
In so far as the complainant`s presence at the appellant`s home on 22 May 1998 resulted in her police report, the complainant testified that she went there only because she wanted to retrieve some of her deceased mother`s old photos and clothes. It was unexpected that her grandmother would inadvertently blurt out the said allegations and accuse the appellant of improper conduct towards the complainant in the past. According to the complainant, the appellant, who was then standing, slumped onto the couch upon hearing the allegations.
As regards the complainant`s police statement made that same night, the complainant admitted that she related the molest incidents to her uncle Norazrin who then wrote the report for her. Mdm Zainon confirmed the information regarding the number of occasions and the times when the incidents occurred.
 The trial below 
 
 
 
During the trial, defence counsel applied to be furnished with a copy of the complainant`s statement to the police in the course of their investigations under s 122(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), with a view towards impeaching the complainant and discrediting her testimony. This application was rejected by the district judge, who felt that, on a purposive reading of s 122(2), it did not compel him to refer to the complainant`s statement to the police, for the purposes of deciding if at all the appellant should be given a copy of that statement; rather, s 122(2) conferred on him a discretion whether to refer to the statement or not, and defence counsel had to show why he should in fact exercise his discretion to do so. This counsel had not done. In any event, the district judge was of the view that counsel was on a fishing expedition for information in order to conduct a discovery of the prosecution evidence, and was determined that he would not countenance the use of procedural rules for such purposes.
Turning to the trial proper, the district judge found much force in the prosecution`s case. According to him, the district judge found the complainant`s testimony reliable. It was, in all respects, materially consistent and inherently credible. Her evidence, corroborated by her grandmother, her classmate Evelyn, her uncle Norazrin and her aunt Mdm Normalah, stood up against rigorous cross-examination by defence counsel. The complainant was, by all standards, an impressive witness who remained unshaken in her testimony. Even the defence conceded that she gave evidence confidently and with good attention to detail. The district judge concluded (at [para ]76 of his grounds of decision): 
 
After having carefully scrutinised [the complainant`s] testimony and demeanour against the totality of the evidence, I am of the view that she is a reliable witness. She did not strike me as a vindictive person who was motivated by malice to lie or embellish her evidence against the appellant.
 
 
 
In considering the prosecution`s case, the district judge also paid particular attention to the evidence of Mdm Zainon, the complainant`s grandmother who shared an extremely close relationship with her and who substantially confirmed the complainant`s version of events. He was constantly mindful that Mdm Zainon`s evidence could possibly be infected because of her close proximity to the complainant, yet concluded that it was safe to rely on her evidence because it did not appear to be tailored to suit the testimony of the complainant. In all circumstances, much as Mdm Zainon and the complainant shared a maternal-like bonding between them, as regards her testimony, Mdm Zainon at all times acted independently giving her side of the story as she saw it.
The appellant`s defence was one of bare denial. He claimed that he got along well with the complainant, and defence counsel suggested that there were ulterior motives to frame him; first the complainant blamed the appellant for her mother`s death and, secondly, she was influenced by the rest of Mdm Noraidah`s family members, who wanted to claim the Choa Chu Kang flat which now belonged to the appellant. Both these submissions were rejected by the district judge, as there was no conceivable reason why the complainant or anyone else would want to falsely implicate or frame the appellant.
The appellant called only one other witness to support his version of events, and that was his brother, Ramli bin Othman (`Ramli`). Ramli did not lend weight or credibility to the appellant`s denial of misconduct against the complainant, and his evidence was only to the extent that he confirmed that the family meeting of 22 May 1998 turned sour. However, he could not recall any allegations of misbehaviour by Mdm Zainon or anyone else. He thought that the dispute which arose related to `some property matters`.
Having regard to the totality of the evidence, including the fact that the appellant was not a credible witness who had tailored his testimony to dissociate himself from evidence which could have implicated him on the charges of molest, and the highly frivolous contentions from the defence that the complainant and her relatives had a hidden agenda against the appellant, the district judge found that the prosecution had proven their case against the former beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, he was convicted and sentenced to a total of 24 months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane; six months` imprisonment for the first charge and 18 months` imprisonment and four stokes of the cane for the second charge; both to run consecutively. This reflected the severity of the offences, particularly the second charge, and the abusing of the appellant`s status as her stepfather in whom the complainant reposed trust.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 SECTION 122(2)
 
Amongst other issues, one of the grounds of appeal of the appellant related to the operation of s 122(2) of the CPC. It will be recalled that counsel for the appellant applied, by way of s 122(2), for a copy of the complainant`s statement to the police, with a view towards impeaching her credit (see [para ]19 above). The following were the reasons for which the district judge refused the application (from [para ]32-34 of his grounds of decision): 
 
 
32 In my view, the word `shall` in section 122(2) should be construed in the directory and not the mandatory sense - in that the Court retains the discretion whether or not to refer to the witness` police statement. In my opinion, an applicant must assist the Court by stating why there are grounds for believing that material contradictions exist between a witness` testimony and his police statement before a Court can consider whether to refer to the witness` statement. To put it another way, a Court should not refer to the witness` statement when the application is hinged on mere suspicion by the applicant, without any basis, that such contradictions exists. My reasons for these views are as follows. 
 
33 Looking at section 122(2) in its entirety, it is obvious that the purpose of requesting the Court to refer to a witness` statement is to draw its attention to the possibility of material discrepancies between that statement and his testimony. This may be relevant in deciding whether there are grounds to proceed to impeach the witness` credit. Considering the objective behind section 122(2), it is incumbent on the applicant, at the very least, to show why there are grounds for believing that such discrepancies may exist. 
 
34 If such an approach is not taken and the Court must refer to the witness` statement whenever there is an application under section 122(2), then there is a very real danger of our Courts being inundated with a flood of frivolous applications under that section by parties out on a fishing expedition. This would surely lead to the undesirable result of (a) trials being unduly prolonged, and (b) judicial efforts being unnecessarily expended in having to consider statements containing extraneous matters which usually would be irrelevant, inadmissible and sometimes even prejudicial. This would certainly defeat Parliament`s intention in enacting our Criminal Procedure Code, which must surely be to regulate criminal procedure for the effective, efficient and fair administration of criminal justice.
  
 
 
He continued (from [para ]36-38): 
 
 
36 In the present case, the Defence did not (a) refer to any extraneous matter, (b) nor show in any way that [the complainant] had given evidence in such a manner, which would suggest that her testimony is different from her police statements. In any event, I found that there is no such evidence to suggest that such contradictions exist. 
 
37 Instead, the basis of the Defence`s application under section 122(2) was that there were discrepancies between [the complainant`s] evidence and that of Mdm Zainon`s relating to what [the complainant] had told her about the nature of the molests. I am of the view that it would have been wrong for me to refer to [the complainant`s] statement on the ground suggested by the Defence. 
 
a. Firstly, it does not logically follow that just because there are discrepancies between the evidence of 2 witnesses, one of them might have given a police statement which is inconsistent with his testimony. After all, it is common for witnesses to contradict each other for wholly innocent reasons, unconnected with their police statements: 
Chean Siong Guat v PP
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
 . 
 
b. Secondly, a natural implication of the Defence position is that they would be entitled to invite the Court to refer to Mdm Zainon`s police statements as well, since she could also have contradicted herself when testifying in Court. If that is the case, is there any valid justification why the Court should only refer to [the complainant`s] statements and not Mdm Zainon`s? Would the Court have to be saddled with the task of referring to both their statements to consider whether there should be an impeachment exercise, and if so whom, thereby complicating the issues and protracting the trial? 
 
38 The Defence argued that the Appellant would be prejudiced if I did not even refer to [the complainant`s] statement to discover whether the discrepancies in fact exist. Though this may seem to be an attractive argument at first blush, I did not find any merit in it. It is plain that the Defence application under section 122(2) for [the complainant`s] statements was in the nature of a fishing exercise. In effect, what the Defence was attempting to do was to enlist the services of the Court (under the guise of section 122(2)) to conduct a discovery of the Prosecution`s evidence. Our Courts have made it clear that they do not countenance the use of our procedural rules for such purposes:

The difficulty accepting the district judge`s reasoning, so argued counsel, was that it smacked against several authorities in our jurisdiction and our neighbour`s. Further, a literal reading of s 122(2) saw no requirement to establish grounds or provide evidence to justify the belief that the witness statement was different from his evidence before a court would refer to it, and decide its use so stated in the latter half of s 122(2). In other words, s 122(2) 
 compelled 
 a court, at the request of the accused or the prosecutor, to refer to any statement made by any witness (other than the accused) to the police in the course of police investigations, either with a view towards furnishing the accused with a copy of that statement; and/or using the statement for impeachment purposes. There was no discretion on the court to refuse reference to that statement, even if the court did not subsequently allow the accused a copy of the statement, ie such an obligation of the judge was mandatory, not directory.
Section 122(2), for our purposes, reads: 
 
When any witness is called for the prosecution or for the defence, other than the accused, the court 
 shall
, on the request on the accused or the prosecutor, refer to any statement made by that witness to a police officer in the course of a police investigation under this Chapter and may then, if the court thinks it expedient in the interests of justice, direct the accused to be furnished with a copy of it; and the statement may be used to impeach the credit of the witness in the manner provided by the Evidence Act. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
Counsel`s contentions hinged on the word `
 shall 
`, which he argued connoted an obligation without discretion on the part of the court.
In support of his arguments, counsel advanced three cases. The first was the case of 
Yohannan v R
 
 
[1963] MLJ 57
 . This was a magistrate`s appeal of Chua J, decided on 21 December 1962. In this case, the accused was charged and convicted of the offence of rioting under s 147 of the Penal Code. During his trial, the accused sought to obtain the statement of the main prosecution witness, also the victim injured during the riot, made to the police under s 121(2) of the CPC (our equivalent of s 122(2)) on the ground that it did not disclose the offence charged. The magistrate denied the application.
On appeal, Chua J overturned the magistrate`s decision. Holding that the object of s 121(2) was to protect the accused against untruthful witnesses and the police, the learned judge continued (at p 58H): 
 
The law appears to me to be perfectly clear. There is a definite provision [under s 121(2)] under which the Court is 
 obliged
, on the request of the accused, to refer to the statement of the witness to the police and the Court has a discretion, if it thinks it expedient in the interest of justice, to direct that the accused be furnished with a copy of it to enable the accused to impeach the credit of the witness in manner provided by the Evidence Ordinance. The right given to the accused by s 121(2) is a very valuable one and often provides important material for cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
The legal effect of the magistrate`s error was this (at p 59A): 
 
There is no doubt in this case that [the accused] had lost the chance of putting to the witness ... his previous statement in case it happened to be contradictory. The omission by the Magistrate to refer to the statement of [the witness] had prejudiced [the accused] and it cannot be said that [the accused] had a fair trial. There has been a failure of justice in this case and the conviction cannot be sustained. The conviction of [the accused] is quashed and the sentence set aside.
 
 
 
 
 
 Yohannan v R 
 
 (supra) was referred to and followed in 
Chandrasekaran v PP
 
 
[1971] 1 MLJ 153
 . Here, two accused were charged and convicted of abetment of the offence of defrauding the government. Amongst the various grounds of appeal put forward, only one concerned the present case, namely that the court below erred in denying one of the accused his right to a copy of a statement made by a witness to the police for the purpose of cross-examination. The court gave its decision in the following terms (at pp 161I-162E): 
 
Section 113(1) (
 sic
) of the Criminal Procedure Code confers an unfettered discretion on the court to direct the accused to be furnished with a copy of the police statement for purposes of impeaching credit. If an accused or his counsel has reason to believe that the evidence which the witness gives in the witness box differs in material particulars from the police statement he or his counsel can request the court to refer to a particular passage or passages in the statement and the court is obliged to refer to them. Failure to refer to such statement is a denial of justice. (See 
Yohannan v R
 
 
[1963] MLJ 57
 ). The court then exercises its discretion whether to furnish the accused with a copy of the police statement. The true test when exercising such discretion seems to be that the police statement must afford material for serious challenge to the credibility or reliability of the witness on matters relevant to the prosecution case. (See 
Mohamed Fiaz Baksh v The Queen
 
[1958] AC 167
). If the court finds there is no material to afford a serious challenge to the credibility or reliability of the witness, the accused need not be furnished with a copy of the police statement. In the present case the learned president at the request of counsel had referred to the police statement and he had come to the conclusion that there was no material for serious challenge to the credibility or reliability of PW55. I do not think that, merely because he had rejected the application, it can be said that he had failed to exercise his discretion judicially and that he had applied the wrong test in applying the provisions of section 113 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
 
 
 
 
 
 Chandrasekaran v PP 
 
 was a Malaysian decision. Section 113(ii) of the CPC in Malaysia was in pari materia with s 122(2), although the full section of s 113 dealt with statements to police not to be signed or admitted in evidence, as compared to s 122, which dealt with the admissibility of statements to police. I should point out that s 113(1) in the abovecited passage in fact referred to s 113(ii), as s 113(1) was non-existent under that section at the material time and s 113(i) was a general bar against statements made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation to be used in evidence.
Section 113 has since been superseded, and the current s 113 in no way resembles the old provisions since 
 Chandrasekaran v PP 
 (supra) was decided. In the Malaysian context, there is now no provision akin to our s 122(2) which allows defence counsel to refer any court to any statements made to the police with a view towards obtaining them for purposes of impeachment except as provided in the following manner by s 113(1): 
 
Where any person is charged with any offence any statement, whether the statement amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after the person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not and whether or not wholly or partly in answer to questions, by that person to or in the hearing or any police officer of or above the rank of Inspector and whether or not interpreted to him by another police officer or other person shall be admissible in evidence at his trial and, if the person charged tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit.
 
 
 
Section 113(1) is followed by several qualifications which are not relevant for purposes of this appeal.
The third case relied on by counsel was the case of 
Samsudin v PP
 
 
[1962] MLJ 405
 . 
 Samsudin v PP 
 concerned an appeal by the accused, who was convicted in the High Court of Penang for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The accused argued that the trial judge erred in failing to supply him with copies of the statements of two witnesses made to the police, even though the trial judge had referred to the statements. His counsel had applied under s 124(2) of the CPC to be supplied with copies of these statements.
Upholding the decision of the trial judge, the court gave the rationale for s 124(2) (which was in similar terms to our s 122(2)) (at p 406H): 
 
Obviously the policy behind the provisions of the subsection is that where a witness gives evidence in Court which the prosecution knows or the defence either knows or suspects to be in conflict with a statement which he has previously made to the police, it is in the interests of justice that the judge should be made aware of the discrepancy so that the credibility of the witnesses may be tested by cross-examination, under which he will either explain, or fail to explain, the discrepancy to the satisfaction of the Court.
 
 
 
 
 
 Samsudin v PP 
 
 dealt with the application of s 124(2) of the CPC in 1962. The CPC in this instance referred not to the Federal Statutes of Malaysia, as was the case for 
 Chandrasekaran v PP 
 (supra), but to the Straits Settlements Ordinance, applicable in `the Islands and Territories known as the Straits Settlements` under the East India Co until they `became a separate Colony when the Government of the Straits Settlements Act 1866 was brought into force on 1 April 1867`. For what reasons this piece of legislation was applied, more so in 1962, than the Federated Laws of Malaysia in 
 Chandrasekaran v PP 
 was never made known, although s 124(2) was in exactly the same terms as s 113(ii).
The upshot of the three cases, argued by counsel, was this: the court`s reference to witness statements to the police under s 122(2) was premised upon the request of either the prosecution or the defence. Without even referring to the statements, the court would not be aware of the discrepancies therein, if any, and would therefore give more weight to the embellished accounts of the witness`s testimony in court than they deserve. The effect would be that the defence was deprived of the chance of testing the credibility of these witnesses under cross-examination.
Section 122(2) can be divided into two limbs, the first being the application by the prosecution or defence for the witness statement, whereupon the court 
 shall 
 refer to it, and the second being the court`s discretion, in the interests of justice, to furnish such statement to the accused, and/or for the purposes of impeaching the maker of the statement. Our concern was with the first limb, particularly so with respect to the defence. I say this as the reality of the situation is that the prosecution would invariably have a copy of any witness statements made to the police, and would therefore never have to ask the court to refer to it without any justifiable reasons.
Having thoroughly considered the three abovementioned cases, I took the view that counsel`s arguments, though highly attractive, were misconceived. It was a misunderstanding of the three cases that an application under s 122(2) for the court`s reference to witness statements did not require justification.
The facts in 
 Yohannan v R 
 (supra) were brief, and did not state in detail the circumstances of the case. However, there were, implicit from the facts therein, grounds for asking for the police statement of the witness as it was the belief that the contents were different from the testimony of the witness in court, such that it could absolve the accused of his offence charged. The facts of this case, in more detail, was this: the accused was arrested for injuring his victim. Prior to the arrest, the victim had made a police report wherein he claimed he was assaulted by several persons, one of whom was the accused. He made a second report, but was told subsequently that his case was one of a non-seizable nature, and that he had to take out a summons under s 323 to prosecute the accused for voluntarily causing hurt. For some reason which was not obvious from the facts, the accused was eventually charged with rioting under s 147 of the Penal Code. On this basis, in the course of cross-examining the victim, counsel for the accused requested the magistrate to refer to his second report under s 121(2). It was counsel`s contentions that the second report did not disclose an offence under s 147, rather it disclosed only an offence of voluntarily causing hurt. It was in this context that the magistrate refused the request, which decision led to the allowing of the appeal by Chua J.
Chua J`s ratio was in extremely wide terms, but read against the background facts, it was no different from the position that a court must be provided with justifiable reasons before referring to statements made to the police under s 122(2) which were not tendered in court as evidence. The district judge`s approach in the court below was not a departure from the approach in 
 Yohannan v R 
, rather it was an endorsement of it.
 Chandrasekaran v PP 
 (supra) shed more light on this matter. It was tacitly stated in that case that there must be some reason to believe that the statement to be referred by the court was actually inconsistent with the witness`s testimony. This could be seen from the judgment where the court so held (also reproduced at [para ]32 above): 
 
Section 113(1) (
 sic
) of the Criminal Procedure Code confers an unfettered discretion on the court to direct the accused to be furnished with a copy of the police statement for purposes of impeaching credit.
 If an accused or his counsel has reason to believe that the evidence which the witness gives in the witness box differs in material particulars from the police statement he or his counsel can request the court to refer to a particular passage or passages in the statement and the court is obliged to refer to them. Failure to refer to such statement is a denial of justice
. (See 
Yohannan v R
 
 
[1963] MLJ 57
 ). [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
The italicised passage was clear. There must be reason to believe that the evidence which a witness gave in the witness box 
 differed 
 in material particulars from his police statement. Only when the court was satisfied of this would they then be 
 obliged 
 to refer to the statement, and in this sense they had no discretion.
The position taken by the court in 
 Samsudin v PP 
 (supra) did not deviate from either 
 Yohannan v R 
 and 
 Chandrasekaran v PP 
. On the contrary, it reinforced the position that unless `a witness [gave] evidence in Court which the prosecution [knew] or the defence either [knew] or [suspected] to be in conflict with a statement which he has previously made to the police` (per Good JA at p 406I), the court shall not entertain reference to that statement.
The resultant approach to s 122(2) was this: unless and until counsel showed, to the court`s satisfaction, grounds for belief that the witness statement ought to be referred to, more often than not because the statement was in contradiction to the witness`s testimony in court, the court shall not refer to the said statement. Without this inherent checking mechanism, any criminal court would invariably receive a floodgate of frivolous applications based on pure speculation.
Naturally, once grounds were put forward, and the court was satisfied that there was reason to believe the existence of such contradiction or inconsistency, it shall have no choice but to refer to it to determine the factual basis of the application. On this basis, and this basis alone, the word `shall` in s 122(2) becomes mandatory. This approach not only discouraged the abuse of s 122(2), but also served as some form of sieving mechanism preventing vexatious and groundless applications. In addition, it was in the interests of justice that the court be aware of the contents of the statement to determine the true state of affairs surrounding the trial.
I believe that even counsel in the present case subscribed to this practice. In the trial below, he contended that there were discrepancies between the complainant`s statement to the police and that of her evidence in court. However, there was no basis for this contention, either on the facts of the case or otherwise. In the instance, the district judge concluded that counsel was in effect poking his hand in the dark hoping to discover something in his favour. He was, in the words of the district judge, on a `fishing expedition`, making use of the court under the guise of s 122(2) to conduct a discovery of the prosecution`s evidence.
My approach was consistent with my reasoning in 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
 , where I undertook an extensive discussion of s 122. I explained the purpose of s 122, read from s 122(1), as thus (at p 151B): 
 
Rather, s 122(1) ensures that evidence given out of court to police officers are only adduced as evidence if there is either a good foundation for the reliability of these out of court statements either as being exceptions to the hearsay rule or exceptions governed by policy considerations that is, being within one of the exceptions listed in ss 122(2), (3) and (5). This is reflected imperfectly in the contention expressed in 
 Yohannan
 that a basis for the prohibition contained in s 122(1) is that witnesses may be untruthful.
 
 
 
The intention of s 122 was to restrict all statements made out of court, except as provided by sub-ss (2), (3) and (5). It was a blanket prohibition on witness statements unless so expressed. If counsel`s arguments were correct, it would circumvent the whole restriction cast by s 122(1) and in effect allow for admission of witness statements by the back door. It could not be that the specific provision of s 122(2), stated as an exception to s 122(1), could virtually override the general prohibition in such a manner.
The practical effect of counsel`s arguments was akin to opening up a Pandora`s box on witness statements. It was also a mode of criminal discovery for the defence. Time and again, I have made the observation that the form of trial prescribed in our CPC has never been to provide for any form of pre-trial or trial disclosure by the prosecution. I reiterated this position again in my recent case of 
Selvarajan James v PP
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 750
  at [para ]18 and 19: 
 
 
18 The procedure for criminal discovery in Singapore is governed by the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the `CPC`). The CPC does not impose on the prosecution an onerous duty of disclosure. This differs from the requirements in civil cases where extensive rules of discovery are provided for in the Rules of Court. For criminal cases, there is no requirement in the CPC for the prosecution to disclose witnesses` statements to the defence ... 
 
19 The present duty of disclosure on the part of the prosecution in criminal cases, as provided for in the CPC, is minimal. This position is not necessarily the most ideal and it has been argued on numerous occasions that more disclosure and early disclosure on the part of the prosecution are desirable to ensure that the accused knows the case that has to be met and as such would get a fairer trial. However, it is not for this court to impose such requirements on the prosecution. It is for Parliament to decide if it wants to enact these revisions when it updates the CPC and, until then, the court cannot direct the prosecution to produce witnesses` statements to the defence.
  
 
 
Section 122(2) was not the process to provide for criminal discovery, neither was this case the forum to do so. In the instance, counsel`s appeal on this issue failed.
The remainder of counsel`s appeal was canvassed along the line that the district judge erred in his findings of fact. I dealt with them in the following manner.
 ULTERIOR MOTIVE AND CONSPIRACY AND/OR CONTAMINATION
This issue was similarly brought up in the trial below, and went along the following lines: there was a theory of conspiracy between Mdm Noraidah`s family against the appellant, the collective ulterior motive being to lay claim on the appellant`s Choa Chu Kang flat where he stayed with Mdm Noraidah before her death. Counsel argued that Mdm Zainon and the rest of the prosecution witnesses had ample motive and opportunity to conspire and tailor their evidence to support their allegations against the appellant.
I felt this contention bordered along the lines of frivolity. Even so, the district judge was alive to this remote possibility, but dismissed it after some consideration. I agreed with him.
The complainant was candid about the fact that the appellant became her stepfather after his marriage to Mdm Noraidah. For a child who never experienced the joys of paternal love and concern, the appellant`s arrival marked a welcome change in her life. In her words: `Basically I felt happy and I was telling myself finally I am having a father now.` It was evident that she bore no grudges against the appellant and had no reason to entrap him on allegations of wrongdoing. Likewise, the appellant admitted that he got along well with the complainant.
The appellant`s conspiracy theory was, in all respects, speculative in nature. There was not an iota of evidence from the defence to support such a theory, nor was it evident, if at all, from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. Granted that it was possible that the latter`s evidence could be doctored together, yet that collective evidence was neither one-sided nor skewed entirely against the appellant. In fact, there were discrepancies which were highlighted by defence counsel, but nothing significant which affected the prosecution`s case against the appellant.
The conspiracy theory invariably tied in with the danger that the complainant`s family members might have corrupted their evidence by discussing the molest incidents with each other, each reinforcing the gravity of the offence whilst giving evidence in court. The district judge was fully conscious of this possibility. The law in this respect was contained in my judgment in 
Lee Kwang Peng v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 278
  at [para ]95-97 and 110: 
 
 
95 [W]here the allegation is one of innocent infection, and there is some evidence suggesting the opportunity for contamination, the court must always be alive to that possibility even if it considers the possibility to be slight. Where an allegation is one of infection (as opposed to conspiracy), the accused is objecting to the probative value of the evidence and not its` (
 sic 
) validity. He is not challenging the evidence as an outright lie, but saying that the degree of veracity of the evidence and the strength of recollection of the witness must be subject to scrutiny. 
 
96 To require the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was no risk of contamination would be oppressive as - and this has already been pointed out - the possibility of contamination must as a necessity always be in the court`s mind so long as the opportunity for contamination was present. If the court must remain sensitive to the possibility of contamination as a matter of legal principle and fairness to the accused, it would be illogical to adopt a test requiring the prosecution to remove all doubt from the court`s mind. 
 
97 The duty of the trial judge in such a position is to consider the evidence of the complainants and to assess the risk and opportunity for contamination. The trial judge must then ask himself or herself what weight is to be attached to the testimony of these witnesses in light of that assessment. The final question is whether that evidence, together with the other evidence before the court, satisfies the standard of proof required of the prosecution.
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
110 Insofar as an allegation of `innocent infection` is concerned, so long as there has been proof of some opportunity of contamination, the weight of the respective complainants` evidence is accordingly diminished. In cases where the opportunity of contamination is so slight as to be insignificant, then the allegation of collusion is not made out and it is safe to convict on the evidence of the complainants provided it is `unusually convincing`. Where, however, the opportunity of contamination is a real opportunity, such that the truth of the complainants` evidence is subject to scepticism, something more is required to justify a conviction. It is conceivable that there will be cases in which the very strength of the complainants` `unusually convincing` evidence derives entirely from the innocent infection. As a result of the potential for injustice which springs from such conspiracy, the law demands evidence originating from some independent source which is capable of confirming the credibility of the complainants` evidence.
  
 
 
Turning to the evidence, there was nothing which showed that Mdm Zainon`s evidence, and the rest of the prosecution witnesses` evidence, were in any way affected by their prior communication with the complainant, or with each other. Apart from confirming the gist of the complainant`s allegations against the appellant, I accepted that none of their testimonies which elaborated the scheme of the appellant`s misbehaviour suggested any hint of contamination. In the event, counsel`s arguments on conspiracy and contamination failed.
 NON-REPORTING OF MISCONDUCT
A common ground of appeal, and one that did not escape counsel, was the non-action of the complainant to report the acts of sexual abuse by the appellant to the police and to any other family members. It was not the prosecution`s case that the complainant never reported the molest incidents, rather it was reported several years after the occasion of the molests. Counsel suggested that this was not consistent with the usual behaviour of victims, although in this case his contention was very much directed at Mdm Zainon, who claimed she prevented the complainant from reporting the molest incidents, either to the police or to anyone else. In the instance, counsel urged me to take the view that the molest incidents could only be fabricated.
I must stress again that, in our context, there is no general rule which requires victims of sexual abuse, or those cognisant with the same matters, to report them immediately, more so to the police. Many cases have repeated this, which stemmed from the conservative nature of our society. In 
Tan Pin Seng v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 418
 , I elaborated on this point (at [para ]29): 
 
... While it is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint to her family or friends, the same cannot be said of a failure to make a prompt police report. In my experience, there is a natural reluctance on the part of victims of sexual offences to make a police report. This stems from a variety of reasons. The victim may keep silent for fear of being stigmatised or disbelieved. She may view the police investigation and the court process, both of which are potentially intrusive and distressing, with trepidation, or she may have been so traumatised by the experience that reporting the offence is simply a very low priority. She may even have been threatened with retaliation if she reported the offence. Her first recourse will invariably be her family and friends rather than the police. Indeed, many of those who do eventually make a police report do so only after they have been persuaded to do so by their family or friends.
 
 
 
I recalled this statement was made in the light of 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
 , where I wrote (at [para ]79): 
 
The evidential value of a prompt complaint often lay not in the fact that making it renders the victim`s testimony more credible. The evidential value of a previous complaint is that the failure to make one renders the victim`s evidence 
 less
 credible. The reason is simply common human experience. It is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint. However, as in all cases where common human experience is used as a yardstick, there may be very good reasons why the victim`s actions depart from it. It would then be an error not to have regard to the explanation proferred (
 sic
). All these merely illustrate the fallacy of adhering to a fixed formula.
 
 
 
The justification given by Mdm Zainon for the inactivity in reporting the appellant`s actions, both to the police and to other family members, was three-fold. One, the complainant was only 10 and 13 respectively when she complained of the appellant`s actions. It was only natural that such allegations, serious in their nature, were viewed with a tint of suspicion by Mdm Zainon, resulting in her instructions to the complainant never to repeat the same to anyone else, lest it turned out to be a silly prank of hers. In my mind, this manner was highly consistent with any other adult in the same circumstances, treading the situation with extreme caution. Next, Mdm Zainon felt it could potentially jeopardise the relationship of the appellant with her daughter if these allegations were let out, since her daughter`s marriage to the appellant was in its infancy. Her daughter had a previous failed marriage, and Mdm Zainon wanted the current one to work. After all, the complainant was staying with her, and she felt that this considerably lessened the chances of a recurrence of molest. Essentially, Mdm Zainon made a judgment call in disallowing the complainant to report the abuse to anyone else. It was not for this court to criticise this call, so long as it was justified.
Finally, it was an embarrassment, amongst family members no less, if the appellant was accused of misconduct towards his own stepdaughter. I accepted that the potential awkwardness and shame which could result from publicising the matter hung on Mdm Zainon`s mind constantly. This was similar to the scenario in 
Soh Yang Tick v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 42
  (at [para ]78): 
 
... I have noted that often, the main reason, amongst others, for not making a police report soon after such an incident is not because the victim has something to hide, rather it is because the victim is afraid of the shame it would bring to the family, should others know about the incident. Making a police report and subsequently having the case dealt with by the courts often attracts undue attention which can be very traumatic for the victim as well as for the family. Also, some victims may be afraid that their word may not be believed. Therefore, they would rather suffer in silence than to see that the culprit is punished. It is for this reason that victims are often reluctant to report any matters to the police. In view of this therefore, the failure to make an early police report will no longer be seen as fatal to the prosecution`s case, unless it can be ascertained with certainty that this failure was due to other reasons which might cast doubt on the victim`s claim of the offence.
 
 
 
I took the view that Mdm Zainon`s explanation was valid given the present situation, and accepted it as justifying the delay in reporting the appellant`s actions to the police. It was conceivable to expect Mdm Zainon to be cautious of her granddaughter`s allegations. Every explanation of non-reporting must be justified, and in this case it was. It was quite by chance that a police report was finally made, although I did not hold this against the complainant.
In any event, the crucial point was that the complainant did complain of the molest incidents promptly, first to her grandmother and then to her close friend Evelyn. This negated any adverse inference which might be drawn in the event of non-reporting or a delay in reporting the offence to the police. Given the circumstances, it was not reasonable to expect the complainant to open her heart to her mother of the appellant`s assaults. It was quite clear that Mdm Zainon was her closest kin.
 EVIDENCE OF THE COMPLAINANT AND THE APPELLANT
Like previous cases which I have decided, the present case was one of a child complaining of a sexual crime committed by the appellant. Much as there was corroboration of the complainant`s testimony, the corroboration was not independent. It was accepted that the rest of the prosecution`s evidence on the molest offences originated from the complainant, and the complainant alone. No one else saw the actual acts of assault. In such a case, the general approach of the courts was not to treat the complainant`s evidence at face value, unless there were reasons to believe the evidence of the complainant was nothing but the truth. Two cases by way of example illustrated this approach. The first was 
 Lee Kwang Peng v PP 
 (supra at [para ]70): 
 
 
 Tang Kin Seng
 and 
 Teo Keng Pong
 were cases involving a single complainant who made allegations against an accused person. The principle emerging from these cases was that, unless the complainant`s evidence alone is so strong that it proves the prosecution`s case beyond reasonable doubt, corroboration is required. By extension, where the complainants` evidence is not so strong as to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, but where the other prosecution witnesses, for example, an eye-witness, can provide 
 direct
 evidence of the offence, such that the combined effect of the evidence is to satisfy the burden of proof, corroboration is similarly not required.
 
 
 
The passage from 
 Lee Kwang Peng v PP 
 was derived from another of my decisions in 
 Tang Kin Seng v PP 
 (supra), where a similar passage so alluded (at [para ]43 and 44): 
 
 
43 ... There is no legal requirement that a judge must warn himself expressly of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant in a case involving sexual offences. There is, however, authority to the effect that it is dangerous to convict on the words of the complainant alone unless her evidence is unusually compelling ... 
 
44 ...
 the right approach is to analyse the evidence for the prosecution and for the defence, and decide whether the complainant`s evidence is so reliable that a conviction based solely on it is not unsafe. If it is not, it is necessary to identify which aspect of it is not so convincing and for which supporting evidence is required or desired 
. [Emphasis is added.]
  
 
 
I could only state, having gone through the evidence of the appellant in some detail, that it suggested a pattern of tailoring his evidence to refute the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. He was evasive, and could not provide legitimate answers to questions posed to him in the court below.
In contrast, I accepted the district judge`s findings that the complainant`s evidence was unusually convincing. She appeared to me, by the way her testimony went, a sensible and intelligent girl, who knew and understood the offences perpetrated on her. It was highly unlikely that the allegations which she made `could have been born from her wild imaginings as a child after her mother remarried and started a new family or could have been the result of blaming the appellant for her mother`s death or could have been the fruit of suggestions planted in her mind by other family members`, as contended by the defence. There was no evidence to show that the appellant and the complainant never got along, or that she had an axe to grind.
The conclusion of the district judge, which I fully endorsed, was this (at [para ]66 of his grounds of decision): 
 
Nonetheless, the Defence urged me to disbelieve [the complainant`s] allegations against the Appellant, arguing that her evidence was `somewhat coached and rehearsed`. Defence submitted that [the complainant`s] confidence in Court is incompatible with that of a victim of molest. I am unable to accept this contention. Having carefully considered her demeanour and her evidence, it was clear to me that her confidence and ready replies to pointed questions about the molest incidents stem from the fact that she was testifying on matters in which she had personally experienced. Indeed, when she was asked why she could remember the molest incidents so clearly, she replied indignantly:
 
 
 
 
If something like this were to happen to you, are you going to simply forget about it or let it stay as a reminder?
  
 
 
Having regard to the totality of the evidence against the appellant, and the appellant`s own testimony, the only conclusion I drew was that the appellant was guilty of the offences as complained. Counsel raised nothing which warranted overturning the findings by the district judge. The law was clear, findings were not to be disturbed in the absence of justifiable reasons.
 Sentence 
 
 
 
In so far as sentencing was concerned, counsel appealed on the basis that the district judge imposed a manifestly excessive sentence on the appellant. He referred to two cases in support: 
Ng Chiew Kiat v PP
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 370
 , where the appellant was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each of three charges of molest which were more aggravated than the present case, and 
PP v Chia Fook Kun
 (Unreported) where a single charge of molest of a more serious nature drew a sentence of 15 months` imprisonment. In addition, in his written submissions, counsel highlighted the fact that the prosecution did not seek any enhanced sentence in the court below, nor did they ask for a deterrent sentence.
It was almost axiomatic to say that each case depends on its own facts and circumstances when it comes to sentencing, and that no pre-established sentence can be applied in respect of a particular offence. Yet, I was mindful that no sentence should ever be pronounced in a vacuum, and that it is essential to be aware of what has been stated in similar cases.
In the present case, I could not but think that the overall sentence was acceptable given the circumstances of the case. The first charge drew a fairly lenient sentence of six months` imprisonment, given that I had decided as far back as in 1993 that `for this sort of offence in Singapore, the standard sentence where a victim`s private parts or sexual organs [were] intruded is now nine months` imprisonment`, with caning: see 
Chandresh Patel v PP
 (Unreported) (judgment dated 31 August 1993). In 
 Chandresh Patel v PP 
, the molest act was somewhat similar to the present situation, where it was not an innocent act, nor was it aggravated in nature.
As for the second act of molest, which drew the appellant a sentence of 18 months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane, I felt that it appeared to be on the high side. It was not disputed that this offence was more serious than the first charge, or that in 
 Chandresh Patel v PP 
, which inevitably warranted a more severe sentence. The appellant had, in his position as a stepfather, abused his relationship with his stepdaughter as well as the trust reposed in him. He had taken advantage of a defenceless child and his act went to the core of intrusion, touching the complainant`s private parts. The complainant, frightened and confused as she was, had little choice but to give in to an adult, who could easily have overpowered her. These were deliberate acts of infringement of one`s personal privacy.
However, mindful of the authorities submitted by counsel, and the fact that the DPP did not produce any authorities to the contrary, I was prepared to accept that the sentence on the second charge tended to be slightly on the high side. Yet, it could not be said that it was manifestly excessive, given that it deviated from 
 PP v Chia Fook Kun 
 (supra) by a mere three months. In any event, there have been cases where more severe punishment has been meted out: see 
PP v Johari bin Samad
 (Unreported) , although this case was discontinued before it reached me.
I agreed with the DPP that the overall sentence combined for the two convictions did not offend the totality principle in respect of the appellant`s punishment. It could not be said to have a crushing effect on the appellant under the circumstances. He violated the complainant`s innocence, and the total sentence reflected not only the serious nature of these offences, but also the punitive aspect of the conviction.
In the instance, I dismissed the appellant`s appeals against conviction and sentence.

 Introduction 
 
 
 
This was an application by the abovenamed Nirmal Singh s/o Fauja Singh (`the applicant`) to have his name replaced on the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore pursuant to s 102(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2000 Ed) (`the LPA`). We dismissed the application and now give our reasons.
 Brief facts 
 
 
 
The applicant was admitted as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore on 8 November 1989. He began his career as a legal assistant in Assomull, Pereira & Partners, and thereafter moved on to Gurdaib, Cheong & Narmal and became partner in the latter firm from 31 July 1993.
On 3 September 1993, the applicant was convicted, after a trial in the district court, of three charges of corruption under the Prevention of Corruption Act and one charge of criminal breach of trust (`CBT`) under the Penal Code. The applicant was found to have offered corruptly gratification of $5,000 to one Aziz, a police officer, as an inducement for letting off one Tan, who had engaged the applicant as defence counsel, from the police investigations into several housebreaking offences. In addition, the applicant was also found to have solicited and received corruptly $5,000 as gratification from Tan for his assistance in the scheme. In relation to the CBT charge, the applicant was found to have misappropriated a sum of $500 belonging to the firm of Assomull, Pereira & Partners, while he was employed there as a legal assistant. The applicant was sentenced to a total of 18 months` imprisonment and fined a sum of $5,000 for his offences. He paid the fine, served the term of imprisonment, and on account of his good behaviour was released on 19 October 1994.
A Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society of Singapore (`the Law Society`) was subsequently appointed by the Chief Justice, upon the application of the Council of the Law Society, to investigate the applicant`s conduct pertaining to his criminal convictions. The applicant admitted to the charges against him before the Disciplinary Committee. On 30 August 1995, the Disciplinary Committee concluded its investigation and found that sufficient cause existed for disciplinary action to be taken against the applicant. Accordingly, the Law Society applied for an order requiring the applicant to show cause why he should not be dealt with under s 83(1) of the LPA.
At the show cause proceedings before the court of three judges on 1 December 1995, the applicant indicated that he did not intend to show cause but wished only to raise some matters in mitigation in order that the court could determine the appropriate penalty. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court ordered that the applicant be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore: see 
Law Society of Singapore v Narmal Singh
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 184
 . After a lapse of some five years, the applicant, on 3 April 2001, filed the present application seeking an order under s 102 of the LPA that his name be replaced on the roll of advocates and solicitors.
 The present application 
 
 
 
The provisions of s 102 of the LPA are as follows: 
 
 
(1) The court may, if it thinks fit, at any time order the Registrar to replace on the roll the name of a solicitor whose name has been removed from, or struck off, the roll. 
 
(2) Any application that the name of a solicitor be replaced on the roll shall be by originating motion, supported by affidavit, before a court of 3 Judges of the Supreme Court of whom the Chief Justice shall be one. 
 
(3) Notice of the motion shall be served on the Society which shall - 
 
(a) appear at the hearing of the motion; and 
 
(b) place before the court a report which shall include - 
 
(i) copies of the record of any proceedings as the result of which the name of the solicitor was removed from or struck off the roll; and 
 
(ii) a statement of any facts which have occurred since the name of the solicitor was removed from or struck off the roll and which in the opinion of the Council or any member of the Council are relevant to be considered or to be investigated in connection with the application.
  
 
 
Mr Davinder Singh for the applicant made an impassioned plea before us. He submitted that it had been eight years since the applicant ceased his legal practice, and some five years and four months since he was struck off the roll. After his release from prison, the applicant was actively engaged in various charity works, and was gainfully employed as a business development manager and subsequently, as the head of administration in a company, where he handled large sums of money in the course of his work. In addition, he was, presently, diligently studying for and pursuing as an external postgraduate degree of Master of Law at the University of London. Throughout all these years, he had steered clear of any brushes with the law. All these, counsel argued, showed that the applicant was fully repentant and rehabilitated. He had paid a three-fold price for his past misdeeds, which counsel described as follows: first, he was made to suffer the shame and stigma of his conviction, the sheer ignominy of which alone must have been extremely difficult to bear given that he had himself been a senior police inspector; second, he had had to endure the disgrace and dishonour, which his striking-off brought not only to himself but also his family, and finally, he had had to face the humiliation of his peers in his small, but extremely close-knit Sikh community. The hard lesson he learnt from his acts of folly rendered it most unlikely that the applicant would repeat his offences again. His conduct and good deeds in the past few years exemplified that he was now a changed man, one in whom honour and integrity resided. In support of this, numerous accompanying testimonials from the applicant`s current employer, the head of his religious organisation and senior members of the Bar, attesting to his good character, trustworthiness and sense of responsibility as well as asserting their confidence in his fitness for restoration, were tendered. In counsel`s submission, it was not so much the length of time which had elapsed since an applicant had been struck off which was pertinent, but rather whether the facts showed that there was still a risk to the public and the profession, if the applicant was allowed back into practice.
Ms Asanthi S Mendis, State Counsel representing the Attorney General, opposed the application on two main grounds: first, it was argued that the application was premature in that an insufficient amount of time had elapsed since the applicant was struck off the rolls; and second, that the nature of the offences for which the applicant was struck off were of such nature and gravity as to render a five-year period of disbarment inadequate. Mr Lok Vi Ming for the Law Society informed the court that there were no material facts which had occurred since the applicant was struck off the roll and that the Law Society objected to the application.
 The law 
 
 
 
The provisions of s 102 of the LPA under which this application was made are quite clear. The court may, at any time, if it thinks fit, make an order for replacement of the applicant`s name on the roll of advocates and solicitors. The application of this section has been previously considered by the court of three judges, and it is helpful to examine these cases in some depth.
In 
Re Chan Chow Wang
 
 [1982-1983] SLR 413 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 30
 , the applicant was an advocate and solicitor of Singapore and was also an advocate and solicitor of Malaya. On 22 November 1974, before the court of three judges he was struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors for champerty and fraudulent conduct in his dealings with his clients. Notwithstanding that, he continued to practise as an advocate and solicitor in Malaya until November 1979, when he was also struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors in Malaya. In 1982 he applied for his name to be replaced on the roll of advocates and solicitors. The court of three judges noted that, although it was nine years since his name had been struck off the roll, he had ceased legal practice only for a period of three and a half years. The court held that, in all the circumstances, his application was premature. In delivering the judgment of the court, Wee Chong Jin CJ made the following general observation ([1982-1983] SLR 413 at 414; 
[1983] 2 MLJ 30
 at 30-31): 
 
In principle, sentences of exclusion from the legal profession need not be exclusive forever. On the other hand, the court has a duty to perform to the suitors of the court and the profession of the law to take care that those who are readmitted to it are persons on whose integrity and honour reliance may be placed. The court should also, in the public interest, on all the material before it be satisfied that the applicant is not likely to repeat the same offence or any other offence of a similar nature in the discharge of his professional duties before restoring him to the Roll.
 
 
 
Next, there was the case of 
Re Lim Cheng Peng
 
 
[1987] SLR 486
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 231
 . There, the applicant was admitted as an advocate and solicitor in 1965 and began his practice immediately. In January 1978, he ceased legal practice after an investigation was conducted into his clients` account. He was convicted of an offence under s 409 of the Penal Code on 28 February 1981. There was some delay in the disciplinary proceedings taken against him. They were eventually brought in 1984, and on 9 April 1984 he was struck off the roll. On 17 July 1987, he applied for an order that his name be restored to the roll of advocates and solicitors. The court was somewhat troubled by the short intervening period between the date on which he was struck off the roll and the date the application was made, which was only slightly more than three years. However, having regard to the period he had ceased legal practice prior to the date on which he was struck off the roll and the delay in the disciplinary proceedings taken against him, the court, on the basis of the facts of the case, allowed the application. Wee Chong Jin CJ delivering the judgment of the court said (
[1987] SLR 486
 at 490; 
[1988] 1 MLJ 231
 at 233): 
 
We are of the view that unless there are exceptional circumstances, we would say that, as a general rule, no solicitor who has been struck off the roll ought to contemplate taking out an application under s 99 of the Legal Profession Act before the expiration of five years from the date of the order of striking off.
 
 
 
The learned Chief Justice made it a point to emphasize the special facts as follows: 
 
We would emphasize that this case turned entirely on its own special factual situation and should not be regarded as a precedent by those who might be minded to make such an application before the expiration of five years from the date of the order of striking off.
 
 
 
Lastly, we come to the case of 
Re Ram Kishan
 
 [1992] 1 SLR 52 
9. There, the applicant, formerly an advocate and solicitor, was struck off the roll on 15 August 1983 following a finding of the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society that he had violated the Solicitors` Accounts Rules 1967 and was also guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duties. While the disciplinary proceedings were in progress, he was charged in the subordinate courts on five counts of criminal breach of trust. He pleaded guilty to one charge with the other four charges being taken into account. It appeared that the applicant`s conduct was the result of a long history of a mental disorder known as manic depressive psychosis. Since 1956, despite various treatments he had received, he suffered several lapses. Recent psychiatric reports submitted in relation to the application stated that the applicant showed no evidence then of manic depressive illness. Neither the Law Society nor the Attorney General objected to the application. Nevertheless, the court held that, having regard to his long history of mental disorder, in the interests of the public and the profession as a whole, it would be wrong to order the replacement of his name on the roll. The court approved the decisions in 
 Re Chan Chow Wang 
 and 
 Re Lim Cheng Peng 
 (supra) and held that, while an application for replacement on the roll may be made under s 102 of the LPA at any time, as a general rule an application for replacement will not be entertained until the expiration of five years from the date of the striking-off order. Yong Pung How CJ said at p 533: 
 
An application for replacement on the roll may be made under the section at any time, but as a general rule no advocate and solicitor who has been struck off the roll ought to contemplate taking out an application for replacement on the roll before the expiration of five years from the date of the order of striking off. In taking out his application for replacement, the onus will be on him to convince a court of three judges that he is still a person on whose integrity and honour reliance may be placed.
 
 
 
At this stage, it is convenient to make an observation on the minimum time frame of five years adumbrated in 
 Re Lim Cheng Peng 
 and 
 Re Ram Kishan 
 (supra). At the time when these two cases were decided, the maximum period of suspension which the court could order under s 83(1) of the LPA then in force was only two years. As such, the general rule requiring a lapse of a minimum of five years since the date of the order for striking off before an application for reinstatement should be made was appropriate, as it served to reflect the difference in gravity between a striking-off order and a suspension order. Section 83(1) of the LPA, however, has since been amended, and the amendment came into effect on 1 January 1994. Under the amended provision, the court is empowered in appropriate circumstances to order an advocate and solicitor to be suspended from practice for a period not exceeding five years. Having regard to this amendment, the general rule as to the minimum of five years is clearly no longer applicable. A significantly longer period than five years is now required to have elapsed before an application to be restored will be entertained. This is only commonsensical, since an advocate and solicitor who has been struck off the roll should not end up in substantially the same position as, or would be better off than, one who has merely been suspended from practice for the full period of five years. We are not disposed to lay down any fixed minimum time frame for bringing an application under s 102 of the LPA. Suffice it to say that under the current provisions of the LPA, a significantly longer period than five years should have elapsed before any such application will be considered.
The difference in gravity between a striking-off order and an order for suspension for the full term of five years was demonstrated in 
Law Society of Singapore v Dhanwant Singh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 429
 . There, the respondent was convicted on three counts of abetting his clients to be excused from attending court by producing false medical certificates. In the show cause proceedings, the court had to consider whether the respondent ought to be struck off the roll or suspended from practice. The court held that a period of suspension even for the full period of five years would be neither adequate not appropriate, and that the only appropriate penalty was a striking off and this was ordered.
Reverting to the present application, we agreed with the submission of Ms Mendis that clearly in this case an insufficient period of time had elapsed since the applicant was struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. The order striking him off the roll was made on 1 December 1995 and he filed the present application on 3 April 2001. There was thus only a lapse of approximately five years and four months. It was argued on behalf of the applicant that he had ceased legal practice long before the order for striking off was made, and in total he had not practised for eight years, and that following 
 Re Lim Cheng Peng 
 (supra) the period in which he had ceased legal practice before the order for striking off should be taken into account.
We accepted the applicant`s statement of fact as deposed to in his affidavit that he stopped practice as from 31 July 1993. Presumably, at or about that time, the police had commenced investigations into his affairs and he was subsequently arrested. He was charged with six counts before the district court in August 1993; he was tried and convicted on 3 September 1993, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 18 months and was fined $5,000. As such, his cessation from legal practice at that time was far from voluntary and could hardly be said to have been undertaken by him in recognition of or in atonement for his mistakes. In this case, the period before the order for striking off was made could hardly be taken into account for the purpose of deciding whether or not sufficient time had elapsed for the present application.
At the show cause proceedings, it was argued that a suspension would meet the ends of justice. This was expressly rejected by the court which made an order for striking off: 
 Law Society of Singapore v Narmal Singh 
 (supra). The court`s decision therefore meant that it had considered, as in 
 Dhanwant Singh 
 (supra), that a suspension of full five years would be neither adequate nor appropriate. Indeed, the court held that the offences committed by the applicant were far more serious than those committed by the respondent in 
 Dhanwant Singh 
.
We also agreed with Ms Mendis that the nature of the offences, for which he was struck off, was of such a degree of severity as did not warrant a restoration of the applicant to the roll at this point in time. The applicant was convicted of three charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act and one charge of criminal breach of trust under the Penal Code. The three charges revolved around the applicant corruptly offering gratification to one Aziz, a police officer, in order that his client, Tan, would be let off from the police investigations into his role in some housebreaking offences. At the same time, the applicant himself corruptly solicited and received gratification from the same client for his assistance in that scheme. The gravity of these offences was all the more exacerbated by the fact that the applicant himself had been a former police officer - an inspector of police at that - and that he committed these offences while acting as an advocate and solicitor for his client. What the applicant did amounted to a blatant attempt on his part, as an officer of the court, to evade the due process of the law and pervert the course of justice. That was not a case of simple dishonesty, which led to the applicant being taken off the roll. Neither could it be said that the offences, with their wide-reaching consequences, were the result of the `false steps of youth and early manhood`, given that the applicant was already 37 years old, when he committed the offences.
In exercising its powers under s 102 of the LPA, the court must consider as its primary duty the protection of the interests of the public and the profession as a whole over the interests of the applicant. In 
 Re Ram Kishan 
 (supra), Yong Pung How CJ said at p 533: 
 
In taking out his application for replacement, the onus will be on [the applicant] to convince a court of three judges that he is still a person on whose integrity and honour reliance may be placed. In exercising its judicial discretion as to whether or not to replace the name on the roll, the court of three judges must consider as its primary duty the protection of the interests of the public and the profession as a whole over and above the interests of the applicant. The application of a person who has previously been struck off the roll for grossly improper conduct must necessarily be subjected to stricter scrutiny than that of a new entrant to the profession who has no adverse record. Unless the court is completely satisfied on all the material before it that there is no likelihood that the applicant will repeat the same offence or any other offence of a similar nature in the discharge of his professional duties, and that he is now deserving of re-admission to an honourable profession, the court should not replace his name on the roll.
 
 
 
In the final analysis, the question was really whether or not, on all the materials available before the court, the applicant could be said to be one who was fit to have his name restored on the roll. The court must be every bit as jealous of the honour of those admitted to the Singapore legal profession as a man is of his own reputation, for the integrity of the profession is dependant wholly on the character and virtue of its members. At the same time, we must be conscious of the ever-compelling need to protect the public from errant lawyers and the serious harm which such lawyers could inflict on the public and the reputation of the legal profession. Upon a consideration of all the facts in this case, we were not satisfied that the applicant could have been fully reformed and rehabilitated in the relatively short time span which had elapsed since he had been struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court, or that the public would be adequately protected if the applicant was allowed back into legal practice at this point in time. Accordingly, we dismissed the application with costs.

 Introduction 
 
 
 
The respondent was charged under s 304A of the Penal Code (Cap 224) for causing the death of three persons in a motor accident on the evening of 3 February 2000 by doing a negligent act. The charge read as follows: 
 
that you, on or about the 3rd day of Feb 2000, at about 8.57 p.m., along Alexandra Road in the direction of Commonwealth Avenue infront of The Anchorage on the left, Singapore, being the driver of motor car SCA 6965K, did cause the deaths of 3 deceased persons namely, Shyn Ji Yun, M/2 (1st deceased), Oh Eun Sook, F/35 (2nd deceased) and Shyn Hong Wook, M/5, (3rd deceased) by doing a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, to wit, by failing to keep a proper lookout infront and simultaneously collided onto the said 3 deceased persons where the 1st deceased was seated inside a baby stroller and was pushed by the 2nd deceased together with the 3rd deceased crossing the road along Alexandra Road from the centre road divider from your right to the left of your motor car and consequently causing their deaths and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 304A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 
 
 
District Judge Audrey Lim acquitted the respondent of the charge on 30 January 2001. The prosecution appealed against the acquittal on the grounds that the judge erred in finding that it had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The respondent was a British national with 20 years of driving experience in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. On 3 February 2000, at about 9pm, she was driving a motor car registered as SCA 6965K (`the SAAB`) along the right lane of Alexandra Road in the northbound direction towards Commonwealth Avenue. The weather that night was fair and dry.
The stretch of Alexandra Road in question was a dual carriageway with three lanes on each side. The speed limit was 60km/h, and the road was lit by street lamps on both sides. Separating the carriageways was a centre divider (`the median strip`) of about 2.3m in width, consisting of a grass strip raised 0.9m above ground level and separated from the road by a kerb. A railing on this median strip extended from the traffic light junction of Queensway and Alexandra Road (`the traffic junction`) all the way to about the entrance to the Anchorage Condominium (`the Anchorage`), which was on the left-hand side of the road from the point of view of the respondent. This railing was intended to prevent pedestrians from crossing the road, channelling them instead to the overhead bridge. Along the median strip, trees were planted at intervals of approximately 10 to 12 metres apart. The trees had a trunk diameter of about 20cm and had a high crown and unobstrusive foliage. From the traffic junction to the scene of accident was a stretch of road of approximately 200m in length, of which the last 120m leading to the point of impact was straight. The right lane on which the respondent was travelling was darker in colour than the centre and left lanes, as it had just been retarred.
On the fateful night, the respondent was driving the SAAB and her husband Simon Briscoe (`Simon`) was the front seat passenger. They were on their way to attend the birthday party of a friend, and were considerably late by over an hour. They stopped at the traffic junction en route, and the SAAB was the first car on the right lane. At the junction, the respondent asked Simon to telephone their maid Olivia and instruct her not to answer their home doorbell as they had recently been subject to nuisance calls. Simon made this call and had ended it by the time the respondent pulled away from the traffic junction. She estimated her driving speed to have been around 50 to 55km/h. There was no traffic in front of her at the material time.
A pedestrian group consisting of the three deceased, a mother and her two children, all of whom were Korean nationals, were standing on the median strip, about 17m from the end of the railing. The mother, who was wearing a white dress, was pushing a stroller with an aluminium frame and white wheels in which was seated her two-year-old daughter. She was accompanied by her five-year-old son and was carrying a transparent laundry bag. From a driver`s viewpoint, the width of the pedestrian group would have been about 80cm wide. They were attempting to cross from the median strip to the Anchorage, where they lived, when they impacted with the respondent`s vehicle roughly in the centre of the right lane. The mother and her son were flung across the median strip by the impact, and the stroller with the daughter was dragged some 30m with the daughter inside before the vehicle came to a rest. They succumbed to their injuries and passed away later that night.
The respondent admitted that she had initially failed to notice the pedestrian group, and had only seen them when they stepped off the kerb of the median strip. She estimated them to be about 12 to 18 feet (4 to 6 metres) away at that point, but qualified that she was not sure of the distance. When she saw them, she jammed on the brakes very hard and swerved the car to the left, but the impact was almost instantaneous with her actions and she could not avoid the collision. The automatic braking system (`ABS`) of the car was not activated by her braking, nor were there brake or skid marks indicating heavy braking at the scene of the accident.
The respondent explained in her defence that several factors hindered her view of the pedestrians while they were standing on the median strip. Firstly, the visual clutter presented by the trees and railing on the median strip had partially obscured the pedestrian group standing on the median strip. Secondly, a large shadow was cast by trees covering Lamp 112, which was the lamppost nearest to the collision point, located on the left-hand side of the road just beyond the entrance to the Anchorage. This shadow likewise hindered her observation of the pedestrian group. Finally, the respondent explained that her attention was divided among various legitimate driver tasks expected of any prudent driver; such as the checking of car mirrors, as well as scanning to the left and right to generally survey the entire road. This was necessary, explained the respondent, as this stretch of Alexandra Road was particularly hazardous with cars exiting from the Anchorage and switching to the right lane to turn to the opposite direction. Furthermore, she added that the presence of commercial and residential properties as well as bus stops on both sides of the road meant that there was further increased pedestrian and vehicular activity at the accident scene.
The issue of the extent and effect of the lighting of the scene was of particular concern to both parties. Notably, there was some discrepancy as to whether the shadow cast by the trees extended to the right lane. The investigating officer, SI Shariff, made a sketch in her field diary which showed that the shadowy area extended to only the left and middle lanes of Alexandra Road. This contrasted with the testimony of Cheah Wi Kwong (`Cheah`), an electrical engineer from Power Grid, who said that the right lane was affected by the shadows cast by trees, although the actual level of lighting in the right lane satisfied international standards. The fact that the shadow extended to the right lane was also supported by Charlie Chua, the chairman of the management committee at the Anchorage. Finally, photographs taken by a professional photographer, David Lee (`David`), tendered by the defence, showed that the shadow covered the right lane, although it fell short of the median strip itself. David`s photographs managed to depict night lighting conditions as they were taken with high-speed film and without a flash. In contrast, the photographs taken by the police employed flash photography and were less useful, as they had a `bleached` effect which obscured the lighting conditions.
The photographic evidence was particularly important as the lighting conditions were altered sometime in April 2000. In response to a request from the management of the Anchorage, the Land Transport Authority re-sited two lampposts and added an additional one sometime in April 2000, giving a total nett effect of one additional lamppost and brighter surroundings.
Finally, there were no independent eyewitnesses of the accident itself. At the material time, a motorist, one Cheng Keen Boon (`Cheng`), was driving in the middle lane of Alexandra Road about 4m behind the SAAB. However, Cheng said he had merely heard a thud, which was followed by the SAAB swerving a little into his lane. He had not realised that an accident had occurred and had simply continued on his way.
 The expert evidence 
 
 
 
Both prosecution and defence called two experts each to reconstruct the events leading up to the accident. Significantly, these four experts came to agreement during the course of the trial on several key facts: 
(1) the SAAB was driven at a speed of about 50km/h; 
(2) the average walking speed of the pedestrian group was about 1m/s; 
(3) the five-year-old boy was on the right of the mother; 
(4) the normal `perception and reaction time` (`PRT`) of a driver under the circumstances would have been between 1.5 to 2 seconds; 
(5) the point of impact between the SAAB and the pedestrian group was approximately 2m from the kerb of the median strip; 
(6) although it was possible to have observed the pedestrian group at various approach distances, the point at which an approaching driver would be put on notice of the pedestrian group as an impending hazard would be when the centre of the group was at or about the western kerb of the median strip, and onward into the roadway lane; 
(7) based on the above, the pedestrian group would have taken approximately 2s to move from the western kerb to the area of impact. Given the approach speed of the SAAB, the vehicle would have been approximately 28m from the area of impact when the pedestrian group was identifiable as a hazard; and 
(8) adopting a PRT of 1.5s, and given that the SAAB was travelling at 50km/h and had a drag factor of 0.75, the SAAB would have travelled approximately 34m between the time the driver could begin perception and reaction, and when it came to a complete stop.
The experts however differed principally on whether the fatalities could have been avoided. Both experts for the prosecution, Peter Bellion (`Bellion`) and Chenry Baugham (`Baugham`), were of the view that the proximate cause of death was the respondent`s inability to detect the pedestrian group at the centre of the median strip. Bellion opined that the group was detectable from 50 to 70 metres, given the weather and lighting conditions and the fact that the SAAB`s headlights would illuminate a distance of between 45 to 60 metres, as well as the contrast between the deceased mother`s white dress and the blackened tar surface. Baugham agreed with this assessment in essence, although he thought the pedestrians were visible some 60m away.
The defence experts, Christopher Marks (`Marks`) and William Russell Haight (`Haight`), were however of the opinion that the accident was unavoidable even for a normal, prudent and attentive driver under the circumstances. Marks in particular conducted a pedestrian detection test on site, at 9pm on 6 March 2000 (prior to the change in lighting conditions). He concluded that under the circumstances the detection range of a pedestrian wearing white clothing against a black tarred surface was 24m. Haight further added that, even if the pedestrian group was visible 55m away, their movement would have been difficult to detect, and they would have been `hidden` in the background clutter of trees at the median strip, the strobe effect of headlights and other objects on the road.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
In a sterling and carefully considered judgment, the district judge at first instance set out her grounds of decision, which are briefly summarised as follows.
The judge relied on David`s photographs as a reliable representation of the lighting condition and concluded that the shadowy area did indeed extend to the right lane of the carriageway. She also accepted that the pedestrian group standing at the centre of the median strip would have been visible from 50 to 55 metres away, and that the respondent had failed to detect them at this point and had only seen them when they stepped off the kerb.
Nevertheless, the judge found that the respondent had not failed to keep a proper lookout by failing to detect the pedestrian group at the centre of the median strip. Applying 
PP v Teo Lian Seng
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 19
 , she found that the standard of care to be expected of a reasonable and prudent driver in the circumstances would fall somewhere in between that expected when driving on an expressway and in a housing estate. In such a situation, a reasonable and prudent driver would not be expected to focus on only one point when driving, but to scan the road and its immediate surroundings. The judge also accepted that the respondent had not been distracted by events within the car, such as talking to her husband or listening to music, nor was she mentally distracted by the fact that she was late for the party, or by the nuisance rings at her house. Taking into account the railing on the median strip and the dark patch of shadow around the area of impact, she found that it was a real possibility that the respondent could not see the pedestrians while they were standing at the centre of the median strip. As such, the respondent had not failed to keep a proper lookout.
Additionally, the judge found that the failure to detect the pedestrian group at the centre of the median strip was not sufficient as the cause of the accident. She reasoned that a reasonable driver perceiving the pedestrian group would have continued to maintain his speed without slowing down until the group could reasonably be detected as a hazard, as it was within the expectations of a reasonable driver that pedestrians would look carefully and give way to cars before crossing. The approaching driver would only have been put on notice when the group presented itself as a hazard by stepping off the western kerb of the median strip. At this point, the accident would have been unavoidable as there would only have been two seconds before the SAAB would impact the pedestrian group at the centre of the right lane. The judge found that the respondent had applied her brakes at the point of impact, and had accordingly reacted within the accepted PRT of the reasonable and prudent driver. As the collision would have been unavoidable for the reasonable man in any case, there was thus no causation between the failure to keep a proper lookout and the fatalities that resulted.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant admirably presented a plethora of arguments on appeal, touching on almost every facet of the case at hand. For the sake of brevity I disposed of the appeal under the following five heads.
 (1) REVIEWING THE FINDINGS OF THE LOWER COURT
It is trite law that the appellate court will not disturb the findings of fact of a lower court unless they are clearly reached against the weight of evidence. An appellate court must not merely entertain doubts about whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong: see 
PP v Azman bin Abdullah
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
  and 
Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdul Kadir v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 788
 , as well as the decision of FA Chua J in 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 .
The appellant, however, contended that the findings of a lower court could be reviewed where they arose from inferences made from the contents of a witness`s evidence, as opposed to the actual demeanour of that witness in the court. In support, the appellant referred to my judgment in 
PP v Choo Thiam Hock
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 248
 . In that case, I made the following comment on the findings of the district judge with regard to the credibility of the complainant, at p 253: 
 
The undisputed and objective evidence was also a very strong indication of the true course of events. I have therefore considered very closely the evidence in the record, the arguments of counsel and the district judge`s grounds of decision. These were mainly targetted at the question of the complainant`s veracity. They were based not so much upon her demeanour as a witness but upon inferences made from the content of her evidence. This being so, an appellate court is of course in no worse position than the trial court to assess the same material.
 
 
 
This case should not be read beyond its context. On its facts, the demeanour of the witness was not at issue, and the appellate judge was theoretically in as good a position as the trial judge to make inferences from the face of the record. But even so, an appeal judge should not regard such circumstances as granting a free reign to substitute his view for that of the trial judge as and when he pleases. Indeed, the appeal in 
 Choo Thiam Hock 
`s case only succeeded because there were strong objective facts indicating that the family of respondents had assaulted their Filipino maid. Notably, the victimised maid had sustained serious injuries and had made a plaintive plea for help at a public restaurant. I was also careful to emphasise in 
 Choo Thiam Hock 
 that this was a rare instance where the facts weighed so strongly against the decision of the trial judge that it required intervention on appeal, at p 256: 
 
Taken all together, I consider this a rare instance in which it would (be) appropriate for me as an appellate judge to interfere with the district judge`s finding as to the credibility of the complainant. He did not base that opinion merely upon her demeanour in the witness box but quite rightly looked to the content of her evidence - unfortunately, in my opinion, he drew what appeared plainly to be incorrect conclusions from his examination of that content. I am of the opinion that the reasons he gave for doubting the complainant`s veracity were unsound.
 
 
 
In the normal case, a judge sitting on appeal should be sensitive to the impressionistic nuances which invariably contribute to the inferences drawn by the trial judge, who had the opportunity of observing and evaluating the evidence first-hand. This does not mean that a respondent, by invoking the spectre of 
 Lim Ah Poh 
 (supra) and other like cases, can effectively keep at bay the scrutiny of an appeal court over the findings at first instance. This is merely a guiding principle and should not be applied to usurp the power of the appellate court to correct errors of law and fact made by a lower court. Rather, it serves as a gentle reminder that an appellate court should exercise careful restraint and only intervene in the rare case where logic clearly militates against the findings of fact made by the trial judge.
The present appeal was certainly not such an exceptional case. The fact that the bulk of the evidence arose from expert testimony was of no special significance. The trial judge would similarly have had to assess the demeanour of the expert witnesses in deciding on the reliability and soundness of their opinions. Furthermore, there was no indication that the inferences drawn by the trial judge from the expert testimony were so exceptionally illogical that they deserved to be overturned on appeal.
 (2) RES IPSA LOQUITUR
In aid of his cause, the appellant sought to invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, arguing that the fact of the accident spoke for itself and that an inference of negligence could thereby be raised against the defendant. It is, however, settled law that this doctrine has no application in criminal cases in which negligence must be positively proved beyond reasonable doubt, per 
Ramasamy v R
 
 
[1955] MLJ 95
  and 
Lai Kuit Seong v PP
 
 
[1969] 1 MLJ 182
 . Furthermore, the appellant`s proposition involved a dubious leap of logic; it was not clear how a driver can be prima facie negligent when mobile pedestrians walk into his path of their own volition. The doctrine may very well have found some application in a civil case where the respondent had been the sole author of the outcome; for example, if she had rammed into and damaged an immobile object. Short of such special facts, I found it patently clear that even in a civil action, the circumstances of the present case could not, without any wild stretch of the imagination, give rise to the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur against the driver. It was a total misunderstanding of the doctrine.
 (3) THE STANDARD OF CARE EXPECTED ALONG THE ROAD IN QUESTION
The standard of care expected of a reasonable and prudent driver is not determined in a vacuum, but in accordance with the type of road and prevailing traffic conditions. I noted this principle in 
PP v Teo Lian Seng
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 19
 , where I said, at p 27: 
 
It must be emphasised that the standard required for expressways cannot be the same as that for normal roads. While on the latter, especially in housing estates, there would be a need to be alert at all times to the possibility of persons crossing the road indiscriminately, particularly children, or the elderly regardless of whether there are specific signs of their presence, such as schools, playgrounds or parks. And what is appropriate for a normal road would not be for car parks. What constitutes danger depends on the type of road.
 
 
 
There is thus a spectrum of road situations ranging from expressways to housing estate roads, upon which the judge can pitch the standard of care required of the particular driver. In this respect, the appellant sought to persuade this court that the stretch of Alexandra Road in question should be considered more akin to a busy housing estate road than a major roadway or expressway, due to the presence of commercial and residential properties lining its length. The standard of care would thus be significantly higher than that considered by the trial judge, who considered that the character of the road was in between that of a housing estate and an expressway.
I found this argument rather far-fetched. Alexandra Road was and is a major thoroughfare, and the presence of an overhead bridge and a railing preventing unauthorised crossing was sufficient indication of the fact that this was no housing estate where pedestrians were wont to tread carelessly. The trial judge was therefore perfectly justified in characterising the activity level on the road as falling somewhere in between that of a housing estate road and an expressway. Accordingly, the standard of care expected of the reasonable and prudent driver was not so high as to require strenuous precaution to be taken against every potential hazard. A reasonable driver under the circumstances was entitled to assume that pedestrians on the median strip would not cross unexpectedly, and could simply maintain his speed and perform other legitimate driver tasks.
 (4)FAILURE OF EARLY DETECTION OF PEDESTRIAN GROUP STANDING AT THE MEDIAN STRIP
The trial judge had accepted that the pedestrian group could have been seen at the centre of the median strip some 50 to 55 metres away. Given an approach speed of 50km/h, this meant that the pedestrians were detectable approximately four seconds prior to impact.
The appellant argued that the respondent was negligent in failing to spot the pedestrian group at this distance, and that such negligence was causative of the accident fatalities, as early detection could have allowed the driver to avoid or at least minimise the damage caused by the collision.
I turn first to the issue of whether the reasonable driver, under the circumstances, should have spotted the pedestrians. Lighting takes centrestage as the key factor influencing the detectability of the pedestrian group. The main point of contention in this regard was the effect of the shadowy area extending to the right lane. The appellant sought to downplay the significance of the shadow, on the basis that the lux reading taken under it was above internationally accepted standards, and that additionally the shadow did not in any case extend to cover the median strip where the pedestrian group was standing.
However, the impact of lighting on detectability is not determined solely by reference to lux readings. Although the level of illumination both under and outside of the shadowy area was satisfactory, the pertinent point was the contrast between areas of bright and low lighting. This contrast could prove confusing to the oncoming driver, who would have to adjust between different levels of perception within the same scene. It was in this manner that the shadows adversely affected the detectability of pedestrians on the median strip. Indeed, this was the view of Marks, who explained how the contrasting lighting levels could be a trap for the approaching driver: 
 
In my opinion this created a trap for the oncoming driver who would perceive the road to be well lit until entering the shaded area when the low illumination levels and visual clutter from the background and oncoming vehicle headlights would combine to make pedestrian detection extremely difficult and could result in complete failure to detect a pedestrian on or close to the median strip.
 
 
 
The darkness of the shadow and how far it extended were therefore merely contributory factors to the lighting situation and were inconclusive of the larger issue of detectability. Having regard to the overall lighting situation as depicted in David`s photographs, I was satisfied that the very existence of shadows on the right lane, in contrast with the brighter lighting at other parts of the scene, somewhat impeded the detectability of the pedestrians on the median strip.
These lighting conditions were further exacerbated by the visual clutter along the median strip in the form of tree trunks and the metal railing. Additionally, the need for the driver to focus on his left to avoid cars emerging from the Anchorage and cutting into the right lane would also have distracted his attention from the median strip. On the other hand, I noted that there were some factors which improved the detectability of the pedestrians, particularly the white dress worn by the mother, the reflective material of the stroller, and the wide breadth of the group as a whole. Taking all these factors in totality, while I would accept that it was technically possible to have seen the pedestrians on the centre of the median strip four seconds prior to impact, I was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the reasonable driver would have done so under the circumstances. In this respect, I found that the respondent was not negligent in failing to spot the pedestrians standing on the median strip.
In any case, turning to the second limb of the appellant`s argument, I found it difficult to agree that early detection would have made a difference to the driver`s reaction. I say this for two reasons. Firstly, early detection does not require the reasonable driver to slow down or take evasive action, as concluded by the trial judge upon applying the test in 
 Teo Lian Seng 
 (supra). Notably, the pedestrians were not unaccompanied children or elderly folk, for whom a wider berth of caution would have been warranted. In ascertaining how the reasonable man would have reacted under the circumstances, I also found particularly relevant the testimony of Cheng, who was driving behind the respondent at the material time and also a seasoned traveller along Alexandra Road: 
 
 
Q: If you see person standing on median, would you apply brakes? 
 
A: No. Because pedestrian waiting for car to pass. Unless I see him moving forward, I would apply brake or sound horn.
  
 
 
Thus the perception of pedestrians standing on the centre of the median strip of a busy thoroughfare would not engender an assumption that they would haphazardly cross the road. I had previously made this point in 
 Teo Lian Seng 
 (supra), albeit with regard to expressways, at p 27: 
 
The degree of observation required of the respondent must be in relation to what is expected along the expressway. Even if the boys were seen, there would have been no expectation that they would have tried to cross.
 
 
 
I would only add that this reasoning applies equally to a major roadway with an overhead bridge and obstructive railings, designed to assure drivers of their uninterrupted right of way.
The second reason why the issue of early detection was largely irrelevant was that it was mere speculation that it would have lowered the response time of the respondent. The appellant essentially argued that, had the respondent registered the potential threat presented by the pedestrians four seconds prior to impact, her reaction would have been quicker when they actually stepped off the kerb two seconds later, given that their existence was already registered in her mind. It was, however, unfortunate that this crucial question, upon which the case could very well have turned, was never posed by the prosecution to the expert witnesses. Instead, before this court there was simply a unanimous and unqualified agreement among all four experts from both sides that the acceptable PRT was between 1.5 to 2 seconds.
In raising this issue the appellant therefore sought to persuade this court to draw the inference that earlier detection (at the four-second mark) would have lowered the acceptable PRT (at the two-second mark). I, however, did not consider this a matter within the ordinary human experience for which the court could come to its own conclusions, without the assistance of expert testimony. Indeed, the issue was not one easily explicable by recourse to common sense. Had the respondent registered the potential hazard, but dismissed it and shifted attention to perform other legitimate driver tasks, could it safely be said that her reflexes would have been quicker? Does a visual imprint of danger, assessed and dismissed, affect psycho-motor reflexes two seconds later? These are technical considerations behind PRT which I found unsafe to resolve without the aid of expert testimony on point.
Furthermore, the experts had the opportunity to consider all the issues raised by the appellants, and made an unqualified finding on the issue of PRT. It was not open to the court now to simply disregard their opinion and substitute its own speculation on the matter. This cardinal principle finds enunciation in Gould J`s decision in 
McLean v Weir
 
[1977] 5 WWR 609
, where, commenting on medical expert evidence, he said at p 620: 
 
[I]f the medical evidence is equivocal, the court may elect which of the theories advanced it accepts. If only two medical theories are advanced, the court may elect between the two or reject them both; it cannot adopt a third theory of its own, no matter how plausible such might be to the court.
 
 
 
This principle was applied locally in 
Tengku Jonaris Badlishah v PP
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 260
  at 271, and most recently by the Court of Appeal in the recent case of 
Saeng-Un Udom v PP
 
 
[2001] 3 SLR 1
 . In the present context, no challenge had been raised as to the basis of the experts` view on the PRT under the circumstances. While the court is not obliged to accept expert evidence by reason only that it is unchallenged (see 
Sek Kim Wah v PP
 
 
[1987] SLR 107
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 348
 ), where the expert`s view is based on sound grounds and supported by the basic facts, the court can do little else but to accept the evidence. Accordingly, I found no reason in this case to disturb the findings of the experts as to the PRT, especially since the prosecution did not consider it necessary to so challenge their views at the trial stage.
 (5)FAILURE TO AVOID ACCIDENT WHEN PEDESTRIAN GROUP STEPPED OFF THE MEDIAN STRIP
The crux of this appeal lay in the question of whether, when the pedestrian group stepped off the median strip, the reasonable and prudent driver, keeping a proper lookout, could have avoided a collision resulting in fatality. If so, the respondent would have negligently caused the deaths of the pedestrians.
The analysis of this issue was largely simplified by the arithmetic provided by the experts. The experts agreed that the pedestrian group was identifiable as a hazard when the centre of the group was at the western kerb of the median strip. They assumed a walking speed of 1m/s, and figured that there would be a two-second window before they covered the two metres to the point of impact. Based on the further assumption that the approach speed of the SAAB was 50km/h or 14m/s, the SAAB would at this two-second mark have been about 28m away.
The appellant raised two arguments to show that, but for the negligence of the appellant, the fatalities could have been avoided. Firstly, the appellant submitted that the approach speed of the SAAB was actually higher than the impact speed of 50km/h. Arguably, this would have made it more difficult for the driver to decelerate in time. However, this simply ignored the experts` agreed view that the approach speed was 50km/h. For the reasons stated earlier, I declined to speculate on issues that were not put to the prosecution`s own experts at the trial stage itself.
Secondly, the appellant advanced the argument that the respondent saw the pedestrians too late and only braked and took evasive action 
 after 
 the collision. This, they contended was supported by the testimony of Cheng, who said that he had heard a `thud` sound, followed by a swerve. Furthermore, the appellant cited the non-activation of the ABS, and the lack of brake or skid marks on the scene, to indicate that the respondent had not applied maximum braking to avoid the collision.
This argument, however, missed the mark. The first hurdle the appellant had to surpass was whether the reasonable and prudent driver could have decelerated in time to avoid a fatality. This was amply answered by the experts` acceptance of two key facts: that the accepted PRT under the circumstances was between 1.5 and 2 seconds, and that the SAAB would take 34m to come to a complete stop from 50km/h given a PRT of 1.5s. Hence, if the driver had reacted within the lower range of the PRT, ie 1.5s, the car would still have collided with the pedestrians and come to a halt some 6 to 7 metres after the point of impact. Arguably, this could have sufficiently reduced the speed of impact to avoid fatality. However, no evidence was led on this point and in any case this was simply the `best-case scenario` within the accepted PRT range. Had the driver instead engaged the brakes at the upper end of the accepted PRT, ie 2s, braking would have been simultaneous with impact, which meant that the collision would have taken place at the full approach speed of 50km/h, for which fatality would certainly have resulted. The inescapable conclusion to be drawn from the expert testimony was therefore that the reasonable and prudent driver could still have caused the fatalities as he may not have been able to decelerate prior to impact. Hence, quite apart from whether the respondent`s reaction was actually negligent, her negligence could not thereby be said to have caused the deaths, as they may have very well been unavoidable for the reasonable driver.
It was therefore strictly unnecessary to determine whether the respondent was negligent in her reaction, that is, whether she had depressed the brakes after the point of impact, outside of the accepted PRT. This was an extremely difficult issue to determine as there was no expert assistance on the matter. In any case, I make the following observations for the sake of completeness. The trial judge accepted the respondent`s testimony that she engaged the brakes simultaneously with the impact. This nevertheless raised the question of why the car came to a halt only after 30m, when the braking distance of the car would have rightly been about 13m (working backwards from the agreed fact that the braking distance was 34m, given a PRT of 1.5s, the car would have travelled 21m before the brakes were engaged, and have taken the remaining 13m to decelerate). It also did not square well with the respondent`s own admission that she only saw the group stepping off the kerb four to six metres from the point of impact, for she would have had less than 0.5s to react and engage the brakes at impact. This admission was, however, qualified by the respondent, as she was unclear of the exact distances in the moments before the accident. Turning elsewhere, the evidence of Cheng was not helpful, for his observation that there was a `thud` of impact followed by a swerve was strictly unrelated to the issue of braking. Similarly, the lack of skid or brake marks on the road surface was also inconclusive, for it was not shown by expert testimony that the braking would have caused the car to enter into a skid. Taking the available evidence into account, I found no compelling reason to disturb the trial judge`s finding that she spoke the truth when she said that she had braked upon the point of impact. The respondent had given consistent testimony throughout the trial, and her credibility had not been questioned by the trial judge. The only uncertainty with her account lay with the braking length of 30m, which could have been explicable for many reasons, one of which could be that she released the brakes in panic after the shock of impact. In any case, I found that the respondent had acted reasonably by responding and engaging her brakes within the accepted PRT, that is, two seconds after perception and at the point of impact. This was, however, no longer a live issue once, as mentioned earlier, it was clear that a reasonable driver may not have been able to avoid the accident fatalities.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In coming to my decision, I noted that the question of conviction swung on the events occurring within a four-second window of time. It would have been easy, in the hallowed and esoteric rationality of a courtroom, and with the benefit of hindsight, to dissect the respondent`s reactions ad infinitum and surmise what she could and should have done within those precious four seconds leading to the tragic accident. But in the legal post mortem that follows the facts, one should not miss the wood for the trees. The respondent had a clear right of way on a major thoroughfare. She was under the speed limit and not acting irresponsibly in any way. Her vision was somewhat affected by shadows and visual clutter on the median strip. No independent witnesses offered further assistance, and once the prosecution experts conceded that a reasonable person would have taken 1.5 to 2 seconds to react, it was clear that under the circumstances a reasonable and prudent driver may not have been able to avoid the fatalities. I therefore found that the appellant had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent had negligently caused the death of the pedestrians and accordingly dismissed the appeal.

: This was an appeal against the decision of District Judge Audrey Lim when she convicted the appellant, Soh Lip Hwa (`Soh`), of an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed) for employing a China national, Zhou Xi Qiu, who had entered Singapore without a valid pass. Soh was sentenced to one year`s imprisonment. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 The charge 
 
 
 
The charge against the appellant read as follows: 
 
You, Soh Lip Hwa, Male/44 years, NRIC No. S2584327D, are charged that you, from a day in Jan 2000 till 8th day of March 2000, at various locations in Singapore, did employ one Zhou Xi Qiu [commat] Zhou Xi Qun, a China National, as general worker, whom you had reasonable grounds for believing to be a person who had acted in contravention of Section 6(1) of the Immigration Act; Chapter 133, by entering Singapore without being in possession of a Valid Pass issued by Controller of Immigration, Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act Chapter 133 and punishable under Section 57(1)(ii) of the said Act.
 
 
 
 
 
 The undisputed facts 
 
 
 
 
 
On 8 March 2000, Sgt Koh Ah Seng was on patrol duty when he was despatched to Block 749, Jurong West Street 73, [num ]12-143. He saw two China nationals, namely, Huang Xin Hwa (`Huang`) and Zhou Xi Qiu (`Zhou`) working in that unit which was under renovation at that time. They were unable to produce any documents when requested and were arrested. They were subsequently charged in court and convicted for being illegal immigrants.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
Soh was employed as a supervisor in a company known as Tops and Hui Design & Renovation (`Tops and Hui`), which was owned by one Ting See Sa Moi (`Ting`), since July 1999 when the company was first set up.
Soh`s job was to supervise the workers and the factory. According to Ting, every minor detail in the factory was handled by him. Soh was in charge of the workers and arranged for the workers to do their jobs at the project sites. When there was a project, drawings would be faxed to Ting. Soh would then arrange for the workers to go to the site and do all the measurements before commencing work. Every week he would advise Ting as to how much to pay the workers and she would withdraw the money from the bank for payment. If Ting was unable to do so, Soh could also withdraw the money to pay the workers, as Soh and Ting were joint signatories to the company`s bank account.
Soh was given almost complete control over the assignments given to Ting`s company. Soh had the authority to employ workers without Ting`s approval or consent and he had done so previously. Ting did not raise any objections to that as she thought he was more familiar with that line of work.
In 1999, Soh brought two China nationals, namely Zhou and Huang, to see Ting and asked her whether she wanted to employ them. Ting told him no, as her company was very small. When Ting asked the two China nationals whether they had work permits, Huang showed her a work permit. Zhou did not do so. Ting claimed that she could not understand the contents of the work permit as she did not know English. She testified that Soh had seen the work permit and told her that the work permit was genuine. Ting told Huang that she had no work for him at that time and that she would contact him if she had any work for him. She made a copy of Huang`s work permit.
Soh had informed Ting of a contract for cleaning works at Block 749, Jurong West St 73, [num ]12-143. Soh was in charge of the work to be done in that unit. As Ting was not free to attend to this herself, Soh told her that he would send workers to do the job, and suggested sending Huang. Ting agreed to it and told Soh he could send the person whose work permit she had photocopied to do the work. Ting testified that she did not instruct Soh to employ Zhou.
During the course of the investigations, two handphones were seized by Investigating Officer SSgt Anan s/o Balakrishnan. One of the handphones was seized from Zhou. That handphone, bearing the number 97870275, was registered in the name of Soh and the phone bills were sent to Soh`s residential address.
Ting testified that she had never purchased handphones for the company and had never given any handphone to anyone in the company. She never requested Soh to purchase handphones for the company. She also did not pay for Soh`s handphone or his handphone bills. Neither did she pay for any handphones or handphone bills for the workers.
 The defence 
 
 
 
Soh testified that he was formally employed by Ting from May 2000. Prior to that, he was employed by Home Shape Design and Construction (`Home Shape`), which was a company owned by Ting`s husband, Ngu Ting Tieh (`Ngu`). Soh would assist Ting whenever Ngu instructed him to do so.
Soh`s evidence was that, as a supervisor, he had no authority to employ any workers. His main job was to oversee the production line in the factory and he never went down to project sites. He acted on Ting`s or Ngu`s instructions and it was Ting, and not him, who was in charge of the day to day running of the business in Tops and Hui. According to Soh, Ting had told him of the work to be done at Block 749, Jurong West St 73, [num ]12-143. He testified that he was not in charge of the work to be conducted in that unit and did not supervise the workers for the project. However, he testified later that he had instructed workers to go to the unit to do work upon Ngu`s or Ting`s orders.
Soh got to know Zhou and Huang at a nearby canteen. One day both of them asked him whether any general work was available. Soh told them that they could ask Ngu at Home Shape. Soh brought them to see Ting and asked her whether she would employ them. Soh said that he did not see Ting check any work permit and was not aware whether she did so. However, he later testified that Ting told him after checking the work permit that it was genuine.
Soh`s defence was that it was Tops and Hui, and not he, who had employed Zhou and that Soh had acted on Ting`s instructions in sending Zhou to do the work. Zhou contacted Ting in the office to ask if there was any job for him. Ting told Soh to inform Zhou that there was a job for him and to ask him to report for work. Ting also paid $20 to him to be handed over to Zhou as Zhou`s salary for the work to be done.
Ting told Soh to apply for two handphone lines for the use of the company two to three years prior to 2000. At that time, Ting was at Home Shape. The handphone bearing the number 97870275 was the handphone that Home Shape instructed him to purchase. He handed this handphone to Zhou. The handphone was purchased for Home Shape, but the bill was sent to his residential address. According to Soh, this was because he did not bring an authorisation letter from Home Shape when he bought the handphone, but produced his identity card instead. He handed the phone bills to Home Shape for reimbursement or payment. He never asked Ngu whether he would pay or had paid the bills.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The judge accepted Ting`s testimony that she had left Soh to supervise the work at the factory and on-site and to deploy and supervise workers. Ting`s testimony that Soh had the authority to hire workers without Ting`s consent was also accepted by the judge.
The judge found that Soh had brought Zhou and Huang to see her for employment. It was also found that Ting had asked to look at their work permits, and Huang produced one to Soh, who remarked that it was genuine and handed it to Ting. The judge believed Ting`s testimony that she had agreed to Soh`s suggestion in deploying Huang to do the cleaning work at the flat, as Huang had a work permit. Further, it was found by the judge that Ting never gave Soh permission to employ Zhou.
The judge found that there was clear indicia of employment by Soh. Firstly, in Soh`s long statement he admitted that he had informed Zhou that there was a job for him and asked him to come to work. Soh also demonstrated the work to Zhou and told him that he could return in one or two days. When Zhou returned, Soh directed him to do the cleaning work and gave him the address. The judge preferred Soh`s evidence in his long statement to his testimony in court, where he claimed that he had done all those things on Ting`s orders. Secondly, Soh handed Zhou his salary of $20 per day. Thirdly, Soh gave Zhou a handphone registered in Soh`s name to contact him for work. The judge also found Soh to be an inconsistent, evasive and untruthful witness. For instance, Soh`s evidence was that he did not know that Zhou and Huang produced their work permits to Ting and he did not see Ting check their work permits. However, he later testified that Ting told him that the work permits were genuine. Under such circumstances, Soh must have known that Ting had checked their work permits. Another discrepancy noted by the trial judge was that Soh testified that he did not supervise workers or go to project sites and he only worked in the factory, but he also testified that he did instruct workers to go to the unit at Blk 749 upon Ting`s or Ngu`s instructions. Yet another inconsistency was that Soh kept referring to Ting as his boss during the trial and as his employer in the long statement, but he kept denying that he was employed by Ting at the material time. He maintained that his employer was Ngu at that time, but Ngu was never mentioned in his long statement as his employer. The judge rejected Soh`s explanation that he regarded Ting as his employer when the statement was recorded, because he was then working for Ting, and thus did not mention Ngu as his boss. The judge held that it was inconceivable how Soh could have forgotten to mention Ngu, if Ngu had been involved in any way.
Accordingly the judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Soh had employed Zhou at the material time and Soh was convicted. The judge imposed a sentence of one year`s imprisonment, taking into consideration the recent decisions of 
Hameed Sultan Raffic v PP
 (Unreported) , 
Tan Soon Meng v PP
 (Unreported) and 
Ang Jwee Herng v PP
 
 
[2001] 2 SLR 474
 .
 The motion to adduce additional evidence 
 
 
 
Counsel for Soh applied, by way of CrM 24/2001, for leave to adduce the following documents as additional evidence: 
(1) a faxed copy of Zhou Xi Qiu`s marriage certificate showing his marriage to one Lin Ming Qin on 6 June 1990; 
(2) a faxed copy of a letter from the Singapore Immigration & Registration (SIR) dated 12 February 2000 addressed to Ting See Sa Moi regarding an application for a one-month social visit pass for one Lin Ming Qin; 
(3) a copy of the original letter from the SIR dated 12 February 2000 to Ting See Sa Moi regarding an application for a one-month social visit pass for one Lin Ming Qin; 
(4) a notarial certificate dated 18 June 2001 certifying the marriage of Zhou Xi Qiu to Lin Ming Qin on 6 June 1990; 
(5) a notarial certificate dated 18 June 2001 certifying the identity of Zhou Xi Qiu; 
(6) a notarial certificate dated 18 June 2001 certifying the identity of Lin Ming Qin; 
(7) a copy of the DHL envelope cum shipment airway bill dated 27 May 2001; 
(8) a copy of the DHL envelope cum shipment airway bill dated 20 June 2001.
The applicable provision in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) is s 257(1) which reads as follows: 
 
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter, the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or a Magistrate`s Court.
 
 
 
The principles in determining whether additional evidence is `necessary` were laid down in 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  at 343, which adopted the test in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 3 All ER 745
: 
 
[F]irst it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; second, the evidence must be such that, if given it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
 
 
 
This threefold test of non-availability, relevance and reliability has been applied in the recent cases of 
Chia Kah Boon v PP

In my view, the first condition was satisfied. There was no evidence to suggest that Soh knew at the time of the trial that Ting had helped Zhou`s wife apply for a social visit pass. It was also reasonable for Soh not to have suspected at the time of the trial that Ting had done so, as no evidence had been adduced to show that Ting had revealed this fact to anyone prior to the trial.
Soh might have known of the application if he had managed to contact Zhou before the trial. Soh had handed Zhou a handphone so that Soh could contact him if there was any work for him. Prior to the trial, Soh had attempted to contact Zhou by calling the phone numbers in China, as reflected on the handphone bills. In my view, this amounted to the exercise of reasonable diligence, but Soh was not able to contact Zhou prior to the trial and was thus unable to obtain evidence of the application.
 (2)THE EVIDENCE MUST BE SUCH THAT, IF GIVEN, IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON THE RESULT OF THE CASE, ALTHOUGH IT NEED NOT BE DECISIVE
Counsel for Soh submitted that the letter from the SIR addressed to Ting regarding an application for a social visit pass for Zhou`s wife indicated a closer relationship between Ting and Zhou, and their relationship was not limited to a mere acquaintanceship that was formed when Soh brought Zhou and Huang to see Ting. It was contended that this showed that Ting had been less than truthful during the trial. It was also submitted that in such circumstances it would be more likely that Zhou would have approached Ting rather than Soh for employment and it was Ting who subsequently employed Zhou.
I was of the opinion that the evidence in this case was sufficiently strong to prove that Soh employed Zhou. Ting, being the local sponsor, was required to declare her relationship with Zhou`s wife in the form for the application for a social visit pass. No evidence was adduced as to what was the relationship that Ting declared in the form. The fact that Ting had made an application for a social visit pass for Zhou`s wife might suggest that the relationship between Ting and Zhou was more than a mere acquaintanceship. Nevertheless, the possibility of a closer relationship between Ting and Zhou would not have an important influence on the result of the case, as it was not sufficient to show that Soh did not employ Zhou. Furthermore, the inference that Ting might have employed Zhou due to their relationship being possibly more than an acquaintanceship was not a strong one.
The other documents, namely, the faxed copy of Zhou`s marriage certificate showing his marriage to Lin Ming Qin, the notarial certificate certifying the marriage of Zhou to his wife, the notarial certificates certifying the identities of Zhou and his wife and the DHL envelopes cum shipment airway bills, would also not have an important influence on the result of the case.
Since the second condition was not satisfied, the motion should be dismissed.
 The appeal against conviction 
 
 
 
The main issue in this case was whether Soh had in fact employed Zhou. Before deciding on that issue, I dealt with defence counsel`s argument that the judge had erred in fact when she accepted Ting`s testimony that Soh had the authority to hire workers without her consent.
Ting testified in court that Soh had the authority to employ workers without her approval, as he was more familiar with this line. It was contended by defence counsel that as far as foreign workers were concerned, only Ting would have the authority to employ them. Counsel submitted that this was evidenced by the fact that Ting would apply for work permits for her workers through her agent and that Soh had seen it fit to bring Zhou and Huang to see Ting to ask her whether she had jobs for them and whether she wanted to employ them. It was submitted that the fact that Ting had told Huang that she had no job for him at the moment and would contact him if she had any job for him also implied that only Ting had the authority to hire foreign workers.
It is well settled that an appellate court would not readily disturb the trial judge`s finding of fact. In 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , it was held that: 
 
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor.
 
 
 
This principle has been applied by the Court of Appeal in several recent cases: 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
 ; 
Abdul Ra`uf bin Abdul Rahman v PP
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 683
 .
In my view, this finding of fact was not reached against the weight of the evidence. Ting testified that she and Soh were joint signatories to the bank account of Tops and Hui from which Soh was able to withdraw money to pay the workers and other expenses. In addition, she stated that Soh was able to tell how much each worker was worth according to their craftsmanship and would advise her how much to pay the workers every week. In my view, these facts showed the trust that Ting had in Soh and the extent of Soh`s responsibility in Tops and Hui.
Counsel for Soh submitted that, in giving such testimony, Ting was trying to distance herself from the employment of Zhou and to shift all responsibility to Soh. However, it must be noted that Soh did not dispute the fact that he held a joint account with Ting, that he was able to withdraw money from the account to pay the workers and that he determined the salaries of the workers. Ting`s testimony that Soh had the authority to hire workers without her consent was consistent with the extent of trust and responsibility conferred on Soh. Accordingly there was no reason to overturn the judge`s finding of fact in the present case.
In any event, even if the judge was wrong in finding that Soh had the authority to employ workers without Ting`s consent, I was of the view that Soh would still be guilty of the charge if he had in fact employed Zhou, even though he had no general authority to hire workers.
 (1)WHETHER SOH EMPLOYED ZHOU ON THE FACTS OF THE PRESENT CASE
Section 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed) (`the Act`) reads: 
 
 
(1) Any person who - 
 
(e) employs any person who has acted in contravention of section 6 (1), 15 or 36 or the regulations; 
 
shall be guilty of an offence and - 
 
(ii) subject to section (1A), in the case of an offence under paragraph (b), (d) or (e), shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $6,000.
  
 
 
`Employ` is defined in s 2 as: 
 
""employ"" means to engage or use the service of any person, whether under a contract of service or otherwise, with or without remuneration.
 
 
 
This definition came into effect on 1 March 1996.
As I noted in 
Tamilkodi s/o Pompayan v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 702
 , under the amended definition of `employ`, in s 2 of the Act, there was no longer a requirement that the prosecution must prove the existence of a contract of service or any payment before the alleged employer could be charged under s 57(1)(e) of the Act. In 
PP v Heng Siak Kwang
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 274
  it was held that the manner of remuneration and control over the workers would often be of great significance in deciding whether there was an employment relationship between the parties. 
 Heng Siak Kwang 
 dealt with the definition of `employ` before the amendment in 1996. Nevertheless the manner of remuneration and the degree of control of the workers continue to be two significant considerations in determining the existence of an employment relationship: 
Ramli bin Daud v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 225
 ; 
Lee Boon Leong Joseph v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 445
 ; 
 Tamilkodi s/o Pompayan v PP 
. However, these are not the only considerations which the court will take cognizance of when determining the existence of an employment relationship.
In the present case, there was evidence that Soh had control over Zhou. In the long statement, Soh stated as follows: 
 
A few days later,
 the male China national (Zhou) contacted me and asked me if there is any job for him. I told him that there is and asked him to come for work
 ...
 On his arrival, I demonstrated to him how to do the work. I also told him that he could come for work one or two days later
 ... After two days, the male China national (Zhou) came to the company. 
 I then gave the address of a unit and told him to go there to do the cleaning works in a taxi
. I also told him that the keys to the unit would be above the meter reading box. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
In court, Soh admitted that he had made the above statement. However, Soh sought to qualify his statement by saying that Zhou called Ting in the office, and not him, and that Ting told him to inform Zhou that there was a job for Zhou and to ask him to come to work. When Soh was asked during cross-examination to explain why he had omitted to mention that it was Ting who had instructed him to ask Zhou to come to work, he claimed that he was very tense when he was in the police station.
The judge rejected Soh`s qualification, as it was never once mentioned in his long statement. She held that it was implausible for him not to mention that he had done everything on Ting`s instructions because he was very tense, since he was able to give a very detailed account of how he had met Zhou and dealt with him, and had even mentioned Ting`s name. It was also held that it was inconceivable that he could have omitted such a material fact, namely, that it was Ting and not him, who had employed Zhou, if that was indeed the case.
On appeal, defence counsel submitted that the judge was wrong in accepting Ting`s testimony that she never gave Soh permission to employ Zhou. It was also contended that the judge had erred in fact when she disbelieved Soh`s testimony at trial that all the instructions given to Zhou were upon Ting`s orders. Counsel contended that Soh`s omission to mention in his long statement that he had been acting on Ting`s instructions as regards Zhou ought not to be taken against him, as direct and specific questions such as `Who employed Zhou?` or `Did you employ Zhou? If not, who did?` were not posed to him. Counsel also submitted that Soh was very tense when the statement was taken and it was not unusual for an accused person to omit to mention certain important facts in view of the pressures faced during police investigations.
I was unable to accept this argument. As rightly held by the judge, if Ting had in fact given instructions in asking Soh to inform Zhou that there was a job for him and to ask him to come to work, it was very unlikely that Soh would omit to mention that fact, given that he had mentioned Ting earlier in the statement and given that this was an important fact. There was no need to pose specific questions to elicit this fact if Ting had indeed been involved. In my view, the judge`s finding that Ting never gave permission to employ Zhou should be upheld. I was also satisfied that the judge was not wrong in rejecting Soh`s qualification to his long statement at trial.
Apart from Soh having control over Zhou, there was other evidence which gave rise to the inference that Zhou was employed by Soh. Soh handed Zhou his salary of $20 per day two to three times and had given Zhou a handphone registered under Soh`s name so that it would be convenient for Soh to contact him (Zhou) if there was any work. The phone bills were sent to Soh`s residential address. Soh claimed that Home Shape had instructed him to purchase the handphone and that the bills were paid by Home Shape. However, no evidence was adduced to show that this was so. If the phone was indeed purchased for Home Shape, it was unlikely that Soh would leave the billing address as his residential address for one and a half years and not subsequently change the billing address to that of the company. Furthermore, if the bills were to be paid by Home Shape, it was unlikely that Soh would be so unconcerned with whether unpaid portions of certain bills or amounts that were overdue had been paid by Home Shape. It would be in his interest to see that the bills were paid since he would be personally liable if payments were not made.
Accordingly, I was satisfied that the element of employment had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
 (2) MENS REA
The offence under s 57(1)(e) is not one of strict liability. The prosecution had the burden of establishing that Soh had the necessary mens rea, that is, he knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that Zhou was an immigration offender: 
Assathamby s/o Karupiah v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 744
 ; 
 Tamilkodi s/o Pompayan v PP 
 (supra).
In my view, Soh had the requisite mens rea for the offence. From the evidence, Soh had gotten to know Zhou at a nearby canteen and he was aware that Zhou was a China national. There was no evidence that Soh had checked Zhou`s passport or work permit. Soh had not exercised any due diligence on Zhou`s immigration status.
 The appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
Counsel for Soh argued that the sentence of one year imposed by the court below was manifestly excessive for the following reasons: Soh had completely no part to play in Zhou`s illegal entry into Singapore; there could not have been any profit motive on the part of Soh as he was not the boss of the business; there was no evidence to suggest that Soh stood to gain or had gained any advantage in having employed Zhou; Zhou was employed only on an ad hoc basis; Soh did not give any assistance to Zhou to evade apprehension; only one immigration offender was involved; there was no ill-treatment of the person employed; Soh has no antecedents whatsoever whether of similar offences or otherwise.
Counsel for Soh also submitted that in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused, the court ought to take into consideration the following mitigating factors: Soh was married with three children (ages 16, 14 and 12 years) and his wife was a housewife who was currently four months` pregnant. He had set up his own business and was holding the post of production manager. He was drawing a gross monthly salary of $5,000. Since late 1992, Soh had been diagnosed with and had been treated for chronic anxiety-depressive disorder.
In the recent case of 
 Hameed Sultan Raffic v PP 
 (supra), the accused was convicted after a trial for employing an immigration offender for about two months. He was a first offender and was sentenced to seven months` imprisonment. The accused unsuccessfully appealed against conviction and sentence. His sentence was enhanced to 12 months` imprisonment on appeal. In 
 Tan Soon Meng v PP 
 (supra), the accused was convicted after a trial for employing an immigration offender for about six months. The accused, who had three previous convictions for illegal employment under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, was sentenced to seven months` imprisonment. He initially appealed against his conviction, but subsequently applied to withdraw his appeal. Before the court acceded to his application, his sentence was enhanced to 12 months` imprisonment.
 Tan Soon Meng 
 was affirmed in 
 Ang Jwee Herng v PP 
 (supra) in which the court reiterated that the benchmark sentence for employing illegal immigrant workers was now one year, double that of the previously assumed tariff of six months.
In my view, the imposition of a minimum term of six months` imprisonment as prescribed by s 57(1)(ii) of the Act was confined to cases where the accused pleaded guilty to the charge. In cases where the accused was convicted after trial, the benchmark sentence for employing illegal immigrants was one year`s imprisonment.
The impact of imprisonment on the offender`s family members is generally not relevant in determining the appropriate sentence to be meted out. In
 Ang Jwee Herng 
 (supra), I held at [para ]78 that: 
 
... the argument that an offender`s family members will suffer if the offender is incarcerated for a longer term is one often put forth in vain by defence counsel. The reason, as I explained in 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
  is simply because imprisonment of the sole breadwinner inevitably causes hardship to the family. If the courts were to take such hardship into account in determining the appropriate sentence, then any punishment meted out would not be accurately reflective of the gravity of the offence and circumstance of the offender himself, but tempered with considerations of the extent to which his family would be prejudiced by it. The crux of the matter is that part of the price to pay for committing a crime is the hardship that would unavoidably be caused to the offender`s family. To put it bluntly, the appellant should have thought hard about these consequences before committing the offences in question. It is now too late in the day for him to regret the inescapable hardship which his own foolishness and greed will cause to his wife and children.
 
 
 
Accordingly, I did not think that the sentence was manifestly excessive and the sentence ordered by the district court should be affirmed.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the reasons stated above, I denied the criminal motion and dismissed the appeals against conviction and sentence.

 Introduction 
 
 
 
The appellant, Moey Keng Kong aged 57 is employed as a consultant engineer. In May 2001 he was charged and convicted in the district court under s 130(1)(a) of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 1997 Ed) of two charges of importing into Singapore assorted brands of cigars and liquor without paying customs duty. He was also convicted under s 130(1)(a) of the Customs Act, read with s 26 and s 77 of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap 117A, 1997 Ed), for failing to pay the goods and services tax (`GST`) on those same dutiable goods. The district judge ordered a fine of a total of $8,751.60 for all four charges, in default eight months` imprisonment. He also ordered the forfeiture of the cigars, liquor and a pick-up, registration number TS 5619 (`the vehicle`) under s 123(2) of the Customs Act. The appellant has paid the fines less a rebate after serving two days default sentence. He then appealed against his sentence and the forfeiture of his vehicle. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 Brief facts 
 
 
 
On 27 February 2001 at about 10.30pm, the appellant arrived at Woodlands Checkpoint. The checkpoint had a customs clearance system, which was divided into red and green car arrival channels. The red lanes were intended for cars with goods to declare whereas the green lanes were for cars with no goods to declare. The appellant drove his vehicle, a Thailand registered vehicle TS 5619, into green lane 3 where he was stopped by Senior Customs Officer Abdul Razak bin A Rahman (`SCO Abdul Razak`) for a routine check. SCO Abdul Razak checked the vehicle and found a black plastic bag containing one box `AR Rangoon` brand cigars and three boxes of `Asoka` cigars on the floorboard behind the front passenger seat. He then referred the appellant to his superior, Higher Superintendent of Customs Sim Yong Khoon (`HSC Sim`). HSC Sim asked the appellant whether he had any more cigars in the pick-up. The appellant denied having any more, although he admitted that the boxes of cigars found in the vehicle belonged to him. He said that the cigars were for private consumption and for friends when they visited him.
HSC Sim then instructed SCO Abdul Razak to conduct a more thorough search of the pick-up. In this second search, SCO Abdul Razak found five more boxes of cigars inside the toolbox compartment of the pick-up. This was located beneath the floorboard at the back of the cabin. He also found one bottle of `Maharaja` brand liquor in a leather bag on the front passenger seat and three bottles of `Kao Liang Chiew` in the side pouches of a golf bag found in the back of the pick-up. The appellant admitted that all nine boxes of cigars and four bottles of liquor found in the vehicle belonged to him. He also accepted that the nine boxes of cigars weighed a total of 2.164kg. According to the computation that was submitted to the court, the total customs duty payable on the four bottles of liquor was $45.10 and the GST payable was only $1.98. The customs duty and GST on the nine boxes of cigars also came up to a relatively modest amount of $389.50 and $12.77 respectively.
A person who fails to pay the required customs duty and tax on imported goods will be punished under s 130(1)(iii) of the Customs Act if (1) he was a first-time offender, (2) the goods imported were `tobacco products` within the meaning of s 130(3) of the Act, and (3) the goods exceeded 2kg in weight. All these elements were satisfied on the present facts as the appellant was a first-time offender who had smuggled 2.164kg of cigars into Singapore. Hence in respect of the first and second charges of importing into Singapore cigars, without paying for the requisite customs duty and GST, the appellant was liable under s 130(1)(iii) of the Customs Act. Section 130(1)(iii) in full reads as follows: 
 
where the goods consist wholly or partly of tobacco products and such tobacco products exceed 2 kilogrammes in weight - on the first conviction to both a fine of not less than 15 times the amount of the customs duty, excise duty or tax and not more than 20 times the amount of the customs duty, excise duty or tax or $10,000, whichever is the greater, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.
 
 
 
For the third and fourth charges of smuggling uncustomed liquor into Singapore, the appellant was punishable under s 130(1)(i) of the Customs Act to 
 
a fine of not less than 10 times the amount of the customs duty, excise duty or tax or $5,000 whichever is the lesser amount, and of not more than 20 times the amount of the customs duty, excise duty or tax or $5,000 whichever is the greater amount ...
 
 
 
In addition, the appellant would also be punishable, in the event of his non-payment of any of the fines imposed, with imprisonment for a term not exceeding the duration as laid down in s 119 of the Act in respect of each fine.
 The judgment below 
 
 
 
For the first and second charges (DAC 7974/2001 and DAC 7975/2001) the district judge ordered the appellant to pay a fine of approximately 20 times the amount of the customs duty and GST payable. For the third and fourth charges (DAC 7976/2001 and DAC 7977/2001), the judge imposed a fine of 15 times the amount of customs duty and GST payable. He also ordered a default term of eight months` imprisonment. The fines were as follows:

The vehicle that was used to transport the bottles of liquor and boxes of cigars was also ordered to be forfeited.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant appealed against the sentence passed by the district judge on the following grounds: 
(1) The district judge erred in holding that the appropriate benchmark sentence was 20 times the duty payable for DAC 7974/2001 and DAC 7975/2001. 
(2) The fines were manifestly excessive considering that the appellant had a clean record.
The appellant was also dissatisfied with the order of forfeiture of the goods and the vehicle and sought the release of the latter. However no substantive grounds were advanced by the appellant in this appeal, save that he had bought the goods for his own personal consumption and not for trade or business.
 (1)BENCHMARK SENTENCE OF 20 TIMES THE TAX PAYABLE FOR DAC 7974/2001 AND DAC 7975/2001
As I have stated above, the amounts of customs duty and GST payable on the nine boxes of cigars were $389.50 and $12.77 respectively. It must be noted that, because of the relatively low amount of tax payable at the first instance, the statutory maximum of the fines payable is $10,000 and not the amount that is 20 times the customs duty or tax payable, ie $7,790. Hence applying s 130(1)(iii) of the Customs Act, the permissible range of fines that can be imposed by the court came to $5,842.50-$10,000 for the customs duty and $191.50-$10,000 for the GST. The judge applied the benchmark of 20 times the tax payable and fined the appellant $7,790 for the customs duty and $255.40 for the GST. I did not consider that the judge had erred in law in applying the benchmark of 20 times the tax payable. This plainly fell within the range of fines permitted by s 130(1)(iii) and was also consistent with the current sentencing practice of the subordinate courts.
 (2) WHETHER THE FINES WERE `MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE`
 
 
 
 The nine boxes of cigars (DAC 7974/2001 and DAC 7975/2001)
 
The role of an appellate court when considering an appeal as to the sentence imposed by the trial court has been re-stated recently in 
Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 361
 . The court can and will interfere if it is satisfied that (a) the sentencing judge has made a wrong decision as to the proper factual basis for sentence; (b) there has been an error on the part of the trial judge in appreciating the material placed before him; (c) the sentence was wrong in principle; and (d) the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. In the present case, it was clear that the only question was whether the fines which had been imposed for the nine boxes of cigars and the four bottles of liquor were `manifestly excessive`.
Important factors in determining the appropriate sentence are the amount of duty evaded, the quantity of goods involved, repetition of the offence, whether the offender was acting on his own or was involved in a syndicated operation, and the role of the offender. Only the first two factors were relevant to us here. I noted that the appellant had `imported` only 2.164kg of cigars into Singapore. This was just slightly in excess of the `statutory limit` of two kilogrammes in s 130(1)(iii) of the Customs Act. Hence, in the absence of any other aggravating factors, the fact that a minimal amount of cigars was being imported should have entitled the appellant to the minimal sentence as prescribed by s 130(1)(iii).
Nevertheless it must be remembered that the fines under s 130(1)(i) and by extension s 130(1)(iii) are intended by Parliament to have a retributive and deterrent effect. See 
Chia Kah Boon v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 72
 . The fines imposed have to be fixed at a level which would be sufficiently high to achieve the dual objectives of deterrence, in terms of deterring both the appellant and other importers from evading customs duty and GST on imported goods in future, and retribution, in the sense of reflecting society`s abhorrence of the offence under s 130(1)(a) of the Customs Act.
With these factors in mind, I did not consider that the fines imposed were `manifestly excessive`. The fines of $7,790 for the customs duty and $255.40 for the GST were actually in the lower half of the permissible range as specified by s 130(1)(iii) of the Customs Act. The judge had also refrained from imposing the maximum sentence of $10,000 and/or a term of imprisonment of three years. The fact that the appellant was a first-time offender could have no additional mitigating effect as this factor had already been taken into consideration for sentencing under s 130(1)(iii) of the Customs Act. I was aware that in 
 Chia Kah Boon v PP 
 (supra) the fine was pegged at only five times the GST payable. However that case was distinguishable from the present because, whilst the individual fines imposed there were neither unreasonable nor excessive, the cumulative effect of all the fines imposed was crushing and violated the totality rule in sentencing. There is no such relevant consideration here. The appellant is employed as a consultant engineer and the total fines imposed of $8,751.60 was more than in keeping with his financial capability.
 The four bottles of liquor (DAC 7976/2001 and DAC 7977/2001)
For the four bottles of liquor, the amount of customs duty and GST which the appellant ought to have paid was $45.10 and $1.98 respectively. Hence applying s 130(1)(i) of the Customs Act, the permissible range of fines that could be imposed by the court was $451-$5,000 for the customs duty and $19.80-$5,000 for the GST. The judge imposed fines of 15 times the amount of customs duty and GST payable. This worked out to be $676.50 and $29.70 respectively.
The appellant`s contention that the sentences imposed for the importation of the four bottles of liquor were `manifestly excessive` could not be made out. Similar considerations as stated above apply. The fines imposed were minimal. The benchmark of 15 times applied was also consistent with current subordinate courts` sentencing practice with the range of sentences currently being imposed as between 15 to 20 times the customs duty or tax leviable.
 FORFEITURE OF THE VEHICLE TS 5619
I turned then to the last ground of appeal. The appellant urged the court to order the release of the forfeited vehicle on the basis that the goods conveyed in it were only meant for his personal consumption. The section governing forfeiture is s 123(2) of the Customs Act, which provides that: 
 
An order for the forfeiture of goods shall be made if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that an offence under this Act or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder has been committed and that the goods were the subject-matter of, or were used in the commission of, the offence, notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of the offence.
 
 
 
`Goods` is in turn defined in s 122(2) of the Customs Act to include `receptacles, packages, 
 vehicles 
, vessels not exceeding 200 tons net registered tonnage and aircraft, other than aircraft engaged on international carriage` (emphasis is added).
It is clear from s 123(2) itself that forfeiture is mandatory once two elements are proved: (1) an offence under the Customs Act or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder has been committed, and (2) the goods `were used in the commission of the offence`. Goods will be `used in the commission of the offence` if they are `directly related and substantially connected` to the commission of the offence: 
PP v Mayban Finance (Singapore)
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 462
 .
The weight of case law is also that there is no discretion within the courts to refuse any application for forfeiture. In 
R v Ng Hee Weng
 
 
[1956] MLJ 85
 , a case concerned with s 123 of the Customs Ordinance 1952 which was in pari materia with s 123 of our Customs Act, Good J said that: 
 
If the matters specified therein [elements 1 and 2 above] are proved to the satisfaction of the Court, the Court must order forfeiture both of the goods which were the subject matter of the offence and also of the goods ... which were used in the commission of the offence ...
 
 
 
The same point was reiterated in 
PP v M/s Serve You Motor Services
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 669
 , a case relied upon by the public prosecutor where the High Court held that (at p 675): 
 
Though a party may be innocent and have taken all necessary precautions, forfeiture will have to be ordered once it is clear that an offence had been committed. That may not be totally satisfactory, but the words of the provision are clear.
 
 
 
Similar conclusions were also reached in 
Public Finance v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 354
  and 
Bright Impex v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 405
 .
The legislature has also clearly indicated that the use of the word `shall` in s 123(2) of the Customs Act is mandatory and not merely directory. During the Parliamentary debate on 5 February 1996, the Minister for Law Professor S Jayakumar expressly said that mandatory forfeiture provisions are necessary because the public interest requires effective enforcement of customs laws. The provisions on forfeiture are intended by Parliament to act as a strong deterrent against the smuggling of dutiable goods which is viewed as a serious offence. It is also meant to target and `dry up` the means and resources by which smugglers carry out their illegal activities. Hence there can be no discretion within the courts to refuse forfeiture.
On the facts of this present appeal, it was undoubted that an offence under s 130(1)(a) of the Customs Act had been committed. It was also clear that the vehicle TS 5619 was `used in the commission of the offence` as it was used by the appellant to transport the nine boxes of uncustomed cigars and four bottles of uncustomed liquor all the way from Penang to Singapore. The appellant also made use of the hidden tool compartment of the vehicle to conceal a large portion of the uncustomed cigars to evade detection. Therefore both elements required for the operation of s 123(2) of the Customs Act were satisfied. The vehicle was also `goods` that can be forfeited as defined by s 123(2) of the Customs Act. It followed that the court must forfeit the vehicle in accordance with s 123(2) of the Act. The fact that the uncustomed goods conveyed were intended for the appellant`s personal consumption was irrelevant. The clear words of the Act must be applied and forfeiture must be ordered.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For all the above reasons, I dismissed the appeal.

ss 304(a) & 314 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
: The accused, aged 55, was charged and convicted for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224). An offence under this section is punishable with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term, which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine or caning.
The accused, represented by Mr Ahmad Nizam, pleaded guilty and admitted the facts set out in the statement of facts. On 20 January 2000 the accused bludgeoned his 79-year-old uncle to death with a stool and then cut off the deceased uncle`s genitals. The killing was utterly gruesome. After considering the mitigation plea by Mr Nizam as well as the submission on sentence by the Deputy Public Prosecutor Mr Chan, I sentenced the accused to a term of life imprisonment. Although Mr Chan called for the imposition of life imprisonment because of the repulsive nature of the offence, it was not on that basis that I handed down the sentence.
The accused was a patient of the Institute of Mental Health and has been receiving outpatient treatment at the Tampines Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic. A psychiatric report dated 24 February 2000 by Dr Tommy Tan, an Associate Consultant Psychiatrist at the Woodbridge Hospital, which report was tendered as part of the prosecution`s statement of facts, reveals the accused to be a person with a history of `chronic schizophrenia` since the 1960s. He was `markedly disabled socially and intellectually, unable to be gainfully employed and dependent on his family`.
The report went on to state that at the time of the offence the accused `was suffering from an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia`. The psychiatrist stated that the accused satisfied the criteria for the defence of `diminished responsibility`. He said that the accused `has an abnormality of the mind, ie a persecutory delusion, brought on by Schizophrenia [which] would have substantially impaired his mental responsibility`.
The defence of insanity was not raised. Mr Nizam declared that the accused did not satisfy the insanity test under s 84 of the Penal Code. The psychiatric report declared the accused fit to plead. It will be seen from the medical evidence that the accused was clearly in need of constant psychiatric treatment and supervision and that will continue for an indefinite period. Although he was suffering from mental illness since the 1960s, this was the only known incident of violence in his record of antecedents; but this episode was manifested in an extreme form, and there is evidence that there is a danger of recurrence if he does not undergo medical treatment. I have noted the plea made by his family, through his counsel, that they have forgiven him and do not hold him responsible for the crime.
The medical evidence shows that the mental culpability of this accused was substantially diminished. As such he deserves compassion and leniency, but nonetheless I am of the view that the sentence of life imprisonment is the appropriate sentence. The alternative was to sentence him to a fixed term of imprisonment not exceeding ten years. That will enable the accused to return to society after about seven years on account of good behaviour; but remains a danger to himself and others. Finding the correct principle to apply in the sentencing process in this case was, however, not a straightforward exercise. If a man must be punished for what he has done, then the fact that his mental culpability was diminished by reason of a mental illness ameliorates his crime and the punishment ought to be reduced to the extent that he is not punished beyond what he deserves. If medical treatment is not required (or in issue) a long custodial sentence may not be appropriate in such a case. However, in the present circumstances, I was unable to ignore the obvious desirability of keeping the accused safe from himself, and others, from him. Dr Tommy Tan wrote in a report dated 22 March 2000 that the accused `has Chronic Schizophrenia, a major mental illness. He will need long-term medication. He can be a danger to others and himself if he does not take medication.` A person in this condition requires medical and psychiatric treatment as much as the law may require his imprisonment; but there is no other suitable relief or order that may be made under any of the relevant statutory provisions on the facts before me.
The two notable provisions under the Penal Code are s 84 and Exception 7 to s 300. They read as follows: 
 
Section 84 - Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.
 
 
 
Exception 7 - Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.
 
 
 
These provisions were drafted at a time when psychiatric medicine was still in a relative state of infancy, and could not adequately guide the framers of the Code, who it appears from the overall scheme, initially intended to provide a general excuse for criminal conduct on account of an unsoundness of mind which eliminates any prescribed or implied mens rea of an offence, but subsequently incorporated the specific Exception 7 provision to exclude a homicide from the definition of murder if the accused was incapable of forming the requisite intention by reason of `an abnormality of mind` without adjustment to s 84. No connection or distinction was made between `unsoundness of mind` and `abnormality of mind` nor of all the peripheral qualifications to those crucial terms. The words of s 84 were adopted in form and substance from the M`Naghten`s Rules themselves emanating from 
M`Naghten`s Case
 (Unreported) (Unreported) . The English have long questioned the usefulness of those enigmatic Rules. See: 
 Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1949-1953 Report 
, 90-116. The dearth of cases in Singapore in which s 84 has been raised successfully as a defence is mute testimony consistent with the conclusion of the Royal Commission.
From the point of law, an accused found at trial to be of unsound mind within the definition of s 84 at the time of the offence will be acquitted as provided under s 314 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). By s 315(1) of the CPC, that accused will then be ordered to `be kept in safe custody in such place and manner as the court thinks fit and shall report the case for the orders of the Minister`. The Minister may then order that person to be `confined in a mental hospital, prison or other suitable place of safe custody during the President`s pleasure`. On the other hand, a person found at trial to be suffering from an abnormality of mind within the definition of Exception 7 (introduced in England under the Homicide Act 1957) may not be liable for murder but shall be found guilty of culpable homicide and be sentenced accordingly. The distinction between `unsoundness of mind` and `abnormality of mind` appears to be a legal one, hinging on the question whether the accused was aware of the nature of his act, or that what he did was wrong or contrary to law. Laying s 84 and Exception 7 in the same Code invites the suggestion that mental disorders are categorized neatly into one or the other, a suggestion which may mislead lawyers and doctors alike to assume that that is what the law wants. The end of the trap is the obfuscation of the simple fact that mental disorders are of different types and each has a wide range in terms of the degree of affliction. The effect of the trap is that the full facts of each case may not be adequately explored so as to facilitate the inquiry whether the accused was not guilty by reason of insanity, or guilty but not fully culpable, or guilty and fully culpable. In the second case, a further inquiry is necessary to determine what is the appropriate sentence of imprisonment since there is no fixed rule that a person convicted of culpable homicide must invariably be sentenced to life imprisonment.
Often, if not invariably, when an accused pleads guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, he would have represented to his counsel and the psychiatrist (and sometimes to the court) that he was aware of the nature of his act and knew that what he did was wrong and contrary to law. But what is the weight to be given to an admission made by a person diagnosed to be suffering from an unsoundness or abnormality of mind such that his judgment and perception are impaired? It is virtually an inverse situation of Joseph Heller`s 
 Catch-22 
. In that novel, there is a `regulation 22` under which a pilot may only apply to be discharged from the air force on the ground of insanity. However, the same regulation provided that if a pilot is capable of making that application he shall be deemed to be sane. Mr Nazim pleaded for the accused be confined in a mental institution as opposed to being sentenced under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. But as I have stated above, on the facts, this accused does not qualify to be acquitted on the ground of unsoundness of mind and the only orders that I could make are those under s 304(a). Given the nature of his illness, the closest order to a long term detention with medical rehabilitation would be, in my view, a sentence of life imprisonment; but if I do not provide any sound basis why a person whose mental capacity (for the commission of the offence charged) was diminished by a chronic and serious mental illness should be punished to the maximum limit provided under s 304(a) it is because there is none save the utilitarian one that I have adopted for this case.
There was no evidence in this case to suggest that although the accused had stated that he knew the nature of his act, and that his action was wrong, his admission ought, nonetheless, be disregarded because objective medical diagnosis indicates that his perception of right and wrong had been warped by his mental illness. There is only a hint of that in Dr Tan`s report of 24 February 2000 that I shall now refer to again. It was, of course, open to counsel to ask that I reject the accused`s plea and proceed to trial; but Mr Nizam was reluctant to do that - I say this not as a criticism in any way as I do not know the details of his brief and instructions - neither was I inclined to reject the plea on my own accord, even though on this score I had taken into account the last sentence in Dr Tommy Tan`s report of 24 February 2000 at p 2 in which he stated: 
 
[The accused] is fit to plead. He understands that he has been charged with killing his uncle and the consequence of being found guilty. However, I urged his counsel to be patient with him. I also humbly ask the court to be patient with him. His chronic symptoms may cause him some difficulty in following court procedures and instructing counsel.
 
 
 
It is well acknowledged that difficulty in understanding court procedure or in instructing counsel is not equated with the inability to understand the nature of the act or that it was wrong and contrary to law. That the accused failed to satisfy the criteria was fully borne out by the medical evidence and submission of Mr Nizam. So, once again, the narrowness of s 84 has prevented a possible candidate from passage. In my view, since the effect of an order under s 314 of the CPC and a sentence of life imprisonment would be almost similar in the present case I, therefore, accepted the accused`s plea of guilty and for the reasons above, sentenced him to life imprisonment.

: This was another in a series of cases involving the now infamous Geylang moneylender Chua Tiong Tiong, otherwise known as `Ah Long San`, which have perplexed the courts in recent months. At the end of the hearing, I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 Salient facts 
 
 
 
The facts of this case are relatively straightforward. The appellant, who was a police officer, was charged with one count of having accepted an unspecified sum of money from Chua Tiong Tiong (`Chua`) through one Tan Yuek Theng (PW2) (`Tan`) outside the M3-KTV Lounge in Geylang sometime in January 1998. The charge under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed) (`the PCA`) alleged that the appellant accepted the moneys as gratification in return for using his position as a police officer to assist Chua in his affairs.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The prosecution for its case relied mainly and in fact primarily on the evidence of Tan. Prior to the trial, Tan had given, inter alia, two statements to two senior special investigators from the Corrupt Practices Investigating Bureau (`CPIB`) separately: P4, which was recorded by SSI Liew Khee Yat (PW6) (`SSI Liew`) in the early morning of 2 January 1999; and P3, recorded by SSI Jacqueline Foo (PW5) (`SSI Foo`) some 22 days later on 24 February 1999. The gist of what Tan had said in these statements, particularly in P4, was that he had been a runner for Chua between 1997 and 1998, and had assisted the latter in passing envelopes of cash to the appellant, as well as several other police officers, including Kelvin Fong and William Fong. He was previously acquainted with Kelvin who subsequently introduced him to William in 1995. Thereafter, he was further introduced to the appellant by Kelvin some time in 1998 at a drinking session. With respect to the appellant, Tan said that he had, on one night in January 1998, been given an envelope of cash by Chua at the back of a coffeeshop in Geylang with the instruction that he should pass the envelope of cash to the appellant, who would be waiting for him at the M3-KTV Lounge several streets away. The envelope was sealed and Tan did not open it. From his experience of having handled cash as a loanshark before, however, he was able to tell that there were two stacks of S$50 notes inside the envelope. He proceeded to the M3-KTV Lounge where he saw one Lim Hock Gee, whom he knew to be Chua`s personal driver, waiting there. About five minutes later, the appellant arrived in his car, following which Tan handed the envelope of cash to him after telling him that it was from Chua. The appellant accepted the envelope and drove off.
In court, under examination-in-chief by the Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP), Tan did a complete turnaround and retracted the essence of what he had said in his statements to the CPIB officers. He denied having worked for Chua or having ever delivered envelopes of money for the latter to the appellant. He claimed that SSI Liew had threatened him as well as conducted other oppressive acts on him when recording P4, as a result of which Tan had given the statement randomly and its contents were thus his own concoctions and did not contain the truth.
At this juncture, the DPP applied for a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of P4 and P3. Several CPIB officers who had been involved in recording statements from Tan were called during the voir dire, including SSI Liew and SSI Foo. SSI Liew denied the allegations made against him by Tan to the effect that he had stripped the latter to his underwear, turned on the air-conditioner to full-blast and refused his request to visit the washroom when recording P4. He further testified that he met up with Tan again subsequently on 23 March 1999 whereupon Tan was requested to furnish a witness bond of $25,000 as compulsion for him to testify at trials against several police officers investigated by the CPIB, including the appellant. When Tan replied that he could not afford the amount, SSI Liew pleaded with his Assistant Director on Tan`s behalf for the amount to be reduced to $5,000, which it eventually was. As for the other recording officers, the substance of their evidence was to the effect that none of them had held out any threat, inducement or promise to Tan during the recording of his statements, nor had Tan complained to them about Liew`s alleged mistreatment. All the recording officers were offered to Tan himself for cross-examination, although defence counsel was not afforded the same opportunity. Under cross-examination by the DPP, Tan agreed that P4 and P3 were made by him voluntarily. He maintained this stand again in his own re-examination by withdrawing his allegations of oppressive conduct by SSI Liew.
At the end of the voir dire, the district judge ruled, based on the evidence adduced in the trial-within-a-trial, that both P4 and P3 were made by Tan voluntarily.
Upon the resumption of the main trial, Tan again confounded the court with his erratic and conflicting testimony. While he admitted that he had indeed worked as a runner for Chua between 1997 and 1998, he denied having ever handed any envelope containing cash to Kelvin, William Fong or the appellant. He said that he had given the appellant a loan of $1,000 once, at the Changi Government Chalet, but that that was a personal loan given by himself and not on behalf of Chua. He claimed that he had stated otherwise in P4 and P3 out of fear.
At this point, the prosecution applied to impeach Tan`s credit under ss 157(c) and 147(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed), which application was granted by the court. When confronted with the material discrepancies between his assertions in P4 and P3, and his testimony in court, Tan`s characteristic replies were that he had given the statements contained in P4 and P3 out of fear, that he had said them thoughtlessly, and that SSI Liew had threatened him. Under cross-examination by defence counsel, Tan again asserted that the conflicting statements in P4 and P3 were either suggested to him by SSI Liew or a figment of his own imagination and further claimed that SSI Liew had hit him with a document sometime during the recording of P4. He agreed with defence counsel that Chua had never given him envelopes of money to pass to the appellant. Upon re-examination by the DPP, Tan again maintained that the inconsistencies in P4 which implicated the appellant were thought up of by himself and that he was forced into saying what he did to SSI Liew.
At the end of the prosecution`s case, the defence made a submission of no case to answer which was rejected by the trial judge. The appellant elected to give evidence in his defence in consequence.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The appellant`s defence was simply that he had never received any envelope of cash from Tan. He also denied having ever been to the M3-KTV Lounge in Geylang. Under cross-examination, he admitted that he had known Tan since the beginning of 1997, having been introduced to the man by Kelvin. He agreed that he had gone out with Tan before, either to coffeeshops or KTV Lounges but always with Kelvin or William around. At these outings, the appellant always left the party first so he did not know who eventually footed the bill. But he maintained that he always paid back his share of the bill to either Kelvin or William. It was not disputed that the appellant was also acquainted with Chua. He testified that he had met Chua through the latter`s brother, one Chua Tiong Chye (`CTC`), whom he had known in his army days, at a coffeeshop in Geylang. He denied knowing that Chua was the infamous illegal moneylender `Ah Long San`, and testified that he only knew him as `Ah San`. He later met Chua or `Ah San` at the Deluxe Lido Palace Nite Club in the Concorde Hotel on two separate occasions. He claimed, however, that the meetings were chance meetings and both men had gone there separately with their own groups of friends. As before, he maintained that he paid back his share of the bill on both occasions to his colleagues and did not know if Chua had paid for the appellant`s group. He admitted when pressed, however, that Chua had arranged to meet him once at the Sakura Finger Pressure Fitness Centre (`Sakura`) in Geylang on 17 December 1998 to confide in him about the legal processes concerning CTC, who had been arrested in June 1998.
It was revealed during cross-examination that the appellant had made a status enquiry into one Lim Chin Boon on Chua`s request some time in December 1998. He disclosed that he had called up one SSG Ong Hock Leong from the Secret Societies Branch to find out if Lim Chin Boon had been arrested. He denied, however, that the information given by SSG Ong on Lim Chin Boon`s status was confidential in nature or that his act in making the enquiry was against the law, asserting that members of the public themselves could personally call up to find out if a particular person had been arrested. The appellant also did not ask Chua why he wanted this information for he simply assumed that Lim Chin Boon was either Chua`s relative or friend.
With regard to a certain blue Sunpage pager in his possession, the appellant admitted that Tan, to whom the pager belonged, had passed it to him for safekeeping sometime in late 1998. Tan had allegedly bought the pager for one of his workers but had trouble locating him and as such, requested the appellant to keep the pager in his custody for the time being. The appellant agreed to do so as he felt it was prestigious to be carrying two pagers.
At this juncture, the DPP applied to impeach the appellant`s credit by reference to a document entitled `Statement of Facts`, which was admitted by the trial judge as exh P7. I noted at the outset that P7 was not a document signed by the appellant but was instead signed by the DPP. It contained brief descriptions written in the third person of the facts surrounding several other charges against the appellant under the Police Force Act, Films Act and Computer Misuse Act respectively. The appellant agreed with the DPP that he had seen the document P7 before and had previously admitted to its contents unreservedly. He explained that the statement in P7 to the effect that he had accepted free drinks from Chua at the Deluxe Lido Palace Nite Club in 1997 referred only to the period when Chua had, as a matter of courtesy, invited the appellant over to join his party after they happened to chance upon each other at the lounge. The appellant maintained that he paid for the drinks of his own group himself and that Chua had never specifically invited him out for drinks. As for the status enquiry into Lim Chin Boon, the appellant stated that he did not know, at the time he made the enquiry, that it was against the Police General Orders or that it amounted to conduct prejudicial to good order.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
At the end of the trial, the district judge disbelieved the appellant`s testimony and convicted him accordingly. He also found that Tan`s oral evidence was unreliable, choosing instead to rely on what he had said in P4 and P3, which the learned judge held contained the truth of events. He was satisfied, after a consideration of the factors in s 147(6) of the Evidence Act, that adequate weight could be accorded to the evidence contained in P4 and P3, which on their own was sufficient to sustain the appellant`s conviction.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The main issue on appeal before me, as was the case at the trial, was the question whether or not the fact of gratification had been proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. Counsel for the appellant advanced in essence two main lines of argument before me. He contended firstly that his client was prejudiced as he was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the recording officers during the voir dire. Next, counsel further submitted that P4 itself raised serious doubts as to whether or not the envelope which Chua had handed to Tan to pass to the appellant even contained cash, and if so, exactly how much cash it contained.
 The law 
 
 
 
Section 6(a) of the PCA states as follows: 
 
If -
 
 
 
 
(a) any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempt to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal`s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs or business,
  
 
 
 
... 
 
he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.
  
 
 
I held in the case of 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
  that in order to sustain a conviction under s 6(a), the prosecution needs to prove the following four elements beyond a reasonable doubt (at p 613): 
(i) that there was an acceptance of gratification; 
(ii) that the gratification was accepted as an inducement or reward; 
(iii) that there was an objectively corrupt element in the transaction; and 
(iv) that the appellant accepted the gratification with a guilty knowledge.
As alluded to, the only element in dispute in this appeal was limb (i) of the offence as enunciated above.
 Analysing the appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tan`s evidence
 
It was not disputed that Tan was the prosecution`s sole material witness in this case, one who also turned hostile during his examination-in-chief. As a result, the prosecution sought to impeach his credit by highlighting the material discrepancies between his testimony in court, and his prior statements to the CPIB. When oppressive acts by SSI Liew were alleged by Tan in the recording of P4, the district judge allowed the prosecution`s application to conduct a voir dire in order to determine the voluntariness of Tan`s statements.
With respect, I found that the course taken by the trial judge was procedurally erroneous. Nowhere is it stated either in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`) or the Evidence Act that a witness`, as opposed to an accused`s, statement to the police or a CPIB officer is subject to any test of voluntariness. In other words, there is nothing in the statute law which states that a witness` police or other statement has to be voluntary before it may be admitted as evidence in a trial. It will be seen that the voluntariness tests espoused in s 122(5) of the CPC for police statements and s 24 of the Evidence Act for confessions made to non-police officers, apply only to statements given by an accused person. Witness` statements whether to police officers or otherwise do not fall within the same category and, as such, are not subject to any test of voluntariness. As such, it was unnecessary and procedurally incorrect for the district judge to have ordered a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of P4 and P3. The Court of Appeal has recently endorsed this view in the case of 
Thiruselvam s/o Nagaratnam v PP
 
 
[2001] 2 SLR 125
 , in which it was said with regard to previous inconsistent statements of witnesses which are sought to be admitted via s 147 of the Evidence Act, as P4 and P3 undoubtedly were in this case, that all that is required to be proved is that those statements were in fact made by the witness. There is no further requirement under s 147 to prove that the witness made the statement voluntarily. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge in that case that, if a statement had been involuntarily extracted from a witness, then the weight of that statement admitted for the purpose under s 147 may be significantly reduced but its admissibility per se remains unaffected. In my view, that must be the correct position at law for in the absence of any statutory direction enjoining the conducting of voir dires for witness` statements, to hold that the admissibility of a witness` statement is conditioned upon it being found to have been given voluntarily would be tantamount to judicial legislation.
Following from the above, I found that the admission of P4 and P3 as evidence in this case was governed solely by ss 147 and 157(c) of the Evidence Act, which I reiterate do not stipulate a separate requirement of voluntariness. The relevant portions provide as follows: 
 
 
147(1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined, without such writing being shown to him or being proved; but if it is intended to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him. 
 
... 
 
(3) Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible. 
 
... 
 
(6) In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts. 
 
157 The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him: 
 
... 
 
(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted; ...
  
 
 
Section 157 thus allows for the credit of a witness to be impeached upon proof of the previous consistent statement and its material discrepancies not being satisfactorily explained. Section 147 too was originally drafted as an impeachment provision, intended to permit cross-examining counsel to demolish the credibility, and hence testimony of a witness who had previously given a statement which was inconsistent with his evidence in court. The function of s 147 was, therefore, limited or restricted to impeaching the credit of the witness in question. It did not allow the previous inconsistent statement to be correspondingly admitted into the case as evidence. In 1976, however, the Evidence Act was amended to introduce the current s 147(3), which effectively lifted the restriction on the purpose for which previous inconsistent statements might be used. Following the amendments, a previous statement made by a witness may now be used not only to impugn his credibility as a witness, but as evidence of the facts stated therein as well. I had earlier settled and documented this point in the landmark case of 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
 , in which I held further that a conviction may be sustained solely on the evidence contained in a witness` previous inconsistent statement.
Returning to the facts of the present case, it was not disputed on either side that Tan`s testimony in court was vastly different from his statements in P4 and P3. Since the signatures on P4 and P3 belonged to Tan and he in any event admitted to making them, there was no question that the statements P4 and P3 were formally proved. What was in contention was the question whether or not P4 and P3 contained the truth or had been voluntarily made. As I explained earlier however, this question does not affect the admissibility of P4 and P3. They being but mere witness` statements, are admissible via s 147 of the Evidence Act irrespective of the voluntariness or lack thereof with which they were made. But are the statements then to be accorded their full weight? Surely this cannot be the case. While P4 and P3 are clearly admissible whether in cross-examination or as evidence of the facts stated therein by virtue of s 147, the weight to be accorded to such evidence has to be separately determined. As held in 
 Thiruselvam 
`s case (supra), it is only at this stage that questions relating to the circumstances in which the statements were made become relevant and not earlier, as the trial judge appeared to me to have mistakenly thought in acceding to the prosecution`s request to hold a voir dire. The difference between considering questions of voluntariness at the weight stage as opposed to the admissibility stage is that in the former, a separate trial-within-a-trial need not be held to determine the question of voluntariness for the evidence is already admitted. Any question concerning the circumstances surrounding the recording of the statements is thus put to the recorders as part of the main trial itself, rightfully opening them to cross-examination by defence counsel in a case where it is the voluntariness of a prosecution witness` statement that is in contention. What took place in the present case on the other hand was that the district judge had called for a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of P4 and P3, but had excluded defence counsel from cross-examining the recorders of P4 and P3 in the voir dire because it was the voluntariness of a prosecution witness` statement that was being impugned. I accepted counsel`s point that clearly this could not be right, for the thrust of the prosecution`s case, as it turned out, hinged solely on P4 and P3, and as such, it was in every interest of the appellant that he be permitted to cross-examine the recorders of those statements on the circumstances in which the recordings were made. The failure to let defence counsel cross-examine the recorders might thus well have rendered the proceedings below a mis-trial warranting a rehearing altogether. Fortunately however, the recorders of P4 and P3 were called to give evidence again in the main trial of the circumstances surrounding the recording of the statements so as it turned out, defence counsel was not after all precluded from cross-examining them on this point. As a result, I found counsel`s contention that his client was prejudiced because Tan was unrepresented during the voir dire to be wholly without merit. While it may have been improper for the trial judge to have asked Tan to undertake the cross-examination of SSI Liew and SSI Foo during the voir dire himself, no prejudice accrued to the appellant since defence counsel was subsequently allowed to cross-examine the recorders when the main trial resumed. Certainly, the position may well be different in other cases where the recorders are not called as part of the main trial which is in fact often the case. In that situation, the accused would effectively have been denied the opportunity to confront the persons best acquainted with the circumstances surrounding the recording of the incriminating statement against him, resulting in an affront to all common sense notions of fairness. No such unfairness however was present in the case before us since the recorders were in fact called as witnesses again in the main trial. In addition, I found that there was also nothing to support counsel`s suggestion that Tan should have been offered separate representation for himself, the latter not being a defendant or co-accused in the trial.
The result of the examination of the recording officers is thus one of the instrumental factors influencing the proper weight to be given to the statement in question. In 
Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 25
 , guidance was given by the Court of Appeal in respect of the other factors listed under s 147(6) to be considered when determining the proper weight to be accorded to a previous inconsistent statement of a witness admissible in evidence by virtue of s 147(3): 
 
First, the contemporaneity of a statement with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated is important for it guards against inaccuracy, though the degree of contemporaneity required will vary with the facts in question. The recollection of the details of particular events, particularly where these occur quickly, is easily susceptible to error with time but the recollection of the existence of a relationship is not so malleable. Second, there can be little guidance on the possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement but the court must be astute in spotting such instances. Third, in addition to the above matters, the weight to be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by an explanation of the inconsistency and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of the facts. Fourth, regard should be had to the context of the statement. Subsection (6) does not restrict consideration to only the making of the statement but requires consideration of all the circumstances affecting its accuracy. Thus the court must consider the context of the inconsistent portions, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined. Reliance cannot be placed on a portion of the statement that is taken out of context. Finally, the cogency and coherence of the facts to be relied upon has to be noted. An ambivalent statement does not attract much weight.
 
 
 
Applying the above factors first to P4, which in any event was the more incriminating of Tan`s two statements, the most pertinent consideration was of course Tan`s allegation of the several oppressive acts that SSI Liew had supposedly carried out on him. While I have shown that this does not go towards the admissibility of the statement, it nevertheless affects the weight to be given to it. A perusal of the notes of evidence of the court below showed, however, that any accusation of oppressive acts committed by SSI Liew on Tan could not have been anything more than a figment of his own imagination, dreamt up of by him for reasons best known to himself. Firstly, despite the obviously harsh treatment which he described he received from SSI Liew, it is telling that Tan made absolutely no complaint about it to the other officers whom he encountered subsequently - SSI Phua Meng Ghee (PW4) (`SSI Phua`), who took over the recording of P4 from SSI Liew in the evening of the same day, and SSI Foo who recorded P3 from Tan some 22 days later. He claimed to have made a complaint to one SSI Raymond Wee, yet it is telling that SSI Wee was not called by the defence though it was open to them to do so. Next, it was both SSI Phua and SSI Foo`s evidence that they had read back P4 over to Tan before commencing the recording of their own statements and at no time did Tan complain of any errors, mistakes or untruths in P4. Thirdly, SSI Liew testified, and this was admitted to by Tan himself, that subsequently, Tan had even confided in him about his financial and business problems in China, thus diminishing the possibility that SSI Liew could have subjected Tan to the type of callous treatment which he alleged since it appeared that the two men obviously got along well-enough for the latter to share his personal problems with the former. Nor was Tan able to proffer any explanation why SSI Liew would have later bothered to negotiate for a lower witness bond for the former if the two men had indeed had a bad episode between them just several months earlier. Finally, it is pertinent that Tan was not even under arrest nor was it suggested that he was a suspect at the time when his statements were recorded. If anything, it appeared that he was all along treated as a witness only by the CPIB. As such, there was no fathomable reason why SSI Liew should have subjected him to the type of treatment which he described. As regards P3, it was clear that there was nothing questionable about the circumstances in which it was recorded. No allegation of oppression was made against SSI Foo who recorded that statement 22 days after the alleged harsh treatment by SSI Liew. As such, any fear which might have been operating on Tan`s mind, even if it had existed, as a result of SSI Liew`s alleged oppressive conduct would clearly have ceased to operate by the time P3 was recorded.
As for the noticeable absence of contemporaneity, given that the statements were only given in February 1999 while the alleged incident occurred in January 1998, I found that the district judge had already adequately dealt with this point. He noted, rightly, that the passing of the envelope of moneys from Tan to the appellant was but a simple, one-off concrete event. It was not part of a complicated factual matrix which, if it was, might have provided an excuse for a genuine failure of memory. As such, it was unlikely that Tan`s recollection of the event in his statements could have been eroded by the passage even of one year. Perhaps if he had been mistaken as to the person whom he passed the moneys to outside the M3-KTV Lounge, he being a regular runner for Chua, that might have been a credible explanation, but his testimony in court was not that he had been mistaken as to the identity of the recipient of the moneys, but that he had never passed envelopes of moneys for Chua to anyone at all! Indeed, I found it difficult to see why or how he could have spun those stories concerning the passing of moneys to the appellant in front of the M3-KTV Lounge and to Kelvin Fong at the void deck of his block of flats, together with all their specifics and details if not even a semblance of these events had ever taken place.
Moving on to the possibility of misrepresentation, I found that there was no reason why Tan should implicate the appellant nor was defence counsel able to suggest one to the court. While Tan, though not necessarily an accomplice, was clearly a participant or abettor to the offence, and his words should thus be treated with caution, this was not however a case in which Tan had sought to minimise his own role in the transaction by seeking to push the blame wholly onto someone else. Here, Tan had clearly fully incriminated himself in P4, admitting without qualification that he was the middleman who had delivered the moneys from Chua to the appellant. As such, astute as I was to such instances, I found no reason or motive for him to misrepresent the facts in his statements.
With respect to the cogency and coherence of the statement, I had no doubt that the incriminatory portions of P4 were clear and unambiguous for they unequivocally identified the appellant as the person to whom Tan had passed the envelope of moneys. Nitty-gritty details on the other hand, such as his knowledge of the denomination of the currency or the exact amount contained in the envelope, even if somewhat nebulous and unclear, did not affect the main purport of the statement which clearly incriminated the appellant. It will be recalled that the charge, after its amendment by the district judge, defined the gratification received as being an `unspecified sum of money` only and as such, counsel`s contention that the prosecution was unable to prove from P4 the exact amount of money contained in the envelope did not advance his client`s case in any way whatsoever.
It followed from the above that there was nothing which warranted that little weight be given to Tan`s previous statements as contained in P4 and P3. On the contrary, I formed the view that substantial and considerable weight should be given to them for the reasons set out above. His failure to proffer any satisfactory explanation of the material discrepancies between his CPIB statements and his testimony in court meant further that his credit had been impeached and he had clearly been shown to be one who was incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath: see 
 Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP 
 (supra). What the court was left with were thus his statements in P4 and P3, which I have shown should be accorded substantial weight. In the light of the now well-settled pronouncement in 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
 (supra) elucidated above that a conviction may be sustained solely on the evidence contained in a witness` previous inconsistent statement even if uncorroborated, a fortiori, I had no hesitation that such evidence on its own amply satisfied the minimum evaluation test espoused in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 [1980-1981] SLR 73 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  that is necessary to justify calling upon of an accused to enter on his defence at the end of the prosecution`s case. As a result, I found that the decision by the district judge to reject the submission of no case to answer by the defence and to call upon the appellant to enter on his defence was unimpeachable.
At this juncture, I pause for a moment to mention that I am aware of the dangers of relying solely on a previous inconsistent statement of a witness to found a prima facie case for the prosecution, let alone sustain an entire conviction. Admittedly, the evidence contained in such a statement is potentially unreliable on three counts: first, it is obviously hearsay, being an out-of-court and hence unsworn assertion, second it is, at least in this case, the word of a participant in the offence itself who may thus be seen to have had a motive to lie or frame the accused, and lastly, it is almost always extracted under custodial and interrogative conditions which greatly increase the risk of false statements. Nevertheless, I was of the view that these concerns did not fair strongly in the present case. With respect to the objection by reason of hearsay, this is dealt adequately with by s 147(3) of the Evidence Act which specifically creates a statutory exception to the hearsay rule. The legislature has obviously thought it fit, for reasons of practicality (since they felt it artificial to draw a distinction between using a statement to impeach and treating its contents as substantive evidence), to make statements admitted via s 147(3), an exception to the rule. In any event, the appellant in this case was not precluded from cross-examining the maker of the statement, Tan, who unlike a co-accused in a joint trial, was a compellable witness. As regards the fact that Tan himself was a participant, I have shown that there was no logical reason nor has defence counsel suggested one, why he should frame the appellant after he had already fully implicated himself in the statement. Clearly any temptation to narrate the story in a way most favourable to himself was not succumbed to by Tan in giving the statement in P4. Finally, it was also pertinent that Tan was not under arrest nor was he even a suspect at the time when the statements were taken from him. As such, the statements could not be said to have been recorded under custodial conditions. As for whether the conditions were interrogative, it too has been shown that Tan`s allegation of oppressive conduct by SSI Liew was simply unbelievable. While implicating a third party in one`s statement hardly qualifies as an admission against one`s own self-interest and does not generally have the same guarantee of reliability as one`s own confession damning oneself, I had no doubt in this case after taking all the above circumstances into account in totality, that P4 and P3 were not so inherently incredible as to be incapable of belief. As such, I rejected counsel`s submission that the district judge had erred in calling upon the appellant to enter on his defence based on the evidence in P4 and P3 alone.
 The allegation of hearsay and opinion contained in P4
Before moving on to consider the appellant`s defence, I ought to deal briefly with counsel`s allegation in his written case that several portions of P4 contained hearsay which should have been excluded. If counsel`s allegation was correct, then those portions of the evidence should rightly have been excluded since s 147(3) of the Evidence Act only permitted the admission of facts of which direct oral evidence by the maker would have been admissible. With respect then to the allegation of hearsay, the impugned portions of P4 read as follows: 
(a) `... Ah San had asked me personally to hand the envelopes of money to Kelvin, William and Royston.` 
(b) `... I was asked by Ah San to hand an envelope of money to Royston.` 
(c) `[Ah San] said that Royston would be waiting for me at M3-KTV Karaoke ...`
With respect to `a` and `b` above, the argument ran that since Tan never opened the envelope, he did not have personal knowledge of its contents, and as such, the fact that the envelope contained money could only be proved by Chua`s statement to Tan that it did, which was clearly hearsay since Chua was not called to testify. I found that contention to be wholly without merit. I think it was clear that the fact that the envelope contained money could be and was indeed proved by evidence other than the portions `a` and `b` in P4 as set out above. As the district judge rightly pointed out, numerous other factors contributed to the irresistible inference that the envelope contained money. Firstly, it was not disputed that Chua was a moneylender and the appellant a police officer. Second, the surreptitious circumstances surrounding the passing over of the envelope - at night, in front of a KTV Lounge in Geylang with no other witnesses present, and through a middleman - strongly suggested that the envelope contained cash. Finally, and most importantly, the defence was never advanced along the line that Tan had passed something else contained in the envelope to the appellant but had always been a complete denial of the appellant having received anything at all in the first place! As such, the attempt to impugn the evidence of what was contained in the envelope clearly did not assist the appellant in his defence at all. With respect to portion `c` set out above, I had no doubt that the prosecution was not attempting to prove the truth of what was said by Chua there, but merely the fact that it was said, thus taking that portion of the statement out of the realm of inadmissible hearsay. In any case, Tan was fully capable of testifying as to his own personal encounter with the appellant outside the lounge subsequently, so it did not matter whether what Chua had said to him was true.
Moving on to counsel`s other contention that P4 also contained opinion evidence, the impugned portions read as follows: 
(d) `I had felt the envelope and I believed that there were 2 stacks of new $50 notes inside the envelope.` 
(e) `I could not confirm that there were exactly $10,000 inside the envelope but based on my experience of handling cash before (I was a loan shark before), I could feel that it was 2 stacks of $50 inside the envelope.`
In my view, the trial judge was here perfectly entitled to draw on his own common and normal human experience in reaching his own conclusions as to what was contained inside the envelope given all the other surrounding and undisputed circumstances. Whether or not the envelope contained money was clearly not a matter for which special skill or knowledge is required for its ascertainment. As such, this was not a case in which expert evidence was required in order for the court to form an opinion. As for the exact amount contained in the envelope, or the denomination of the notes therein, this was, as previously explained, no longer relevant once the charge was amended to one where the gratification was stated simply as being `an unspecified sum of money`. It was thus unnecessary for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the exact amount of money contained in the envelope and counsel`s submissions in this regard were plainly misconceived.
 The appellant`s testimony
Moving on to the appellant`s defence, it will be seen that the testimony given by the appellant was simply riddled with too many loopholes and ludicrous explanations to retain any measure of credibility whatsoever. First, it was clear that the appellant was not a truthful witness. He sought to downplay his relationship with Chua by first saying that they never had pre-arranged meetings and that the only times they met were when they happened to bump into each other at a coffeeshop in Lorong 30, Geylang. Later, however, he effectively retracted from this position but only when quizzed and prompted by the DPP specifically on whether he had run into Chua at KTV Lounges on two separate occasions and, again, at Sakura which, as it turned out, was in fact a pre-arranged meeting between the two men. The attempt by the appellant to conceal the true depth of his relationship with Chua thus lent a highly suspicious complexion to his testimony that he and Chua were merely casual acquaintances. Next, he admitted to having made a status enquiry into Lim Chin Boon on behalf of Chua. It was not disputed that neither the appellant nor the division he was in at that time was concerned in the investigations into Lim`s matter. Being a person of rank and seniority in the Force, one would have expected the appellant, an inspector at the time, to know better than to open himself to the risk of improper conduct by undertaking the enquiry when he could simply have directed Chua to the Secret Societies Branch to make the enquiry himself. The fact that the appellant did not bother to ask a single question of Chua to find out why he wanted the information, or how the latter was related to Lim showed that he was somehow beholden to the man and had no hesitation whatsoever in doing his bidding. The deeper than surface relationship between the men could also be gleaned from the fact that the appellant had taken the trouble to go down to Sakura immediately to meet him at his behest to discuss CTC`s troubles with the law. If indeed he and Chua were but just casual acquaintances, one would expect that any problems concerning CTC could simply have been discussed over the telephone instead. It is telling from the appellant`s enthusiasm in rushing to meet Chua at a location specified by the latter that they could hardly be casual acquaintances only. A further loophole came from the fact that, while the appellant clearly admitted to meeting Chua to discuss the legal processes concerning CTC, he claimed that he only knew that CTC was arrested after he saw Tan`s statement to that effect in P4 during the course of the trial. I found this to be strangely puzzling to say the least, since if he did not know that CTC had been arrested, then exactly what sort of legal processes concerning him did the appellant and Chua speak about when they met at Sakura way back in December 1998?
But perhaps the most revealing aspect of the appellant`s testimony was his absurd explanation of how he came to be in possession of Tan`s blue Sunpage pager. It will be recalled that he disagreed with Tan`s statement in P4 to the effect that Tan had loaned him the pager in order that Chua`s pages to him which had hitherto been made to the appellant`s own existing pager would not be traced. He claimed instead that Tan had bought the pager for one of his workers who had suddenly gone missing. As a result, Tan requested the appellant to keep custody of the pager temporarily while Tan sought to locate the missing worker. Tan himself did not wish to carry the pager on him as in the appellant`s own words, he often wore `tight pants or jeans`. Indeed I found the appellant`s account to be a likely story which was absolutely incapable of belief. If it was true that Tan had bought the pager for a worker whom he could not subsequently locate, he could simply have left it at home till he found his worker rather than carry it around in his `tight pants or jeans`, especially if he found this uncomfortable as the appellant appeared to be suggesting by his reply. His explanation that he found it 
 prestigious 
to be carrying two pagers was similarly incredible, the gadget being such a common and easily obtainable item these days. In any event, it was difficult to see why that any normal person would require to be contactable through two pagers plus a handphone, when one pager more than sufficiently serves that purpose, and in this case especially when the appellant had obviously got along fine with using just one pager previously. Next, I also saw no reason why Tan would gratuitously let the appellant use the pager, the subscriptions for which Tan continued to foot from late 1998 till the time of the trial in September 2000, if it was not for some other more imperative purpose, especially when Tan was someone whom the appellant would meet with only when he was together with Kelvin and William. In my view, the above circumstances, taken in toto, showed unreservedly that the appellant`s explanation of how he came to be in possession of the pager was but a pathetic and feeble attempt on his part to disassociate himself with Chua and Tan. In any case, his version was not put to Tan in cross-examination and as such, remained but an uncorroborated bare assertion on his part.
Finally, it was pertinent that the appellant could not proffer any convincing reason why Tan might wish to frame him in his statements to the CPIB save for the baseless speculation that Tan was assaulted or threatened by the recording officers who took those statements. The appellant was clearly not present during the recording sessions with Tan, and in any event, Tan`s evidence of being threatened during his interviews was completely demolished by the contrary testimony of the recording officers which was in my view rightly believed by the trial judge.
 The prosecution`s failure to call Lim Hock Gee and Chua Tiong Tiong
With respect to the attack on the prosecution`s failure to call Lim Hock Gee and Chua, it suffices for me to say but a brief word on this. With regard to Lim Hock Gee, there was no evidence to show that his evidence, if called, would have affected the outcome of the case in any way. All that Tan had stated in P4 was that he saw Lim Hock Gee outside the M3-KTV Lounge on the night when he passed the envelope of money to the appellant. Nowhere was it mentioned that Lim Hock Gee even saw, noticed or spoke to Tan, let alone witnessed the handing over of the envelope. As such, no adverse inference could be drawn against the prosecution for their failure to call him as a witness. As for Chua, I accepted the defence`s submission that the mere fact that a person is medically certified as being unfit to attend court is hardly a good reason not to put him on the stand since the party wishing to call him could well have applied for an adjournment or otherwise taken a deposition from the witness outside of court. Nevertheless, I found that the failure to call Chua was not fatal to the prosecution`s case as there was ample evidence in Tan`s CPIB statements to show that he was a runner for Chua, and that the latter had asked him to pass the envelope of moneys to the appellant. Further, the appellant himself never denied that he was acquainted with Chua, and even had drinks with him and his party of friends at KTV lounges before. As such, it did not appear that Chua`s evidence, had it been called, would have added anything to the evidence which was already before the court.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In the light of the foregoing, I found that the appellant had clearly not succeeded in casting a reasonable doubt on the prosecution`s case. His only defence was really nothing more than a bare denial of having received the envelope of moneys. He did not offer any alibi as to his whereabouts on the evening in question, nor give any other evidence to that end. In the face of the compelling evidence against him as contained in Tan`s CPIB statements, the appellant had plainly not discharged his evidential burden of proof. While I am conscious that in the earlier reported cases involving Chua Tiong Tiong, such as 
Hassan bin Ahmad v PP
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 791
  and 
Fong Ser Joo William v PP
 
 
[2000] 4 SLR 77
 , the fact of the receipt of moneys was admitted to unreservedly by the respective appellants, thus distinguishing those cases from the present. I also had no doubt that this fact, though disputed by the appellant in this case, was nevertheless satisfactorily proven by the prosecution beyond all reasonable doubt. I thus saw no reason to disturb the trial judge`s finding of guilt and dismissed the appeal accordingly.
 Sentence 
 
 
 
The appellant was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment by the district judge. Although there was no appeal by the DPP on this, I took it upon myself to review the sentence as I found it to be manifestly inadequate on the facts. Firstly, the offence in question is one which by its nature is extremely difficult to detect, especially when the gratification received is in the form of cash since there is then almost always no or little material or documentary evidence of the crime. In this case for instance, a large part of the evidence for the prosecution, save for Tan`s testimony which itself was entirely discredited, was circumstantial, rendering it extremely difficult to obtain a conviction. Then there is also the added problem of the givers of the gratification, who if they have not already escaped or disappeared from the face of the earth before the law catches up with them, are naturally unwilling to co-operate with the authorities, making the prosecution`s job even more difficult. All these factors strongly support the policy that a commensurate sentence must be meted out in order to deter would-be offenders from accepting that first bribe, for, human nature being such that a man`s greed can only get the better of him, it then becomes progressively more difficult for him to stop accepting moneys in future. Most pertinently, however, is the fact that the appellant in this case was not merely an ordinary civilian, but an inspector in the police force who, being a public servant, should be held to higher standards in the discharge of his duties than the ordinary man in the street. It is important that the courts dish out a sentence that will deter similarly-placed individuals from acting in disregard of the fundamental tenet of their calling, which is to uphold the law with utmost standards of honesty and integrity. The appellant had here clearly fallen short of those standards, and I had no doubt that a more severe punishment was warranted to emphasise the courts` as well as society`s disapproval and abhorrence of his actions, which not only had the effect of bringing the public service of which he was an integral part into disrepute, but also gravely injures the impartial workings of our criminal justice system. To lightly condone the offence in the present case would no doubt undermine the efficacy of our public service as a whole, not only diminishing the public`s trust in the country`s law-enforcement agencies but also setting back the government`s efforts at establishing Singapore in the international community as a safe and corruption-free city state. Finally, I would add the point that police officers like the appellant, by virtue of their office alone are extremely susceptible to becoming recipients of monetary inducements in return for the disclosure or suppression of relevant information and evidence relating to criminals and their offences leading to serious repercussions which surely do not bear repeating here.
Having regard to the above circumstances, I had no doubt that the sentence of nine months` imprisonment was manifestly inadequate for someone of the appellant`s standing. I thus enhanced the sentence to 18 months` imprisonment instead.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This was an appeal by the appellant against a conviction at the High Court of a capital charge of being in possession of 45 packets of substance containing not less than 24.12g of diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking. We heard the appeal on 2 March 2001 and dismissed it and now give our reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The appellant, female, 36 years old, is a drug addict and was previously an inmate of the Drug Rehabilitation Centre. She is divorced with three children, but the children are in the custody of her ex-husband.
On 22 March 2000, at 4.20pm she was arrested by Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) officers in room 507, Brendma East Park Hotel, Kitchener Road. With her in the room was a male friend, one Lai Gek Siew (`Lai`), 41 years old, unemployed, who is also a drug addict. Both had been staying at the hotel from 14 March 2000 until their arrest. The staff of the hotel told the court that they would only allow a Singaporean to register for a room if he or she produced his/her identity card. The room was registered in the name of Lai because the appellant did not have her identity card, having lost it more than a year ago.
Heroin in packets was found in the room. Three straws of heroin were on a chair. Three packets wrapped in newsprint and four straws were in a drawer of a dressing table. A black drawstring bag, with a total of 45 packets of heroin, was found hidden in the false ceiling above the bathroom. The drawstring bag was not sealed or locked. Inside the black drawstring bag were three plastic bags: a red, a blue and a black. In the red plastic bag were 20 packets of substance. In the blue plastic bag were two newsprint wrappings, each containing five packets of substance. In the black plastic bag there were three newsprint wrappers, each containing five packets of substance. The charge preferred against the appellant related only to the drugs found in the drawstring bag. The 45 packets had a net weight of 24.12g of diamorphine.
At the time, scissors, pincers (tweezers), paper foil, some 109 empty plastic sachets, a digital weighing scale and lighters were also found in the room. Evidence was adduced which showed that the appellant had purchased a digital weighing scale a few days before her arrest. The receipt for the purchase was found in her wallet. But no heroin stains were found on the weighing scale.
In the appellant`s statement recorded on 23 March 2000, under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), she said: 
 
I did not intend to sell the drugs. A male Malaysian asked me to keep the drugs for him. My friend Lai Gek Siew has nothing to do with the drugs.
 
 
 
In her second statement recorded on 29 March 2000, she admitted to the ownership of the drugs, stating that the 45 packets found in the black drawstring bag were given to her by one Hak Chai for safe-keeping and in return Hak Chai would forgo the $1,000 debt she owed him. In her third statement recorded on 5 April 2000, she gave an account of her dealings with Hak Chai. She also exonerated Lai from any knowledge of the drawstring bag. In her words, `I did not tell (Lai) about the black bag.`
However, there is an aspect of the evidnece which should be mentioned at this juncture. A fingerprint expert, ASP Lay Yeow Khoon, told the court that Lai`s fingerprints were found on the magazine paper used to wrap some of the drugs. Lai explained that he had been reading some of the magazines taken from the hotel front desk. The pages came from the 11-17 March 2000 issue of Singapore This Week, a tourist promotional magazine freely distributed at the hotel reception. The appellant did not make any comment regarding this aspect of Lai`s evidence. Lai also said that the heroin in the room belonged to the appellant, except as regards those in the drawstring bag found in the false ceiling, which he did not know existed. Neither did he know how the drawstring bag happened to be there. Lai was eventually not charged for drug-trafficking though he was arrested together with the appellant. Instead, he testified for the prosecution.
In the light of the foregoing evidence, the trial judge called upon the appellant to enter her defence. The appellant`s evidence was that on 12 March 2000, she received five packets of heroin from Hak Chai, a drug peddler, who had taken over from a previous peddler, `Ah Tee`. Those five packets of heroin were for her own consumption. They cost $1,000 and were not paid for. In return for waiving the debt, Hak Chai wanted the appellant to safe-keep something for him. So on 19 March 2000, Hak Chai asked the appellant to go to a rubbish bin near the Toa Payoh Post Office to pick up a plastic bag. She collected the plastic bag at around 8pm and returned to the hotel. She then called Hak Chai and was asked by the latter to help him keep it. She was informed that its contents were of a value of $9,000. He also informed the appellant that he would call her again later with regard to the return of the drawstring bag.
On opening the plastic bag, the appellant saw a black drawstring bag and a paper wrapper. Inside the paper wrapper, there were three packets of heroin. She took the three packets as they were meant for her personal consumption. She did not open the drawstring bag. She then hid the drawstring bag, with the substance therein, above the false ceiling of the bathroom. She did not touch it again. The next time she saw the drawstring bag was on the day of her arrest, when the CNB officers retrieved it from the false ceiling.
The appellant admitted that the three straws of heroin found on the chair and the three packets and four straws of heroin found in the drawer were hers, but they were for her own consumption. She also stated that it was Hak Chai who had asked her to buy the digital weighing scale and the empty plastic sachets, although she did not know what purposes they were meant for.
It would be noted that the only inconsistency in her oral evidence, compared with the statements she gave earlier, was her denial of being the owner of the heroin, or that she suspected the black drawstring bag contained heroin. She admitted that Hak Chai had placed three packets of heroin in the plastic bag (together with the black drawstring bag), for her personal consumption. The trial judge drew the obvious inference that the 45 packets of heroin found in the black drawstring bag were not meant for the appellant`s own consumption but was for trafficking. He also held that the appellant would be guilty of trafficking even if the drug in the drawstring bag were meant to be returned to Hak Chai later.
 Motion to adduce additional evidence 
 
 
 
Before we proceed to examine the grounds raised by the appellant at the appeal, we ought to refer to a motion filed by the appellant to adduce additional evidence for this court`s consideration of the appeal.
In her affidavit filed in support of the motion, the appellant alleged that it was Lai who had bought the digital weighing scale and had also brought the black drawstring bag into the hotel room, without telling her about them. Furthermore, at the time the CNB officers raided the room, Lai had asked her to shoulder the blame and responsibility for the drugs found in the room. He repeated this request on two occasions later. She said that she did as was told by Lai because Lai had assured her that she would only serve a short sentence of between eight to ten years and he had also promised her that he would marry her after her imprisonment and would, while she was serving her imprisonment, look after her mother. As she loved him very much, she agreed to the suggestion. Furthermore, when she accepted blame, on behalf of Lai, she did not know that the black drawstring bag contained drugs. The appellant claimed that, for all these reasons, she concocted a story that she had collected the black drawstring bag from Hak Chai.
The appellant thus wanted to adduce the following additional evidence. First, that Lai asked her to purchase the digital weighing scale. Secondly, that on 21 March 2000, Lai told her that a friend had left the black drawstring bag with him and told her not to ask so many questions about it. Lai then took the black drawstring bag to the bathroom and returned to the room without it. It was Lai who placed it above the false ceiling. Thirdly, Lai had, on several occasions, asked her to shoulder the blame for the drugs. She agreed to do so, because she loved him and thought that her own family (her three children) did not care for her.
Explaining why she decided to tell the true version of the events at this eleventh hour, she said that after the conviction at the High Court, her three children had visited her and showed much love and concern for her. She was moved. On the other hand, Lai had not kept his promise to take care of her mother. She realised she should live for the children and not die for Lai.
It is clear that this court, on hearing an appeal, has the power to admit additional evidence. This is provided for in s 55 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Ed) (`SCJA`), which reads as follows: 
 
 
(1) In dealing with any appeal, the Court of Appeal may, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by the trial court. 
 
(2) When such additional evidence is taken by the trial court, it shall certify such evidence, with a statement of its opinion on the case considered with regard to the additional evidence, to the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal shall thereupon proceed to dispose of the appeal. 
 
(3) The parties to the appeal shall be present when such additional evidence is taken. 
 
(4) In dealing with any appeal, the Court of Appeal may also, if it thinks fit, call for and receive from the trial court a report of any matter connected with the trial.
  
 
 
The conditions to be fulfilled before the court exercises the power to admit additional evidence were enunciated by Lord Denning in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 3 All ER 745
. In that case, the court laid down three conditions and they relate to non-availability of the fresh evidence, the relevance of the new evidence and the credibility of that evidence. This test involving the application of the three conditions was adopted and applied by this court in numerous cases, eg 
Rajendra Prasad v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 1
  and 
Van Damme Johannes v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 246
 .
On the facts, there could not be any question that the first condition of non-availability was not satisfied. Counsel for the appellant, Ms Goh, had to concede as much. All the additional evidence sought to be adduced was available at the time of the trial and could have been adduced had the appellant been so minded to do. The appellant was also represented by Ms Goh at the trial.
On the second condition, despite Mr Reddy`s submission to the contrary, we thought that the additional evidence was clearly relevant. But, in our opinion, what the additional evidence which the appellant sought to adduce failed to satisfy related to the third condition on credibility.
The appellant said in her affidavit that on the day the CNB officers came into the hotel room, Lai, who was standing behind her, asked her to shoulder the blame for the drugs. If Lai had whispered anything to the appellant, the CNB officers would have noticed. What was more incredible was the assertion that she agreed to assume blame, expecting, as he told her, that it would only be a matter of imprisonment of some eight to ten years. But surely when the charge and consequent punishment were read and explained to her before the trial, the appellant would have known the serious nature of the charge. Ms Goh was already her counsel. She could not have failed to appreciate that the charge she faced carried the death penalty, and yet she went through the trial asserting that Lai had nothing to do with the drugs.
We would hasten to add that we recognised that the primary consideration of s 55(1) of the SCJA, in allowing fresh evidence, is the interest of justice. But it does not follow that each time a convicted accused changes his mind, justice would require that he be given an opportunity to adduce further evidence. The court has to assess each situation as it arises. In this regard, we had borne in mind what Lord Taylor CJ said in 
Ahluwalia
 
[1992] 4 All ER 889
: 
 
Ordinarily, of course, any available defences should be advanced at trial ... It cannot be too strongly emphasised that this court would require much persuasion to allow such a defence to be raised for the first time here if the option had been exercised at the trial not to pursue it. Otherwise, as must be clear, defendants might be encouraged to run one defence at trial in the belief that if it fails, this court would allow a different defence to be raised and give the defendant, in effect, two opportunities to run different defences. Nothing could be further from the truth.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
We emphasise that the circumstances we have described and which have led us to this conclusion are wholly exceptional.
 
 
 
In 
R v Stafford
 
[1968] 3 All ER 752
, Edmund Davies LJ also sounded a similar note of caution of the possible mischief if the court should regularly receive fresh evidence when there was no adequate explanation for the failure to adduce it at trial: 
 
public mischief would ensue and legal process could become indefinitely prolonged were it the case that evidence produced at any time will generally be admitted by this court when verdicts are being reviewed.
 
 
 
While recognising the overriding consideration of justice, Yong Pung How CJ in 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  at 347G put the whole matter in perspective as follows: 
 
It is true that there are situations where the court would allow additional evidence to be called even though it could not be strictly said that the evidence was not available at the time of the trial, if it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. The core principle in s 257 of the CPC [pari materia with s 55(1) of the SCJA] after all, is that additional evidence may be taken if it is necessary, which must mean necessary in the interests of justice. That said, it must be emphasised in no uncertain terms that such a situation will arise only in the most extraordinary circumstances.
 
 
 
Reverting to the present case, we did not see any extraordinary circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretion in admitting the additional evidence. The appellant ran a line of defence at the trial. That was rejected. Now at the appeal stage she took a defence which was completely at variance with the defence taken at the trial. There was nothing to suggest that what she now sought to say at this late stage was likely to be more credible than what she said at the trial. Furthermore, even if we believed what she alleged in the motion to be true, that the drugs were, in fact, brought back by Lai, and belonged to Lai, the evidence (including her evidence that she bought the weighing scale on behalf of Lai) suggested quite clearly that she was very much involved in Lai`s drug activities. She was not an innocent bystander. She abetted in what he did.
 The question of possession 
 
 
 
The main contention of the appellant at the trial was that she did not know there were drugs in the drawstring bag. Contrary to the statements she gave, she denied having admitted that she was the owner of the drugs in that bag.
Before us, counsel for the appellant submitted that the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had possession of the drawstring bag and its contents. It was pointed out that whenever the appellant was out of the room, the room key would be left with Lai or the hotel reception counter. The appellant and Lai seldom went out of the hotel room together. There were occasions when the appellant went out, and Lai was still in the room, and she would leave the room key with Lai. If, however, at the time, Lai had already gone out, the appellant would leave the room key with the hotel reception. On her return, when she approached the hotel reception counter for the room key, the receptionist would give the key to her without asking for identification. Furthermore, when she was out of the room, she would not know if Lai had brought anyone else into the room. The thrust of all these contentions was to show that between 19 March and 22 March 2000, the contents of the drawstring bag could have been tampered with by a third party.
Another argument of the appellant was that she did not know what was in the drawstring bag or that they were drugs. She did not check the contents of the bag as she had no reason to and had no permission from Hak Chai to do so.
 Our determination 
 
 
 
The evidence did not bear out the assertion of the appellant that the drawstring bag placed above the bathroom ceiling could have been tampered with by a third party. There was no evidence that Lai had allowed any third party to enter the hotel room. Lai was not even asked about this when he was in the witness box. Neither could the appellant say that there were any occasion on which Lai had brought anyone to the room. In this connection, we must point out that according to the appellant, Lai had no knowledge of the drawstring bag. Neither was there any evidence that a stranger could have entered the hotel room using the room key because the hotel reception counter staff did not ask for identification before handing over the room key. The defence did not cross-examine the hotel management staff along this line. It could very well be that the reception counter staff recognised who the appellant was and thus did not ask for identification before handing the room key over to her.
This entire assertion was highly speculative and conjectural. The fact of the matter was that the drawstring bag was hidden by the appellant above the false ceiling of the bathroom. It was not within view. Her intention was obviously to prevent anyone from seeing it or discovering it by chance.
The appellant admitted getting the drawstring bag from Hak Chai, her drug peddler. The understanding was that she would safe-keep the drawstring bag and its contents for Hak Chai and in return Hak Chai would not demand the payment of the $1,000 debt, which the appellant owed Hak Chai in respect of a previous supply of heroin. In her cautioned statement recorded on 23 March 2000, she admitted that Lai, though occupying the same room with her, had nothing to do with the drug. She repeated that in a later statement. Therefore, there was ample evidence for the trial judge to have concluded that the appellant had physical possession of the drawstring bag and the contents therein.
Finally, we would refer briefly to the point that the appellant did not have exclusive access to the room. However, that fact does not necessarily suggest that she could not have possession of the drugs: see 
Fun Seong Cheng v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 523
  and 
Chia Song Heng v PP
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 705
 . It would depend on the circumstances of the case. Here, the appellant said she placed the drawstring bag with its contents above the false ceiling of the bathroom. According to her, Lai did not know about the bag. Lai also told the court that he did not know of the existence of the bag until the CNB officers discovered it. There was no evidence that anyone had tampered with the bag or was likely to have tampered with the bag.
 The appellant`s knowledge of the drug 
 
 
 
It is settled law that to prove possession, apart from mere physical possession, knowledge is required: see eg 
Low Kok Wai v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 676
 , 
Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 253
  and 
Lim Beng Soon v PP
 
 
[2000] 4 SLR 589
 .
In the statement recorded on 5 April 2000, the appellant said that although she did not ask Hak Chai about the contents in the drawstring bag, she suspected the stuff inside to be heroin. She also stated that `a male Malaysian asked me to keep the drugs for him`. Upon her return to the hotel room, she opened the plastic bag and saw a black drawstring bag and a newspaper wrapping containing three packets of heroin which were for her own consumption.
By its very nature, in a case of this kind, knowledge is a matter that has to be inferred in the light of all the circumstances. In our judgment, the appellant knew that there were illegal drugs in the bag. First, Hak Chai was a drug peddler and had previously supplied drugs to her. Second, the very secretive and suspicious manner in which Hak Chai chose to pass the drawstring bag to the appellant (leaving it at a public dustbin). Third, there were three packets of heroin in the plastic bag which were meant for the appellant. Fourth, the appellant was told that the stuff in the bag were of a value of $9,000. Fifth, for the favour of safe-keeping the drawstring bag (and the stuff therein), Hak Chai would write off the debt of $1,000 which the appellant owed him. Sixth, she hid the drawstring bag, with its contents, above the false ceiling of the bathroom. All these pointed irresistibly to the fact that the appellant knew the nature of the stuff in the drawstring bag. This was further confirmed by what she said in her statements. It was not just an instance of wilful blindness. She was fully aware of the contents. Thus, we entirely agreed with the trial judge that possession of the drugs by the appellant had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption laid down in s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Ed) (`MDA`) that she was in possession of the drugs for the purposes of trafficking was accordingly triggered.
 Future return to owners 
 
 
 
There is one last point we need to mention in passing. According to the appellant, she was to keep the drawstring bag (with the contents) for Hak Chai, and that Hak Chai would later contact her to tell her how to dispose of the drugs. The fact that the appellant was holding the drugs as a safe-keeper and would be passing them on (either back to Hak Chai or to a third person indicated by Hak Chai) would not render the possession any less that it was for the purpose of trafficking: see 
Sze Siew Luan v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 522
 , 
PP v Goh Hock Huat
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 274
  and 
Lee Yuan Kwang v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 349
 . It must be borne in mind that `traffic` is defined in the MDA to mean, inter alia, `give`, `transport` or `deliver`. Indeed, the fact that the appellant would be delivering the drugs either back to Hak Chai or to a third person reinforces the point that she was in possession for the purpose of trafficking.
 Judgment 
 
 
 
For the reasons given above, possession by the appellant of at least 24.12g (nett) of diamorphine was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption under s 17 of the MDA was triggered. She failed to discharge on a balance of probabilities the burden of rebutting the presumption raised against her. Thus, the conviction recorded against the appellant was not impugned. In the premises, we dismissed the appeal.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): On 24 September 1996, Teng Eng (`Teng`), whom the appellant, Tan Kok Lam (`Tan`) is next friend to, was knocked down by a motorcycle driven by the respondent, Hong Choon Peng (`Hong`). Teng was then 67 years of age. A CT brain scan showed a `left frontal brain contusion with fronto-tempero-parietal acute subdural haematoma`. A craniectomy and evacuation of the acute subdural haematoma were undertaken at the Singapore General Hospital.
The evidence showed that Teng was not able to respond to visual and verbal stimulation. She could respond to pain, but was not aware of it. Her life expectancy was reduced and while she might live beyond five years she will not live up to 10 years. The assistant registrar found Teng to be in a `persistent vegetative state`.
Interlocutory judgment was entered in the High Court against Hong for 50% of the damages to be assessed. An assessment was duly carried out by the assistant registrar who awarded Tan, among others, $80,000 for the loss of amenities. The assistant registrar felt that the fact that Teng was and is in a persistent vegetative state did not preclude her from making a substantial award for loss of amenities, as opposed to an award for pain and suffering.
Hong appealed against that award to the High Court and the trial judge, being of the view that unconsciousness should preclude the award of a substantial amount for loss of amenities, reduced the amount under this head to $21,000. He stated that: 
 
I think loss of amenities as a head of damages means loss of the capacity to enjoy the amenities of life. The injured person has been deprived of the means of enjoying life to the full that he would be able to but for the injury or deprivation. With respect, I agree with Lord Devlin in 
 H West & Son Ltd & Anor v Shephard
 that in assessing damages under this head both the objective and the subjective elements must be considered and that deprivation should be measured mainly by the sense of loss. Where as in this case the injured person is unaware of the loss and is spared the frustration, distress and suffering resulting from an awareness of the loss damages should only be moderate and conventional.
 
 
 
Having heard the appeal on 19 February 2001, we disagreed with the approach taken by the trial judge and restored the award of $80,000 granted by the assistant registrar. We now give our reasons.
 Issues on appeal 
 
 
 
The present appeal raised primarily a question of law as to whether our courts should adopt the majority decisions in 
Wise v Kaye
 
[1962] 1 QB 638
 and 
H West & Son v Shephard
 
[1964] AC 326
, where it was held that notwithstanding that the victim had remained unconscious as to his surroundings because he had, due to the accident, been reduced to a persistent vegetative state, he is still entitled to claim for substantial damages in relation to loss of amenities. In the alternative, Hong argued that even if West v Shephard were followed in Singapore, $80,000 was high or excessive. But, it was not seriously contended that it was so high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate necessitating the intervention of this court.
 The authorities 
 
 
 
We will begin examination of the question with the leading case, 
 Wise v Kaye 
, where a young woman, aged 20, suffered serious brain injuries from a motor accident. She was hospitalised for 3[half ] years, helpless and unconscious. There was no prospect of recovery and she would never have any knowledge of her condition. Liability in that case was not in question. The trial judge awarded, inter alia, o15,000 as general damages. No claim was made for pain and suffering. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that general damages must be assessed on an objective basis and the fact that the victim was ignorant of the loss suffered was irrelevant and therefore the award of general damages given by the first instance judge at o15,000 was not excessive. Sellers LJ, delivering the main judgment of the majority, said (at p 651): 
 
Unless authority directs, I would be reluctant to apply a standard or basis which required that the happiness of a living person has to be assessed, as it would have to be assessed, to use the common expression, subjectively. I know of no authority which supports this view and have heard no evidence adduced which would in any case permit of its true solution. The head of claim for pain and suffering would come nearer to considerations of happiness - but not, I think, in any deep sense - than would a claim for loss of limbs or faculties.
 
 
 
Sellers LJ distinguished 
Benham v Gambling
 
[1941] AC 157
 on the basis that the latter case was concerned with an action on behalf of a dead child`s estate for the restricted claim for loss of years of life. Sellers LJ refused to treat an injured party as if the latter were dead and to award compensation only for loss of expectation of life and nothing else by way of general damages. He felt that while in common law pain and suffering and loss of amenities are invariably lumped together, they are distinct and separate heads of claim.
The second member of the quorum, Upjohn LJ also reiterated that damages suffered by a living plaintiff were assessed upon entirely different principles from those applicable to a claim for damages on behalf of a deceased person. In respect of a claim for a living person, the fact that she was ignorant of the grave loss was irrelevant because `the injury to her has been done; the damage has been suffered`. In this respect, loss of amenities should be distinguished from pain and suffering. He said (at p 660): 
 
If a plaintiff suffers personal injuries from the wrong-doing of another his cause of action accrues though he may be ignorant of the fact that he has been damaged: 
 Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd
. It is difficult to see why, in general, damages for such injury should be affected by ignorance unless the ignorance prevents the head of damage arising as in the case of pain and suffering.
 
 
 
Upjohn LJ also relied upon an earlier Australian case 
McGrath Trailer Equipment v Smith
 
[1956] VLR 738
 to come to the conclusion he did. In 
 McGrath Trailer 
, the plaintiff became childlike because of severe brain injury. Herring CJ rejected the subjective test advanced by the defendant and stated (at p 741): 
 
The matter has to be treated objectively - what has the plaintiff lost as a result of his injuries, how great is the diminution of his capacity to enjoy life? ... The measure of his loss is not affected by the fact that he does not now by reason of his injuries realise what he has lost and does not miss his inability to live a normal life. It matters not that he now seems content with the cabbage-like existence, that his injuries have forced upon him, although, in truth, we have no knowledge if this is so in fact.
 
 
 
The majority of the court in 
 Wise v Kaye 
 (supra) also thought it irrelevant the fact that the plaintiff would not be able to use the compensation awarded.
However, the third member of the court, Diplock LJ, felt that the extent to which a particular plaintiff was likely to be deprived of pleasure or happiness, which but for the disability he would have enjoyed, was a matter to be taken into account. In other words, unconsciousness by the plaintiff of his predicament was a factor which should adversely affect the quantum of damages to be awarded.
The next leading case is 
 West v Shephard 
 (supra), where the plaintiff, aged 41, was knocked down in a motor accident and sustained severe head injuries resulting in cerebral atrophy and paralysis of all four limbs. Her life expectancy was reduced to five years. She might, to some extent at least, have appreciated the condition which she was in. The trial judge, relying upon the award of o15,000 in 
 Wise v Kaye 
 (supra), awarded general damages at o17,500 as he felt the plaintiff here was worse off than the plaintiff in 
 Wise v Kaye 
 since the plaintiff here must have some knowledge of her own condition. The Court of Appeal, and the House of Lords (by a 3-2 majority), dismissed the appeal. The majority of the House endorsed the views taken by the majority in 
 Wise v Kaye 
.
Four of the Law Lords (Reid, Tucker, Morris and Pearce) in 
 West v Shephard 
 were of the view that the guidance enunciated in 
 Benham v Gambling (supra) 
 applied only to the assessment of damages for loss of expectation of life, and that it did not extend to any other class of cases. Three of the Law Lords (Tucker, Morris and Pearce) felt that unconsciousness did not eliminate the actuality of the deprivation of amenities of life. But all the members of the House thought that the court was not concerned to consider the use which would thereafter be made of the money awarded.
We shall now look at the approach taken by some of the Law Lords on the issue of unconsciousness vis-.-vis loss of amenities. We shall start with the minority judgment of Lord Reid, where he said (at p 341): 
 
If a man`s injuries make him wholly unconscious so that he suffers none of these daily frustrations or inconveniences, he ought to get less than the man who is every day acutely conscious of what he suffers and what he has lost. I do not say that he should get nothing. This is not a question that can be decided logically. I think that there are two elements, what he has lost and what he must feel about it, and of the two I think the latter is generally the more important to the injured man. To my mind there is something unreal in saying that a man who knows and feels nothing should get the same as a man who has to live with and put up with his disabilities, merely because they have sustained comparable physical injuries. It is no more possible to compensate an unconscious man than it is to compensate a dead man.
 
 
 
Lord Devlin, the other member of the minority, thought that the approach taken in 
 Benham v Gambling 
 (supra) was correct and that that approach was applicable even in a case, such as that in West v Shephard, where death did not intervene. While there are two elements in considering the question of loss of amenities in such a case, the objective and the subjective elements, he felt that as between the two, the objective element should be `very moderately assessed`. He said (at p 362): 
 
If it were not that the objective element has already by the authorities been given a place in the assessment, I should question whether it ought to be there at all. I think that deprivation should be measured mainly, if not wholly, by the sense of loss. I cannot help feeling that the contrary view is coloured by the thought that a wrongdoer should be made to pay damages commensurate with the gravity of the physical injury he has inflicted rather than with the suffering he has caused.
 
 
 
The views of the majority Law Lords were otherwise. Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest put the question of the relevance of unconsciousness in these terms (at p 349): 
 
An unconscious person will be spared pain and suffering and will not experience the mental anguish which may result from knowledge of what has in life been lost or from knowledge that life has been shortened. The fact of unconsciousness is therefore relevant in respect of and will eliminate those heads or elements of damage which can only exist by being felt or thought or experienced. The fact of unconsciousness does not, however, eliminate the actuality of the deprivations of the ordinary experiences and amenities of life which may be the inevitable result of some physical injury.
 
 
 
Lord Pearce emphasised that the ruling in 
 Benham v Gambling (supra) 
 should be viewed in its proper context when he said (at p 366): 
 
In 
 Benham v Gambling
 this House was called on to answer a particular problem that had recently caused grave difficulty in the courts. It had little direct connection with the daily cases concerned with injuries that disable the living body. The problem simply stated was `Is life a boon`? And, if so, what is `the money value of all that which we lose by death?`
 
 
 
Lord Pearce then proceeded to reiterate that the traditional method of assessing injuries should continue: 
 
The loss of happiness of the individual plaintiffs is not, in my opinion, a practicable or correct guide to reasonable compensation in cases of personal injury to a living plaintiff. A man of fortitude is not made less happy because he loses a limb. It may alter the scope of his activities and force him to see his happiness in other directions. The cripple by the fireside reading or talking with friends may achieve happiness as great as that which, but for the accident, he would have achieved playing golf in the fresh air of the links (p 368).
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
I venture to think that an alteration of the current principles of assessing damages for personal injury would be an embarrassment to a practice which in spite of its difficulties does in the main produce a just result. Common law courts should not lightly abandon a method of estimation that works reasonably well and achieves a certain amount of precision, for a method that is nebulous, variable and subjective. I cannot read 
 Benham v Gambling
 as having by implication intended such a result (p 369).
 
 
 
By contrast, in 
Skelton v Collins
 
[1965] 105 CLR 94
, the Australian High Court, by a majority of 4-1, departed from the majority decision in 
 West v Shephard 
 (supra) and ruled in that case that, where the plaintiff`s expectation of life had been reduced and who had been rendered permanently unconscious by the injuries, in assessing damages, regard must be had to the fact that the plaintiff was insensible of his deprivation. It therefore held that, for loss of expectation of life and the loss of amenities of life, only moderate sums should be awarded. Kitto J said he was unable to agree with the majority in 
 West v Shephard 
 (supra) that the guidance enunciated in 
 Benham v Gambling (supra) 
 should only apply to cases involving death. He put it as follows (at p 102): 
 
(
 Benham v Gambling
) treated of life not as a state of being a mere physical phenomenon, but as a thing to be lived and lived consciously. Thus, what was meant by every reference to loss of expectation of life was, in truth, loss of the possibility of conscious experience. The whole burden of the Lord Chancellor`s speech was the legal impropriety of attempting to place any but the most modest figure on a human being`s capacity to experience the varied quality of life; and I cannot bring myself to say that although the law sees the impropriety where a person has died it does not see it where he has lost all capacity for thought and feeling.
 
 
 
Kitto J, in reference to Lord Morris` remark that unconsciousness does not eliminate `the actuality of the deprivations` countered it with this argument (at p 103): 
 
What is here said of the fact of unconsciousness may equally be said of the fact of death; but in relation both to death and to unconsciousness surely it is true that what ought to affect the quantum of damages is not the actuality of the deprivations but their value: what would `the ordinary experiences and amenities of life` (in the future) have added up to, if the plaintiff had not been cut off from them?
 
 
 
Kitto J was unable to distinguish a case where the person was physically dead as opposed to only dead to all experiences.
Another member of the quorum, Taylor J, was also of the same view and while recognising that the expression `loss of amenities of life` was a loose expression, said (at p 113): 
 
... but as a head of damages in personal injury cases it is intended to denote a loss of the capacity of the injured person consciously to enjoy life to the full as, apart from his injury, he might have done.
 
 
 
However, in the dissenting judgment of Menzies J, he basically agreed with the majority decision in 
 Wise v Kaye 
 (supra) and 
 West v Shephard 
 (supra). He said (at pp 124-125): 
 
Loss of capacity - total or partial, permanent or temporary - to live the life that could otherwise have been lived is, apart from damages for pain and suffering, the fundamental loss for which general damages for personal injury are awarded. It is from this loss that other losses stem. Thus, for instance, loss of earnings arises from loss of capacity to work. Moreover, the fullness of a man`s life cannot be measured simply by the happiness which it brings to him; capacity to live fully includes capacity to suffer, to master adversity, to endure as well as to enjoy. Thus, unconsciousness is basic incapacity which ought not to be regarded as insignificant in itself and as depriving other injuries of their significance. Remarkable though it may be, a quadriplegic with a lively mind can live a life which seems worthwhile both to himself and to others, whereas a person whose incapacity includes loss of consciousness seems to me to have lost everything. If, therefore, damages are awarded as such compensation for injury as money can provide and part of the injury which a person suffers is brain injury, it seems to me odd that a disabled man who is conscious but not in pain should be awarded o15,000 while a man additionally injured can recover but o5,000 damages because he has been rendered permanently unconscious. The difference cannot, I think, be satisfactorily explained merely in terms of unhappiness from awareness of injury. From its very nature, however, unconsciousness does negative pain and suffering.
 
 
 
The next significant case that had come before the English courts where this point was again addressed was 
 Lim Poh Choo v Camden 
 & 
Islington Area Health Authority
 
[1980] AC 174
, where a senior psychiatric registrar with the National Health Service, aged 36, suffered severe brain damage following her admission to hospital for a minor operation. In the words of Lord Scarman, who delivered the sole judgment of the House, `she is now the wreck of a human being, suffering from extensive and irremediable brain damage, which has left her only intermittently, and then barely, sentient and totally dependent upon others.` The trial judge described her condition thus: `she is so intellectually impaired that she does not appreciate what has happened to her` - 
[1979] QB 196
 at 201. However, her life expectancy remained substantially unaffected. The trial judge awarded her a sum of o20,000 for pain and suffering and loss of amenities. This sum was upheld and the House reiterated the majority decision in 
 West v Shephard (supra) 
. This was how Lord Scarman put it (at p 188): 
 
I think it would be wrong now to reverse by judicial decision the two rules which were laid down by the majority of the House in 
 H West & Son Ltd v Shephard
, namely: (1) that the fact of unconsciousness does not eliminate the actuality of the deprivation of the ordinary experiences and amenities of life (see the formulation used by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, at p 349); (2) that, if damages are awarded upon a correct basis, it is of no concern to the court to consider any question as to the use that will thereafter be made of the money awarded. The effect of the two cases (
 Wise v Kaye
 being specifically approved in 
 H West & Son Ltd v Shephard
) is two-fold. First, they draw a clear distinction between damages for pain and suffering and damages for loss of amenities. The former depend upon the plaintiffs` personal awareness of pain, her capacity for suffering. But the latter are awarded for the fact of deprivation - a substantial loss, whether the plaintiff is aware of it or not. Secondly, they establish that the award in 
Benham v Gambling
 
[1941] AC 157
 (assessment in fatal cases of damages for loss of expectation of life) is not to be compared with, and has no application to, damages to be awarded to a living plaintiff for loss of amenities.
 
 
 
 
 
 Position in Singapore 
 
 
 
 
 
As far as Singapore is concerned, it would appear that there has not been any case where the court had to consider the element of loss of amenities of life in its own right, distinct and separate from that of pain and suffering; and neither has the court had the occasion to examine the question of whether an unconscious plaintiff is entitled to claim for loss of amenities of life where, in view of his condition, he would not be able to experience pain or the loss. However, in 
Au Yeong Wing Loong v Chew Hai Ban
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 355
 , KS Rajah JC did make this comment (at p 361): 
 
Pain and suffering and loss of amenities are usually quantified together and a single award is usually made without indicating how much is awarded under each head, partly because it is difficult to separate them.
 
 
 
While as a matter of practice the courts in Singapore have often lumped the claim for `pain and suffering` together with that for `loss of amenities` they are not the same and neither is one subsumed under the other. The example given by counsel for Hong is apt: suffering pain from a fracture of a leg is different from the consequential disability (if any), the latter giving rise to the loss of amenities. A fractured leg would not necessarily give rise to a loss of amenities other than for the short period the fracture required to heal: much would depend on whether there is any residual disability. One local case where the two claims were given separate awards was 
Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978)
 
 [1984-1985] SLR 10 
 
[1984] 1 MLJ 325
 . The Privy Council did not make any adverse comment that this was wrong.
 Our decision 
 
 
 
Like the learned judge below, counsel for Hong relied upon the dicta of Lord Devlin in West v Shephard (cited in [para ]16 above) to argue that as Teng, because of her unconsciousness, could no longer appreciate any loss, the sum awarded should be moderate. Further, arguing from the fact that just as no damages are allowed for pain and suffering which is not felt, similarly no damages should be allowed for loss of amenities which is also not felt. The principle for awarding damages is to give the injured party reparation for the wrong done. Accordingly, the learned judge below preferred the minority view in 
 West v Shephard 
 (supra) and the majority view in 
 Skelton v Collins (supra) 
.
However, on our part, we felt otherwise. In our view, the majority view of the court in 
 West v Shephard 
 (supra) is more in line with the ends of justice, which is to compensate the plaintiff for the injuries he has sustained, as well as pecuniary losses which he has suffered or is likely to suffer.
We recognise and accept that for a claim for pain and suffering, unconsciousness on the part of the victim would negative that claim and thus render an award in respect of that claim inappropriate. A claim for pain necessarily suggests that the victim has consciousness, otherwise there is no question of him enduring any pain for which he should be compensated. However, the same cannot be said for loss of amenities. Whether or not there is loss of amenities is an objective fact. It cannot and should not depend on an appreciation of the loss by the victim. Perhaps the point can be better illustrated by a simple example, where in an accident the victim not only loses a leg, he also loses his mental faculty. Are we to say that because the victim cannot appreciate his present condition, no substantive award should be made even for the loss of the leg? We should think not. Has he not lost the ability to move about freely, even with the help of an artificial limb? And if a substantive award should be made for the loss of the leg, why should it be otherwise for the complete loss of the mental faculty? While it might be thought that we are treading on dangerous ground to make comparisons between injuries, we think there is no greater injury or loss, as far as a living person is concerned, than to be turned into a cabbage.
It seems to us that the dissenting judgments in 
 Wise v Kaye (supra) 
 and 
 West v Shephard 
 (supra) were greatly affected by the approach taken by the House of Lords in 
 Benham v Gambling (supra) 
 where it was held that for loss of expectation of life, only a small sum should be given. In those dissenting judgments, the judges equated a person who is permanently unconscious with one who is dead, and thus that person has effectively lost no more than the expectation of life. It is clear that 
 Benham v Gambling 
 was decided in the way it was to arrest the trend then of juries making large awards for the loss of expectation of life as a separate head of damage: see (1954) 70 LQR 179. The decision in that case should not be extended by analogy to cases where there is no death.
In our view, what Lord Devlin referred to as feelings of frustration and anguish for the loss should appropriately be considered to fall under the head of pain and suffering. One can suffer on account of pain from a physical injury. But that is not the only way in which suffering could come about. Feelings of frustration and anguish are as much sufferings, although the cause or source of those feelings may be different from that of physical pain. There is no logic to confine suffering to only physical pain.
The authors of 
 Winfield & Jolowicz on Tort 
 (14th Ed) state at p 607 that `pain and suffering includes the suffering attributable to the injury itself and to any consequential medical treatment, and worry about the effects of the injury upon the plaintiff`s way of life and prospects.`
In this regard, we think the caution uttered by Lord Pearson in 
 West v Shephard 
 (supra) is germane, namely, that it would `be lamentable if the trial of a personal injury claim puts a premium on protestations of misery and if a long face was the only safe passport to a large award.`
 Judgment 
 
 
 
In the result, we preferred the approach taken by the majority in 
 Wise v Kaye 
 (supra) and 
 West v Shephard 
 (supra) and held that notwithstanding unconsciousness, a person, who as a result of another`s negligence suffers from brain damage leading to unconsciousness, is entitled to substantial damages. Accordingly, we restored the quantum of damages awarded by the assistant registrar to Tan.

s 377 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellant, Adam bin Darsin, before the High Court, pleaded guilty to eight charges for committing the offence of carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). Fifteen other similar charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He was sentenced to ten years` imprisonment on each of the eight charges, and four of the eight terms of imprisonment were ordered to run consecutively and the remaining four terms to run concurrently with the four consecutive terms of imprisonment. This resulted in an aggregate term of imprisonment of 40 years. The appellant appealed against the sentence. We allowed the appeal and reduced the term of imprisonment for each of the charges to five years, and following the order below we ordered four of the terms of imprisonment to run consecutively and the remaining four to run concurrently with the four consecutive terms of imprisonment. In aggregate, the term of imprisonment was reduced to 20 years. We now give our reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The appellant is 32 years old and worked as a delivery man for Kentucky Fried Chicken. He is a self-professed male homosexual. In January 1997, he befriended one of his victims (`V6`), while the latter was playing street soccer in a street soccer court. In July of the same year, the appellant told V6 that he needed a place to live and asked if he could stay with him. V6`s mother agreed, and the appellant moved into their flat, Block 53 Lorong 5, Toa Payoh [num ]06-06, paying a monthly rent of $150 to $200. Later, in early 1999, the appellant had a quarrel with V6`s brother, and as a result he moved out of the flat to his flat, Block 52 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh [num ]04-20.
Thereafter, V6 became a regular visitor to the appellant`s flat. He spent much of his time there and played computer games on the appellant`s Sony Play Station. On occasion, he would bring food from his mother to the appellant. V6 even had a set of keys to let himself into the flat.
The appellant met his other victims at the street soccer court through V6`s introduction, who referred to him as `uncle`. Normally, after the soccer games, the appellant would invite the boys to his flat to play computer games. In June 2000, the boys gathered in his flat to watch the Euro 2000 football tournament.
It was at his flat, Block 52 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh [num ]04-20, where the offences were committed. The acts of carnal intercourse committed by the appellant were acts of fellatio which he performed on the victims and these took place over a period of 12 months, between July 1999 and June 2000. His victims were boys between the ages 12 and 15 years old. He committed the offence on each occasion when his victim was alone with him, and he forced himself on his victim and performed the act of fellatio. It is unnecessary to narrate each of the offences which he committed and with which he was charged. For our purpose, it is sufficient to set out below the summary of such offences as given by the judge at first instance, which we respectfully adopt: 
 
 
7 The Accused would accost the victims when they were alone in his flat. He would proceed or continue to suck the penis of the respective victims despite their mild protests. In some cases, the victims were too afraid or too shocked to resist. They did not tell anyone about the incidents. On one occasion, he accosted Victim 7 in the kitchen of the flat while some of the other boys were playing the video games elsewhere in the flat. He pulled down Victim 7`s shorts when the latter emerged from the toilet in the kitchen and proceeded to suck his penis, stopping only when the victim shouted ""Jangan"" (or ""Don`t""). Victim 7 returned to join the others without telling them about the incident in the kitchen. 
 
8 In another incident, when Victim 8 was in the Accused`s flat past midnight playing the video games, the Accused sat beside him and talked about his financial woes and work-related problems. Suddenly, the Accused unbuckled Victim 8`s pants and pulled them down to his knees. He then proceeded to perform fellatio on Victim 8 who was too shocked to react and did not struggle but told him to stop. The Accused ignored him and continued with his act until Victim 8 ejaculated. The Accused then swallowed the semen.
  
 
 
On 21 June 2000, one Muhammad Kamal Ariffin bin Osman, the complainant, who is a friend of the victims, confronted the appellant and accused him of having fellated them. An argument between them took place which was followed by a fight. The complainant then went to the home of one of the victims (`V8`) and told the latter`s parents what the appellant had done to him. V8 then admitted that the appellant had indeed fellated him. V8, his parents and the complainant then lodged a police report. On 22 June 2000, the appellant was arrested.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
In the instant case, there were 23 charges against the appellant and the charges were that he committed carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 of the Penal Code. All these acts of carnal intercourse were fellatios which he performed on the eight boys, whose ages ranged between 12 and 15 years old, at various times in his flat. Only eight charges, each involving a different boy, were proceeded with. The appellant pleaded guilty to the eight charges and admitted to the other charges, which were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
The judge, following 
PP v Kwan Kwong Weng
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 697
 , held that fellatio between two male persons is unnatural carnal intercourse within the meaning of s 377 of the Penal Code, and in the instant case consent was irrelevant. In deciding on the sentences the judge bore in mind the decision of this court in 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 801
 . He referred to the guidelines laid down in that case. It was there held that the starting point for unnatural carnal intercourse committed by way of anal intercourse is ten years` imprisonment and the term should then be increased or decreased depending on the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors respectively. For chronic paedophiles, it was said that life imprisonment would be the appropriate sentence. On the facts of the case, the judge concluded that the appellant was not a `chronic paedophile`, and accordingly a sentence of imprisonment for life was not appropriate.
The judge then referred to the very recent case of 
PP v Tan Ah Kit
 (Unreported) , which he decided, and repeated what he said there. He equated the act of fellatio with that of anal intercourse, holding that they are `not really distinguishable when they are the subject of charges preferred under Section 377`. He therefore applied the guidelines in Kelvin Lim (supra) and sentenced the appellant to ten years` imprisonment on each of the eight charges, and ordered four of the eight terms of imprisonment to run consecutively and the remaining four terms to run concurrently with the four consecutive terms of imprisonment. The aggregate term of imprisonment was therefore 40 years.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
We turn first to 
 Kelvin Lim 
 (supra) and the guidelines laid down by this court. In that case, the accused pleaded guilty to and was convicted by the High Court of ten charges: four charges under s 377 of the Penal Code for having carnal intercourse against the order of nature, one charge under s 377 read with s 511 of the Penal Code for attempting to have carnal intercourse against the order of nature, and five charges under s 377A of the Penal Code for committing acts of gross indecency. The acts of unnatural carnal intercourse were acts of anal intercourse committed on the victims, and the acts of gross indecency were acts of fellatio performed on him by the victims. In addition, there were 30 similar charges: ten charges for unnatural carnal intercourse (which were acts of anal intercourse performed on his victims) under s 377 and 20 charges of acts of gross indecency (which were acts of fellatio performed on him by his victims) under s 377A, which were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The victims involved were five young school boys, aged between eight and twelve years at the time of the offences. Further the accused had previous convictions for similar offences. He was sentenced by the High Court to ten years` imprisonment on each of the four charges under s 377 of the Penal Code, five years` imprisonment on the charge under s 377 read with s 511 of the Penal Code, and one year`s imprisonment on each of the five charges under s 377A of the Penal Code. The terms of imprisonment on the four charges under s 377 were ordered to run consecutively and the terms of imprisonment on the remaining six charges were to run concurrently with the terms of imprisonment of the four charges under s 377. He appealed against his sentence and his appeal was dismissed by this court.
That clearly was an extreme case of an `irrepressible paedophile` who repeatedly committed offences of having carnal intercourse against the order of nature and also offences of gross indecency on the five young school boys. Indeed all the acts of gross indecency were acts of carnal intercourse against the order of nature and charges under s 377 of the Penal Code could have been brought against him. This court observed at [para ]2 of the grounds of judgment: 
 
The charges arose out of a series of sexual abuses inflicted by the appellant on five young victims. The appellant was a irrepressible paedophile who had repeatedly committed offences of having carnal intercourse against the order of nature and committed acts of gross indecency on five school-going boys between the ages of 8 and 12 years at the time of the commission of the offence. All the boys attended the same primary school. (We will refer to the victims as V1 to V5). The appellant had accepted all the facts in the statement of facts tendered by the prosecution. The modus operandi of the appellant in the commission of each offence was similar and this was a horrific case of how a paedophile systematically manipulated and abused the trust placed in him by the five naive young boys and then had them subjected to humiliating and unnatural carnal intercourse with him in order to satisfy his perverse sexual instincts.
 
 
 
The court having considered the gravity of the offences said at [para ]23 and 24: 
 
 
23 ... [T]he offence of unnatural carnal intercourse (in the form of anal intercourse) represents the gravest form of sexual abuse. It is unfortunate that no provision has been made for caning for offences under s 377 Penal Code, in contrast to rape offences. Anal intercourse constituted by penetration of the anus contains, by its very act, an element of violence. In England, the offence of buggery of a boy below 16 years and the offence of rape carry the maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Under the UK Sexual Offences Act 1956, as amended by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, a man who has sexual intercourse (anal) with another man without his consent commits rape and is charged accordingly ... In Singapore, the guidelines for sentencing rape offenders are found in 
Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 361
 , where the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the starting point is ten years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. 
 
24 Bearing in mind the gravity of the offence, we started from the position that a paedophile who commits unnatural carnal intercourse (in the form of anal intercourse) against young children below the age of 14 years, without any aggravating or mitigating factors, should be sentenced to ten years` imprisonment. There should not be any difference whether the victim is a young girl or a young boy. The court would then have to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors in increasing or reducing the sentence. Second or repeat offenders who are demonstrated to be a menace to society should be sentenced to a far longer period.
  
 
 
The guidelines laid down in that case apply in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence of carnal intercourse against the order of nature committed by anal intercourse. As observed by the court (at [para ]21), carnal intercourse committed by way of anal intercourse on children, whether young boys or young girls, is a grave offence. It inflicts physical harm or injury on the victim caused by the penetration of the victim`s anus which is exceedingly painful and subject them to severe emotional trauma. By its very nature, such an offence involves some degree of coercion and violence. Additionally, there is the risk of transmitting sexual disease. Furthermore, as the 
 Wolfenden Report 
 (Cmnd 247, 1957), points out, where the victims are very young, it may leave them for life with embarrassing disabilities. In terms of the gravity of the offence, it is equated with rape.
In the instant case, all the charges laid before the court involved acts of fellatio performed by the appellant on his victims. The eight charges the prosecution proceeded with against the appellant involved eight different boys, whose ages ranged from 12 to just over 15 at the time the offences were committed, and all the acts in question involved fellatio performed by the appellant on the boys. An act of fellatio in these circumstances is carnal intercourse against the order of nature falling within s 377 of the Penal Code: 
PP v Kwan Kwong Weng
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 697
  at [para ]25.
There were past cases, where the High Court dealt with offences of unnatural carnal intercourse committed in the form of fellatio involving young children. But the sentences meted out were not quite consistent with each other.
In 
Kanagasuntharam v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 81
 , the accused pleaded guilty to a charge of rape and two charges of carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 of the Penal Code. The first of the two charges under s 377 was for the fellatio, which the accused forced his victim to perform on him, while the second was for the anal intercourse he committed on the victim. The victim was a 17-year-old girl. In respect of the rape charge, the trial judge sentenced the accused to 14 years of imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. As for the two charges under s 377 the accused was sentenced to imprisonment for six years (for the fellatio) and eight years (for the anal intercourse) respectively. The term of imprisonment of 14 years for the rape charge was ordered to run consecutively with the term of imprisonment of eight years, thus making a total of 22 years. The accused appealed, and this court dismissed the appeal.
In 
PP v Sikendar Sellamarican
 (Unreported) , the accused pleaded guilty and was convicted on two charges under s 377 of the Penal Code. The first charge was for having anal intercourse with a 13-year-old boy and the second charge was for fellating the boy. He was sentenced to ten years` imprisonment on each charge and the sentences were ordered to run consecutively. He had a previous conviction for similar offences of unnatural carnal intercourse with young victims.
In 
PP v Norli bin Jasmani
 (Unreported) , the offender claimed trial to the following charges: three charges for committing unnatural carnal intercourse under s 377 of the Penal Code; one charge of attempting to commit rape under s 376(2) read with s 511 of the Penal Code, and one charge of rape under s 376(2) of the Penal Code. The victim was a young girl of 12 years old at the time of the commission of the offence and was the niece of the offender. He was found guilty of the three charges of unnatural carnal intercourse and the charge of rape but was acquitted of the charge of attempting to commit rape. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years for each of the three charges under s 377 and nine years of imprisonment with caning in respect of the rape charge. The sentence for the rape offence and one of the three sentences for the offence under s 377 were ordered to run consecutively, thus making a total of 12 years` imprisonment.
In 
PP v Radhakrishna Gnanasegaran
 (Unreported) , the accused claimed trial to three charges under s 377 for causing and coercing his daughter to perform fellatios on him and four charges of raping his daughter under s 376(2)(b) of the Penal Code. He was found guilty as charged. All the offences were committed over a period of some four years. The victim was 14, 16 and 17 years old at the time of the offences under s 377. The trial judge sentenced the accused to five years` imprisonment on each of the three charges under s 377 and 15 years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on each of the four charges of rape under s 376(2)(b). Two of the imprisonment terms for the rape charges were ordered to run consecutively and the other terms to run concurrently with these two terms. Thus the total term of imprisonment was 30 years.
We now turn to the very recent case of 
PP v Tan Ah Kit
 (Unreported) . In that case, the accused pleaded guilty to three charges for offences of carnal intercourse against the order of nature. Of these offences, two were offences of anal intercourse on a boy, MF who was about 13 years old at the time of the offences, and one was fellatio which he performed on another boy, S who was 14 years old at the time. Four other similar charges and two charges under the Films Act were admitted by the accused and were taken into consideration. Of the four charges, three of them were anal intercourse on MF and the fourth was a charge for fellatio performed on S. The judge at first instance followed the guidelines in 
 Kelvin Lim 
 (supra) and applied the guidelines in determining the sentences for all the three charges. He sentenced the accused to ten years on each of the three charges, and these sentences were ordered to run consecutively, making in aggregate a term of 30 years. The judge said at [para ]23: 
 
 
23 The Court of Appeal`s sentencing guidelines (at paragraph 24 of the judgment) apply to paedophiles performing anal intercourse on young children below 14 years of age. The guidelines apply squarely to the first victim, MF, who was 11 and 12 years old at the material times. Where the second victim S was concerned, he was almost 15 years old at the time of the offences but did not appear to have been materially more mature or intelligent than MF was. Moreover, the unnatural carnal intercourse involved in the two Charges concerning S was fellatio and not anal intercourse. In 
 Kelvin Lim 
, the acts of fellatio were made the subject of Charges under Section 377A and not Section 377 of the Penal Code. Section 377A carries a maximum imprisonment term of only two years and Kelvin Lim received one year imprisonment for each of the five Charges under Section 377A. Whether fellatio is made the subject of a Charge under Section 377 or 377A of the Penal Code is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. As the Court of Appeal there noted (at paragraph 16 of the judgment), since 
PP v Kwan Kwong Weng
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 697
 , it is clear that fellatio is regarded as unnatural carnal intercourse within the meaning of Section 377 save for an exception that has no application here. In my view, fellatio and anal intercourse involving two males are not really distinguishable when they are the subject of Charges preferred under Section 377. Everything said about anal intercourse applies to oral intercourse except for the potential physical injury caused by penetration of the victim`s anus. Further, I do not think any distinction ought to be made on the basis of who is penetrating whom. I am therefore of the opinion that the guidelines set out by the Court of Appeal should apply to the case S in the same way as they patently do in the case of MF.
  
 
 
The accused appealed and his appeal was dismissed by this court in CA 22/2000. It should be noted that in that case, apart from the charge of fellatio which the offender performed on the victim, S, there were two very serious charges of anal intercourse which he performed on the young victim, MF, and in addition to these two charges, there were, inter alia, three other similar charges of anal intercourse committed on MF which were taken into consideration. The accused had inflicted great pain and emotional harm on MF who had to seek psychiatric treatment. The judge made the following comments on the psychiatric assessment of MF: 
 
The report dated 2 June 2000 by Dr Bernadine Woo of the Child Guidance Clinic showed that MF was exhibiting signs of emotional trauma. He was said to be depressed, fearful and irritable. He has also suffered loss of appetite and experienced interrupted sleep. He has been staying out at night and has become withdrawn, refusing to talk to his parents. Although his school grades showed no deterioration, he has been irritable and inattentive since the beginning of the year and has been frequently fighting with schoolmates. Over the past two months before the report, he has been touching the genitalia of three schoolmates and has hit a younger schoolmate who refused to caress him.
 
 
 
Taking all these circumstances into consideration, this court was of the opinion that, although the sentence for the act of fellatio was excessive, the aggregate term of imprisonment of 30 years for the three charges was not excessive, and for that reason the court was not disposed to interfere with the sentences.
The instant case was not one of unnatural carnal intercourse committed by way of anal intercourse. Nor was it a case in which the accused coerced or cajoled a young victim to perform the revolting act of fellatio on him. Both these types of acts of unnatural carnal intercourse were committed by the offender in Kelvin Lim (supra). The present case was one where the accused himself performed the acts of fellatio on his victims. Of the three forms of unnatural carnal intercourse, in terms of gravity of an offence, the form of unnatural carnal intercourse in the present case (ie the accused himself performing the act of fellatio on his victim) undoubtedly stands at the bottom of the scale and the sentence imposed for such an offence should reflect this distinction also. The guidelines laid down in 
 Kelvin Lim 
 (supra) are, with respect, not applicable here, though they were of assistance to us in our deliberation. Lest it be misunderstood, we do not dissent from that decision. On the contrary, we agree with it entirely.
The judge in imposing the terms of imprisonment on the appellant applied the guidelines laid down by this court in 
 Kelvin Lim 
 (supra) principally on the ground that fellatio involving two males and anal intercourse are not really distinguishable, when they are the subject of charges preferred under s 377 of the Penal Code. In his view, everything said about anal intercourse applies to oral intercourse, except the potential physical injury caused by the penetration of the victim`s anus. With respect, we were unable to agree with the judge on this point. It is true that fellatio involving two males and anal intercourse are in each case carnal intercourse against the order of nature and are capable of being made the subject of charges under s 377 of the Penal Code. They are indistinguishable only in the sense that they are both offences falling within s 377. Apart from that, they are plainly distinguishable in terms of the nature and physical aspect of the act involved in the commission of the offence. Looking at the offences from this point of view and also from the victim`s point of view, there is no doubt that between the two, namely: subjecting a young victim to anal intercourse - whether such victim be male or female - and performing an act of fellatio on a young male victim, the former is definitely a far more serious offence than the latter. In the case of the former, a great deal of pain and suffering is caused to the victim, and the court, depending on the circumstances, has equated it to rape. In the case of the latter, the act of fellatio per se does not cause or inflict any pain or physical harm or injury on the young victim.
In our judgment, an appropriate sentence for an offence of unnatural carnal intercourse such as that committed by the appellant in this case would be in the region of five years, subject to any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may be present. In this case, the appellant had no previous conviction of similar offence and no harm or injury had been inflicted on the victims. Nor are there any significant mitigating or aggravating factors.
Lastly, in this case, having regard to the nature of the offences committed by the appellant, we were of the opinion that the total term of imprisonment of 40 years imposed by the court below, was a crushing sentence and not in proportion to the overall gravity of the criminal conduct of the appellant. On this point we echo the following observation of Yong Pung How CJ in 
Maideen Pillai v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 161
  at p 196: 
 
[T]he sentencing court will bear in mind at all times the second limb of the totality principle, that is, the need to avoid an aggregate sentence so harsh as to be `crushing` in its effect on the offender. Where consecutive sentences are imposed on an offender, the overall punishment should be in proportion to the overall gravity of his criminal conduct, taking into account the circumstances in which he offended and also the pattern of his previous behaviour.
 
 
 
In the circumstances, we reduced the term of imprisonment to five years for each of the offences and ordered four of them to run consecutively and the remaining four to run concurrently with the four consecutive terms of five years, thus making in aggregate a total term of 20 years.

: The appellant was charged with three counts of harbouring an illegal immigrant during the period between October 1999 and 16 February 2000 pursuant to s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed). At the end of the trial, district judge Valerie Thean convicted him of all three charges and sentenced him to nine months` imprisonment on each charge. Two of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively, making the total length of imprisonment 18 months. He appealed against both his conviction and sentence. At the end of the hearing before me, I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 Background facts 
 
 
 
On 16 February 2000, just slightly after midnight, a police raid was conducted at 725A Havelock Road (`the Premises`). A total of 21 Bangladeshi nationals were found on the Premises, with 18 of them subsequently ascertained to be immigration offenders.
The appellant and his wife were found to be the registered proprietors of the Premises, which was part of a shophouse that also comprised the units 725 and 725B Havelock Road, which were similarly owned by the appellant and his wife.
At the material time, 725 Havelock Road, which was located on the ground floor, was rented out to a teochew porridge business known as Henry Teochew Porridge, while 725B was unoccupied.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The mainstay of the prosecution`s case rested on the evidence of the three Bangladeshi nationals who were the respective subjects of the three charges proffered against the appellant. All three were also part of the 18 immigration offenders arrested on the Premises during the police raid.
 ALI (PW6)
Ali testified that he stayed at the Premises from October 1999 right up to the day of the police raid on 16 February 2000. He said that one Majibur, a fellow Bangladeshi national, was in charge of the Premises and had told him that he had to pay a monthly rent of $130 which Majibur would then pay to the owner of the Premises. Ali said that he had seen the owner of the house, whom he identified in court to be the appellant, on three separate occasions. The first occasion was on 5 October 1999 when the appellant and Majibur came to the Premises together at around 9pm. Ali was asked by Majibur to pay the rent as the owner of the house was there. Ali then gave $130 to Majibur who in turn handed the money over to the appellant. He did not however speak to the appellant for Majibur told him that that was unnecessary and that Ali should speak to Majibur if there was anything he needed.
The second occasion was a month later on 5 November 1999, when the appellant and Majibur again came to the Premises together at around 9pm. Ali together with another 15 others who were then watching television on the Premises were asked to pay up the rent, which they did to Majibur who again handed the moneys to the appellant. On this and the first occasion, the appellant remained at the brightly-lit Premises for around ten to 15 minutes and Ali had a good look at him. He was certain that the person in the dock was the same man who had come to the Premises with Majibur.
The third and final occasion was on 5 December 1999 when Ali met Majibur and the appellant at a park situated close to the Premises at around 10pm in the evening. Majibur again asked him to pay up the rent which he did before leaving. He did not know however what Majibur did with the money on this occasion.
 ALAM (PW7)
Alam`s evidence echoed that of Ali`s in most material respects. In particular, he testified that he stayed at the Premises for about three and a half months before his arrest on 16 February 2000. One Majibur, he said, was in charge of the Premises, and Alam paid him a monthly rental of $130. He was quick to point out however that Majibur was not the owner of the Premises.
Alam testified that he saw the owner of the Premises, whom he identified in court to be the appellant, on one occasion. It was around 8 or 9pm in the evening and the appellant had come up to the Premises with Majibur. All the occupants present, which numbered some eight to ten Bangladeshi nationals, were then asked to pay up their rent. Subsequently, Majibur went into one of the rooms and took out some moneys from a drawer which he handed over to the appellant, who left after accepting the cash. When queried about this, Majibur replied that the appellant was the owner and landlord of the Premises who had come to collect the rent.
Like Ali, Alam asserted that the Premises were brightly lit and that he was able to observe the appellant for a good few minutes. He was certain that the man in the dock was the same person who had come to the Premises with Majibur. The appellant did not however ask him anything at any time nor did he speak to anyone else on the Premises.
During cross-examination, Alam explained that he normally paid his rent to Majibur on the fifth or sixth of each month, which rent Majibur said he would then pay over to the owner of the Premises.
 MILON (PW8)
Milon gave evidence that he stayed at the Premises after his arrival in Singapore on 25 December 1999. Majibur had brought him there. Majibur also told him that the monthly rent was $120, which Milon subsequently paid to him.
Milon testified that he had never seen the owner of the Premises. He knew however that Majibur was not the owner but that the latter was only in charge of the Premises and collecting the rent. He had further been told by Majibur that the Premises belonged to a Chinese man to whom Majibur had to pay over the rental moneys.
Under cross-examination, Milon averred that Majibur would normally collect the rents from the Bangladeshi occupants some two or three times before the tenth of each month.
 SIRJIT DASLAL MOHAN DAS (PW14)
The prosecution also called one Sirjit to testify. He was not however one of the 18 immigration offenders found on the Premises during the raid on 16 February 2000.
Sirjit, also a Bangladeshi national, testified that he never stayed at the Premises. During the relevant time, he resided at quarters provided by his company in Clementi. This was corroborated by Lim Kok Hua (PW10), a director of the company which employed Sirjit.
Sirjit gave evidence that he went to the Premises once to visit his uncle but the latter was not in. As he was coming down the stairs, he met two other Bangladeshis. He asked them where the coffeeshop was to which they replied that there was none. They then asked him to accompany them instead and told him that they would bring him to a coffeeshop. He followed them into a car which was parked on a nearby road, and the driver of which was a Chinese man. Sirjit entered the car as the two Bangladeshis told him that they would take him to a coffeeshop. The Chinese man then drove the men to an office building. At the office, he saw several other Bangladeshis. The Chinese man asked for Sirjit`s work permit and assured him that he had nothing to worry about as the man was a Singaporean. In consequence, Sirjit handed over a laminated photocopy of his work permit to the Chinese man, who further instructed him to sign some documents which he did. Sirjit alleged however that he did not know what he was signing and that he merely did as he was told because the Chinese man said that he was Singaporean and a `boss`.
In cross-examination, Sirjit testified that the above events occurred sometime in February 2000. He explained that he agreed to get into the car with three complete strangers because, aside from the driver, the rest of the party were all Bangladeshis, and thus his own people whom he trusted. He also averred that he did not leave or attempt to leave as the driver told him that he would take him to a coffeeshop later. His photocopied work permit was returned to him and he was dropped off at an MRT station after the men left the office building that morning.
 KAREN TAN (PW2)
Another witness called by the prosecution was one Karen Tan (`Karen`), a secretary in the law firm of Lee Bon Leong & Partners (`the firm`). Karen gave evidence that the appellant was a client of the firm. On 3 February 2000, the appellant came to the firm to see Karen`s boss, Mr Lee Bon Leong. After the meeting, Mr Lee instructed Karen to prepare a tenancy agreement in respect of the Premises based on the instructions which the appellant had given him. In particular, the tenancy agreement was to state that it was made between the appellant as landlord, and six Bangladeshis whose names were written on a piece of paper which Mr Lee had handed to Karen as the tenants. According to the appellant`s instruction, the agreement should further state that the tenancy was to commence on 1 February 2000.
On 8 February 2000, the appellant came to the firm again, this time together with five Bangladeshi nationals. He instructed Karen to delete one of the names in her prepared draft of the tenancy agreement, and to replace three of them, making the total number of tenants now five instead of six as was the case under his previous instruction. Karen then obtained the photocopied work permits of the three Bangladeshi nationals whose names were used as replacements in the tenancy agreement and made copies of them before returning them to the men. Thereafter the appellant and the five Bangladeshi nationals signed the tenancy agreement. The appellant`s wife, the co-owner of the Premises came down around two days later to sign the document as well. The tenancy agreement (`P5`) was eventually dated 18 February 2000 as stamp duty was only cleared on that day.
At the end of the prosecution`s case, the court found that a prima facie case had been made out and, after administering the standard allocution, the appellant was called upon to enter on his defence. The appellant elected to give evidence.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The appellant`s defence, in essence, was a complete denial of any knowledge of Ali, Alam and Milon being on the Premises.
The appellant was a 51-year-old businessman dealing in the wholesale seafood business. He purchased 725, 725A and 725B Havelock Road in September 1998. At the time of the purchase, Unit 725 was occupied by Henry Teochew Porridge. After the purchase, Henry Teochew Porridge negotiated a fresh tenancy with the appellant commencing from 1 December 1998 and ending on 30 November 2000. This agreement was prepared by Lee Bon Leong & Partners. Unit 725B meanwhile was vacant at all material times.
With regard to Unit 725A, ie the Premises, the appellant testified that one Saidur Rahman (`Rahman`) had lived there originally and that the appellant had seen him on the Premises when he went to inspect it before purchasing it. After the purchase, Rahman approached him and told him that he wanted to rent the Premises at the same rate of $1,800 which he had been paying previously. He agreed. A tenancy agreement was subsequently drawn up by the appellant`s wife and son in respect of the tenancy to Rahman (`the Rahman tenancy`) and was based on the tenancy agreement between Henry Teochew Porridge and the previous owner with slight modifications. Rahman also gave the appellant his original work permit and other documents which the latter photocopied and returned to him. These photocopies which were admitted into evidence showed a work permit which bore the name `Saidur Rahman` and had an expiration date of 3 November 1999.
The appellant alleged further that Rahman always paid his rent to him directly in cash. He himself would visit the Premises about once or twice a month during the period of Rahman`s tenancy. He either collected the rent at the Premises itself or at a nearby coffeestall or park. He denied seeing Rahman collect rent from anyone else on the Premises. He did however get to know one Abdul Mazid (`Mazid`) through Rahman, whom he said was Rahman`s friend who was sometimes at the Premises when he went there to collect rent.
A few days before the expiry of Rahman`s tenancy, Rahman called the appellant to tell him that he did not wish to extend and asked him to come and collect the keys. On 30 November 2000, he went to the Premises and collected the keys as previously arranged. He noticed while he was there that the Premises were comparatively dirty but denied seeing anyone else there.
The appellant did not change the locks to the Premises after Rahman left. As he would rent out the property again soon, he figured that he would change the locks only when the new tenant moved in. He put up a notice downstairs advertising the Premises for let.
The appellant claimed that he never visited the Premises after 30 November 1999 all the way up to February 2000. While he did come by to pick up a cheque from Henry Teochew Porridge every month, he averred that he merely drove up and parked in front of the shophouse or a little distance away on each visit, and the proprietor of the porridge business would walk over and hand him the cheque. He thus never had occasion to step out of his car or walk into or around the Premises.
Sometime in the middle of January 2000, Mazid telephoned the appellant and subsequently met him for tea. On that occasion, Mazid told the appellant that he wanted to rent the Premises and asked for the rent to be reduced to $1,600. The appellant agreed but told him that formal documentation drawn up by a law firm had to be obtained. Mazid agreed. Subsequently, the appellant obtained from Mazid a work permit and other documents bearing Mazid`s name and photograph, took copies of them, and handed the copies to Lee Bon Leong & Partners. It later surfaced that Mazid intended to include co-tenants for the Premises. He thus gave the appellant several pieces of paper on which were written six names including his own and told the appellant that these were the other men who would be co-renting the Premises. When he got home, the appellant`s wife copied the names onto one piece of paper, and several days later, the appellant handed the paper containing the names to Mr Lee at his law firm. He told Mr Lee that he wanted to rent the Premises to the six Bangladeshi nationals listed on the piece of paper. In response, Mr Lee told the appellant to check and verify the particulars of the men and informed his secretary Karen to draw up the necessary agreement. Karen told the appellant to return with the men to sign the lease once it was ready.
Subsequently at the end of January 2000, Mazid arranged to meet the appellant again at a block of flats near the Premises. There, he handed $3,200 to the appellant, being one month`s rent and one month`s deposit. He also asked for the keys to the Premises as he wanted to carry out some minor renovations to it. The appellant agreed, but told him that while he could carry out the renovations, he could not yet live on the Premises.
The next time the appellant met Mazid was on 14 February 2000. He picked up Mazid and several others from Havelock Road and drove them to Mr Lee`s office. Mazid told him at this time that there would now only be five tenants including himself instead of six as before. He also changed several of the names previously supplied. At the office, the appellant claimed that all the men produced their original work permits when asked by Karen. Karen further read out the tenancy agreement to them and asked if they understood. The men nodded and subsequently signed the agreement, followed by the appellant who did the same.
The appellant disagreed with Ali`s evidence that he was at the Premises on 5 November, December 1999 and January 2000. He produced relevant extracts from his passport which showed that he was out of town on those dates. On 5 November 1999, he was in China for a fisheries exhibition. On 5 December 1999, he went to Batam by boat in the afternoon and only returned the next day, while on 5 January 2000, he went to Johor for the day and would have been too tired to visit the Premises when he returned in the evening.
In cross-examination, the appellant explained that the Rahman tenancy was not prepared by a lawyer as Rahman was already a former tenant of the Premises and, as such, he believed that the previous owner would have checked his details. As such, a simple agreement was sufficient. He further claimed that Rahman`s work permit was cancelled on 5 September 2000 and that he had been repatriated to Bangladesh by the time of the trial. As for the rental moneys, it was always paid in cash and the appellant never banked the moneys into his bank account as it was a `thousand odd dollars only`. He also denied knowing Majibur.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The district judge held that two things had to be shown before the appellant could be found guilty of the offence of harbouring under s 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Act. First, it had to be shown that the appellant harboured the men named in each of the charges against him, and second, that he had reasonable grounds for believing that they were immigration offenders.
Upon analysing the evidence before her, the district judge concluded that the above two elements had both been made out by the prosecution beyond all reasonable doubt, and convicted the appellant accordingly.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The provisions in the Immigration Act which are relevant to this appeal provide as follows: 
 
 
57(1) Any person who - 
 
(d) harbours any person who has acted in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the regulations;

The term `harbour` in s 57(1)(d) is in turn defined in s 2 of the Act as meaning:

Before me, senior counsel for the appellant made no quarrel of the way in which the district judge had framed the issues in this case. His only argument was that the district judge had erred in her finding that the appellant had, as a matter of fact, harboured the three men. In support of his contention, senior counsel raised two main points. First, he stressed tirelessly on the prosecution`s failure to call Majibur as a witness, which failure he urged warranted the drawing of an adverse inference against the prosecution for their omission. Next, he contended that the identification evidence of the prosecution witnesses was weak, and should not thus have been relied on by the district judge. These two points taken together were, in counsel`s view, sufficient to create reasonable doubt in the prosecution`s case.
I shall consider each of these points in turn.
 ADVERSE PRESUMPTION UNDER S 116 ILLUSTRATION (G) EVIDENCE ACT (CAP 97, 1997 ED)
Senior counsel for the appellant placed great emphasis on the district judge`s failure to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution for its failure to call Majibur as a witness, especially, he said, in light of the fact that there was no suggestion that the latter was unavailable as a witness. Counsel further pointed out that this case was distinguishable from several recent decisions involving similar factual scenarios. In particular, he drew my attention to the cases of 
Awtar Singh s/o Margar Singh v PP
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 439
  and 
PP v Ong Phee Hoon James
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 293
 . In the former, counsel asserted that the fact of harbouring by the agent or middleman had been conceded by the defence, and as such, the only issue in that case was the question whether or not the accused had abetted the agent. In the latter, it was explained that the agent had been repatriated and as such the prosecution could not be faulted for not calling him. None of these factors however were present in the case at hand.
In my view, counsel`s argument in the above regard can be dealt with briefly. It is not every failure by the prosecution to call a material witness that warrants the drawing of an adverse inference against them under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act. While I accepted that Majibur`s evidence, if called, would have been relevant and even helpful, the absence of it did not in my view have the effect of demolishing the prosecution`s case completely. There was uncontroverted evidence by Ali and Alam, which was believed by the trial judge, that they had seen the appellant on the Premises with Majibur. In addition, they also personally witnessed Majibur handing moneys to the appellant after collecting the rent from the occupants. Since criminal liability is not in any event grounded on the finding of an agency relationship between the appellant and Majibur and the crucial factor here is the appellant`s knowledge of the presence of the illegal immigrants, I was of the view that Ali and Alam`s evidence was on their own more than sufficient to sustain such a finding of knowledge on the appellant`s part.
In any event, it is well-established that an adverse inference would be drawn against the prosecution under s 116 illustration (g) only if it withheld certain evidence which it possessed and not merely on account of its failure to obtain certain evidence: see 
Yeo Choon Huat v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 217
 . In 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
 , I held that the prosecution has no obligation to call any particular witness, unless the failure to do so could be shown to be motivated by an intention to hinder or hamper the defence. I reiterated this point again in the subsequent case of 
Roy S Selvarajah v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 517
  in which it was said that, in the absence of an ulterior motive, there is no reason to draw adverse inferences against the prosecution for its failure to call witnesses. There was clearly no suggestion of any such ulterior motive on the prosecution`s part in this case. Nor was it alleged by senior counsel that the prosecution was deliberately attempting to hamper the defence by not calling Majibur. If anything, it appeared to me from a perusal of the Record of Proceedings that the prosecution was clearly not in possession of any particulars relating to Majibur as all the prosecution witnesses testified that he did not live on the Premises, that they had no means of contacting him, and he had not in any case been found on the Premises during the police raid. There was thus nothing to show that the prosecution had intentionally withheld evidence from the appellant or the court, especially when it had from the start set out categorically the role that Majibur played in the case against the appellant. As such, I found that the trial judge was right in refusing to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution in this case.
In any case, it would not be surprising if Majibur, himself being clearly concerned in the whole scheme of harbouring, would have indeed given evidence unfavourable to the prosecution to protect himself if he had in fact been available and was called by the prosecution. In these circumstances, it would not be proper to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution for their failure to call a witness whom they knew would, for self-serving reasons, in all probability turn hostile on the stand.
 IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE
Senior counsel next attacked the failure by the police to conduct an identification parade for the prosecution witnesses. He argued that the dock identification of the appellant by the witnesses in court more than seven months after they were arrested and more than eight since they last saw him was unreliable and should not have been relied upon by the district judge.
This point was adequately dealt with in the case of 
 Awtar Singh s/o Margar Singh 
 (supra) wherein I had said at [para ]35: 
 
Whether it is necessary to conduct an identification parade depends on the circumstances of each case. Obviously, it would not be necessary when the accused person is arrested while committing the offence ... However, if the accused person is not known to the eyewitness, it may be prudent for the police to conduct an identification parade not only to ensure that the witness`s memory regarding the identity of the accused person is tested but also to ensure that the investigation is proceeding on the right track and that the person arrested is the real culprit.
 
 
 
On the facts of the present case, it was clear that the appellant was not a complete stranger to Ali and Alam even if he had not been formally introduced to them nor they to him. What was important was that he had been seen on the brightly-lit Premises on more than one occasion, where he had remained for at least ten to 15 minutes on each visit, which by any objective standard is not an inconsiderable length of time. In the circumstances, the men were afforded ample opportunity to observe him which they did. As such, the failure to conduct an identification parade in this case did not diminish the probative value of the identification evidence given by Ali and Alam.
I was not persuaded that the present case was distinguishable from 
 Awtar Singh 
 (supra) simply because the number of witnesses identifying the accused was less here than it was in 
 Awtar Singh 
. In that case, there were seven witnesses who positively identified the accused, and he had been seen by some of them at least two or three times a week, and on some occasions for as long as up to two hours. In my view, the determination of the reliability of identification evidence cannot be dependent solely on the number of witnesses making the identification for a single person is in many circumstances as capable as a dozen others of identifying a suspect accurately. The key is not the quantity of the evidence, but rather its quality that is relevant. If I were to accept senior counsel`s argument, then it would logically mean that a person could never be convicted on identification evidence alone if there was only one witness to the offence, which surely cannot be the case. In my opinion, a holistic approach has to be adopted in order to ascertain the reliability of the evidence which has in turn to be assessed in the context of all the surrounding circumstances. To this end, the guidelines laid down in 
R v Turnbull
 
[1977] QB 224
 and followed in 
Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 465
  are instructive. The non-exhaustive list of factors which the court would consider in determining the reliability of the identification evidence include the length of time that the witness observed the accused, the distance at which the observation was made, the presence of obstructions in the way of the observation, the number of times the witness saw the accused, the frequency with which the witness saw the accused, the presence of any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused, the length of time which had elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police and the presence of material discrepancies between the description of the accused as given by the witness and the actual appearance of the accused. Having perused through the Record of Proceedings, I felt no hesitation in concluding that the identification evidence of Ali and Alam was cogent and indefeasible. I thus saw no reason to doubt their reliability.
 THE OTHER EVIDENCE OF ALI AND ALAM
I move on next to consider the several other sub-arguments put forth by senior counsel. He contended that the district judge could not, on the one hand, accept the thrust of the evidence given by Ali and Alam that they had seen the appellant with Majibur on the Premises, and yet on the other hand disregard the inconsistency that the other evidence given by them raised vis-.-vis the objective facts before the court. In particular, counsel pointed out that while Ali had categorically asserted that he had seen the appellant at the Premises on 5 November, December 1999 and January 2000, the appellant was nevertheless able to provide undisputed documentary proof in the form of extracts from his passport which showed that he was out of town on those dates to contradict Ali`s testimony. In the light of this objective evidence, counsel argued that there was no basis for the district judge to find that Ali was a forthright witness or that his evidence was consistent and withstood cross-examination.
In my view, there was nothing to prevent the district judge from reaching the conclusion that she did. This was not a case where she was completely unaware of or oblivious to the inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses` evidence. On the contrary, she was acutely aware of the contradictions, but having weighed them against the totality of the evidence, she found, as she was entitled to do, that the inconsistencies were not so material as to completely demolish the credibility of those witnesses. It is trite law after all that in weighing the evidence of witnesses, the court recognises and accepts that human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is often-time inevitable. It does not mean however the whole of a witness` testimony should be rejected simply because certain parts of it may be technically inaccurate due to a genuine lapse of memory.
In any event, I was of the view in the present case that the discrepancy with respect to the 5 November 1999 sighting can be explained on the ground that Ali was honestly mistaken as to the exact date on which he had seen the appellant at the Premises. It appeared after all that the Bangladeshi nationals encountered some measure of difficulty in ascertaining the days and months according to the Gregorian calendar, their being more comfortable with going purely by the seasons. Hence it was not entirely inconceivable that Ali could have been legitimately mistaken in this respect. In my view, what was more important is the fact that Ali was certain that he had seen the appellant at the Premises with Majibur during the relevant months, and it was not fatal to the prosecution`s case that he was unable to accurately point out the exact date in those months when he saw the appellant. Further, paramount was the fact that the gist of the evidence given by Ali and Alam was clear and consistent. In particular, they were both able to identify and point to a common scheme or routine of things whereby Majibur would collect the rents from the occupants during the early part of each month, and pay it over to the appellant when he came several days later, sometime before the tenth of the month. Whether or not that sometime occurred on or after the fifth, did not in my view render the evidence that the appellant was indeed seen on the Premises less credible or worthy of belief.
In any case I did not think that the appellant`s presence at the Premises on 5 November 1999 was a crucial fact given that both Ali and Alam had seen him on other occasions as well. While the appellant might have left for Bintan on 5 December 1999 and gone to Johor on 5 January 2000, the other two days when Ali alleged to have seen him on the Premises, there was nothing in the passport entries to show what time he had exited the country on those dates. As such, he could well have visited the Premises before or after leaving town. As for Alam, he could not categorically state the relevant date on which he saw the appellant due to his unfamiliarity with the Gregorian calendar but was nevertheless certain that he had seen the appellant on the Premises with Majibur at some point during his stay there. In my view, this was more than sufficient for the purposes of the case against the appellant.
The appellant`s own evidence itself lent some weight to the men`s testimony that they had seen him on the Premises. It will be recalled that he testified that he visited the Premises to collect rent from Rahman, and this practice continued right up till the expiry of Rahman`s tenancy at the end of November 1999. In addition, he also specifically went to the Premises on 30 November 1999 to collect the keys from Rahman and had occasion to walk through it at that time. Ali`s testimony meanwhile was that he had stayed at the Premises since October 1999, while Alam possibly since November 1999. As such, the appellant must have been aware of the presence of at least some Bangladeshi nationals on the Premises when he visited in November 1999. Alternatively, his whole claim of having gone there to collect rent from Rahman was in all probability nothing but pure fabrication on his part. I shall return to this point again later on in my judgment.
Senior counsel next contended that even if the evidence of Ali and Alam was reliable, the fact that they saw Majibur collecting moneys and handing it over to the appellant was not sufficient basis to conclude that Majibur was acting as the appellant`s agent in managing the Premises. It was further suggested that Majibur could well have been the head tenant who was merely paying over his own share of the rent to the appellant.
With respect, I found the above argument to be completely misconceived. In my view, the fact that there is a head tenant between the owner and the sub-tenant does not automatically absolve the owner from criminal liability if the sub-tenants are found to be illegal immigrants. In 
Lim Dee Chew v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 956
 , I said that whether or not an owner can be found liable in such a situation depends on the facts of each particular case and the agreement which the owner had with the head tenant. I clarified and expanded on this in 
 PP v Ong Phee Hoon James 
 (supra) wherein I held that liability is pivoted primarily on the knowledge of the owner. Hence, even accepting the defence`s submission in this case that Majibur was the head tenant while Ali, Alam and Milon merely the sub-tenants, it was plain that the defence, in making this submission, was impliedly accepting that the appellant was present at the Premises when he received the moneys from Majibur. This being the case, he must be taken to have been aware of the presence of the immigration offenders. Having acquiesced in their presence, it did not now lie in his mouth to contend that he had not, even if by his sheer inaction, harboured them. It would be inimical to the policy to curb illegal immigration if house owners were allowed to circumvent the strict requirements of the Immigration Act with impunity by hiding behind the fortuitous shield of protection inadvertently created by a head tenant, especially when the owner is plainly aware of the activities and goings-on in the premises. If this was tolerated, then a mockery would be made of the entire scheme of the immigration legislation as a pervasion of sham sub-tenancy arrangements results.
It was in any event irrelevant whether or not Majibur could be said to have been the appellant`s `agent` in managing the Premises in the strict sense of the word. The touchstone of criminal liability in every case is knowledge. Where it is clear, as was the case here, that the owner had actual knowledge of the presence of the sub-tenants and took no further step to ascertain their status, then he must clearly be taken to have done a positive act of giving shelter to them. One must be realistic in situations such as the present, where it was not merely one or two innocuous-looking sub-tenants whom the appellant saw on the Premises, in which case he might have been excused for failing to inquire further. Here, it was, according to Ali and Alam`s evidence, at least eight to 15 Bangladeshi nationals, whom it must have been obvious to the appellant to be foreigners, who were at the Premises at the times when the appellant visited. Surely any reasonable house owner would have had much cause and reason to question under these circumstances the immigration status of the men, especially in view of the constant and widespread media attention given to the very real and rampant problem of illegal immigrants in Singapore.
Furthermore, it was also not implausible to infer from the circumstances that the appellant clearly had control over the rent. According to the prosecution witnesses, all the men who had not already done so would be asked to pay up their rent whenever the appellant came to the Premises with Majibur. Thereafter, Majibur was seen handing over moneys to the appellant. Next it was also clear that the appellant had not completely relinquished control of the Premises which could be seen in the fact that the Bangladeshi tenants were highly respectful of him, turning off the television and generally stopping whatever they were doing the moment he arrived. In my view the ineluctable inference from all this, albeit circumstantial, evidence was that the appellant obviously had some sort of controlling influence over the occupancy and tenancy of the Premises. The district judge was thus not wrong in drawing the inference that the appellant had harboured the three men.
 HEARSAY
Counsel next referred me to several portions of the prosecution witness` oral testimonies which he contended amounted to hearsay and as such should not have been admitted by the district judge. In relation to Ali, the impugned parts were: 
 
 
 ... Majibur told me how much to pay. He told me I had to pay to him and he would then pay the house owner ... Majibur ... told us to pay up our rent because the house owner was here ... We were then told to switch off the television as the house owner was here.
 
 
 
 
With respect to Alam, the relevant portions read: 
 
 
 ... It was Majibur who told me accused was the landlord ... Majibur told me accused was house owner and that he had come to collect the rent.
 
 
 
 
In my view, save for the statement by Alam `
 It was Majibur who told me accused was the landlord 
`, the rest of the impugned portions were not hearsay. They were obviously not intended to be used by the prosecution to prove the truth of what was said, but merely the fact that they were said. Whether or not the man whom the witnesses saw with Majibur on the Premises and whom they subsequently identified to be the appellant was truly the owner of the Premises was clearly not proved nor was it intended to be proved by the witness` statements. All that the evidence showed, and was intended to show, was that the witnesses had seen a Chinese man with Majibur on the Premises whom they later identified to be the appellant. It was irrelevant what Majibur had told the witnesses about the man since it was undisputed that the appellant, and hence the same man as it turned out, was the registered proprietor of the Premises, and thus the `house owner`.
With regard to the statement `
 It was Majibur who told me accused was the landlord 
`, I was of the view that although technically it amounted to hearsay, it was nevertheless not admitted for the purpose of proving the truth of what was said. More precisely, it could not have been so admitted for that purpose since the question whether or not the man seen on the Premises with Majibur was or was not the landlord was a question of law which could only be determined by the court and not by Majibur, Alam or the appellant. In any event, the issue in this case was whether or not the appellant had harboured the immigration offenders and to this end it was irrelevant, following my recent decision in 
Elizabeth Usha v PP
 (Unreported) , whether or not the appellant was a landlord.
Having said the above, I was of the view in any case that the district judge clearly had not in her grounds of decision relied on any of the impugned portions of the prosecution witness` evidence. Even if she had, I agreed with the DPP that this was a case in which s 169 of the Evidence Act operated to render a reversal of the district judge`s decision unnecessary, since there was more than sufficient other evidence to justify it.
 CREDIBILITY OF THE APPELLANT`S EVIDENCE
The next point raised by senior counsel was the argument that the trial judge`s adverse findings against the credibility of the appellant could not be supported on the evidence.
It is settled law that an appellate court will be slow to overturn findings of fact by the trial judge especially when an assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses has been made. The only instance when such interference is warranted is where the assessment was plainly wrong or against the weight of the objective evidence before the court, or where the assessment was based not so much on observing the demeanour of the witnesses but on inferences drawn from his evidence: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
  and 
PP v Choo Thiam Hock
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 248
 .
 THE RAHMAN TENANCY
Counsel contended that there was an error in cross-referencing with respect to the Rahman tenancy and this error contributed to the district judge`s erroneous assessment of the appellant`s credibility. The district judge had said at [para ]38 of her grounds of decision: 
 
In his evidence, [the appellant] said that his agreement with Rahman was based upon the agreement with the teochew porridge business, hence there was no necessity to ask solicitors to draw up a new agreement. The teochew porridge business agreement was adduced in cross-examination by the prosecution, and was a completely different document from the agreement signed with Rahman.
 
 
 
Senior counsel, on the other hand, pointed out that what the appellant had said was that the Rahman tenancy had been based on the agreement which the teochew porridge business had with 
 the previous owner of the Premises 
, and not the fresh tenancy agreement which his client had entered into with Henry Teochew Porridge after purchasing the property in 1998 as the district judge had thought.
I accepted counsel`s clarification on this point and recognised that the district judge had indeed been mistaken when interpreting the appellant`s evidence in this regard. Nevertheless, serious doubts still remained with respect to the remainder of the appellant`s evidence and I had no doubt that the district judge`s conclusions were influenced as much by these other factors as by the minor cross-referencing slip. First, I found it surprising that the appellant would bother to seek legal advice in preparing the fresh tenancy agreement with Henry Teochew Porridge, and yet not do so in respect of the Rahman tenancy, given that both leases were entered into within a space of less than two months from each other. When queried as to why he did not seek his lawyer`s assistance with regard to the Rahman tenancy, the appellant`s feeble explanation was that Rahman had been a former tenant of the Premises before, and as such, he did not think it was necessary to consult a lawyer. Indeed if this was true, then the same explanation ought to apply vis-.-vis Henry Teochew Porridge who had also been a former tenant of Unit 725. Yet the appellant saw it fit to consult a lawyer vis-.-vis the agreement with Henry Teochew Porridge. Next it was also curious why the Rahman tenancy should have been based on Henry Teochew Porridge`s tenancy agreement with the previous owner, and not Rahman`s own tenancy agreement with the previous owner, if indeed Rahman had been a former tenant as the appellant contended, or on Henry Teochew Porridge`s new tenancy agreement with the appellant which the latter had only lately instructed his lawyers to prepare just before signing with Rahman. It was moreover unhelpful to his cause that the appellant had not produced the alleged tenancy agreement between Henry Teochew Porridge and the previous owner to support his assertion that the Rahman tenancy had been drawn up based on that agreement.
When the above factors are taken into account collectively, it became plain to me that the district judge had more than ample reason to question the authenticity of the Rahman tenancy, and even the existence of Rahman himself. It will be seen that although the appellant had asserted unequivocally that Rahman only ended his tenancy on 30 November 1999, the photocopy of the work permit which bore the name `Saidur Rahman` that he produced expired nearly four weeks before that on 3 November 1999. The explanation by the appellant that Rahman subsequently obtained an extension of another two years appeared to my mind to be an afterthought on the appellant`s part, conjured up by him when he was hard put for a credible explanation following the DPP`s questions to that end. Likewise, the convenient excuse that Rahman could not be called to testify as his alleged extended work permit had been cancelled less than two months before the trial on 5 September 2000 provided much ground for suspecting his true existence. Indeed it would have been so easy for the appellant to have obtained written verification of such information from the Ministry of Manpower but he did not. It was further telling that both Ali and Alam who resided at the Premises before 30 November 1999 were not able to recognise Rahman from the photograph shown to them. As such, I was inclined towards agreeing with the district judge that the Rahman tenancy was most probably a sham document and Rahman a fictitious character wholly invented out of the appellant`s fertile imagination.
 THE APPELLANT`S NEGLECT OF THE PREMISES
Counsel next contended that, in view of the fact that the year-end was the busiest period for the appellant`s wholesale seafood business, there was nothing astounding or incredible about him not devoting much time and effort in managing the Premises during that time. Moreover, the appellant was also a successful businessman whose rental income from the Premises was but a tiny fraction of his annual business turnover and, as such, it was not unusual for him to neglect the Premises completely for two or more months.
In my view, the appellant`s bare assertion of not visiting the Premises at all between December 1999 and February 2000 must be looked at in its larger context. Firstly, he was obviously not too busy to drop by Havelock Road to pick up his cheque from Henry Teochew Porridge during the relevant period. Next, he was certainly free enough to meet up with Mazid for tea to discuss the alleged intended tenancy agreement between them. These alone countered counsel`s suggestion that the appellant was too caught up in running his businesses to bother about his Havelock Rock property. Moreover, with up to as many as thirty persons residing on the Premises at times, it was indeed strange that the appellant never noticed a single person going up or down the stairs leading to the Premises whenever he stopped by to pick up his cheque from Henry Teochew Porridge. It was further unusual that he never on these occasions bothered to check for mail sent to the Premises after Rahman left. Next, the appellant himself admitted that he did actually go up to the Premises on 30 November 1999 to pick up the keys from Rahman and performed a visual examination, albeit a cursory one, of the Premises at that time. It was thus incredible that the appellant could have missed seeing even one of the Bangladeshi nationals then, who on their evidence, had been living there since October. It was further amazing that the appellant would have readily agreed to lease the Premises to Mazid and five other strangers whose names had merely been scribbled on drips and drabs of paper when he barely knew the latter and only saw him around occasionally as a friend of Rahman`s. More incredible was the fact that the four or five men named by Mazid would actually agree to rent premises which they had not previously had a chance to view. Indeed I found it unbelievable that the appellant would not have thought of offering and did not offer to let the men view the Premises, given that it had been more than one and a half months since Rahman left by the time Mazid allegedly approached him and the fact that the appellant himself had noticed that the Premises were rather dirty when Rahman left.
The above circumstances taken in totality showed that it was inconceivable for the appellant not to have visited the Premises at all from the time of the expiry of Rahman`s tenancy to the day of the police raid on 16 February 2000.
 THE TENANCY AGREEMENT WITH MAZID
Counsel also submitted that there was no reason why the appellant should have bothered to execute a formal lease in respect of Mazid and the four others named in P5 if he had hitherto already been harbouring immigration offenders at the Premises.
With respect, I think it was plain that the appellant did precisely what he did in order to `cover his tracks` should the law finally catch up with him. He carefully calculated the risks involved and probably figured, albeit erroneously as it turned out, that his chances of escaping criminal liability would be heightened if he was armed with a legal document in hand. Clearly the whole agreement with Mazid and the four others named in P5 was to my mind a sham as the appellant was content to change the number and names of the tenants at the last minute on the morning of the signing of the agreement itself. Next, while the fact that he had not checked the men`s particulars against their original documents but had instead relied solely on photocopies only might not have been directly relevant to the charges against him since the men named in the charges were not the same men named in P5, it went nevertheless towards showing that the appellant was obviously not interested in the true status of the persons named in P5, which in turn gave rise to the irresistible inference that P5 was not intended to be a genuine document to begin with. Contrary to counsel`s argument, I found that the appellant`s conduct in procuring P5 suggested quite clearly that he knew fully well of the activities that were going on at the Premises. Moreover, it was also amazing that the appellant was not in the least bit hesitant about letting Mazid have the keys to the Premises the moment the latter asked for them in order to carry out renovation works even before the formal commencement of the tenancy. The facts that no further question was asked of Mazid and that the appellant had not bothered to conduct an inventory of the items left on the Premises with his new prospective tenants before allowing them to move in, as any prudent landlord would have done, likewise cast grave doubts on the true nature of P5.
With respect to Sirjit`s evidence, I found that it was not so incredible or bizarre as senior counsel contended to be unworthy or incapable of belief. The fact was that Sirjit was an uneducated blue-collar worker in a foreign land whose main languages of communication were completely incomprehensible to him. As such, when he was asked by two of his fellow countrymen to get into a car driven by a Chinese man, it was not surprising that he obeyed that instruction, seeing that it came from his compatriots. Similarly, it was hardly surprising that Sirjit signed on P5 which he did at Mr Lee`s office as he was merely following suit after his `own people`. Viewing the whole episode realistically, I did not find that his actions were in any way unusual, given the strong sense of natural camaraderie amongst many of these blue-collar foreign workers in Singapore, friendships between whom are often forged fast and easily.
 THE CHARGE AGAINST MILON
Last but not least was the argument that there was no evidence to support the charge against Milon since Milon himself admitted that he never saw the appellant before, whether on the Premises or otherwise.
This point can also be dealt with swiftly. The evidence was clear that the appellant knew of the presence of at least some of the immigration offenders on the Premises. His acquiescence in this as well as his continued indulgence in allowing Majibur to bring more people to reside on the Premises without further question were on their own sufficient to found liability vis-.-vis Milon even if the appellant had never met him nor vice versa. Surely the scope of the appellant`s harbouring could not be confined only to those immigration offenders whom he happened to come across during his visits to the Premises, for liability vis-.-vis each individual `harbouree` cannot legitimately be grounded on such fortuity and arbitrariness.
 Conclusion with respect to appeal against conviction 
 
 
 
It appeared clear to me on the evidence that the appellant had indeed harboured the three men named in the charges against him. There was no reason why Ali and Alam would unfairly incriminate or wrongly accuse him as they had already finished serving their sentences by the time of the trial and did not appear to have stood to gain anything by testifying in the manner which they did. Moreover, it was also not suggested that the men had any axe to grind vis-.-vis the appellant nor was he able to point to one which may have led them to give unfavourable evidence against him. Next, I had no doubt that the appellant, a highly successful businessman despite his meagre qualifications on the academic front, was a shrewd and intelligent person who carefully calculated and weighed the risks involved before devising and engaging in this whole elaborate scheme to earn easy money from letting his property to illegal foreign workers. His purposiveness can be seen in the fact that he always worked through Majibur, and made it a point never to speak with or collect the rent directly from the illegal immigrants, obviously so as to maintain what appeared to him to be a legally acceptable distance from them. The fact that Unit 725B was never let out coupled with the weak economy following the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis probably also goes some way towards showing that the rental market at least for that type of dwelling in that area was somewhat in a slump at the time, leading the appellant to succumb to the temptation of leasing out the property to illegals, the very conduct which the immigration legislation was designed to stamp out.
Upon a review of all the evidence, I agreed with the district judge in her finding and dismissed the appeal against conviction accordingly.
 SENTENCE
The appellant was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each of the three charges, with two of those sentences ordered to run consecutively, making a total of 18 months` imprisonment.
Senior counsel submitted in his skeletal arguments that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. He urged the court to take into account not only the lack of antecedents, but the fact that the appellant was a man of good character and standing, as evidenced by his long-standing involvement in community and grassroots service. In addition, he was also the main driving force behind the family business as a result of which his prolonged absence from the business would directly affect his family.
With respect, I could not agree with senior counsel that the sentence of nine months` imprisonment was manifestly excessive in the circumstances. Firstly, I had held only recently that the benchmark sentence for employing illegal immigrant workers is now one year, double that of the previously assumed tariff of six months: see 
 Tan Soon Meng v PP 
, appeal withdrawn on 27 March 2001 and reported in 
 The Straits Times 
, Wednesday, 28 March 2001. With the surge of illegal immigrant cases over the past year, I saw no reason why a lower benchmark ought to apply where the charge is one of harbouring rather than employing, given that the statutory minimum and maximum sentences for both offences are the same. As such, the sentence of nine months` imprisonment which is below the new tariff sentence could not be said to be manifestly excessive. Next, the argument that an offender`s family members will suffer if the offender is incarcerated for a longer term is one often put forth in vain by defence counsel. The reason, as I explained in 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
  is simply because imprisonment of the sole breadwinner inevitably causes hardship to the family. If the courts were to take such hardship into account in determining the appropriate sentence, then any punishment meted out would not be accurately reflective of the gravity of the offence and circumstance of the offender himself, but tempered with considerations of the extent to which his family would be prejudiced by it. The crux of the matter is that part of the price to pay for committing a crime is the hardship that would unavoidably be caused to the offender`s family. To put it bluntly, the appellant should have thought hard about these consequences before committing the offences in question. It is now too late in the day for him to regret the inescapable hardship which his own foolishness and greed will cause to his wife and children. Finally, the fact that the appellant was actively engaged in grassroots activities showed that he was not just some ignoramus or simpleton who was genuinely unaware of the seriousness of his actions. On the contrary, he was clearly a man of considerable shrewdness, who knew not only how best to profit from his real property investment but was at the same time capable enough of crafting for himself what he must have thought was a sure-fire way to escape criminal liability by supplanting and paying a middleman to facilitate his dealings with the illegal immigrant tenants. In my view, such abominable behaviour should not be lightly condoned by the courts.
In view of the strong policy and legislative reasons behind the harsh sanctions prescribed for harbourers and employers of illegal immigrants, I found that a sentence of nine months` imprisonment on each charge was not manifestly excessive. I dismissed the appeal against sentence accordingly.

: The plaintiff is a single female and runs a translation service business. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the National University of Singapore (`NUS`). At the material time, ie in December 1996, she was 38 years old.
The defendant is a doctor who, at the material time, had more than 20 years` experience as a general medical practitioner. He practised, and still practises, at the Bedok Medical Centre at Block 18 Bedok South Road. After graduating from the University of Singapore with an MBBS in 1969, he served as a medical officer at the Accident and Emergency (`A&E`) Unit of the Singapore General Hospital (`SGH`) for a year. He has been in general practice since 1973. In 1978, he was admitted as a member of the College of General Practitioners, Singapore, and was subsequently conferred a Fellow of the College of Family Practitioners, Singapore. Since 1979, he was a clinical tutor for undergraduate medical students of the NUS. And from 1996, he was a clinical tutor as well as examiner for the Master of Medicine (Family Medicine) degree at the NUS. He is the co-author of a monograph entitled `Medical Records`.
The plaintiff had been consulting the defendant in respect of her general medical problems since February 1992. On three occasions in December 1996, the plaintiff saw the defendant for treatment of an infection which worsened and eventually resulted in the loss of her left eye. The plaintiff claims that the defendant had, in respect of those consultations, failed to exercise due care and skill as a medical practitioner in breach of his contractual duties, alternatively, that he had negligently treated and advised her, and that such breaches had caused her loss.
 Background facts 
 
 
 
On the afternoon of 18 December 1996, the plaintiff consulted the defendant at his clinic. According to the plaintiff, she was running a fever and felt aches and pain in her bones and all over her body. The defendant kept a record of this consultation in his medical record card. It is in the usual doctor`s short-hand and he explained that they meant the following: 
(a) The plaintiff complained that she had a fever, backache and giddiness for the preceding two days. 
(b) On examination, the defendant found that she had a temperature of 100[ordm ]F and blood pressure of 100/70. He found her general condition to be satisfactory. 
(c) The defendant prescribed the following medication: 
(i) Transgesic for fever; 
(ii) Ponstan for body pain/backache; 
(iii) Dramamine for giddiness; and 
(iv) Decodine for running nose. 
(d) The defendant gave her a certificate for two days` sick leave.
The plaintiff went home, took the medicines and rested for the remainder of the day. However, when she got up the following day, 19 December, she felt no improvement in her condition. In addition to the continuing symptoms of aching bones and fever, she had nausea. So she returned to the defendant at his clinic. This session is recorded by the defendant in his medical record card as follows: 
(a) The plaintiff complained she still had fever, backache and giddiness. 
(b) She had developed a cough. 
(c) On examination, she was afebrile, ie had no fever. Her blood pressure was 110/70 and her lungs were clear. 
(d) The defendant prescribed the following medication in replacement of the previous day`s prescription: 
(i) Apo-Naproxen for body pain/backache; 
(ii) Merlislon; and 
(iii) Phenexcept CD for giddiness. 
(e) The defendant gave her a certificate for a further two days` sick leave.
The plaintiff returned home and took the medication as advised. However, at about 8 pm that night, she felt her heart beating very quickly, was breathless and `quivering`. By that last description, I take it that she meant that she was shivering. Knowing that the defendant`s clinic would be closed at that hour, she went to another clinic, the Bedok Family Clinic, where she was seen by Dr Teng Shi Chong. The plaintiff said that she described her symptoms and gave him details of her two prior consultations with the defendant. She also showed Dr Teng the medication prescribed by the defendant. In the clinic`s medical record card, Dr Teng recorded that the plaintiff had complained of fever and running nose. Dr Teng noted that the plaintiff`s temperature was 37[ordm ]C, her general condition was well and her heart and lungs were clear. The plaintiff said that Dr Teng had told her that the medicine prescribed by the defendant was `too strong` and it is recorded in the medical record card that he prescribed Beserol and Clarityne.
Over the next three days, the plaintiff took the medication prescribed by Dr Teng. However, she felt the fever subsiding and returning at intervals. By the morning of 23 December 1996, she had completed the course of medicine but still felt feverish. She decided to return to the defendant`s clinic as he was her regular physician. Although she got there at 11am, it was not until past 2pm that she was able to be seen by the defendant because of the large number of patients.
This is the plaintiff`s account in her affidavit evidence-in-chief of the consultation of 23 December 1996: 
 
 
8 When I saw the Defendant, I told him about my fever, which I said had not subsided. I also informed him of the pain in my right knee joint and that a thin film had formed over the lower portion of my left eye. 
 
9 The Defendant examined me as he had done previously, but this time, he also conducted a urine test on me. After testing the sample I provided, he told me that there was blood in my urine. He mumbled something like he would not give me anything for my eye, and that he did not know what to do about it. The Defendant then mentioned various options that might be open for me to consider: 
 
(a) treatment at the Singapore National Eye Centre (`SNEC`); 
 
(b) consultation with, and treatment by, an eye specialist; or 
 
(c) treatment at the Accident & Emergency Unit of a hospital. 
 
10 The Defendant did not inform me that there was any infection in my body. Neither did he tell me that I needed treatment through any of the above options 
 immediately 
 ie without further delay. Neither did the Defendant inform me that my condition was serious or that I required immediate medical treatment above and beyond the medical treatment that he could provide in his own skill and expertise, at his clinic. 
 
11 Instead, the Defendant simply prescribed me some medication and wrote a note for me to undergo a blood test at a polyclinic after Christmas, ie 25 December 1996. 
 
12 The Defendant`s actions and advice led me to believe that my condition was not serious or life-threatening and only if necessary, I could avail myself of any of the options after the Christmas public holiday without endangering myself. It was because of this that I simply went home and continued to take the Defendant`s medication, looking to see if my symptoms would go away, or whether my condition would persist, or get worse. I recall my distinct impression from what the Defendant said to me, and the manner in which he said it, was that the options were 
 just in case 
 I did not feel better after Christmas. I recall that the note he wrote to the polyclinic simply re-inforced this impression. If the Defendant had really wanted me to seek urgent and immediate medical treatment at a hospital, or with a specialist, or the SNEC, he would have made arrangements for me to see someone, or at least write me a referral note. All he had given me was a note to a polyclinic, to use after Christmas. ...
  
 
 
Her evidence in cross-examination did not materially depart from this version in her evidence-in-chief.
This is the defendant`s account in his affidavit evidence-in-chief of the consultation of 23 December 1996: 
 
 
6 The Plaintiff came to consult me again on 23 December 1996. The Plaintiff complained of fever with chills, giddiness and pain over the right kneecap, as well as blurring of vision and seeing spots in the left eye. This was the first time that the Plaintiff mentioned any complaints about her left eye. 
 
7 On examination, the Plaintiff was afebrile. Her right knee joint was not swollen and her throat was not inflammed. I further examined her pupils and found both pupils to be equal and reactive to light. Both her left and right corneas were clear. There was no evidence of eye infection at the time of examination. 
 
8 I specifically asked the Plaintiff for symptoms of vomitting, diarrhoea and of pain and/or increased frequency of urination. The Plaintiff denied having any of these symptoms. Although she said these symptoms were absent, I proceeded to examine her urine to complete the examination. I observed that there were leucocytes (white blood cells) and blood present in the urine. There was no protein or sugar in the urine. Based on the urine dipstick and the clinical picture so far, my diagnosis was that she had a urinary tract infection. 
 
9 At the end of the consultation on the afternoon of 23 December 1996, I told the Plaintiff that I suspect that she had: 
 
(i) a detached retina, which is a serious eye condition that required urgent specialist treatment, and 
 
(ii) a urinary tract infection that required treatment and follow-up urine tests. 
 
10 I informed her that she required an urgent referral to see an Eye Specialist and that she had to go to the Accident and Emergency (`A&E`) Unit of Singapore General Hospital (`SGH`) where there is an eye specialist on duty after the SNEC closes. 
 
11 At the end of the consultation, it was already past 1600 hours. Therefore, it was not possible to refer her to the SNEC`s specialist outpatient clinic or any private eye specialist clinic on that day as the clinics would probably be closed by the time she reached them. Hence, the earliest appointment could only be the next day on 24 December 1996 and that, in my opinion, would have been inadvisable. 
 
12 As a result, I explained to the Plaintiff that she had no choice but to go to the A&E Unit of SGH immediately. I wrote her a referral letter to bring to the A&E Unit of SGH. I did not keep a copy as it is not my clinic`s practice to keep copies of referral letters. However, annexed hereto and marked as ""YPHH-2"" is a copy of the standard format that I use for my referral letters. In my 27 years as a General Practitioner, I always write a referral letter for all my patients that I refer to: 
 
(a) A&E Unit; 
 
(b) specialists; 
 
(c) Government Polyclinics; and 
 
(d) other doctors who co-jointly manage the patient so the case can be coordinated.
  
 
 
I write 2 to 3 such letters a day. Many of my general practitioner colleagues also do not make it a clinic practice to keep copies of referral letters.
 
 
 
 
13 I further stressed to the Plaintiff that my clinic would be closed after lunch on 24 December 1996 and Christmas Day 25 December 1996. I also informed her that the SNEC specialist outpatient clinic and the private eye specialists` clinics would probably also be closed then. Therefore, in view of the circumstances, I advised her to go to the A&E Unit of SGH or even the A&E Unit of any other hospital instead, without further delay. 
 
14 I also informed the Plaintiff that at the A&E Unit, if admitted, she would have her blood and urine tested. In the event that she was not admitted by the doctor at the A&E Unit, she should proceed to do her blood and urine tests at the Bedok Polyclinic. The laboratory form issued to the Plaintiff was to have the blood and urine done on 26 December 1996 if she was not admitted to hospital so that her response to treatment for the urinary tract infection can be monitored. A copy of the said form is annexed hereto and marked as `YPHH-3`. 
 
... 
 
18 I also recall that when I informed the Plaintiff on 23 December 1996 of the urgent need to go to the A&E Unit of the SGH immediately, the Plaintiff was reluctant to go and had pleaded with me not to refer her. I insisted that she went immediately to the A&E Unit as a detached retina is a serious condition. She got up from her chair and with her gestures, pleaded with me not to send her to hospital. 
 
... 
 
27 In my 27 years of practice as a general practitioner, inevitably whenever I refer any patient to a hospital, the patient, whether educated or uneducated, will always question me for the reason for referral. The Plaintiff is educated. I explained to the Plaintiff that she had a serious eye condition a `detached retina`, and that she needed to go to the A&E Unit of SGH. She was not keen to do so as she had a Christmas Eve lunch function to attend the next day (24 December 1996). It is always a doctor`s duty to explain the reason for the referral and the need for urgency, which I did. I have discharged this duty accordingly.
  
 
 
In cross-examination, the defendant did not materially depart from the version in his evidence-in-chief. In support of his testimony, Grace Ng Lay Hong (`Ng`), his clinical assistant was called to give evidence. She said that she was present in the consultation room that day and stood next to doctor`s table where she was able to hear the conversation between the doctor and patient. In her affidavit evidence-in-chief, she related the following: 
 
 
4 I recalled distinctly the Defendant advising the Plaintiff that he suspected the Plaintiff of having a detached retina, and that this is a serious condition and which will need to be treated. The Defendant further advised the Plaintiff that she should go to the Singapore National Eye Centre or the Accident and Emergency of a hospital to have her left eye attended to. 
 
5 The Defendant also informed that Plaintiff that as it is the festive period, the Plaintiff should try and have her left eye attended to as soon as possible, rather than wait as the eye clinics/specialists will not be available over the festive period.
  
 
 
However, upon cross-examination, Ng revealed that she was unable to recall a lot of the details of that consultation because it had been four years since the events took place. Significantly, Ng did not say in her affidavit that the plaintiff had refused to go immediately to the hospital as the defendant had asserted. When questioned about this, Ng said as follows:
 
 
Q:
 
Do you recall Plaintiff ever mentioning a lunch appointment?
 
 
 
A:
 
Cannot remember.
 
 
 
Court:
 
Can you rule it out?
 
 
 
A:
 
No. I cannot remember.
 
 
 
Q:
 
Did Plaintiff refuse to go to A&E or SNEC?
 
 
 
A:
 
I really cannot remember that.
 
 
 
Q:
 
Would it be unusual for a patient to refuse to go?
 
 
 
A:
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
More significantly, Ng`s evidence in cross-examination was somewhat contradictory to her evidence-in-chief. Although she had stated in para 4 of her affidavit that she recalled distinctly that the defendant had told the plaintiff that he suspected she had a detached retina, her recollection of this exchange seemed to fade on the stand as the following extract from the notes of evidence suggests: 
 
 
Q: Did Defendant ever mention to Plaintiff the words `detached retina` during the consultation? 
 
A: Cannot remember. 
 
Q: What about `retinal detachment`? 
 
A: Cannot remember. 
 
Q: Affidavit paragraph 4. `I recalled distinctly ...` What do you mean by `distinctly`? 
 
A: `Clearly`. 
 
Q: Affidavit paragraph 4. `I recalled ""clearly"" the Defendant advising the Plaintiff that he suspected the Plaintiff of having a detached retina ...` What exactly did Defendant say to inform Plaintiff that he suspected Plaintiff of having a detached retina? 
 
A: Cannot remember what words he used. 
 
Q: You said that Defendant told Plaintiff that this was a serious condition which will need to be treated. What exactly did Defendant say to Plaintiff in respect of this? 
 
A: Cannot remember what exactly he said, but I recall he told Plaintiff that her eye problem needed to be treated by an eye specialist. 
 
Q: Did he use the word `serious`? 
 
A: Cannot remember.
  
 
 
 
 
 Sole disputed fact 
 
 
 
 
 
This then is the sole issue of fact in respect of which the plaintiff and the defendant gave very different versions. The plaintiff said that the defendant did not advise her that her eye condition was serious or that she had to go immediately to the A&E unit of a hospital to seek treatment for it. The plaintiff also said that the defendant did not tell her that he suspected she had a detached retina. On the other hand, the defendant asserted that he did tell her so and that it was a serious eye condition and to go immediately to the A&E unit of SGH. The defendant further said that the plaintiff was not keen to do so as she had a lunch function the following day which was Christmas Eve.
 try to have her left eye attended to as soon as possible, rather than wait as the eye clinics/specialists will not be available over the festive period 
In so far as demeanour of the plaintiff and defendant as witnesses is concerned, I am unable to say that I found anything that would, of itself, lead me to conclude that one or the other was not telling the truth. Generally, they were both co-operative witnesses and answered questions posed to them in a forthright manner. I therefore have to examine these two versions in the context of the surrounding circumstances and the subsequent behaviour of the parties. In respect of the first factor, ie the surrounding circumstances, the relevant considerations are the following: 
(i) The evidence of the clinical assistant, Ng at para 5 of her affidavit was that the defendant told the plaintiff that she should ``. Firstly, this does not sound like unequivocal advice to go immediately as suggested by the defendant in his evidence. Secondly, there is no reason for the defendant to make any mention about the festive period if his advice was for her to go immediately from his clinic for treatment, whether to an A&E unit or to an eye specialist. 
(ii) The defendant himself said (at para 13 of his affidavit) that he mentioned that the following day, his clinic would be closed after lunch and that most eye specialists would also close early on Christmas eve. Again, this does not accord with the notion of urgency. If it were urgent that she sought treatment immediately, there should be no need to consider the availability of treatment options the following day.
In respect of the subsequent behaviour of the parties, firstly on the plaintiff`s part, she did not go anywhere else to seek treatment after she left the defendant`s clinic. It was not until the following day, when her symptoms worsened, that she went to the SGH. If the defendant had told her that detached retina was a serious eye condition and that she had to seek immediate treatment from an eye specialist or the A&E unit of a hospital, why would she have refused to take his advice? Why would an educated person like the plaintiff not understand the defendant`s explanation about the urgency of her situation? Especially when she had been running a fever for seven days and in that period had seen two doctors on four occasions. The defendant`s explanation that this was because she had a lunch appointment the following day requires that the plaintiff be a rather irrational person with a high threshold for pain. However, she did not impress me as an irrational person. Furthermore, the clinical assistant, Ng, could not recall the plaintiff refusing to follow the defendant`s advice to go to a hospital urgently. She said that it would be unusual for a patient to refuse to follow such advice. Therefore, it would follow that if this had happened, it would be likely that she would be able to recall this, especially when she was able to recall `distinctly` that the defendant had advised the plaintiff that he suspected she had a detached retina.
The second point relates to the defendant`s letter of explanation to the Singapore Medical Council (`SMC`) following a complaint lodged by the plaintiff against him. This is the part of his letter concerning the advice to go to hospital: 
 
The possibility of detached retina crossed my mind on the eye symptom. I had in the past diagnosed cases of detached retina based purely on similar symptoms. These cases were sent as urgent referral and were confirmed by my specialist colleagues (opthalmologists).
 
 
 
 
 I informed her that if her symptoms of blurring of vision, seeing more spots persisted or if her sight deteriorated she should go to see an opthalmologist via the Accident and Emergency Unit immediately
. This point was made as the next day was 24th December 1996 - Christmas Eve and our clinic would be closed at noon. The next day would be 25th December 1996 and would clinic would be closed.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
I was concerned of a possible detached retina in her left eye as I am fully aware of the presentation of detached retina and its serious consequences and that it needed an urgent opthalmologist consultation.
 
 
 
I advised her to `visit the SNEC, an eye specialist or the Accident and Emergency Unit of any hospital` if her vision persisted to be blur or if she sees more spots or any impairment of vision. In my medical record card I wrote `cannot exclude Detached Retina. To see Dr PRN` - ie 
 to go to the eye specialist or Accident and Emergency Unit if her sight remained blur or deteriorate
.
 
 
 
In respect of the portions in italics above, the defendant was asked why he had told the SMC that his advice to the plaintiff to go to the eye specialist or the hospital was only conditional upon her sight remaining `blur` or deteriorating. At first he evaded the question somewhat. I then pointed out to him that to a person who was comfortable with the English language, those passages meant that his advice to her to go to the hospital was conditional upon her symptoms of blurred vision or seeing more spots persisting, or her sight deteriorating. The defendant`s response was as follows: 
 
This letter was written to my professional peers at Singapore Medical Council. It is obvious to them that detached retina warrants urgent eye consultation. It is never conditional. I had stressed this to Plaintiff. `You have this problem you must go`. She did not refuse to go. She wanted to go the following day in the afternoon. I told her that in this case, she could not wait. She had to go to Accident & Emergency immediately. In the dialogue with Plaintiff, I told her that I was not able to refer her to SNEC or an eye specialist that day because it was already about 4pm by then. It would have been too late to get an appointment for her. I informed her that we could not wait until the next day. She had to go immediately on 23.12. She still did not want to go. I told her: `You have to go. Your vision is blur, and detached retina had to be excluded. You go if it persists, especially if you see more spots or your vision deteriorates.` This sort of bargaining and dialogue took some time. At the end of the consultation, I followed her out of the room and in the waiting room, I reminded her to go immediately. I wrote in my card, `To see Dr PRN`. It means it is medically indicated that she saw a doctor. She was just reluctant to go immediately. Worse still if it deteriorates.
 
 
 
It should be noted that the defendant`s response does not address the question as to why, if he had unconditionally advised her to go immediately to the hospital, he should write to the SMC in such a manner.
Another point is this. In the plaintiff`s medical record card, the defendant had made the following record: 
 
Cannot exclude detached retina. To see Dr PRN
 
 
 
The defendant exhibited this medical record card in his letter to the SMC along with a very helpful key to the abbreviations used by him in the card. In relation to that particular entry, the key to the abbreviations states as follows: 
 
PRN [equals] when medically indicated, in this case it means when the patient`s vision remains blur or deteriorates to go to hospital Accident and Emergency Unit
 
 
 
It should be noted that on the face of it, this explanation accords wholly with the definition given in Stedman`s Concise Medical & Allied Health Dictionary (3rd Ed) of the Latin term `pro re nata`, for which PRN is the acronym. The term is defined as `as needed, as required`. This is consistent with the prima facie conditional position in his letter to the SMC.
The defendant had said that the letter to the SMC was written to his professional peers to whom it was obvious that detached retina warranted eye surgery and his advice to the plaintiff to go to a hospital immediately could never be conditional. This line of argument is best explained by the evidence of Prof Cheong Pak Yean, an expert called by the defendant. Prof Cheong had written a report to the SMC in support of the defendant`s treatment of the plaintiff. His substantive comments are not too long and it is worthwhile to set them out in full: 
 
I wish to comment as follows.
 
 
 
 
1 A significant difference in the account of the consultation on 23rd December 1996 by Mdm Pai and yours is on the urgency of the eye referral. 
 
Mdm Pai alleged that you `did not inform me that there was infection` but noted that you did counselled referral to Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC), an eye specialist or the Accident and Emergency Unit (A&E) of any hospital. Your clinic records documented the clinical diagnosis as retinal detachment as far as the eye ailment was concerned. That was the basis for your discussion of the referral to specialist`s attention. 
 The course of management you had for the patient was that she should proceed to the A&E if the eye symptoms persisted 
. 
 
The laboratory referral 3 days later was in relation to the fever in the event the patient was not admitted into hospital and clearly was not in relation to the left eye ailment. 
 
I note that your account is based on contemporaneous written records as in the photocopied clinic records. 
 
2 One Professor Stuart L Brown of University of California at San Diego was quoted in the statutory declaration. The source document from Professor Brown is however not provided. 
 
I note that Professor Brown`s opinions were based only on the patient`s recollection and medical records provided by SNEC and do not have the benefit of referring to your medical reports. It would be instructive to study the original statement of opinions by Professor Brown to see whether the quotations were contextual and valid now that you have provided a medical account of the consultation on 23rd December 1996. To be fair to Professor Brown, I believe that he should now be given a copy of your medical reports and asked for further comments. It is also in the course of natural justice to do so. 
 
3 The final diagnosis in this case was Kelbsiella Endoopthamitis, which is a very rare infection in immuno-competent patients. There was paucity of definite eye signs in its early stage. At this stage, it is not easily detected, even by many eye surgeons. In my almost 20 years of practice, I have never diagnosed a case or have referred a patient who subsequently is diagnosed as such. I have checked my library of medical books kept for the post-graduate doctors that I supervised and this condition is never mentioned in any of the books. 
 
 
 
 I note that you had clinically suspected detached retina 
 
, a far more common and plausible explanation of the left eye symptoms at the 23rd December 1996 consultation 
 and instructed the patient to seek urgent attention should it persist 
. This is acceptable medical practice. 
 
I would also like to commend you for your clinical acumen of suspecting a serious underlying problem in the left eye even though the patient only complained of `a thin film in my left eye`. You have further elicited other relevant eye complaints and though there were no definite eye sign, you have correctly advised the patient of the urgency of the matter and the referral avenues.
  
 
 
In my opinion, far from being negligent as the complainant had alleged, the documents provided showed that you have practice with care and diligence and in a high professional standard we expect of doctors in Singapore.
 
 
 
To any reader of this letter it would be clear that there is no suggestion that the defendant had unconditionally advised the plaintiff to go immediately to a hospital. Asked whether the underlined portions above support the plaintiff`s version that the defendant`s advice was conditional, Prof Cheong said that: 
 
... In communication to fellow doctors, it is not necessary to state courses of action which had obviously happened ...
 
 
 
such course of action being the defendant`s advice to go immediately to the hospital. Questioned further on this leap of logic, Prof Cheong said: 
 
This is letter written by a doctor for other doctors to read. All doctors know that detached retina is a medical emergency and would assume that a referral to A&E immediately would have been the first course of action. Not necessary to state the obvious, that the patient, after direction to go to A&E had refused to go because what came after that is [in] my report. `The course of management you had for the patient was that she should proceed to the A&E if the eye symptoms persisted.` In the management of a patient, the doctor takes a certain course of management through time. Each direction in the course of management depends on clinical assessment and feedback. In communication to fellow doctors, it is not necessary to state courses of action which had obviously happened. That would explain the thinking process of a doctor.
 
 
 
Yet Prof Cheong`s letter, set out in the preceding paragraph, clearly states that the defendant`s advice to go to the hospital was conditional. It seemed to me that Prof Cheong had chosen this stance in order to avoid the clear admission in his letter to the SMC, as well as the defendant`s letter, that the advice was conditional, a stance that is totally at odds with the evidence in the documents and with simple logic. In saying that this explains the thinking process of a doctor, Prof Cheong had chosen to hide behind a professional wall that he hoped the court would not penetrate. On my part, I cannot accept the logic suggested. For if this were the manner in which most doctors think, then I am afraid my impression of them would be totally overturned and my confidence in the mental processes of members of the medical profession thoroughly shaken. However, I do not think this to be the case. I do not believe for one moment that this noble profession is populated in the main by people whose thought processes are so fundamentally perverse. That certainly is not my experience in relation to the other doctors who gave evidence before me, nor to the vast majority of those whom I have known or encountered in other situations, whose intellect I have the greatest respect for. I therefore came to the reluctant conclusion that this statement of Prof Cheong could not be true and that he had taken such a clearly untenable position in order to help the defendant out of an awkward situation.
I should add that the defendant`s allegation that the plaintiff had refused to go to the hospital immediately is a very important fact pertaining to his liability to the plaintiff in damages; whatever may have been his position with respect to his professional peers, it is certainly a fact not immediately obvious to laypersons. Yet this fact was not pleaded in the defence. Finally, I note that there is a strange absence of logic in the need for the defendant to emphasise that the SNEC and eye specialists would close early the following day which was Christmas Eve and would be closed on Christmas day. If his concern was for her to go to the hospital immediately, I cannot see the need to mention of those facts.
All the evidence point to the conclusion that the defendant did not advise the plaintiff to go to the hospital immediately and I would hold that the plaintiff`s version as to what happened at the consultation on 23 December 1996 is the truth.
Having made a determination of the sole dispute of fact, I turn to examine the nature of the breaches. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant was liable to her in damages due to his breach of duty or negligence in two respects, pertaining to the consultations on: 
(i) 19 December 1996; and 
(ii) 23 December 1996.
 Consultation on 19 December 1996 
 
 
 
The plaintiff`s case is that given her medical history which was available to the defendant, and in the context of the consultation of 18 December, he should have tested her for urinary tract infection (`UTI`) when she consulted him again on 19 December. If the defendant had done so, he would have found that she had UTI and prescribed the appropriate antibiotic for it. This would have prevented the eye infection. There are two issues that fall to be considered under this head of claim and they are: 
(i) whether the defendant`s failure to test for UTI was negligent; 
(ii) whether, if he had tested for UTI and prescribed an antibiotic, this would have prevented the eye infection.
The plaintiff called ttwo experts, namely Dr Chuang Wei Ping and Prof Rodney Cartwright. Dr Chuang gave evidence as an expert in the field of general practice. He obtained his MBBS from the University of Singapore in 1977 and a Diploma in Laryngology and Otology from the Royal College of Surgeons, England, in 1984. He began his career as a medical officer at Tan Tock Seng Hospital before moving on to a government outpatient clinic. After about two years, he set out on his own to practise as a general practitioner (`GP`) in 1980. In 1981, he left for Britain and worked as a senior house officer in a number of hospitals there, primarily in ENT departments. He moved up to become a registrar in 1985. He returned to Singapore in 1987 and has continuously been in private practice since then. He is the author of a book entitled Forensic Audiology.
Dr Chuang said that even on the first consultation on 18 December, he would have tested the plaintiff for UTI. This was because he noticed from the medical record card that she was an unusual patient. She was prone to UTI. He said that he formed this conclusion from the fact that the defendant had, on previous occasions, prescribed co-trimoxazole which was the preferred antibiotic for UTI and a number of other infections. Also, Mist Potassium Citrate (`MPC`) had also been prescribed on previous occasions, which raised his suspicion that this was for UTI. Further, the defendant had recorded UTI in several places and gave, as an example, the consultation of 24 February 1992, where the word `dysuria` appears. Dr Chuang explained that this meant pain on urination and was a symptom of UTI. MPC was prescribed to flush out the urinary tract. It made the urine more alkaline, thereby making it more difficult for the bacteria to survive. Dr Chuang also noted that females were more prone to UTI than males and this was another factor he considered. He said that no medical student would have passed his finals without suspecting UTI as a possible cause of the plaintiff`s fever on 18 December. However, he then agreed that the treatment prescribed by the defendant on that day would have met the minimum standard in that a lot of GPs would have done the same, although he himself would have tested for UTI. But when it came to the second consultation on 19 December, Dr Chuang emphasised that no reasonable doctor in Singapore would have missed out on the UTI test. This was because it was the fourth day of fever.
Under cross-examination, Dr Chuang conceded that it was not shown anywhere in the medical record card - which covered the plaintiff`s entire history of treatment at the defendant`s clinic since she started going there in February 1992 - that she had three occurrences of UTI in a year. He agreed that dysuria was not caused solely by UTI, although in 95% of the cases it was. He also conceded that Apo-sulfatrim could be prescribed for infections other than UTI and that on one occasion the defendant had prescribed it for the plaintiff`s blocked nose. As for MPC, Dr Chuang conceded that it could be used to replace potassium loss, although it was a strange way of doing it as it had an unpalatable taste. He also accepted that it could be used to treat diarrhoea, although again it was an unusual remedy.
The plaintiff`s other expert, Prof Cartwright, who hails from Britain, is the Consultant Medical Microbiologist at the Mt Alvernia Hospital and the Emeritus Consultant Medical Microbiologist at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, both at Guildford. He holds a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery from Birmingham University and specialises in medical microbiology. He is a fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists and a past director of the Public Health Laboratory Service South Thames. He is an Honorary Visiting Professor in Clinical Microbiology at the University of Surrey.
Prof Cartwright said that although his current work was laboratory based, he had an active clinical practice and saw patients with infections on a regular basis. He gave evidence that he agreed with Dr Chuang that no reasonable GP in Singapore would have omitted to test the plaintiff for UTI on 19 December. Prof Cartwright said that his conclusion was based on reasons similar to those advanced by Dr Chuang, ie that the plaintiff had, on a number of previous occasions, been prescribed medication consistent with the treatment of UTI. Also, on 18 and 19 December she presented symptoms consistent with UTI and, therefore, this possibility should not have been ruled out without performing a simple urine test at the very least. However, in cross-examination, his position shifted a little and he conceded that the symptoms were not unequivocal as to UTI because an upper respiratory tract infection, a more common malaise, could also cause similar symptoms.
The defendant called Prof Cheong Pak Yean, a consultant physician in Family and Internal Medicine, to give expert evidence on his behalf. Prof Cheong obtained his MBBS from the University of Singapore in 1974. He also holds a Master of Medicine (Internal Medicine), is a member of the Royal Colleges of Physician, UK, and a Fellow of the Academy of Medicine Singapore, the Royal College of Physicians Edinburgh, the College of Family Physicians Singapore and the American College of Physicians. He has held a slew of appointments in various medical committees, including the Singapore Medical Council and is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Family Medicine and external examiner at the Faculty of Medicine, NUS.
Prof Cheong pointed out that in the entire medical record of the plaintiff kept by the defendant`s clinic, spanning the period February 1992 to December 1996, there were only ten instances in which an antibiotic was prescribed. None of these was for UTI save one, and that was the last consultation on 23 December 1996. As for MPC, it was prescribed on four occasions. The first was on 24 February 1992, in which the defendant had recorded that the plaintiff had complained of dysuria. However, a UTI test was conducted and the result was negative, indicating that there was no infection. On the next two occasions, MPC was prescribed on the plaintiff`s request, and on the earlier of these it was recorded that she was going abroad. On the fourth and final occasion, it was recorded that she complained of abdominal discomfort and had diarrhoea for a week. Prof Cheong said that from the medical record card, there was no incident of proven UTI prior to December 1996. Prof Cheong concluded that the plaintiff`s medical history available to the defendant did not indicate that she was prone to UTI and disagreed with Dr Chuang`s evidence in this respect.
In support of this conclusion, Prof Cheong provided a detailed analysis of the plaintiff`s medical record card with references to all the relevant consultations conducted and treatments prescribed. In stark contrast, Dr Chuang made rather sweeping statements with only general reference to the medical record cards. In cross-examination, Dr Chuang had to concede some of the points that he had made so forcefully when giving evidence-in-chief. On the other hand, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Kronenburg, was not able to refute Prof Cheong`s evidence in this respect. I find his analysis to be clear and convincing. Indeed, there is no evidence that between 1992 and 1996, the plaintiff had suffered from UTI, let alone had a pre-disposition to it. I therefore hold that there was no evidence before the defendant in December 1996 that the plaintiff was prone to UTI.
That being the case, was it negligent of the defendant to omit to conduct a test for UTI on 19 December? Mr Kronenburg submitted that it was. The plaintiff had been running a fever for at least three days when she went to the defendant a second time on 19 December. Mr Kronenburg submitted that, apart from the plaintiff`s symptoms and medical history, the cost of conducting such a test was so small - there is evidence that the test material only costs about $0.50 - that it should have been carried out in this case.
The parties agree that the relevant test to apply is the 
 Bolam 
 test ( 
Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee
 
[1957] 2 All ER 118
), which is that it is not negligence if the defendant had acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art notwithstanding that there is a body of opinion that would take the contrary view, as modified by 
Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority
 
[1997] 4 All ER 771
[1997] 3 WLR 1151
. In the 
 Bolitho 
 case, the House of Lords held that although: 
 
... [t]he assessment of medical risks and benefits is a matter of clinical judgment which a judge would not normally be able to make without expert evidence ... where a judge can be satisfied that the body of expert opinion cannot be logically supported at all ... such opinion will not provide the bench mark by reference to which the defendant`s conduct falls to be assessed.
 
 
 
The House further said that: 
 
... if, in a rare case, it can be demonstrated that the professional opinion is not capable of withstanding logical analysis, the judge is entitled to hold that the body of opinion is not reasonable or responsible.
 
 
 
With this in mind, I now turn to the evidence of another expert called by the defendant. He is Dr Nicholas Paton, a Consultant Infectious Diseases Physician and Head of the Department of Infectious Diseases, Communicable Diseases Centre, Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Dr Paton holds undergraduate and postgraduate medical degrees from the University of Cambridge and is a member of the UK Royal College of Physicians. After two years as a House Officer at Addenbrooke`s Hospital, Cambridge, after qualification, he was appointed registrar at St Vincent`s Hospital/Liverpool Hospital, Sydney. After about five years, he became senior registrar and research fellow at St George`s Hospital, London. Two years later, he came to Singapore as senior registrar at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, becoming a consultant and the Head of the Department of Infectious Diseases after another two years. He is a Fellow of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore, and a Clinical Senior Lecturer at the NUS. He has published numerous papers on infectious diseases and co-authored or written chapters in five medical texts.
This was what Dr Paton said in his affidavit evidence-in-chief in relation to the consultation of 19 December: 
 
 
5 On the basis of the symptoms with which Ms Pai presented on 18th and 19th, it would have been quite exceptional for any GP in Singapore to have reached the correct diagnosis, namely Klebsiella bacteraemia with probable liver abscesses, lung abscesses and/or pyelonephritis. It therefore seems strange to raise the issue of competence over the Defendant`s failure to make the correct diagnosis, and more specifically his failure to perform a test that may well have been negative, and even if positive would probably not have resulted in the correct diagnosis being made or correct management being instituted (see below). Nevertheless, I will address this issue of whether the urine should have been tested on 19th December 1996. 
 
6 From the perspective of a hospital-based specialist, if a patient such as Ms Pai presented to our infectious diseases clinic we would probably have performed a number of investigations. These would probably have included a full blood count to look for circumstantial evidence of dengue fever or other viral infection, a malaria film if the patient had any history of travel to the surrounding region, serology for influenza and perhaps dengue, a chest X-ray and perhaps a urine dipstick test or microscopy. Very often we would perform these tests for the sake of completeness, as an infectious diseases specialist would be expected to provide a reasonably thorough investigation to confirm a diagnosis. Thus from the point of view of a hospital-based specialist a urine test would have been included in the list of desirable tests, but I would not have said it was mandatory in this case. Indeed, if one of our medical officers had seen Ms Pai in our clinic I would not be surprised to learn later that she had been sent away with symptomatic treatment and no investigations performed. 
 
7 Although I do not have first hand experience of general practice in Singapore, I am aware that the situation is quite different from a hospital-based practice. 
 Due to the volume of patients seen, the GPs here cannot possibly do all the tests that might be indicated in all patients who walk through the door. It therefore falls upon the GP to be selective about the tests that are done, and striking the balance between doing too much and too little is difficult 
. Whereas the medical student sitting for final exams or the hospital specialist will make sure that all the indicated tests are done ie, practise defensive medicine to some extent (defensive against examiners or lawyers respectively), the emphasis for a GP is to keep investigations to a reasonable minimum, and to treat patients as rapidly and economically as possible. A fresh graduate from medical school or a hospital-based specialist would be quite incapable of running a GP clinic which sees about 70 patients a day on average and would feel most uneasy being deprived of the luxury of time to think and capacity to perform investigations to the level at which they felt comfortable. 
 
8 In addition to briefly evaluating the symptoms mentioned by patients and performing a brief physical examination of the relevant body areas, the GP`s background knowledge of the patient will also influence the decision-making process. This background information is sometimes quite detailed and somewhat subjective and is sometimes advantageous to the GP in helping him to make appropriate sense of patients` symptoms. Medical students sitting for finals or the hospital-based specialist seeing the patient once only rarely have access to this information and thus have to base their decisions only on simple objective facts. 
 
9 Ms Pai presented with symptoms of fever, headache, backache, giddiness and cough. These are certainly consistent with a viral infection and most GPs, I suspect, would have made this diagnosis. The presence of cough would point very much towards a respiratory tract infection, and with the absence of cardinal symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection (see below) it is understandable that this latter diagnosis was not entertained. In addition to the clinical facts that are much more suggestive of a simple viral infection, the background of Ms Pai would also influence the interpretation that any GP puts on symptoms. Looking through the records of Dr Yeo`s clinic, I note that she had presented to this clinic (and perhaps others) 8 times in 1992, 11 times in 1993, 6 times in 1994, 8 times in 1995, and 6 times in 1996 prior to the presentation on 18th December. Many of these presentations were with relatively innocuous symptoms such as cold, cough, fever, headache, sore throat, diarrhoea, etc, that were almost certainly caused by trivial viral infections, which required nothing more than symptomatic treatment (ie no antibiotics) and which resolved spontaneously. I do not see any evidence for recurrent lower urinary tract infections (evidence being the presence of a positive dipstick test or culture). Thus given the background of a patient who presented frequently with relatively trivial symptoms compatible with viral infections, I think the interpretation and diagnosis made by Dr Yeo on 18th and 19th December, namely that of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, was reasonable. In my opinion, given this patient`s background and the constraints within which a GP has to operate, the failure to perform a urine test at this stage does not represent incompetence. [Emphasis is added.]
  
 
 
I find Dr Paton`s evidence in this respect to be a paragon of logic and moderation. He analysed clearly the symptoms presented by the plaintiff on the previous occasions that she had consulted the defendant, and concluded that they do not form any basis for saying that the defendant, as a GP, ought to have carried out a urine test for UTI on 19 December. I must state that the witnesses on the plaintiff`s behalf had not given any evidence that would cast doubt on Dr Paton`s conclusion nor on the bases for it that he had set out. I find the words italicised in para 7 of his affidavit to be particularly important. It is always easy, with the benefit of hindsight, to say that had the defendant done the urine test this or that would have happened. What is important is to view the matter from the perspective of GPs. They are constantly dealing with patients who present themselves with all manner of symptoms. The decision to carry out a particular test must be left to their professional judgment and I cannot say that there is any evidence that in the situation before the defendant on 19 December, it would be negligent of him not to have tested the plaintiff`s urine. Prof Cartwright had said that when the plaintiff returned the following day with the same symptoms, it would have been reasonable for the defendant to conduct a urine test to rule out UTI. However, I would say that it would be equally reasonable for him to think that perhaps he ought to change the symptomatic medication, which he did, since only 24 hours had elapsed, although it may well be different if she had returned after three or four days. As for Mr Kronenburg`s point that given the relatively low cost of the material involved, the defendant ought to have done the test to rule out UTI, in my view it is not so straightforward. First of all, it is not just the cost of material that is relevant. The doctor`s skill is required to interpret the result and this would increase the cost to the patient. More important is the implication that such a holding would have on the practice of medicine in Singapore. In my view, to hold the defendant liable in negligence in the present circumstances would lead GPs to adopt an unnecessarily defensive approach to their practices and to order all manner of tests just to rule out remote possibilities. I do not think that such an approach is justified in the present circumstances. Accordingly, I hold that the defendant was not in breach of his contractual duty nor negligent in not carrying out a urine test for UTI on 19 December 1996.
For completeness, I have to consider whether, if the defendant had tested the plaintiff`s urine for UTI and prescribed an antibiotic, this would have prevented the eye infection. There is an overlap here with the issues pertaining to the consultation of 23 December and I shall first deal with that consultation and revert this question later in this judgment.
 Consultation on 23 December 1996 
 
 
 
I have made a finding of fact that the defendant had not advised the plaintiff to go immediately to the hospital when she consulted him on 23 December 1996. As it is also the defendant`s own case, supported by his own experts, that a detached retina is a medical emergency and any competent GP would have advised his patient to go immediately to a hospital or to an eye specialist, it would follow that in not doing so he had fallen short of the standard of care required of him as a GP.
The next question to consider is whether the plaintiff`s eye would have been saved had the defendant, on 19 December, advised her to go to the hospital immediately. The plaintiff said that had she been so advised she would have gone and indeed I see no reason why she would not have done so in view of her intellect and the fact that by that time she had been running a fever for about a week along with the rest of her symptoms. The next question is what would have happened at the hospital. Evidence of this is given by the defendant`s own expert, Dr Ang Beng Chong, an eye specialist in private practice. Dr Ang obtained his MBBS from the University of Singapore in 1967 and is a Fellow of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He was elected to the Academy of Medicine in 1976. Dr Ang had served in the Eye Department of the SGH and Mt Alvernia Hospital before setting up his own practice as a Consultant Opthalmologist at Mt Elizabeth Hospital. He is a part-time lecturer and clinical teacher at the NUS and a visiting Professor of Opthalmology at Tianjin Medical College, China. He is also the Head, Division of Vitreo-retinal Surgery, Department of Opthalmology, NUH and a visiting consultant at the Singapore National Eye Centre (`SNEC`). He was instrumental in setting up the Department of Opthalmology at the NUH. He has published 70 scientific papers and three books and is on the editorial board of Asia-Pacific Journal of Opthalmology.
In oral evidence-in-chief, Dr Ang was asked whether the plaintiff`s eye could have been saved if she had been treated at the hospital on 23 December. This was his reply: 
 
There is a possibility. Chances would be better than 24.12.96. That is logical. Provided:
 
 
 
 
(1) On 23.12.96 the doctor made the correct diagnosis. 
 
(2) That appropriate treatment given. 
 
(3) Eye responded to treatment.
  
 
 
Possible for eye not to respond. With reference to the S-curve drawn by Professor Cartwright yesterday, at the early stages, less organism so few signs. At the later stage where more signs appear, also a lot more organisms and therefore more difficult to treat. If Plaintiff had gone to A&E on 23.12.96, sometime in the afternoon, a general doctor would look at her, she would have a note saying suspected detached retina and would be referred to eye doctor. The first line of consultation is usually a trainee eye doctor. He would examine patient for signs, especially detached retina. He would not find detached retina because there are hardly any other signs, he would be in a dilemma what to do next. He could either call his consultant in, or if brave, state no detached retina and tell patient to come back if symptoms persist or get worse. If he calls in consultant, consultant would examine eye. Because of his experience, he may find more, eg, early signs of inflammation, eg, cells in the vitreous. He might diagnose it as sterile uvitis which would be an acceptable diagnosis. Possible that consultant is familiar with EKE, he might do more tests. Because she had fever, he would not rule out infectious ophthalmitis. At that stage not likely he would aspirate the vitreous because it is not an innocuous procedure. He would just give her antibiotics orally or intravenously and watch for response.
 
 
 
In cross-examination, Dr Ang agreed that there were more factors in favour of the eye being saved had the plaintiff gone to the hospital on 23 December instead of on 24 December. Dr Ang also agreed that if the plaintiff had gone to the A&E Unit of the SGH on 23 December 1996, it was more likely than not that her eye would have been saved. This was the exchange in cross-examination, which was not altered in re-examination: 
 
 
Q: Put - Had Plaintiff gone to A & E of SGH on 23.12.96 evening, her eye would probably have been saved. 
 
A: Possible. 
 
Q: More likely than not? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
The plaintiff`s expert, Prof Cartwright, gave a great deal of evidence on the mechanism of infection and the response of the bacteria to various antibiotics. In essence, he said that had the plaintiff attended at the A&E Unit of SGH on 23 December 1996, her eye would probably have been saved. As the defendant`s own expert, Dr Ang, was in agreement with this point, there is no need for me to go into the details of Prof Cartwright`s evidence.
It is necessary for me to consider the question of causation. On 23 December 1996, the plaintiff presented herself to the defendant. Apart from her symptoms of fever, chills, giddiness and body pain, she told him that she had blurred vision in her left eye. The defendant examined that eye and found that the cornea was clear. From his examination he suspected that she had a detached retina. He did not advise her to go immediately to a hospital as he ought to have done if she had a detached retina. In any event, it turned out that he was wrong about the detached retina. It was likely that at that stage the bacteria had infected her inner eye. The defendant did not suspect such infection. But he cannot be faulted for that because all the experts agree that this particular infection was so unusual that it would be unreasonable to expect a GP to be able to make such a diagnosis. So here we have a situation where a doctor has failed to make the correct diagnosis, but it was not unreasonable that he should miss it completely. However, he suspected a serious ailment, ie detached retina, but that suspicion was wrong. Yet if he had sent her to the hospital on that basis, which he ought to, the actual infection would have been discovered and the eye saved. The question is whether liability ought to attach to the defendant in such circumstances.
Mr Kronenburg relies on the 
McGhee v National Coal Board
 
[1972] 3 All ER 1008
, in which the House of Lords held that a person who substantially increases another person`s risk of injury through negligence has thereby materially contributed to the victim`s injury. There the House held that the defendant, who was the plaintiff`s employer, was negligent in not providing the plaintiff with washing facilities. Because the plaintiff had to cycle home after work with brick dust adhering to his skin, this had added materially to the risk of his developing dermatitis, which he did contract. Mr Kronenburg submitted that in the present case, the defendant had materially contributed to the risk of the plaintiff contracting the eye infection by not advising her to go immediately to the hospital for treatment on 23 December 1996.
Counsel for the defendant, Mr Wee, submitted that 
 McGhee v National Coal Board 
 was qualified by the House in the subsequent decision of 
Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority
 
[1988] 1 All ER 871
. Lord Bridge, delivering the sole reasoned speech of the House said at p 881: 
 
The conclusion I draw from these passages is that 
 McGhee v National Coal Board
 laid down no new principle of law whatever. On the contrary, it affirmed the principle that the onus of proving causation lies on the pursuer or plaintiff. Adopting a robust and pragmatic approach to the undisputed primary facts of the case, the majority concluded that it was a legitimate inference of fact that the defender`s negligence had materially contributed to the pursuer`s injury. The decision, in my opinion is of no greater significance than that and the attempt to extract from it some esoteric principle which in some way modifies, as a matter of law, the nature of the burden of proof of causation which a plaintiff or pursuer must discharge once he has established a relevant breach of duty is a fruitless one.
 
 
 
In my opinion, this discussion is academic because there is no question that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving her case in negligence in this case and that was the basis upon which I have made my findings. The defendant had a duty, in contract and in tort, to advise her to go immediately to hospital on 23 December to seek treatment for her eye and he had breached it by his failure to so advise her. There is every reason to impose liability in this case and I so hold. A GP is the first line of defence to a patient, who goes to him not just to cure ordinary coughs and colds, but also to spot the more serious illnesses that require specialist or immediate attention. It is not fair to expect a GP to be able to diagnose all urgent ailments accurately. But if he thinks a patient`s symptoms and signs indicate something serious and urgent, he owes the patient a duty to get her to immediate treatment. It should not make any difference whether his diagnosis of the actual condition was accurate or not. The defendant had said that when the plaintiff complained about the film over her left eye, he checked the cornea and pupil and found them normal. So he suspected, accurately, that the problem was with the back of the eye. Given his limited experience in this specialised area, he did not think of the bacterial infection in question. That is not to be held against him. But the defendant knew that it was something potentially serious. As a GP, it was his duty to ensure that his patient was advised to seek immediate treatment at the hospital if he suspected or believed such immediate treatment to be necessary.
 Whether plaintiff`s eye could have been saved if Apo-sulfatrim given on 19 December 
 
 
 
 
 
 some effect on the course of the infection 
 
 
 
 on balance the probability would be expected to be lower, although the possibility of increased release of bacteria from the source might raise 
 
 
 
 probability of the eye becoming infected 
 
In respect of the consultation of 19 December, I had earlier held that the omission by the defendant to conduct a urine test for UTI on that occasion was not a breach of duty or negligent. I had also stated that I would for completeness consider whether the plaintiff`s eye would have been saved had this been done. Having dealt with the evidence of the medical experts, it is appropriate at this juncture to deal with that issue. First of all, there is the question of whether the plaintiff`s urine would have tested positive for UTI. Prof Cartwright was of the view that it would. The defendant`s expert, Dr Paton, was also in substantial agreement as he said that in the circumstances it would more likely than not that the plaintiff had UTI. The next question is whether the defendant would have prescribed the same antibiotic to the plaintiff on 19 December as he had done on 23 December. There is no evidence that he would not and I have no doubt that he would. The antibiotic concerned was Apo-sulfatrim. The evidence of the medical experts are as follows: 
(a) Prof Cartwright was of the opinion that it was probable that her eye infection would have been prevented. It would thus follow that she would not have lost the sight of her left eye. 
(b) Dr Ang agreed with the suggestion of Mr Kronenburg that if she was prescribed the antibiotic, that would probably had wiped off the bacteria that caused the eye infection. 
(c) Dr Paton was equivocal. In his evidence-in-chief, he said that Apo-sulfatrim would not have had an effect on the plaintiff because it was likely that by 19 December the infection involved abscesses in one or more organs, ie the liver, kidney or lung. He said that although a short course of antibiotics might have partially suppressed the infection for a few days, it would not be adequate to eradicate the infection at the organs and therefore he could not confidently conclude that this would have prevented the bacteria from reaching the eye. However, in cross-examination he conceded that Apo-sulfatrim may have had , but qualified that it was unlikely to be strong enough to prevent the bacteria from entering the eye. Asked to clarify the words italicised, he said that it might in some way alter the natural progression of the infection, including a reduced chance of the eye being infected, or postponed the infection of the eye. Finally, he said that although even with administration of Apo-sulfatrim, the circumstances would still exist for an eye infection to occur, ` [the] .`
Dr Chuang, who was called by the plaintiff to give evidence on general medical practice also gave evidence in favour of the plaintiff on this question. However, I did not understand him to be an expert on this particular aspect and therefore did not give much weight to his evidence in this respect. However, in view of the clear evidence of the plaintiff`s expert, Prof Cartwright, and one of the defendant`s expert, Dr Ang, and in view of the equivocal evidence of the defendant`s other expert, I would hold that had the plaintiff been administered Apo-Sulfatrim on 19 December, the infection would not have reached her eye. It would follow that had the defendant tested her for UTI on 19 December, he would have prescribed Apo-Sulfatrim and she would have taken it and this would not have resulted in her eye infection and the subsequent loss of her left eye.
 Limitation Act 
 
 
 
Mr Wee submits that the plaintiff`s claim is time barred. This is because the writ was filed on 11 January 2000, whereas the negligent act the basis of the defendant`s liability took place on 23 December 1996. This is more than the three-year period provided under s 24A of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Ed), the appropriate sub-sections of which are as follows: 
 
 
(1) ... 
 
(2) An action to which this section applies, where the damages claimed consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any other person, shall not be brought after the expiration of - 
 
(a) 3 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or 
 
(b) 3 years from the earliest date on which the plaintiff has the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury, if that period expires later than the period mentioned in paragraph (a). 
 
(3) ... 
 
(4) In subsections (2) and (3), the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury or damage (as the case may be) means knowledge - 
 
(a) that the injury or damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence, nuisance or breach of duty; 
 
(b) of the identity of the defendant; 
 
(c) if it is alleged that the act or omission was that of a person other than the defendant, of the identity of that person and the additional facts supporting the bringing of an action against the defendant; and 
 
(d) of material facts about the injury or damage which would lead a reasonable person who had suffered such injury or damage to consider it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgment. 
 
(5) Knowledge that any act or omission did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence, nuisance or breach of duty is irrelevant for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3). 
 
(6) For the purposes of this section, a person`s knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire - 
 
(a) from facts observable or ascertainable by him; or 
 
(b) from facts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek. 
 
(7) A person shall not be taken by virtue of sub-section (6) to have knowledge of a fact ascertainable only with the help of expert advice solong as he has taken all reasonable steps to obtain (and, where appropriate, to act on) that advice.
  
 
 
It is not disputed that the plaintiff was warded on 24 December 1996 and remained in SGH under the care of specialists of the SNEC until 26 January 1997. The plaintiff gave evidence that she sought further advice in relation to her injury. She consulted one Prof Stuart Brown of the Department of Opthalmology, University of California, San Diego in respect of the liability of the SNEC and SGH. In February 1998, Prof Brown concluded that there was nothing improper about her treatment by those institutions. After further consideration, on 3 June 1998, Prof Brown advised the plaintiff that the defendant`s treatment was unacceptable. Mr Kronenburg submits that in view of these facts, time did not run until 3 June 1998, or at least until the day the plaintiff was discharged from the hospital. This would mean that the action was brought within three years.
Mr Wee submitted that the date of the plaintiff`s knowledge should be 30 December 1996 when the doctors advised her of their prognosis, or on her own admission, sometime in the first half of January 1997. It seems to me that the second alternative does not support the defendant`s position because the writ was filed within three years of 11 January 1997. In any case, the defendant`s submission on this point is clearly untenable for the reasons that follow.
`Knowledge` for the purpose of s 24A may be actual or constructive. The defendant does not submit that the plaintiff had actual knowledge. Indeed, the plaintiff said that she had no idea of it until 3 June 1998 and up to about February 1998 was pursuing the matter on the basis that the SNEC or SGH were liable. However, knowledge can be constructive knowledge. In 
 Hendy v Milton Keynes Health Authority 
 (The Times, 8 March 1991), the Queen`s Bench Division held that the plaintiff`s knowledge had depended on the date she received the expert`s report. However, the court held that in a less complicated case, knowledge would arise when the victim appreciated in general terms that his problems were attributable to the operation even if the precise terms of what had gone wrong were not known. 
 Broadley v Guy Clapham & Co 
 (The Times, 6 July 1993) is a decision of the English Court of Appeal. The report summarises the decision as follows: 
 
A person alleging medical negligence was fixed with a cause of action when she knew, or could have known with the help of medical advice reasonably obtainable, that her injury had been caused by damage resulting from something done or not done by the surgeon during her operation. Knowledge detailed enough to enable the plaintiff`s advisers to draft a statement of claim was not required before time began to run.
 
 
 
I cannot see how, in the circumstances of this case, constructive knowledge could attach to the plaintiff without expert assistance. The parties agree that the plaintiff`s affliction was a rare eye infection. At the very least, it was necessary for the plaintiff to seek an opinion from an expert after giving full instructions about the circumstances. That being the case, I cannot see how the plaintiff could have done this before she was discharged from SGH on 26 January 1997. And at the very least, she was entitled to a reasonable period after that date to obtain such expert advice. In the premises, I would hold that the plaintiff`s claim was made within the three-year limitation period.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In the premises, I find that the defendant was in breach of his contractual duty to the plaintiff, alternatively that he was negligent, in failing to advise her on 23 December 1996 to go immediately to the hospital. I also find that if he had so advised her, she would have gone. And if she had gone to the hospital on that day, on a balance of probability, her eye would have been saved. Accordingly, I find the defendant liable to the plaintiff in respect of the loss of her left eye for such damages as may be assessed.
I will hear counsel on the question of costs.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): On 6 September 1999 the appellant, together with another Wan Yue Kong (`Wan`), was convicted and sentenced to death by Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh (`the trial judge`) under a joint charge of drug trafficking. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons. We should add that Wan did not file any appeal.
The appellant was originally charged in the High Court with the following offence: 
 
That, you, Chin Siong Kian, on or about the 2nd day of March 1999, between 3.50pm to 3.55pm, at the ground floor lift landing of Block 106 Jalan Bukit Merah, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class ""A"" of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by giving ten (10) packets of substance containing not less than 122.9 grams of diamorphine in a red plastic bag to one Wan Yue Kong, Nric S7121997F, at the aforesaid place, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
A separate capital charge was framed against Wan in relation to the same transaction. Wan also faced a second non-capital charge which was stood down.
Both the appellant and Wan were jointly tried in the same court. At the close of the prosecution`s case the court allowed the prosecution`s application that the capital charges against the two accused be amended to a joint capital charge. In allowing the amendment, the trial judge permitted counsel to further cross-examine any of the prosecution`s witnesses if they so wished. Counsel for the appellant did avail himself of this opportunity.
The amended joint charge against the accused read: 
 
You,
 
 
 
Wan Yue Kong (Nric S7121997-F)
 
 
 
Chin Siong Kian (M`sian Nric 770504-01-5603)
 
 
 
are charged that in furtherance of the common intention of both of you, on or about the 2nd day of March 1999, between 3.50pm and 3.55pm, at the ground floor lift landing of Block 106 Jalan Bukit Merah, Singapore, did jointly traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class ""A"" of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, 10 packets containing not less than 122.9 grams of diamorphine at the aforesaid place, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act and section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
 
 
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
 
 
On 2 March 1999 a group of Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) officers were keeping surveillance on Wan at Block 403, Clementi Avenue 1. At around 3.10pm Wan and a female Chinese (later ascertained to be one `Bee Lian`) took a taxi from Clementi Avenue 1 to come to the car park of Block 106 and Block 107 of Jalan Bukit Merah. These two blocks face each other, with a car park located in-between. Having alighted from the taxi, Wan walked in the direction of the lift landing at Block 106 while Bee Lian walked towards Block 107.
At the time, one Chee Kiat Chong (`Chong`), a friend of Wan, who was sitting in a coffee shop at Block 107, saw Wan`s arrival in the taxi. About five minutes later, Wan came into the coffee shop and asked Chong whether he would want to go to Tiong Bahru Plaza later. Wan then walked out of the coffee shop and returned about five to ten minutes later to join Chong at the latter`s table. He also ordered some food. About ten minutes later, Wan received a call on his hand phone, whereupon he, without finishing his food, left the coffee shop and walked towards Block 106. Soon thereafter, Chong noticed a Malaysian registered car, with a registration number beginning with `W`, parked near to Block 106.
The arrival of a Malaysian registered car with the number plate WAF 7185 was seen by S/Sgt Lim and Sgt Kassim who were keeping watch at the entrance to the car park. The driver of the car, later ascertained to be the appellant, alighted and opened the boot of the car, took out a red plastic bag and walked in the direction of the lift landing of Block 106. S/Sgt Lim`s and Sgt Kassim`s evidence was that the red plastic bag appeared to contain light coloured bundles. Shortly thereafter, S/Sgt Lim and Sgt Kassim saw the appellant leaving the car park in WAF 7185. Chong also saw the car leaving. The two officers tailed the car until the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint where the appellant was arrested by a party of CNB officers led by Insp Lester Lim. A search of the appellant`s person and the car produced nothing incriminating.
In the meantime, Wan returned to the coffee shop. After finishing his food, he told Chong that he was leaving for Tiong Bahru Plaza. Chong agreed to follow Wan. Both walked towards Block 106 and Wan contacted Bee Lian to ask her to come down. The three of them then took a taxi to Tiong Bahru Plaza. As they were about to alight from the taxi at the destination, they were arrested by CNB officers. They were then taken back to Block 106, Jalan Bukit Merah, unit [num ]06-1846. This unit (rented from HDB) belonged to Wan`s uncle, one Mark Siak Kong, who had allowed Wan to use it. A search was done outside the unit and two keys were found at a ventilation opening and with the two keys the officers opened the metal grill and wooden door of the unit.
The CNB officers who conducted the search inside the flat included the investigating officer, W/Insp Cindy Goh, and S/Sgt Tai Kwong Yong (`S/Sgt Tai`). In a `Marlboro` cardboard paper box that was placed next to a double-decker bed in the living room cum bedroom, S/Sgt Tai saw two red plastic bags in it. One of the red plastic bags was bigger and double-layered, ie there was another red plastic bag inside it. This bigger red plastic bag was found to contain ten bundles of substance, which were later analysed and found to contain diamorphine. Inside the smaller red plastic bag was another white plastic bag where there were two bundles of substance which were analysed and found to also contain diamorphine.
Other than the two red plastic bags described above, the following were also found in the `Marlboro` box: 
(1) a red plastic bag which contained clothes; 
(2) a red plastic bag which contained a kettle; 
(3) a red plastic bag which contained some empty envelopes; 
(4) an empty red plastic bag; 
(5) a black plastic bag which contained cash amounting to $3,500; 
(6) three clothes hangers; 
(7) a sieve set; and 
(8) a few pieces of newspapers at the bottom of the box.
Because at the time Wan indicated that there were `some more`, S/Sgt Tai found from under the coffee table, another packet of substance which was later analysed to also contain diamorphine. This packet of substance had no relevance to this appeal. A TANITA digital weighing scale was also found there.
At the end of the search, IO W/Insp Goh put a number of questions to Wan in Hokkien. The questions and answers were recorded by IO W/Insp Goh in her field book and were read back to Wan, who affirmed it by signing against the recording.
 Scientific analysis of substance seized 
 
 
 
The ten bundles of substance found in the larger red plastic bag in the Malboro box, which were of a gross weight of 4,496g, were analysed by the Department of Scientific Services to contain not less than 122.9g of diamorphine. Their purity level was 2.7%. The two bundles found in the smaller plastic bag was of a gross weight of 883.7g and contained not less than 9.01g of diamorphine. Their purity level was only 1%.
 Fingerprint evidence 
 
 
 
The various items seized were also examined for fingerprints. The fingerprints lifted from the weighing scale matched the right middle finger of Wan. The other finger impressions obtained were obscure.
 Statements made by Wan 
 
 
 
A number of statements were recorded from Wan, as well as from the appellant, by IO W/Insp Goh. Wan did not challenge the admission of his statements. Some parts of Wan`s statements implicated the appellant and were relied upon by the prosecution. We now set out those pertinent parts of Wan`s statements: 
 
Oral statement of Wan recorded on 2 March 1999
 
 
 
 
Q: Ri quo si mi mai? (What`s your name?) 
 
A: Wan Yue Kong. 
 
Q: Pei Hun si mi si ri eh? (Is the heroin yours?) 
 
A: Pei Hun rong zong wa eh, gar ei nan bo guang hi. (All the heroin is mine and has nothing to do with them). 
 
Q: Hi dao eh Pei Hun sin mi si ri eh? (The heroin over there, is it yours?) [Pointing to some packets of heroin under the coffee table] 
 
A: Si, nong zong si wai eh (Yes, all mine)
  
 
 
Cautioned statement of Wan recorded on 4 March 1999
 
 
 
The heroin belongs to me and have nothing to do with my girlfriend Jo Jo [ie Bee Lian] and my friend Ah Chong. Both of them accompanied me to Tiong Bahru Plaza to buy things. Both of them did not know anything about the heroin.
 
 
 
The long statement of Wan recorded on 5 March 1999 at 1055hrs
 
 
 
 
2 On Monday night (1.3.99), I was in a hotel ... About 3 to 4 am, my girlfriend ""Jo Jo"" called me on my handphone ... I took a taxi and went to her house ... 
 
3 When I arrived at my girlfriend`s house, we chit-chat until about 8 am ... shopped around at Chinatown areas until about 12 noon. We then took a taxi to my flat at Blk 403 Clementi Ave 1 [num ]13-196 ... At about 2 pm, I received a call on my handphone. 
 The call was from Malaysia and the caller was ""Ah Seng"". He told me in Hokkien that the ""mi kia"" (stuff) had arrived. He asked me to go to Block 106 Jalan Bukit Merah at about 3 pm to wait for his call 
 ... we decided to leave in a taxi together. 
 
4 At about some time after 3 pm, the taxi arrived at the car park of Blk 106 Jalan Bukit Merah ... We alighted and my girlfriend walked back to her house while 
 I went to the coffee-shop at Blk 107. In the coffee-shop, I ordered some food. About 10 minutes later, my handphone rang again. A male voice said in Mandarin that ""dong xi"" (stuff) had arrived and asked me to go to Block 106, he told me he is carrying a red plastic bag. 
 I told the caller in Mandarin that I was wearing ""chocolate"" shirt and a long jeans. I told him I am tall and skinny. 
 I cannot recognise the voice and the caller did not say who he was, but I knew he is not ""Ah Seng"". I hanged up and walked to the lift entrance on the ground floor of Block 106 ... I have not finished my food 
. 
 
5 
 When I reached the lift entrance, I saw a Chinese man wearing white round neck T-shirt and a pair of dark-coloured jeans. The Chinese man is about my height. He was holding a red plastic bag standing next to the public phone near the lift entrance. 
 I could not remember he was holding the plastic bag with which hand. 
 There was no other person around him. I looked at him and when he saw me, he put the red plastic bag on the floor near the public phone and walked towards the car park at Block 106. I then picked up the red plastic bag that was tied with a knot and took the lift to the 6th storey ... 
 
 
6 ... I then took two keys from the ventilation opening on the left side of the door. I used the two keys to open the metal gate and the wooden door of the unit. 
 I went to the flat and placed the red plastic bag in a paper box in the living room and left the flat. 
 I did not open the plastic bag to check the contents. The red plastic bag was still tied when I left the flat. I then locked the wooden door and the metal gate and left the two keys at the higher ventilation opening ... I went back to the coffee-shop at Blk 107 to finish up my food. When I reached the coffee-shop, I saw ""Ah Chong"" was seated at a table, drinking coffee. I met him by chance. We did not arrange to meet each other on that day. I then sat with him. I asked ""Ah Chong"" whether he wants to go Tiong Bahru Plaza together with my girlfriend. He agreed. 
 
7 ... A while later, my girlfriend met us ... Three of us then walked to the main road to hail a taxi ... The taxi then arrived at the taxi stand outside Tiong Bahru Plaza. Before we could alight, some men rushed to the taxi and arrested three of us. [All emphases added.]
  
 
 
The long statement of Wan recorded on 5 March 1999 at 1435hrs
 
 
 
 
9 ... At the 6th storey, we were brought to the flat [num ]06-1846. I saw an officer recovered the two keys from the ventilation opening that I had earlier placed. One officer then used the two keys to open the metal gate and the wooden door and all three of us were brought into the flat. 
 
10 In the flat, CNB officers then searched the flat.
 I saw one officer untying the red plastic bag that I had earlier placed in the paper box. I saw the officer took out one packet wrapped with plastic sheets from the red plastic bag ... The woman officer then asked me in Hokkien the heroin belongs to who and I answered that the heroin are mine and has nothing to do with my girlfriend and ""Ah Chong"". She also asked me about the heroin found under the coffee-table and I said its mine. The woman officer then read to me in Hokkien and I signed on her book ... 
 
 
11 In 1989, I came to know one ""Ah Chai"" in RTC ... Two days before my arrest, about sometime midnight I received a call from Malaysia on my handphone. The caller said he is ""Ah Chai"" ... He then told me that he gave my handphone number to ""Ah Seng"" from Malaysia and that ""Ah Seng"" will call me ... About three hours later, my handphone rang and a male voice spoke in Hokkien said that he is ""Ah Seng"" ... he said he will pass me something and told me to pass these things to another ""Ah Seng"" in Singapore. I asked him what these things were, he said I should know. I believe these things were heroin because usually Malaysians say bringing things to Singapore, they meant heroin. I then said I do not know this Singapore ""Ah Seng"" asked him why he did not want to do it himself. He said he did not trust this Singapore ""Ah Seng"". I then said since that ""Ah Seng"" is not to be trusted, why he still want me to do it. He said he had given the Singapore ""Ah Seng"" my handphone number and that the Singapore ""Ah Seng"" will call me. He then said he will give me some coffee money for doing the favour. He also said that he will get someone to pass me the money after I passed the thing to ""Ah Seng"". He did not mention the amount, but I guess it will be at least a few thousands dollars, I then agreed to do it. 
 
14 
 In paragraph 6, I stated I did not open the red plastic bag to check the contents. What I meant was that I did not open up the plastic bundles. When I reached the flat with the red plastic bag, I did untie it and saw a white plastic bag on top of another red plastic bag. I took out the white plastic bag which was tied and placed it inside the paper box. I then tied the red plastic bag containing another red plastic bag and put it in the same paper box. 
 The packet of yellow heroin found under the coffee table was bought by me three weeks ago. I kept that for my own consumption because it is of good quality. [All emphases added.]

16 
 When I took out the white plastic bag from the original red plastic bag, I saw another red plastic bag in the original red plastic bag. I then tied the original red plastic bag without paying attention to the contents. I did not untie the white plastic bag to check the contents. 
 I did not check the contents as my role was to pass these plastic bags to Singapore ""Ah Seng"". The reason for taking out the white plastic bag from the original red plastic bag was because the original red plastic bag was too bulky to put into the paper box. 
 
17 This flat at Block 106 Jalan Bukit Merah [num ]06-1846 belongs to my maternal granduncle ... I call him ""Ah Gu"" ... Some months back, I took the two keys that led to the flat from him. I told him that I would go to the flat to sleep in some afternoons ... Other than the heroin, cash of about three thousand over dollars, the weighing scale and some empty plastic bags, I did not keep any other things in the flat. 
 
19 During the first call from the Malaysian ""Ah Seng"", he mentioned a place for me to collect the things. I cannot remember the place, but I know it was very far for me and 
 I told him to come to Block 106 Jalan Bukit Merah. He then agreed. I decided to ask him to pass me the things at Block 106 Jalan Bukit Merah because I wanted to keep the things at my ""Ah Gu"" flat and wait for ""Ah Seng"" to collect for me. I did not want to carry the things around as I find it risky to do so 
. [All emphases added.]
  
 
 
The long statement of Wan recorded on 20 March 1999
 
 
 
 
27 ... it is true that the Chinese man put the red plastic bag on the floor and I picked it from there. He did not pass the red plastic bag to me personally ...
  
 
 
 
 
 Statements of the appellant 
 
 
 
 
 
The appellant made altogether five statements to IO W/Insp Goh. He also made one cautioned statement to Insp Daniel Tan: 
(1) oral statement on 3 March 1999; 
(2) cautioned statement of the same date; 
(3) s 121(1) statement on 9 March 1999; 
(4) s 121(1) statement on 10 March 1999 (am); 
(5) s 121(1) statement on 10 March 1999 (pm); 
(6) s 121(1) statement on 16 March 1999.
He did not challenge the admission of the first three statements given to IO W/Insp Goh, but contended that he was induced to make the fourth and fifth statements (5 & 6 above). In a trial-within-a-trial, he alleged that IO W/Insp Goh said that he would be allowed to see his family members if he made a satisfactory statement. He said he had earlier made several requests that he be allowed to see his family members. The appellant`s father also gave evidence that since learning of his son`s arrest on 8 March 1999, he had sought through an intermediary to obtain permission to see the son without success. It was only on 23 March 1999 that the appellant saw his father.
The trial judge after hearing the rebuttal evidence from the prosecution witnesses involved in the taking of the statements and analysing the same in the light of the evidence adduced by the appellant`s witnesses, ruled that the two statements `appeared to (have been) made as a result of inducement uttered and emanating from the investigating officer, the inducement being that if (the appellant) gave a satisfactory statement he would be allowed to see his family`. Accordingly, he held that the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the two statements were voluntarily made and refused to admit the same.
The relevant parts of the four statements of the appellant which were admitted into evidence were the following:

I have nothing to say. I handed a plastic bag containing clothing to ""Ah Beng"". I do not know the full name of ""Ah Beng"".
 
 
 
Section 121(1) statement recorded on 9 March 1999
 
 
 
 
2 On two or three nights before 2.3.99, my Malaysian friend ""Ma Lau"" handed me one red plastic bag and told me that the plastic bag contain working clothes. I then took the plastic bag to my room. 
 I opened the red plastic bag and saw about 6 or 7 pieces of clothes. There was one blue T-shirt, two grey collared T-shirts, one black T-shirt, a pair of blue Jeans, a pair of yellow shorts and some clothings 
 which I did not see carefully. I then tied the plastic bag. I was alone in my room when I checked the clothings in the plastic bag. I then kept the plastic bag next to the door in my rented room in Johor Jaya Tetap Lapan ... 
 
3 On 2.3.99, at about 11 in the morning, I went to work in a games arcade in Johor Jaya. A while later, ""Ma Lau"" came to see me at my work place. He told me that there is job in Singapore. I asked him whether he is sure of the job. ""Ma Lau"" said he does not really know and asked me to find out from ""Ah Beng"" in Singapore. I asked him which ""Ah Beng"". ""Ma Lau"" then said we have met this ""Ah Beng"" before. I then told ""Ma Lau"" that I have some impressions of this ""Ah Beng"". ""Ma Lau"" then told me that I can find ""Ah Beng"" in Redhill. I told ""Ma Lau"" that I am not familiar with Redhill areas, but I said I will find my way there. ""Ma Lau"" then reminded me to bring the red plastic bag of clothings he handed over to me two or three days ago. I then got someone to stand in for me so that I can go to Singapore. Then I left for my rented room together with ""Ma Lau"". 
 
4 In my rented room, I took the same red plastic bag of clothings that ""Ma Lau"" handed to me without checking the contents. I brought the plastic bag to downstairs and met ""Ma Lau"". ""Ma Lau"" then gave me a phone number 96811655 which I wrote on a piece of paper and told me that the number belongs to ""Ah Beng"". I then asked ""Ma Lau"" why can`t he just call ""Ah Beng"" directly and asked whether there are any jobs. ""Ma Lau"" said it is better that someone goes to Singapore personally. I told ""Ma Lau"" that I did not feel like going to Singapore as I have to pay S$30 at the Customs just to come to Singapore. ""Ma Lau"" then told me that if I manage to find a job in Singapore, it is worth paying the $30. Then I decided to go to Singapore. ""Ma Lau"" then handed over to me his car keys for me to drive to Singapore. 
 
5 I then walked towards ""Ma Lau`s"" car, which was parked nearby. ""Ma Lau`s"" car is a Honda and 
 the registration number is WAF 7185 
. I then placed the red plastic bag of clothings on the floorboard of the rear seat and drove off. The red plastic bag was tied and I did not open up to check the contents. [All emphases added.]
  
 
 
Section 121(1) statement recorded on 10 March 1999 (am)
 
 
 
 
7 
 On the day when ""Ma Lau"" handed me the red plastic bag of clothings, he did told me that the clothes were meant for both of us to wear when we worked in Singapore ... some time back we have ever discussed about going to Singapore to work and the working clothes were meant for that. 
 
 
8 I then drove alone the car WAF 7185 from Johor Jaya to the Johor Customs, and after clearing the Customs, I drove to Singapore Customs in Woodlands. At about sometime after 2 in the afternoon, I cleared the Singapore Customs, I drove my car to the shop nearby and bought two bunches of grapes. I then make a call to the games arcade and spoke to ""Ma Lau"" and confirmed with him the telephone number of ""Ah Beng"" again ... During the journey to Singapore, the red plastic bag of working clothes were still placed at the same spot. 
 
9 From Wodlands, I drove to a highway ... to Yishun. From Yishun, I drove to somewhere near Jalan Kayu and then to another highway and then exit to PIE. From PIE, I drove to City Plaza at Geylang and then to Golden Mile ... and finally arrived at Redhill area. I then saw Blk 106 at Redhill and drove towards the block. I then drove into the car park of Blk 106, I stopped the car at the car park without parking as most of the lots were occupied. I stopped the car nearer to Block 106, there was another block opposite Block 106, but I do not [
 sic 
] the number of this block. 
 
10 I then alighted from my car, and opened the rear passenger door and took out the red plastic bag from the floorboard ... I walked to Block 106 and make a call from a public card-phone near the lift lobby. I put down the plastic bag next to me and I called 9681165. A male voice answered the call and spoke in Hokkien ""who is that"". I said in Mandarin that I am here to look for a job. I then asked him where he is. He asked me in Hokkien where I was, 
 I said I am now at the lift lobby of Block 106. He said he is coming over now. I then hanged up the phone and waited. About one or two minutes later, I saw one Chinese man walking towards me. I asked him in Mandarin whether he is ""Ah Beng"". He answered ""Yes"". I asked him whether there is any job for me, he said not at the moment. I then decided to leave, carrying the plastic bag. ""Ah Beng"" then asked me in Hokkien what is inside the plastic bag. I said clothings. ""Ah Beng"" then suggested that I leave the clothings with him first. I then handed the plastic bag to ""Ah Beng"". I saw ""Ah Beng"" quickly took the plastic bag and went into the lift immediately 
. I then make a call from the same public phone. I called the games arcade No. 0127033831 and spoke to one ""Ah Wing"" who stood in for me. I asked him to pass a message to ""Ma Lau"" that there is no job. 
 
11 I then hanged up the phone and walked back to the car and drove off. [All emphases added.]
  
 
 
From these statements of the appellant, it could be seen that his defence was that he came into Singapore in the hope of getting a job here through Wan whom he was to meet at Block 106, Jalan Bukit Merah. The red plastic bag which he had passed to Wan contained only working clothes for himself and `Ma Lau` to wear should they manage to find jobs here in Singapore.
 Amendment of charge 
 
 
 
At the conclusion of the prosecution`s case, the prosecution requested for an amendment of the capital charges preferred against Wan and the appellant to a joint charge against the both of them (see [para ]5 above). It was clear to the trial judge that the amendment was necessitated by the court`s ruling that the statements made by the appellant on 10 March (pm) and 16 March 1999, which contain incriminatory confessions, were ruled to be inadmissible. Thus, the prosecution had to rely on the statements of Wan and in order that the prosecution may so rely, both of them had to be charged for the same offence. Section 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) provides: 
 
When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well as against the person who makes the confession.
 
 
 
The request for the amendment of the charges was strenuously objected to by counsel for the appellant on the ground that the amendment would be very prejudicial to the appellant. However, the trial judge felt that as the prosecution could have preferred a joint charge against the appellant and Wan at the beginning, it was entitled to prefer such a charge before the close of the prosecution`s case. He said: 
 
Questions of joinder whether covering offences or offenders is essentially a matter of practice and a question to be determined in the light of experience and the needs of justice, general principles being subordinated to the particular facts of the case. I was of the view that the Amended 1st Charge in the circumstances of the present case was proper. The important consideration here was that the Prosecution was relying only on the evidence adduced thus far and no fresh evidence or cross-examination of any witness or other witnesses was sought by the Prosecution to establish or support the Amended 1st Charge. There was therefore no prejudice to the 1st and 2nd Accused. The case against one or the other or both would fall or be sustained on the evidence already adduced in the light of such law as was applicable.
 
 
 
As a further safeguard, after having the amended charge read to Wan and the appellant, the court gave liberty to their counsel to further cross-examine any witnesses. The investigating officer was, among others, recalled by counsel for the appellant for that purpose. She was asked if she had searched and found a red plastic bag containing the sort of clothing the appellant had described in his statements. She said she did search the box and found no such clothing. In a red bag in the `Marlboro` box there were women`s clothing which belonged to the deceased wife of Wan`s uncle and pyjamas which belonged to Wan`s uncle. IO W/Insp Goh had brought all the contents of the `Marlboro` box to court. She said she did a search of the flat and did not find clothing of the nature described by the appellant.
 Prima facie case 
 
 
 
At the conclusion of the further cross-examination of the prosecution`s witnesses by the appellant`s counsel, whilst Wan`s counsel did not make a submission of no case to answer, the appellant`s counsel did. The trial judge held that a prima facie case had been established on the following ingredients of the joint charge: 
 
 
(i) That the 1st Accused (Wan) had possession of the 10 packets of diamorphine weighing not less than 122.9 grams at the ground floor lift lobby of Blk 106 on the date and time mentioned in the joint charge. 
 
(ii) That the 1st Accused had by virtue of the possession and as a result of the application of certain presumptions escalating the offence, committed the 
 criminal act 
 of trafficking. 
 
(iii) That the 2nd Accused (the appellant) had acted in concert with the 1st Accused pursuant to a pre-arranged plan and in furtherance of the common intention of them both to put and had as such put the 1st Accused in possession of the said diamorphine rendering the 2nd Accused liable as well for the escalated 
 criminal act 
 of trafficking of the 1st Accused as a result of the application of s. 34 of the Penal Code Cap 224 thereby showing that both were trafficking in the said diamorphine. [Emphasis is added.]
  
 
 
 
 
 Conclusion of trial 
 
 
 
 
 
At the conclusion of the trial and after hearing the appellant`s oral evidence as well as the arguments of the prosecution and the defence, the trial judge accepted the statements made by Wan as an accurate reflection of what took place between Wan and the appellant on 2 March 1999, between 3.50pm to 3.55pm, at the ground floor lift landing of Block 106, Jalan Bukit Merah. The appellant`s defence was rejected by the trial judge as being `so incredible that it was incapable of belief`. The trial judge relied on the direct evidence given by the CNB surveillance officers, the confessions made by Wan and all the `tightly knit strands of circumstantial evidence` to reach the irresistible conclusion that the red plastic bag which the appellant had passed to Wan contained the packets of diamorphine which Wan had confessed to receiving. The trial judge therefore convicted the appellant and Wan under the amended joint charge and sentenced them to suffer death.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
In this appeal, counsel for the appellant essentially repeated the arguments that had been canvassed at the trial. They may be categorised under the following heads, namely, that the trial judge had erred: 
(1) in allowing the prosecution to amend the charge against the appellant at the close of the prosecution`s case; 
(2) in ruling that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the appellant at the close of the prosecution`s case; and 
(3) in disbelieving the appellant`s evidence given in his defence.
 (1) AMENDMENT OF THE CHARGE
Counsel for the appellant argued that the amendment to a joint charge was highly prejudicial to his client as pursuant thereto the prosecution was able to rely on 
Chin Seow Noi v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
  to secure a conviction solely on the basis of a confession of a co-accused. Counsel also relied on 
Lee Ngin Kiat v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 511
  to contend that the court in exercising its power to allow an amendment must exercise it judiciously and must bear in mind the possibility of prejudice to the accused.
In the present case the amendment of the charge was sought by the prosecution. The trial judge permitted the amendment in exercise of his powers under s 163(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which provides that `any court may alter any charge or frame a new charge, whether in substitution for or in addition to an existing charge at any time before judgment is given`. In 
Lew Cheok Hin v R
 
 
[1956] MLJ 131
 , a magistrate`s appeal case, Taylor J held that `an amendment [of a charge] may be made at any stage and, in general, the earlier the better but 
 it is at the close of the evidence for the prosecution that the Court is in the best position to decide exactly what is the case which the accused is required to meet` 
 (emphasis is added). This statement of the law was applied by the Malaysian Court of Appeal (in interpreting an equivalent Malaysian provision) in 
PP v Jorge Enrique Pellon Tellon
 
 
[1998] 4 MLJ 183
 .
It was quite clear that following the trial judge`s decision not to admit two of the statements made by the appellant which had contained confessions relating to the appellant`s guilt, the prosecution had to reassess the position. Thus, the need for the amended joint charge. In any case, the amendment was sought prior to the defence being called. The two accused were given fresh opportunities to recall any prosecution witnesses whom they wished to further cross-examine. As mentioned earlier, this opportunity was, in fact, made use of by the appellant`s counsel who recalled and further cross-examined some prosecution witnesses, including IO W/Insp Goh. Ample opportunity was given to the appellant to rebut and meet the amended charge.
In the light of the authorities on how s 163(1) should be applied, we held that the trial judge did act correctly when he allowed the amendment of the charge. The principle stated in 
 Lee Ngin Kiat v PP 
 (supra) remains applicable. But it should be viewed in the right perspective as in 
 Lee Ngin Kiat 
 this court was concerned with the situation where an appellate court proceeded to amend the charge well after the trial had been concluded. Obviously in that situation, even greater caution must be exercised in permitting an amendment.
 (2) WAS PRIMA FACIE CASE ESTABLISHED
Under the amended charge, all that the prosecution need show to establish a prima facie case were the following: 
(a) possession of the said quantity of diamorphine by Wan; 
(b) the possession was for the purpose of trafficking the said drugs; and 
(c) the criminal act of trafficking in drugs was committed in furtherance of a common intention between the appellant and Wan, namely, the plan was that the appellant was to put Wan in possession of the said drugs at the material place and time.
On the evidence, there could be no doubt that the ingredient of possession was established. This was clear from the confessions of Wan as well as the testimony of the CNB officers who searched the flat that day. There was no dispute that Wan, on 2 March 1999 at the ground floor lift landing of Block 106, Jalan Bukit Merah, had received from a person a red plastic bag containing the ten packets of diamorphine and knowing it to be diamorphine. He brought it up to the flat. He was in possession of the drugs. The presumption found in s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Ed) then operated to establish the second ingredient. Section 17 provided that a person found in possession of more than 2g of diamorphine (in this case, 122.9g) would be presumed to have had the drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it was proved otherwise.
Turning to the third ingredient, the question to be determined was whether it had been shown that there was a common intention between Wan and the appellant to put Wan in possession of the said quantity of drugs. In the nature of things, such intention would have to be gathered from the conduct of the parties and all the surrounding circumstances. In this instance, besides the evidence of the CNB officers, again the statements of Wan were most pertinent. From those statements it was clear that there was a plan to deliver drugs to Wan and he had arranged for the drugs to be given to him specifically at Block 106, Jalan Bukit Merah. On 2 March 1999, at about 3.50pm, when Wan was in the coffee shop at Block 107, Jalan Bukit Merah, he received a phone call, whereupon he proceeded to the ground floor lift landing of Block 106. At the same time, the appellant was observed arriving at the car park of Block 106 in a Malaysian registered car WAF 7185. Wan saw a male Chinese waiting by the phone booth near the ground floor lift landing of Block 106. The Chinese male was holding a red plastic bag and when he saw Wan he placed the bag on the ground near to the phone booth and walked away towards the car park. Wan then picked up the red plastic bag from the ground and immediately took the lift up to unit [num ]06-1846.
Even the events recounted in the appellant`s admitted statements were consistent to a large extent with those of Wan. The appellant stated that upon arriving at Block 106, Jalan Bukit Merah, he went to the public telephone to make a phone call and was told to wait there at the ground floor lift landing of Block 106. Shortly thereafter, Wan arrived. He exchanged a few words with Wan and then passed the red plastic bag to him. The appellant then noticed that Wan took the lift up immediately. Although Wan could not identify the appellant as the person who passed him the red plastic bag, the appellant, on the other hand, had positively identified Wan as the person to whom he had given a red plastic bag at the material place and time. But as far as Wan was concerned, there was only one transaction that afternoon. Thus, the only material difference between the appellant`s account and Wan`s account was as to the contents of the red plastic bag that was passed over to Wan. According to the appellant, the contents were clothes. But according to Wan, he took the red plastic bag up to unit [num ]06-1846 and left it in a paper box in the living room. After that he left the flat. Upon Wan (and his two friends, Bee Lian and Chong) being brought back to the said unit following their arrest, he witnessed a CNB officer examining the red plastic bag which he had earlier placed in the paper box. From this red plastic bag, Wan saw the CNB officer take out ten packets of substances which were later analysed to contain diamorphine.
On the evidence, it was clear that the prosecution had established a strong prima facie case against the appellant which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction of the appellant. Counsel for the appellant raised, in the main, the following argument to question the reliability of the prosecution`s evidence. Firstly, it was contended that the trial judge did not give sufficient weight to the fact that the appellant`s fingerprints were not found on either the ten packets of drugs or the red plastic bag in which the drugs were found. This was how the trial judge dealt with the point: 
 
It is well known that a person who handles objects need not necessarily leave a finger impression on the object as finger impressions left behind are dependent on many factors such as perspiration from the sweat glands of the hand, the presence of dirt on the fingers, whether the substance handled is soft, dusty, oily or greasy to give a few examples. Apart from these examples it may well be that an offender has taken precaution to avoid leaving fingerprints behind on the object/s he has handled. In this case the red plastic bags were flimsy and the 2nd Accused had mostly been handling the bags by the carrier handles.
 
 
 
We felt that the trial judge had dealt with this contention fairly and adequately.
Secondly, counsel for the appellant highlighted the fact that the round-neck T-shirt which the appellant was wearing at the material time and which was seized from him was of a greyish-greenish colour whereas Wan had described the person from whom he had taken the drugs as having worn a white T-shirt. The trial judge had made the following observation with respect to this issue: 
 
I observed the round-neck T-shirt in Court. It appeared to me to be light grey and I recorded my observation of the same. It was of a shade which I was satisfied could be mistaken for white depending on the type of lighting there was in the ground floor lobby of Blk 106. The colour therefore was a matter of perception only. The difference was not one of a totally different darker colour.
 
 
 
It is clear that the trial judge had given due consideration to the alleged discrepancy and we would agree with the way he viewed it.
Thirdly, the appellant`s counsel contended that the trial judge was in error in placing too much weight on Wan`s statements as certain parts of Wan`s statements were inherently incredible, in particular, the following portion: 
 
In 1989, I came to know one `Ah Chai` in RTC ... Two days before my arrest, about sometime midnight I received a call from Malaysia on my handphone. The caller said he is `Ah Chai` .. He then told me that he gave my handphone number to `Ah Seng` from Malaysia and that `Ah Seng` will call me ... About three hours later, my handphone rang and a male voice spoke in Hokkien said that he is `Ah Seng` ... he said he will pass me something and told me to pass these things to another `Ah Seng` in Singapore. I asked him what these things were, he said I should know. I believe these things were heroin because usually Malaysians say bringing things to Singapore, they meant heroin. I then said I do not know this Singapore `Ah Seng` asked him why he did not want to do it himself. He said he did not trust this Singapore `Ah Seng`. I then said since that `Ah Seng` is not to be trusted, why he still want me to do it. He said he had given the Singapore `Ah Seng` my handphone number and that the Singapore `Ah Seng` will call me. He then said he will give me some coffee money for doing the favour. He also said that he will get someone to pass me the money after I passed the thing to `Ah Seng`. He did not mention the amount, but I guess it will be at least a few thousands dollars. I then agreed to do it ...
 
 
 
Essentially, what counsel contended was hard to believe was that Wan was to have obtained drugs from someone whom he had never met or known before (a Malaysian `Ah Seng`) and to pass them to someone who was not to be trusted (a Singapore `Ah Seng`). Like the trial judge, we did not think this account was that incredible, bearing in mind that the drug trafficking network was highly secretive and impersonal - each person to know only what he needed to know. It was hardly surprising that drug traffickers, in order to minimise chances of detection, were constantly seeking new contacts to facilitate the movement of drugs. Furthermore, we did not think too much should be placed on the fact that Wan said he did not have the contact numbers of `Ah Chai` and the Malaysian `Ah Seng`. This could be because Wan did not want to further expose other parties in this drug trafficking network.
Another reason advanced to suggest that Wan`s statements should not be given too much weight was that Wan`s intention must have been to shield his girlfriend, Bee Lian and his friend, Chong. All we need say is that Wan did not identify the appellant as the person who passed him the red plastic bag. Wan took the responsibility himself. He did not specifically shift it to the appellant.
Fourthly, the appellant contended that the trial judge had failed to give sufficient consideration to the fact that the investigating officer did not do a very thorough search in the flat for the alleged clothes brought by the appellant to Wan. In our judgment, this contention was without merit. As Wan had said that he placed the red plastic bag he received into the `Marlboro` box it was only natural that the investigating officer would concentrate her attention there. Even then, she did conduct a search of the rest of the flat and found some other plastic bags which were flat and dusty, indicating that those bags had been lying around for some time already. We agreed with the trial judge that the search was sufficiently thorough.
We should add that there were also other contentions raised by the appellant`s counsel, such as (a) the trial judge`s erroneous application of the 
 Browne v Dunn 
 rule; (b) his conclusion on why the appellant drove by a long route from Woodlands to Redhill; (c) his view that the kind of clothes which the appellant allegedly brought to Wan need not be carried in a double-layered plastic bag. In our view, these were incidental issues, and even if they were valid, could not affect the prima facie case that had been made out against the appellant.
The test to be applied at the close of the prosecution`s case was laid down by the Privy Council in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 [1980-1981] SLR 73 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 . This test was succinctly summarised by LP Thean J (as he then was) in 
Tan Siew Chay v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
  at 38, in these terms: 
 
We assume (a) that the evidence on the primary facts is true, unless the evidence is inherently incredible, and (b) that there will be nothing to displace the inferences as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation. The application of limb (b) necessarily involves the court drawing inferences from the primary facts, and, in drawing such inferences, the court looks at the totality of the evidence and consider what inference, if any, that can reasonably be drawn therefrom. 
 But, in considering any inference to be drawn, the court at this stage does not apply the test whether the evidence looked at in its totality would inevitably and inexorably lead to only one inference or inferences for establishing the essential elements of the charge.
 [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
The last sentence in the above extract clearly had the test propounded in 
Ang Sunny v PP
 
 [1965-1968] SLR 67 
 
[1966] 2 MLJ 195
  in mind, where it was held that before circumstantial evidence could be used to secure an accused`s conviction, it must lead to the irresistible inference and conclusion that the accused committed the crime. But that test was only applicable at the close of the trial and not at the stage of 
 the close of the case for the prosecution 
. This was the important distinction drawn in 
 Tan Siew Chay 
, which was affirmed in 
PP v Oh Laye Koh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 385
 .
In the present case, to an extent, the evidence led by the prosecution against the appellant is circumstantial in nature as no CNB officer actually witnessed the passing of the red plastic bag by the appellant to Wan and Wan could not identify the person who left the bag on the floor at the ground floor landing of Block 106 and which bag he picked up and placed in the `Marlboro` box in the flat. The appellant contended that it could have been someone else who passed the drugs to Wan. The question as to what inference may reasonably be drawn from a given set of facts was addressed by LP Thean JA, in 
Tan Chuan Ten v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 348
 , as follows: 
 
A reasonable inference is one which, on looking at the totality of the evidence, one can say that there is a reasonable degree of probability, not just a mere possibility or a strong suspicion, that [the] fact which the court infers did occur. Such an inference does not have to be the only inference that the court can reasonably draw from the evidence. There may be another or other inferences which the court can reasonably draw and any one of them may be relied upon to establish a prima facie case.
 
 
 
Wan quite clearly stated that he received only one red plastic bag that day on the ground floor lift lobby of Block 106. There was no other transaction. The evidence of the CNB officers as to what they witnessed that day at Block 106 was consistent with that. By the operation of s 30 of the Evidence Act, the confessions of Wan could be used to incriminate his co-accused, the appellant: see 
Chin Seow Noi v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
 . In the light of Wan`s statements, as well as the statement of the appellant that he did pass a red plastic bag to Wan (albeit that he said it contained clothes), the inference which could reasonably be drawn was that the plastic bag which the appellant had given to Wan had, to his knowledge, contained the prohibited drugs. We, therefore, agreed with the trial judge that a prima facie case had been established that there was a common intention between the appellant and Wan to put the latter in possession of the said drugs. The appellant was rightly called upon to enter his defence.
 (3) THE APPELLANT`S EVIDENCE
In his testimony, the appellant re-stated the defence he indicated in his statements to the police, namely, that he travelled to Singapore to meet Wan for the purposes of finding out whether there were job opportunities here for him and his Malaysian friend `Ma Lau`. The red plastic bag which he had brought along and passed over to Wan contained only clothing and not drugs.
The appellant gave an account of how he and `Ma Lau` became good friends. The two of them had discussed the possibilities of finding work in Singapore. On 2 March 1999 `Ma Lau` told the appellant that there was a job available in Singapore. However, when asked whether he was sure, `Ma Lau` replied that he did not know and that the appellant should find out from `Ah Beng` in Singapore. `Ma Lau` then gave the appellant `Ah Beng`s` hand phone number and told him that he could find `Ah Beng` in Redhill, although an exact address was not given. The appellant initially expressed reluctance at having to spend S$30 at the Singapore Immigration/Customs just to drive the vehicle into Singapore. However, he was persuaded after `Ma Lau` told him that it would be better if he were to see `Ah Beng` personally and that if he managed to obtain a job then the expenses incurred would have been worth it. `Ma Lau` gave the keys to his car to the appellant to drive to Singapore.
In our judgment, the trial judge was amply justified to have found that he could not believe the appellant`s claim that he had come to Singapore to look for a job. Quite apart from the fact that the appellant said that he did not know the name of `Ma Lau` (consistent with the fact that he wished to protect `Ma Lau`) it made no sense for the appellant to drive all the way, plus incurring the expenses, when a phone call to Wan would have informed him whether there was any job opportunities in Singapore. He knew Wan`s telephone number. All the more incredible was the fact that according to the appellant when he met Wan at the ground floor of the lift landing of Block 106 he barely spoke for a couple of minutes with Wan. There was even no discussion of the sort of jobs the appellant wanted or the salary he expected.
Another factor which cast serious doubts on the defence that he came to Singapore to look for a job was that the appellant knew, from his many earlier visits to Singapore from January 1999 to 2 March 1999, that it was then difficult to find work in Singapore due to the downturn of the economy. Yet he did not tell `Ma Lau` of this when the latter asked him to go to Singapore, for which journey he would have to incur an expense of S$30, plus having to take a day off from work.
The trial judge also found the appellant`s assertion that the red plastic bag which he passed onto Wan contained only clothes, namely, a few T-shirts, a pair of jeans and shorts and pants just in case Wan had a job here waiting for the appellant, to be a sham. Curiously, according to the appellant, the clothes, especially the jeans and shorts could only fit `Ma Lau` though the appellant could wear the T-shirts. Why the need to bring the clothes when no job was yet secured? Why should `Ma Lau`s` clothes be in the plastic bag when he was not even here to take up any job? The appellant would have to return to Johore Bahru to return the car to `Ma Lau` the same day. The appellant would have to come to Singapore again if he wished to take up any job offer (assuming one was available) and that would have been the proper time to bring the clothes. It was of significance to note that the investigating officer did not find any clothes in the flat which corresponded with the description given by him. A red plastic bag of clothes were found in the `Marlboro box`, but they were ladies` dresses and two pyjamas.
Again, the appellant could not satisfactorily explain why he left the bag of clothes with Wan, a person with whom the appellant was not even familiar with and had never met before. He got himself entangled in a bundle of contradictions to explain about the alleged clothes. In his first oral statement, he said that he met Wan to pass him some clothing which `Ma Lau` had asked him to give to Wan. This was later contradicted by the appellant`s own testimony when he said that he just decided to bring the clothes along and it was not for any particular reason. On further questioning, the appellant said that `Ma Lau` had told him to leave the bag of clothes with Wan only if a job was confirmed. `Ma Lau` did not give any instructions on what the appellant should do if no job was confirmed. Asked what he was going to do if there were no job openings, the appellant said that he would just have to bring back the bag of clothing. However, for some inexplicable reason, the appellant then decided to leave the clothes with Wan when such was neither `Ma Lau`s` instructions nor his own initial intention.
It seemed to us clear that the trial judge had taken pains to scrutinise the statements of Wan to ensure that there were no reasons for Wan to want to conceal or misrepresent facts, since those statements were not subject to cross-examination. He said: 
 
I was aware of the dangers of accepting his statements in so far as they might affect the 2nd Accused but was satisfied there were none. I could find no ill motive or any intention to do so. Indeed none had been canvassed before me by Counsel for the 2nd Accused and even to a direct question from the Court to the 2nd Accused as to whether the 1st Accused had any previous problems with him, the 2nd Accused had only replied, `I don`t know why he said that!`
 
 
 
He was satisfied as to the truth of Wan`s statement.
 Judgment 
 
 
 
We entirely agreed with the trial judge that the defence should be rejected. It was cooked up by the appellant to explain what was in the red plastic bag he was seen taking out of the boot of the car. The account of the events given by Wan was similar to that of the appellant, but for the fact that the appellant claimed that what he handed to Wan in the red plastic bag were clothes and not drugs. With the rejection of the defence, and in the light of the other evidence, the irresistible conclusion had to be that the appellant passed the plastic bag of drugs to Wan under a pre-arranged plan. With Wan having been proved to be in possession of the drugs, he was by s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (`MDA`) deemed to be in possession of them for the purposes of drug trafficking and by virtue of s 5(2) of the MDA, Wan had committed the offence of trafficking in drugs. As the appellant had put Wan in possession of the drugs in furtherance of a common intention, then by virtue of s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), both were liable for the criminal act of possession for the purposes of trafficking. A case where the fact-situation was similar to the present is

: The appellant, Silvalingam Sinnasamy (`Mr Sinnasamy`), pleaded guilty in the district court to two charges: a charge under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1997 Ed) (`RTA`) and a charge under s 65 of the RTA. He appealed against the sentence imposed by District Judge Christopher Goh in respect of the charge under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA.
 The facts 
 
 
 
Prior to his conviction under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA, Mr Sinnasamy had been convicted on 25 February 1987 of an offence under the former s 68(1) of the RTA (Cap 92, 1970 Ed), which reads: 
 
Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of drink or of a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle, shall be guilty of an offence ...
 
 
 
Section 67(1)(b) of the RTA, under which Mr Sinnasamy is now convicted, was enacted in 1996. Section 67(1) reads: 
 
Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place -
 
 
 
 
(a) is unfit to drive in that he is under the influence of drink or of a drug or an intoxicating substance to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle; 
 or 
 
 
(b) has so much alcohol in his body that the proportion of it in his breath or blood exceeds the prescribed limit,
  
 
 
shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and, 
 in the case of a second or subsequent conviction
, to a fine of not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
The main question in the appeal was this: having been convicted on 25 February 1987 under the former s 68(1) of the RTA, was Mr Sinnasamy a second time offender for the purpose of sentencing under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA?
 Decision of the judge 
 
 
 
The judge was of the view that the main aim of s 67(1)(b) of the RTA is to target drivers who drink and drive, and that the amendments were introduced to assist the prosecution, by doing away with the need to prove that the driver is incapable of controlling his vehicle when his blood alcohol concentration level exceeds the statutorily prescribed limit. In his opinion, it was clearly the intention of Parliament that such offenders should be treated as second time offenders and accordingly be made subject to the enhanced punishment prescribed in s 67(1) of the RTA.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Mr Selva K Naidu, who appeared on behalf of Mr Sinnasamy, submitted that the judge was wrong in holding that Mr Sinnasamy should be treated as a second time offender under s 67(1) of the RTA. The thrust of his submission was that the former s 68(1) and the current s 67(1)(b) create distinct offences. Under the former s 68(1), the key element of the offence was `driving under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle`. Under s 67(1)(b), the key element is now having `so much alcohol in his body that the proportion of it in his breath or blood exceeds the prescribed limit`.
Mr Naidu went on to submit that, since they are distinct offences, if Parliament had intended for a previous conviction under the former s 68(1) to be treated as a conviction under s 67(1)(b), it would have done so by way of a deeming provision, such as with s 68(4) of the RTA. This section provides: 
 
Where a person convicted of an offence under this section has been previously convicted of an offence under section 67, he shall be treated for the purpose of this section as having been previously convicted under this section.
 
 
 
The need for a deeming provision in s 68(4) is understandable, since ss 67 and 68 are clearly distinct offences. Section 67 covers persons who are driving while under the influence of drink, while s 68 covers persons who are 
 not driving 
, but are nevertheless in charge of a motor vehicle when under the influence of drink.
According to Mr Naidu, the former s 68 is clearly distinct from s 67(1)(b), because the former s 68 has been re-enacted as s 67(1)(a). The language of the present s 67(1)(a) is almost the same as that of the former s 68. The key element in both the former s 68 and the present s 67(1)(a), is that of driving while under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle. In contrast, s 67(1)(b) makes it an offence to have alcohol in the body beyond statutorily prescribed limits, regardless of whether the driver has proper control of the vehicle.
However, even if Mr Naidu is right, there is still no basis for saying that Mr Sinnasamy should not have been treated as a second time offender under s 67(1). This is because s 67(1) does not draw a distinction between s 67(1)(a) and (b) for the purposes of enhanced penalties for second time offenders. A person is guilty of an offence under s 67(1) if he either drives while in an intoxicated state and does not have proper control of the vehicle (s 67(1)(a)), 
 or 
, if he drives while he has so much alcohol in his body that the proportion of it in his breath or blood exceeds the prescribed limit (s 67(1)(b)). Either way, he is guilty of the offence of `driving while under the influence of drink` under s 67(1) and liable to the sentences prescribed there. Thus, if he had first been convicted under s 67(1)(a), which Mr Naidu concedes is a re-enactment of the former s 68, that would count as a first conviction under s 67(1). If he was subsequently convicted under s 67(1)(b), that would, on the language of the provision, be that person`s second conviction under s 67(1), and the enhanced penalties for second time offenders would follow.
Notably, both s 67(1)(a) and (b) come under the same section heading, `Driving while under influence of drink or drugs`. Both of them seek to discourage the same mischief, driving while in an intoxicated state, and Parliament has made it clear from the language of s 67(1) that, regardless of whether the first conviction comes under s 67(1)(a) or s 67(1)(b), if someone decides time and again to drive while in an intoxicated state, he will have to suffer the enhanced penalties.
Mr Naidu also submitted that the sentence imposed by the judge was manifestly excessive. Mr Sinnasamy was in the process of reversing his car into a parking lot when he hit the front bumper of another car. There was some slight damage to the bumper, but nothing substantial. In addition, his previous conviction occurred ten years ago. On the other hand, Mr Sinnasamy was found to have 272mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, way above the prescribed limit of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.
The judge imposed a sentence of five weeks` imprisonment, a fine of $7,000, and disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of six years. In 
PP v Lee Soon Lee Vincent
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 552
 , the respondent, upon a second conviction under s 67(1) of the RTA, was sentenced to two weeks` imprisonment, fined $6,000 and disqualified for four years. In that case, however, the respondent`s breath alcohol level was over the limit by only 3mg per 100ml of breath. In this case, Mr Sinnasamy`s blood alcohol level was over the limit by 192mg per 100ml of blood. He exceeded the statutory limit by almost 3[half ] times. I have said before in 
Ong Beng Soon v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 731
  at 733, that `A person substantially over the limit is obviously in more flagrant violation of the Act than a person marginally over the limit.` The sentence imposed by the district judge was not manifestly excessive and was in fact fully justified.

Whether sentence of eight years' preventive detention manifestly excessive
 
: This was an appeal on sentence only.
The appellant claimed trial in the court below to a charge of theft under s 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and one of fraudulent possession of a car key under s 35(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Ed). He was acquitted of the latter charge but convicted of the former and sentenced to eight years` preventive detention. At the end of the hearing before me, I dismissed his appeal against sentence and now give my reasons.
 Brief facts 
 
 
 
In the early morning of 10 April 2000, patrolling police officers Sgt Muhammad Fazli bin Ismail and Cpl Ow Gim Peng received a message that a male Chinese had been spotted opening vehicle doors in the car park of Block 106 Aljunied Crescent. The two policemen responded promptly to the message and headed for the scene immediately.
Upon arrival, the officers found the appellant standing next to the opened front passenger door of a white-coloured van. They approached the appellant and asked him if he owned the van or otherwise worked for the company which owned it. The appellant replied in the negative to both questions. The officers then searched the appellant and found some coins and notes on him, which moneys he told the officers were his. He was also found to be holding a vehicle key.
Subsequently, the owner of the van was contacted and arrived at the scene. Upon inspecting the inside of the van, the owner told the police officers that some coins which he had placed in a compartment below the radio were missing. When shown the coins found on the appellant, the owner of the van identified a one-dollar coin and a ten-cent coin as belonging to him. The appellant was subsequently arrested and charged for theft of a sum of $1.10 for which he was convicted in the court below and sentenced to eight years` preventive detention.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Before me, counsel for the appellant submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive for a loot of only $1.10 and contended that the district judge had erred in failing to adequately consider the fact that the appellant suffered from depressive illness and personality disorder, and had spent a large part of his life in a mental institution. Counsel urged that because of this, his client could not be considered an incorrigible criminal. Moreover, the appellant`s antecedents, although acknowledged to run into a long list, nevertheless comprised mainly drug-related offences which did not involve any element of dishonesty or violence.
With respect, I could not agree with counsel that the sentence was manifestly excessive. As the prosecution rightly pointed out, the appellant`s criminal record spoke volumes about the type of man that the court was dealing with. The appellant was clearly deeply entrenched in the criminal way of life, having started out on his life of crime from as early as when he was 16 years old. Now 44 years of age and an alarming 28 years of a career in crime later, the appellant had successfully garnered an extensive series of convictions to his credit. His colourful array of previous convictions included that for possession of offensive weapons, robbery with hurt, voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant to deter him from discharging his duty, illegal gaming, affray, theft, and possession and consumption of controlled drugs. It was not correct therefore to say that the appellant`s earlier offences did not involve any element of dishonesty or violence. In any event, I was of the view that the proper approach was to consider the totality of the appellant`s previous convictions and there was no need in this case to separate the drug offences from the other offences. It was clear to me from a perusal of the appellant`s entire history of antecedents that he was a man who had a strong inclination and propensity towards criminal activity. That this was the case can be gleaned from the fact that he had been sentenced to a total of at least 15 years` imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane before committing the offence in the present case. In addition, he had also been in and out of drug rehabilitation centres and was otherwise placed repeatedly under drug supervision for his substance abuse problems. Despite all this, the appellant plainly failed to learn his lesson and remained unrepentant. He continued to re-offend time after time, demonstrating a clear disregard for authority and the law, and even possessed the audacity to commit the most recent offence barely one and a half years after being last released from prison for a previous conviction for a similar offence of theft. Obviously, the appellant had proven himself to be a recalcitrant criminal who has hitherto been incapable of mending his ways, despite having chalked up some 15 previous convictions. In the result, I had no doubt that the appellant was a most suitable candidate for preventive detention.
In 
PP v Perumal s/o Suppiah
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 308
 , I held that the test for determining if preventive detention ought to be imposed is whether the offender had proved by his history of criminal behaviour to be a menace to society which necessitated his incarceration for a substantial period of time. In this regard, the paramount consideration for the court is the protection and safety of the public and the community at large. In my view, there is no rule of law which states that protection of the public necessarily refers to protecting them only from physical bodily harm. Offences against property, such as theft, and that against the peace, such as affray, or that against society in general, such as the consumption and possession of drugs, are all equally offensive to the community who deserves to be well protected from the repeat perpetrators of such crimes. As such, the imposition of preventive detention ought not to be restricted only to persons with a history of violent behaviour as exhibited through the commission of violent crimes. Instead, the real test is whether or not the degree of propensity towards any type of criminal activity at all is such that the offender ought to be taken out of circulation altogether in order that he be not afforded even the slightest opportunity to give sway to his criminal tendencies again. In my view, that threshold was clearly more than amply met in the present case.
In the recent case of 
Soong Hee Sin v PP
 
 
[2001] 2 SLR 253
 , I made the comment that a recalcitrant offender who repeatedly commits the same offence over and over again in spite of his numerous previous convictions should be sentenced to the maximum punishment prescribed by law even if the amounts or items stolen on each occasion were minuscule. Indeed, it would be difficult to find another statement which applies more aptly to the case at hand. Here, it must be remembered that it was not the isolated act of pilfering a meagre sum of $1.10, which taken on its own may appear trivial or even petty, which warranted the severe punishment. Rather, it was that act, seen together with and in the larger context of the appellant`s earlier criminal history which necessitated a protracted term of incarceration. That the amount involved here was minuscule ought not therefore detract from the crux of the matter, which was that the appellant was without doubt an undeterred habitual offender and incorrigible recidivist.
Finally, with regard to the appellant`s alleged history of mental illness, I found that to be of no avail to the defence whatsoever. If anything, it fortified the view that the best option in the circumstances was to keep the appellant in prison for a longer period of time, where he could then be given proper and sustained treatment for his condition. It appeared after all that any previous attempts on his part to obtain treatment of his own volition had obviously not been met with any significant amount of success, given that he had continued to revert to his unlawful ways unendingly. In any case, I was of the view that the fact of his mental condition was irrelevant in determining the appropriate sentence to be given out in the present case, since the appellant had not in his defence pleaded insanity or otherwise sought to deny or disprove mens rea for the offence in question.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the above reasons, I was not persuaded that the sentence of eight years` preventive detention imposed by the district judge ought to be disturbed. In reaching my decision, I also considered the pre-sentencing report submitted by the prosecution, in which it was unequivocally recommended that the appellant was mentally and physically suitable for a sentence of preventive detention. It was further stated in the report that the appellant tended to downplay the seriousness of his conduct and appeared to exhibit a lack of insight into his offending behaviour. In my opinion, this was a clear demonstration of the lack of remorse on the appellant`s part, and reinforced my view that the only appropriate sentence for one so irreversibly accustomed to a life of crime was a term of preventive detention. In the result, I dismissed the appeal accordingly.

: The appellant was convicted in the district court by Khoo Oon Soo DJ on the following charge of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224): 
 
You, Christine Lewis, are charged that you, on or about the 24th day of April 2000, on or about 8.10 pm, at the Seiyu Departmental Store at Parkway Parade Shopping Centre, Singapore, did cheat one Wong Fei Hsia, the cashier of Seiyu Departmental Store by deceiving her to believe that the price of a ""Pochacco"" pencil casing is worth $5.25, when in actual fact, you knew that the price of the said item is worth $16.95, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Wong Fei Hsia to deliver to you the said item for only $5.25 which she would not have done, had she not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 
 
 
The appellant was sentenced to four months` imprisonment. She appealed against her conviction and the sentence imposed. I dismissed both appeals. I now give my reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
This was a classic case of `shoplifting` by means of switching price tags. The appellant was shopping at the toys section in Seiyu Department Store at about 8pm on 24 April 2000. She took a fancy to a `Pochacco` pencil casing and proceeded to remove its $16.95 price tag, replacing it with a $5.25 price tag taken from a nearby coin purse. Subsequently, she tendered the pencil casing to the cashier, Ms Wong Fei Hsia (`Wong`) and paid $5.25 for its purchase.
Unfortunately for the appellant, her act of switching price tags was observed by a sales promoter, Ms Ong Bee Lian (`Ong`). After the appellant left the section, Ong`s suspicions were confirmed when she found below the stationery shelf a crumpled $16.95 price tag (`P3`) and the plastic ring (`P4`) which attached it to the pencil casing. Ong promptly reported the matter to the security supervisor, Mr Paul A/L Devasarayan (`Paul`), who, together with a female security officer, Ms Susan Low Siew Meng (`Susan`), arrested the appellant and recovered the pencil casing.
The appellant was brought to the department store office where she was confronted with the alleged offence by Paul. Initially, she denied the offence and refused to give her personal particulars. Paul then told her that, if she refused to co-operate, he would ascertain the truth by checking the close circuit camera system. The appellant changed her tune and confessed to the switching of price tags, offering to pay the difference in price.
What followed was the high point of the drama. About a half hour into the interview, the appellant asked to go to the toilet. She was escorted by Susan and followed by three other officers. However, at the lift lobby, she suddenly turned and jumped down to a loading bay about one metre below. Susan managed to apprehend her, but released her when the appellant protested against her restraint, upon which the appellant promptly ran off a second time. Susan gave chase and caught hold of her some 40m away at the main road, where the appellant had fallen in the midst of her escapade.
The appellant was brought back to the office thereafter. In view of her behaviour, Paul made the decision to call the police. She was subsequently escorted by police officers and some members of the security staff to the police station.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The appellant flatly denied the act of the switching of price tags as well as knowledge of the original price of the pencil casing. Her version of events was as follows.
At the onset, she was merely testing the zippers on the pencil casing when they became detached. Because of this, she had to fiddle with the pencil casing in order to re-attach them. As far as she was concerned, the $5.25 price tag was on the pencil casing when she handled it and she had no reason to believe it was priced otherwise. When arrested and brought to the office, she felt indignant and refused to furnish her particulars as she felt Paul had no right to them. She further denied having made a confession, and explained that her offer to settle the difference in price was motivated by her concern to return home and prepare dinner for her daughter.
Her description of the escape was almost genteel. She claimed to have informed Paul that she was leaving, whereupon she struggled free from Susan and walked quickly to the steps leading to the loading bay. There, Paul blocked her way and even pushed her down onto the pavement. The appellant explained that her desire to leave was motivated by her anger at the way she was being treated. In particular, she alleged that Susan had shouted at her and twisted her arm behind her back throughout the entire interview. She further claimed that Susan continued to twist her arm until her arrival at the police station.
 Decision of the trial judge 
 
 
 
The trial judge found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and convicted the appellant.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
This appeal was a multi-faceted attempt to chip away at every possible discrepancy in the prosecution`s case. For the sake of brevity I would summarise its main arguments as follows: 
(1) the real evidence tendered by the prosecution was insufficient; 
(2) the prosecution witnesses gave inconsistent and untruthful testimony, presumably in an effort to frame the appellant; and 
(3) the conduct of the accused subsequent to the arrest was not probative of guilt.
 Real evidence 
 
 
 
The appellant argued that the prosecution`s case was weakened by its failure to produce two items of real evidence.
First, the appellant took issue with the non-production of the coin purse from which the $5.25 price tag was taken. This was, however, a minor quibble. While the coin purse provided the opportunity for the offence and was therefore technically relevant under s 7 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed), it shed little light on the fact in issue. The question of whether the appellant had switched the price tags was not answered by proving that the $5.25 price tag came from a particular item as opposed to some other source. It must be borne in mind that the prosecution does not bear the burden of adducing every possible relevant fact. The prosecutor`s task is to bring sufficient evidence to bear in order to prove the essential ingredients of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, not to adduce every preparatory fact constituting the background of the offence. Where the prosecutor is confident of proving the act of switching price tags with direct evidence, the exact source of the tools of deception is rendered inconsequential.
The second contention of the appellant centred on the ubiquitous plastic ring (P4) which linked the price tag to the pencil casing, described analogously by witnesses as a `bean sprout`. The appellant argued that the prosecution`s case required the adduction of two broken plastic rings, one linking the $5.25 price tag to the coin purse, and the other linking the $16.95 price tag to the pencil casing. As such, the appellant contended that the unbroken plastic ring (P4) tendered by the prosecution was insufficient to prove its case.
This was pure speculation and did not in my view carry the appellant very far. The prosecution`s account that there was only one unbroken plastic ring was explicable, considering that the plastic ring could be re-opened if not locked properly. This was the evidence of Ms Looi Sheau Chian, an employee of Rubber Band Pte Ltd which supplied the rings. It was also supported empirically by Ong, who demonstrated on stand that the plastic ring could be pulled apart and refixed. The appellant could have very well opened up the ring, removed the $16.95 price tag, discarded both the ring and the original price tag, and then affixed the $5.25 price tag from the coin purse onto the metal chain of the pencil casing. This was consistent with the fact that only one plastic ring was recovered. Whether this ring was closed when discarded by the appellant or only subsequently to its discovery did not impact on its authenticity.
 Prosecution witnesses 
 
 
 
The appellant also took issue with the testimonies of four prosecution witnesses.
Ong, as the key eyewitness to the actus reus of the deception, took centrestage in the appellant`s case. Fortunately for the appellant, Ong had by all accounts been a flawed prosecution witness. She claimed that she could perceive exact price figures at a range of about 12ft when it was patently obvious that she could not. She had also had a prior encounter with the appellant, who had rebuked her over her sales service. This potentially cast doubt on her objectivity on the stand.
However, a flawed witness does not equate to an untruthful witness. The trial judge is entitled to determine which part of the witness`s testimony remains credible despite its discrepancies. In 
Ramli bin Daud v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 225
 , the conviction of the appellant for employing and harbouring illegal immigrants hinged on the testimony of one Richard Yap, his agent in the entire affair. Naturally, the bulk of the appeal, as in the present case, centred on highlighting numerous discrepancies in the testimony of this key witness. In rejecting that appeal, my reasoning was as follows (at p 230): 
 
In any event, there was no indication that the district judge had permitted himself to be unduly influenced or misled by these discrepancies. The district judge had taken care to note that there were some major inconsistencies in Richard Yap`s evidence ... Nonetheless, he accepted Richard Yap`s evidence on the key facts in issue ... In any case, it is settled law that the testimony of a witness need not be wholly rejected merely because he is shown to have lied on certain aspects of his evidence.
 
 
 
This was also the sentiment of Thomson CJ in 
Khoon Chye Hin v PP
 
 
[1961] MLJ 105
  at 107, where he said: 
 
If a witness demonstrably tells lies on one or two points then it is clear that he is not a reliable witness and as a matter of prudence the rest of his evidence must be scrutinised with great care and indeed with suspicion. To say, however, that because a witness has been proved a liar on one or two points then the whole of his evidence ""must in law be rejected"" is to go too far and is wrong.
 
 
 
Accordingly, I agreed with the trial judge that the inaccuracy of Ong`s perception merely showed an over-zealous rather than an untruthful witness. Her discrepancies therefore only qualified her claim that she could see the exact figures on the price tag. There was no reason to doubt that from her vantage point, Ong could and did indeed observe the appellant in the crucial act of exchanging price tags. Her subsequent discovery of the crumpled $16.95 price tag further supported her initial observation.
As regards the previous encounter between the appellant and Ong, it should be borne in mind that the alleged motive for lying must be juxtaposed against the magnitude of the lie. It is quite absurd that an employee would, for a mere customer complaint which went no further, seek to entrap the customer with planted evidence and conspire with colleagues to commit mass perjury in court. I accordingly found that the previous incident between the appellant and Ong had no impact on the weight of the latter`s testimony.
The appellant next contended for a litany of reasons that Paul`s evidence was not to be believed. Among these arguments, only one needs further examination. The appellant claimed that Paul lied about the appellant`s confession as there was no written record of it before the court. This argument could have been simply dispensed with by noting that the trial judge had not based his conviction on the confession. However, for the sake of clarification, I would go further and make two observations. The first is the impact of writing on admissibility of a confession. It is trite law that confessions need not be written to be admissible. There is no requirement of writing specified under the admissibility provisions relating to confessions under s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) or s 21 of the Evidence Act read with ss 24-26. In fact, s 122(5) specifically allows admission of a confession `whether it ... is oral or in writing`. The issue of writing only has some relevance to admissibility when an accused person claims in a voir dire or in submissions that the statement was not made by him at all. As the appellant did not challenge the admissibility of the confession at trial, the contention in this appeal must relate to the secondary consideration, which is the weight to be attached to the verbal confession. In considering whether a confession is of sufficient weight to found a conviction, regard must be had to a totality of factors - including the spontaneity of the confession, the wording of the questions and answers, the relative relationship between the confessor and the accuser, and the circumstances of the entire transaction. Whether a confession is recorded in writing, or even affirmed by signature for that matter, is simply a factor to be taken into consideration in assessing its probative value. Of course, where the police are concerned, failure to record a statement in accordance with s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code may have greater impact on the weight of the confession (see 
PP v Vasavan Sathiadew
 
 
[1989] SLR 944
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 151
 ). But outside of the police station, the failure to record a statement in writing must be assessed in the context of the circumstances. Notably, even silence in the face of accusations by an equal have been held to be sufficient to found a conviction (see, for example, 
Parkes v R
 
[1976] 3 All ER 380
[1976] 1 WLR 1251
, 
Tan Khee Koon v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 724
 ).
In this case, the trial judge had displayed judicious caution in not relying in his grounds on the confession. However, had he considered otherwise I would have had little doubt that the verbal nature of the confession made no impact on its weight in the light of the preliminary nature of that interview. One cannot expect security personnel to be conversant with and employ police procedures when questioning a suspect. Accordingly, I was of the view that the confession, if relied upon, would have been strongly probative of the appellant`s guilt, notwithstanding that it was subsequently retracted on the stand (see 
Ismail bin UK Abdul Rahman v PP
 
 [1972-1974] SLR 232 
 
[1974] 2 MLJ 180
 , 
Panya Martmontree v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
 ). This point of appeal therefore carried little merit.
The appellant further sought to cast aspersions on the testimony of a male security officer, Hoh Ah Nyong (`Hoh`). Hoh was not listed as a prosecution witness and the defence initially made much ado about Hoh`s role during the cross-examination of Susan and Paul. The defence then made an eleventh hour application to summon Hoh, which the prosecution gamely acceded to by calling Hoh as its witness. Hoh`s testimony, however, turned out to be anti-climactic. He had only played a minimal role throughout the entire episode, which pertained to observing the initial detention and witnessing the escape attempt. He was never present in the office while the appellant was inside. The trial judge was thus justifiably irked that much time and resources had been spent on procuring Hoh`s testimony.
Undaunted, counsel for the appellant maintained on appeal that Hoh was actively involved in the detention proceedings, and that Susan, Paul and Hoh were collectively lying to minimise the latter`s role and involvement in this case. I found this a bare and unsubstantiated assertion, unsupported by any possible motive on Hoh`s part to evade testifying on the stand. Even if the appellant was correct and Hoh was present throughout the detention proceedings, nothing material hinged on his testimony. It should be noted that, with regard to the crucial incident of the appellant`s attempted escape, Hoh`s testimony was in accordance with that of the other prosecution witnesses. This point of appeal was therefore an exercise in futility.
Finally, the appellant argued that insufficient weight had been placed on the evidence of the cashier, Wong, who said that there was nothing unusual about the pencil casing when she keyed in the transaction. The rationale behind this submission appeared to be the implication that the pencil casing was not doctored by the appellant. This, however, bordered on the frivolous. If anything, the innocuous nature of a fake attests to the cunning craftsmanship of the forger. The fact that the cashier took no special notice of the transaction in no way disproved the appellant`s act of switching the price tags.
 Conduct subsequent of the accused 
 
 
 
To my mind, the crux of this case lay in the conduct of the accused subsequent to her arrest by Susan and Paul. Her behaviour was glaringly inconsistent with that of an innocent person wrongly accused of a crime she did not commit. Her actions were of course clearly relevant under s 8(2) of the Evidence Act. They also found elucidation in illustrations (f), (h) and (i) to that section.
I was minded that conduct subsequent to the offence, without more, is not conclusive of prior guilt. This cautionary approach was highlighted by Raja Azlan Shah J in 
Chandrasekaran v PP
 
 
[1971] 1 MLJ 153
 , where, at 160-161, he said: 
 
In a criminal case the conduct of an accused person is relevant against him under s 8 of the Evidence Ordinance. Therefore where the accused volunteered a statement presenting facts in a light favourable to himself, such conduct is relevant and can be held to be incriminatory only where it is open to no other reasonable explanation but of guilt. Of course, this category of conduct is not conclusive. It does not necessarily follow therefrom that he is guilty, any more than that an accused person making a false statement to enhance his appearance of innocence thereby necessarily provides proof of his guilt. It is only evidence which must, like all other evidence, be considered by the tribunal on a question of fact.
 
 
 
In 
 Chandrasekaran 
`s case, the appellant was charged with corruption for conspiring to defraud the government by the forging of vouchers. He had volunteered a statement to explain that various items of expenditure came from turf club winnings, in order to rebut the allegation of corruption. Such conduct was clearly not conclusive, as the act of volunteering exculpatory information could very well have been consistent with several explanations - one of which could have been that the witness was merely over-zealous in trying to prove his innocence.
There are, however, certain types of subsequent conduct which do not afford easy explanation. In this case, the appellant was unwilling to expedite proceedings by furnishing her particulars to Paul, purportedly because she felt he had no right to make such a request. This did not accord with the profile of an innocent person eager to resolve a misunderstanding and be on her way. The provision of particulars would not have prejudiced her in any way and in any case would have been a foregone conclusion, if the police were called in. I was at this point reminded of Bentham`s oft-quoted phrase, `innocence claims the right of speaking as guilt invokes the privilege of silence`. The appellant`s lack of co-operation indicated a guilty person hoping to withhold her identity until she could find a means of escape.
Indeed, the appellant`s attempts to escape constituted the proverbial nail in the coffin of her conviction. Absconding from detention where there is no apparent reason to do so attracts a strong inference of guilt. In this case, the appellant`s explanations for her escape were quite incredible. She alleged ill-treatment by Susan, whom she claimed shouted at her and twisted her arm behind her back. These allegations were completely unsubstantiated. Quite apart from the consistent testimony of the security personnel, it was unlikely that Susan would have restrained the appellant by twisting her arm in the office. There was no demonstrable need to do so as the office door was locked and there were several security personnel and staff in the office. It was all the more unlikely that Susan continued twisting her arm after the arrival of the police officers and even during the trip to the police station. The fact that the appellant did not lodge formal complaints against the security officers, even though the police advised her that she could do so, further diluted the weight of her allegations. For these reasons, I have regarded her complaints of ill-treatment with a liberal pinch of salt. As I could find no other explanation for the appellant`s escape and her lack of co-operation, I accordingly came to the conclusion that her subsequent conduct raised a strong inference as to her guilt.
Quite apart from this inference, the escape attempt itself served to corroborate the allegations of the key eyewitness, Ong. This proposition draws strength from the case of 
Dowse v A-G, Federation of Malaya
 
 
[1961] MLJ 249
 . In that case, the appellant`s wife alleged that the appellant had committed adultery with one Miss Tan, which the appellant vehemently denied. Lord Radcliffe, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, held that the appellant`s agreement to have Miss Tan examined for pregnancy was independent evidence capable of corroborating his wife`s allegation of the affair. In the present case, where the appellant`s account was diametrically opposed to that of Ong, her attempts to escape from detention provided independent evidence which corroborated Ong`s allegations.
It was therefore quite clear in my mind that this appeal failed to raise good reasons that would justify a departure from the findings of the lower court (see my comments in 
Soh Yang Tick v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 42
 , and the views of FA Chua J in 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
  at 713-719). Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal against conviction.
 Appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
The appellant is 50 years old, and is a part-time teacher and church counsellor. She is a first-time offender and the potential profit from her deception amounted to a small sum of $11.70.
There were, however, certain aggravating factors in this case which called for an imprisonment term of substantial duration.
Firstly, the appellant was charged under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) which is intended to create a more serious offence of cheating as compared to the general offence under s 415 (see 
Chua Kian Kok v PP
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 542
 ). Although there is an overlap between the two offences, s 420 is narrower in scope and specifies a maximum period of imprisonment of up to seven years, as opposed to one year under s 415 read with s 417. Section 420 is therefore reserved for serious cheating cases only (see 
R v Nadaison
 
 
[1933] MLJ 41
 ). It follows that an offender charged under s 420 must be dealt with more harshly than one charged under s 415.
Secondly, the appellant had demonstrated no remorse in the conduct of her defence. She had made numerous unfounded allegations, including ill-treatment by Susan, conspiracy between Ong and the other security officers, and lies by Susan, Paul and Hoh to minimise the latter`s role in the whole affair. The thrust of her defence was that the sales and security staff of Seiyu somehow orchestrated a symphony of fabrications to frame her, for no explicable reason other than her previous incident with Ong. While accused persons are free to prove their innocence, it must be made clear that this does not translate to a liberty to blatantly besmirch the repute of prosecution witnesses behind the shield of privilege in judicial proceedings.
Thirdly, the appellant`s thwarted escape showed her complete contempt for authority. The message must be brought home to offenders that it does not pay to abscond - and accordingly those who attempt to do so must be dealt with more harshly when proven guilty and convicted.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the reasons given above, the appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed.

: Wong Sin Yee (`Mr Wong`), who is an advocate and solicitor, was convicted by District Judge Foo Chee Hock on 31 January 2001 on the following two charges: 
 
First charge:
 
 
 
You, Wong Sin Yee, Male 41 years, NRIC No S1328846A, are charged that you, on the 26th day of December 1998, at or about 7.30 pm, along South Bridge Road, Singapore, which is a public place, with intent to cause alarm to Chou Siew Kee, did use insulting words towards the said Chou Siew Kee, to wit, by shouting, `why called your father, call Lee Kuan Yew or the F...ing Police` thereby causing alarm to the said Chou Siew Kee, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 13A(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Amended Act, 1996, Edition, Chapter 184.
 
 
 
Second charge:
 
 
 
You, Wong Sin Yee, Male, NRIC No S1328846A are charged that you on the 26th day of December 1998, at or about 7.30 pm, along South Bridge Road, Singapore did voluntarily cause hurt to one Mok Gok Keong, M/30 yrs, by hitting him on his mouth using your handphone, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 
 
 
 
 
 The facts 
 
 
 
 
 
On 26 December 1998, Mr Mok Gok Keong (`Mr Mok`) was driving his car along North Bridge Road with his wife, Ms Chou Siew Kee (`Ms Chou`), when Mr Wong tried to cut into his lane. Mr Mok sounded his horn in warning as the traffic in his lane was very heavy. Mr Wong nevertheless squeezed into Mr Mok`s lane. When Mr Wong`s car was just in front of Mr Mok`s car, he braked suddenly. Mr Mok`s car also came to a sudden stop.
Both drivers alighted from their cars. Mr Wong went up to Mr Mok and asked him why he had hit his vehicle. Mr Mok observed that there was still a gap between the vehicles and no damage to either car. As their cars were obstructing the traffic, they returned to their cars, drove them to the side of the road, and continued their argument along the five-foot way.
Mr Wong said he would call the police since Mr Mok refused to compensate him. He used his hand phone, then said that the police would not come since no one was injured. Mr Mok asked his wife to call her father to see what could be done. When Ms Chou used her hand phone, Mr Wong rushed forward, waving his hand phone in his left hand, and scolded Ms Chou loudly, using the words stated in the first charge.
In fear that Mr Wong would harm his wife, Mr Mok told her to return to the car. As Mr Mok did not wish to speak to Mr Wong, he turned around. Suddenly, he felt his hair being pulled by Mr Wong, who used the hand phone in his left hand to hit Mr Mok on the mouth. Mr Wong then released Mr Mok and pushed him away. He clenched both his fists and challenged Mr Mok to a fight. Ms Chou demanded that Mr Wong hand over his identity card but he refused. Both parties parted. Mr Mok and Ms Chou went to the Central Police Station to make a police report. Mr Mok was referred to the Singapore General Hospital for a medical examination. The medical report showed that he suffered a 1cm haematoma and superficial abrasion on his right inner lower lip.
On 2 May 2000, Mr Wong gave Mr Mok $1,000 as compensation in an attempt to settle the matter. The two charges were brought against Mr Wong on 21 June 2000. The trial was heard before the judge from 23 to 24 October 2000 and 29 to 31 January 2001.
 Decision of the judge 
 
 
 
The judge withheld his consent to the composition and convicted Mr Wong on both charges. Mr Wong was fined $2,000 and ordered to pay $1,000 in compensation to the complainant in respect of the first charge. He was sentenced to three months` imprisonment in respect of the second charge.
 Mr Wong`s appeal 
 
 
 
Mr Wong appealed against the conviction in MA 30/2001. His appeal centred on the proper construction of s 199 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), which provides: 
 
 
(1) The offences punishable under the Penal Code shown in the sixth column of Schedule A as being compoundable may be compounded by the person mentioned in that column provided that when an arrest has been effected or an application has been made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons the consent of a Magistrate or, if the offence is not triable by a Magistrate`s Court, of a District Judge, shall first be obtained.
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
(4) The composition of an offence under this section shall have the effect of an acquittal of the accused.
  
 
 
In 
Kee Leong Bee v PP
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 190
 , the High Court held in respect of s 199(1): 
 
 
19 Section 199(1) of the CPC does not state that the consent of the court is not required if the composition is made before an arrest has been effected or an application made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons. Instead, on its proper construction, an offence listed in the sixth column of Schedule A is compoundable only with the consent of the court when an arrest has been effected or an application made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons. It does not matter that the composition was made before the arrest was effected. The point is that once an offence is considered grave enough for formal proceedings to be commenced, the offence can be compounded only if the court agrees to it. 
 
20 This reading of s 199(1) of the CPC is supported by the fact that offences such as causing grievous hurt by an act which endangers human life under s 338 of the Penal Code and assault or use of criminal force to a person with intent to outrage modesty under s 354 of the Penal Code are listed as compoundable under the sixth column of Schedule A. If the appellants` suggested reading of s 199(1) of the CPC is correct, it would mean that serious offences such as those under s 338 and s 354 of the Penal Code can be compounded without the consent of the court. Compositions are based on the public policy that, where the interests of the public are not vitally affected, such as in offences which are minor and largely private in nature, the injured party should be allowed to come to a settlement with the person against whom he complains. For offences such as those under s 338 or s 354 of the Penal Code which are potentially grave offences, it is difficult to conceive that Parliament would have regarded them as mere petty wrongs which do not affect the public interest and hence require no judicial sanction before composition is allowed. It is noteworthy that in India such offences are listed in s 320(2) of the Indian CPC. They are regarded as offences of greater gravity and are compoundable only with the consent of the court.
  
 
 
Mr Jimmy Yim SC, who appeared on behalf of the appellant, asked that the court reverse its decision in 
 Kee Leong Bee 
. His main argument was that the legislative history of s 199 is against the interpretation taken by the court in 
 Kee Leong Bee 
. He noted that in 1900, the equivalent provision of the CPC was s 248, subsequently renumbered as s 253 in 1936. The section provided: 
 
 
(1) The offences punishable under the sections of the Penal Code described in the first two columns of Part A of the Table next following may be compounded by the person mentioned in the third column of that Table, or when a prosecution of such offence is actually pending, be compounded by such person with the consent of the Court before which the case is pending. 
 
(2) The offences punishable under the sections of the Penal Code described in Part B of the Table next following may with the consent of the Court before which the case is pending, be compounded by the person to whom the hurt has been caused.
  
 
 
In 1954, a new provision on composition was introduced in the form of s 242. The wording for s 242 of the 1954 CPC is the same as the present s 199. It stated: 
 
The offences punishable under the Penal Code shown in the sixth column of Schedule A as being compoundable may be compounded by the person mentioned in that column 
 provided that when an arrest has been effected or an application has been made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons
 the consent of a Magistrate or, if the offence is not triable by a Magistrate`s Court, of a District Judge, shall first be obtained. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
In Supplement No 61, Government Gazette, Colony of Singapore, July to December 1954, the explanatory note to the Bill introducing s 242 stated: 
 
In the existing section 253 of the Code there appears a table listing the offences which may with the consent of the Court be compounded. In Schedule A which appears at the end of the Code it is stated in Column 6 whether particular offences are compoundable or not. For the sake of simplicity the table appearing in the body of the Code has been omitted and again for the sake of simplicity it is provided by this clause that 
 once cognizance of an offence has been taken by a Court the consent of a Court must be obtained before composition
. It is proposed to amend the sixth column of Schedule A by inserting therein the effect of the table now omitted. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
Mr Yim observed that, according to the explanatory note, the effect of s 242 is this. There are no longer two distinct categories of compoundable offences, one falling under Table A and the other under Table B. Instead, there is now only one sole criterion, that `once cognizance of an offence has been taken by a Court the consent of a Court must be obtained before the composition`. He argued that the meaning of this must be that, if composition is reached before the court took cognizance of the offence, the consent of the court is not required. Since Mr Wong had given Mr Mok $1,000 as compensation on 2 May 2000 before the court took cognizance of the offence, the offence in the second charge had been compounded and Mr Wong was effectively acquitted under s 199(4) of the CPC.
While this particular sentence of the explanatory note could be read this way, it is also open to an alternative reading. It is also possible to read that sentence as saying that, once the court has cognizance of an offence, there can only be `composition` as defined in s 199(4), in the sense of having the effect of an acquittal, only if the court grants its consent. Without such consent, the `personal settlement` between the parties will not be regarded by the courts as a `composition`, with the effect of acquittal as defined in s 199(4).
The explanatory note and Mr Yim`s discussion about legislative history therefore do not add much, except to say that there is ambiguity in the provision, but that was always apparent on the language of the provision. The critical line in s 199(1) is the part that provides that `when an arrest has been effected or an application has been made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons`, the consent of the court is needed before the offence can be compounded. The question is this: does that phrase mean that consent is needed only `
 if 
 an arrest has 
 already 
 been effected or 
 if 
 an application has 
 already 
 been made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons`, or does it mean that consent is needed `
 whenever 
 an arrest has been effected or 
 whenever 
 an application has been made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons`. Clearly, the provision is open to either interpretation. Mr Yim agreed that the provision is ambiguous and open to two interpretations. Which one should be taken?
Mr Yim admitted that the problem with his reading is that serious offences such as grievous hurt, endangering life and outrage of modesty will be compoundable without the consent of the court. He argued, however, that this problem may be more apparent than real, since there has been no occasion where such a problem has surfaced. However, a mere 12 days after 
 Kee Leong Bee 
 (supra) was delivered, the High Court heard 
PP v Mohamed Nasir bin Mohamed Sali
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 83
 .
The facts of that case involved a religious teacher who faced three charges of outraging the modesty of his niece. The issue there was whether the district judge should have given his consent to the application to compound the offence. The relevance of 
 PP v Mohamed Nasir bin Mohamed Sali 
 to the present argument is this: these things 
 do 
 happen. If s 199(1) was not read in the way it was in 
 Kee Leong Bee 
 (supra), it would lead to very wrong results. Mr Yim did not deny this. Accused persons, faced with the prospect of humiliation and punishment, invariably feel the desire to pressurise the victim into settlement. If such settlements are allowed as compositions without the consent of the court, it would undermine the entire basis of criminal jurisprudence. Not only that, it would lead to an inequitable legal system where the rich can avoid criminal sanction by paying off the poor. For these reasons, I dismissed Mr Wong`s appeal.
 Sentence 
 
 
 
The Public Prosecutor cross-appealed in MA 30/2001 against the sentence for the second charge on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate. An offence under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to $1,000. Mr Wong was sentenced to three months` imprisonment.
I have made it clear in 
Ong Hwee Leong v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 794
  and 
PP v Lee Seck Hing
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 745
  that there can be no place in our roads for road bullies and that imprisonment should follow in such cases where the charge is under s 323 of the Penal Code.
In 
 Neo Ner v PP 
 MA 113/2001, the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge under s 323 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to three months` imprisonment. There was a dispute on the road. The appellant alighted from his car and moved to the victim`s car. When the victim opened his car door to get out, the appellant slammed the door in the victim`s face. The victim suffered a 1cm superficial laceration on his cheek and a 3cm laceration on the back of his head. I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against sentence.
The appellant in 
 Neo Ner v PP 
 was a first time offender, who showed his remorse by pleading guilty to the offence. In contrast, Mr Wong brings with him a string of colourful antecedents, and no signs of remorse. He was convicted on 25 October 1994 on 12 charges of disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant, an offence under s 188 of the Penal Code. He was convicted on 6 October 1999 of an offence under s 65 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) for driving without due care or reasonable consideration.
In particular, on 4 October 1994, he was convicted of an offence under s 509 of the Penal Code for insulting the modesty of a woman, and of an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt. Mr Wong had gone to the Singapore National Eye Centre in August 1992 to see a doctor. A dispute arose between him and the counter staff when Mr Wong demanded to see the doctor immediately. In the course of the dispute, Mr Wong told a female staff at the counter, `You take out your skirt and I put my finger in`. When a nursing officer intervened, Mr Wong tried to punch the female staff but ended up punching the nursing officer.
Mr Wong`s antecedents show a blatant disregard for human decency and civility. Through these and the present offence, he has shown himself to be extremely abusive and highly prone to violence. He behaved like an absolute gangster throughout the incident. Three months` imprisonment for him was manifestly inadequate in light of all these factors. The sentence was therefore increased to one year`s imprisonment and a fine of $1,000, with six months` imprisonment in default.
 Reference to Court of Appeal 
 
 
 
At the end of appeal MA 30/2001, Mr Wong applied by way of criminal motion CM 15/2001 for a question to be referred to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Ed) (`SCJA`). The question was: 
 
On a true construction of s 199(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, is the consent of the court required for the compounding of an offence listed as compoundable in the sixth column of Schedule A when an arrest or application for summons or warrant of arrest is made, even though the person hurt and the accused have agreed to a composition before the date of the arrest or application for summons or warrant of arrest?
 
 
 
References to the Court of Appeal are governed by s 60(1) of the SCJA, which provides: 
 
When a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court in the exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction, the Judge may on the application of any party, and shall on the application of the Public Prosecutor, reserve for the decision of the Court of Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the matter and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the case.
 
 
 
The operation of s 60(1) of the SCJA was discussed by the High Court in 
Ng Ai Tiong v PP
 
 
[2000] 2 SLR 358
 , where it was held: 
 
 
9 The requirements which must be satisfied before a s 60 application can be allowed are set out clearly in the words of the section itself. These requirements can be summarised as follows: 
 
(i) There must be a question of law. 
 
(ii) This question of law must be one of public interest and not of mere personal importance to the parties alone. 
 
(iii) The question must have arisen in the matter dealt with by the High Court in the exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction. 
 
(iv) The determination of the question by the High Court must have affected the outcome of the case. 
 
It should be borne in mind that where the application is brought by any party other than the Public Prosecutor, the power of the High Court under s 60 is discretionary in nature. This means that, even if all the above requirements have been satisfied, the court still retains the discretion to disallow a reference to the Court of Appeal. 
 
10 The above listed conditions have been extensively interpreted and examined by previous local judicial authorities. In all these cases, it has been the common emphasis that the discretion under s 60, SCJA, must be exercised sparingly by the High Court. This is to give recognition and effect to Parliament`s intention for the High Court to be the final appellate court for criminal cases commenced in the subordinate courts. The importance of maintaining finality in such proceedings must not be seen to be easily compromised through the use of such a statutory device. In 
Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP
 
 
[1990] SLR 301
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 275
 , Chan Sek Keong J [as he then was] had cautioned aptly that: 
 
`[Section 60, SCJA] is not an ordinary appeal provision to argue points of law which are settled or novel points which can be decided by the application or extension of established principles of law or the application of statutory provisions which have been authoritatively construed by higher courts.` 
 
Hence, it is imperative that s 60 of the SCJA is utilised only in exceptional cases so as to ensure that the proper purpose of the section is not abused to serve as a form of `backdoor appeal`.
  
 
 
Mr Yim submitted that the question should be decided by the Court of Appeal because there are two conflicting views of the High Court on this issue. However, the question raised had already been settled conclusively by the High Court in 
 Kee Leong Bee 
 (supra). The statement in 
PP v Norzian bin Bintat
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 462
  at 473G relied on by Mr Yim as evidence of a conflicting view of the High Court was clearly obiter. This was plainly evident from 
 Norzian 
, where the issues were whether s 199 of the CPC was ultra vires the Constitution unless construed such that it would apply only in cases of private prosecutions, and whether the district judge wrongly exercised his discretion to allow the composition. Moreover, I had made it clear in 
 Kee Leong Bee 
 that my statement in 
 Norzian 
, which Mr Yim relied on, was made in reliance on 
Dharichhan Singh v Emperor
 (Unreported) , which dealt with a provision of the Indian CPC which is very different from our s 199 of the CPC, and consequently should be regarded solely as obiter dictum.
As was stressed by Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) in 
Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP
 
 
[1990] SLR 301
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 275
 , it is imperative that s 60 of the SCJA is utilised only in exceptional cases so as to ensure that the proper purpose of the section is not abused to serve as a form of `backdoor appeal`. The question raised being one which has been settled conclusively in 
 Kee Leong Bee 
, I saw no basis to exercise my discretion to allow the question to be referred to the Court of Appeal. Criminal Motion 15 of 2001 was therefore dismissed.
Outcome:

: In this case, the first plaintiff, Fraser & Neave Ltd (hereinafter referred to as `F&N`), the second plaintiff, Mr Michael Fam Yue Onn, the third plaintiff, Mr Tan Yam Pin, and the fourth plaintiff, Mr Ian Alastair Maclean, alleged that they were defamed by the defendants, Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd (hereinafter referred to as `Aberdeen`) and Mr Hugh Young. As the allegedly defamatory remarks were contained in a letter to the Business Times on 24 August 2000, the plaintiffs, relying on O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court, applied for a determination of the meaning of the words used in the letter. Aberdeen and Mr Young, who were dissatisfied with the assistant registrar`s construction of the words in question, appealed to the High Court. I varied the ruling of assistant registrar. As Aberdeen and Mr Young have appealed against my decision, I set out below the reasons for my decision.
 Letter to the Business Times 
 
 
 
 
 
The letter, which appeared in the Business Times on 24 August 2000 (hereinafter referred to as `the letter`), was re-published in the Business Times website. It is set out below, with the allegedly offending words in italics. 
 
CMB Asia minorities were kept in the dark
 
 
 
 
 Hot on the heels of Times Publishing, we have another case of minority shareholders being kept in the dark and not having sufficient time to consider an offer for a company. Again, the company in question, CMB Asia, is part of the restructuring of the Fraser and Neave group.
 
 
 
 
Crown Cork of the US (already 41 per cent shareholder of CMB Asia) made a general offer for CMB Asia on July 22 at S$3.23, to which the other major shareholder, 
 Fraser and Neave, with 34 per cent, readily assented. This price is at a discount to a heavily written-down book value and not much above the company`s holding of cash in the bank
.
 
 
 
 
 The offer document was posted out on Aug 14 and the offer declared un-conditional one day later - a fait accompli.
 
 
 
 
The independent advice to shareholders has yet to emerge, but institutional shareholders have been given a deadline of Aug 25 by their custodians to reply to the offer which expires on Sept 5. 
 This gives little time for independent directors of CMB Asia to consider the offer, and to communicate with the minority shareholders, and even less time to have an open debate
.
 
 
 
 
 Once again, as in the case of Times Publishing (where the independent advice stating the deal to be undervaluing the company came too late), minority shareholders risk falling victim to an `inside job`
.
 
 
 
 
 This is a poor advertisement for transparency, duty of boards to act equally on behalf of all shareholders, and protection of the rights of minority shareholders
.

 Assistant registrar`s decision 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
F&N and the other three plaintiffs applied in SIC 1319/2000 to have the natural and ordinary meaning of the allegedly defamatory words in the letter determined under O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court. They pleaded that the allegedly defamatory words, in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and were understood to mean that they had: 
 
acted improperly and/or dishonestly by conspiring with Crown Cork & Seal (`CCS`) and CMB Asia Ltd in relation to the takeover of CMB Asia Ltd by CCS, to force on the minority shareholders an inadequate price for their shares by:
 
 
 
 
(a) suppressing material information in respect of the said takeover; and
 
(b) giving the minority shareholders insufficient time to consider the offer.
 
 
 
At the hearing of the SIC on 12 January 2001, the assistant registrar agreed substantially with the meaning pleaded by F&N and the other plaintiffs. However, she disagreed that the words `and/or dishonestly` should be included in her determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. Apart from this, she ruled that the offending letter also suggested that the plaintiffs readily assented to the sale of shares to CCS at a heavily written-down book value. Her ruling was thus as follows: 
 
The words, in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and were understood to mean that [F&N, Mr Fam, Mr Tan and Mr Maclean] acted improperly by conspiring with Crown Cork & Seal (`CCS`) and CMB Asia Ltd in relation to the takeover of CMB Asia Ltd by CCS, to force on the minority shareholders an inadequate price for their shares by:
 
 
 
 
(a) suppressing material information in respect of the said takeover; and/or
 
(b) giving the minority shareholders insufficient time to consider the offer; and/or
 
(c) readily assenting in the sale of its shares to CCS at a heavily written down book value.
 
 
 
 
 
 Appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As has been mentioned, Aberdeen and Mr Young appealed against the ruling of the assistant registrar.
 ORDER 14 RULE 12(1) OF RULES OF COURT
 
 
The right of a party to apply to the court for a determination of a question of law or the construction of a document is governed by O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court, which provides as follows: 
 
The Court may, upon the application of a party or of its own motion, determine any question of law or construction of any document arising in any cause or matter at any stage of the proceedings where it appears to the Court that -
 
 
 
 
(a) such question is suitable for determination without a full trial of the action; and
 
(b) such determination will fully determine (subject only to any possible appeal) the entire cause or matter or any claim or issue therein.
 
 
 
As for whether a plaintiff in a defamation case may rely on O 14 r 12(1) to have the ordinary meaning of words in an allegedly defamatory document construed, the position is not in doubt. In 
Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 529
  at [para ]50-51, which concerned an allegation of defamation arising from a press statement, LP Thean JA, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said as follows: 
 
As for the argument that the meaning of the words complained of is not `suitable for determination` without a full trial of the action because such determination requires the hearing of evidence, we find that such an argument is completely misplaced ... There are obvious advantages in determining the issue of the meaning before trial, as the learned judge held at [para ]27.8 of his grounds of judgment:
 
 
 
`It was plain in all the circumstances that a preliminary determination as to the meaning of the words complained [of] if made would allow the defendants not only to focus on whether there was a triable issue as to their defence of justification of the meaning as determined but further that if there was such a triable issue and leave was granted to defend the action the defendants would also be focused on their particular defence at the subsequent trial.`
 
 
 
In our judgment, in this case, the natural and ordinary meaning of the alleged defamatory words is a question which is suitable for determination under O 14 r 12(1).
 
 
 
Mr Imran Khwaja, the counsel for Aberdeen and Mr Young, contended that the present factual matrix made the application for a construction of the allegedly defamatory words in the letter before the trial inappropriate. He also submitted that if the letter is construed, it will be found that it is not defamatory of the plaintiffs.
At the outset, it ought to be noted that Mr Fam, Mr Tan and Mr Maclean, unlike F&N, were not specifically referred to in the letter. I thus ruled that whether or not there is a sufficient nexus between Mr Fam, Mr Tan and Mr Maclean and the allegedly defamatory words in the letter is a question which should be determined at the trial. This is because extrinsic evidence would be required to show why they were also defamed in the letter and it is clear from the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
 Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings 
 (supra at p 555), that such evidence is not admissible in an application under O 14 r 12(1). However, in the case of F&N, I saw no reason why there could not be a determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the allegedly defamatory words in the letter.
 PRINCIPLES FOR CONSTRUING ALLEGEDLY DEFAMATORY WORDS
 
 
What is meant by the term `natural and ordinary meaning of words` was explained by Lord Reid in 
Rubber Improvement v Daily Telegraph
 
[1964] AC 234
 at 258, in the following succinct terms: 
 
What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning.
 
 
 
The above passage was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in 
 Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings 
 (supra at p 556).
The principles for determining the natural and ordinary meaning of words are well known. In 
 Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings 
, LP Thean JA summed up the position at [para ]53 as follows: 
 
The court decides what meaning the words would have conveyed to an ordinary, reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense: 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong
 
 [1984-1985] SLR 516 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 334
  ... The test is an objective one: it is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by an ordinary, reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. The meaning intended by the maker of the defamatory statement is irrelevant. Similarly, the sense in which the words were actually understood by the party alleged to have been defamed is also irrelevant. Nor is extrinsic evidence admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the context of the entire passage in which they are set out. The court is not confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words, but takes into account what the ordinary, reasonable person may reasonably infer from the words. The ordinary, reasonable person reads between the lines.
 
 
 
 
 WHETHER THE LETTER DEFAMED F&N
 
 
 
At the outset, it ought to be reiterated that in an action for defamation, the plaintiff must establish that the offending words are defamatory of him. In
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed), the position is stated at p 161 as follows: 
 
To succeed in an action for defamation the plaintiff must not only prove that the defendant published the words and that they are defamatory: he must also identify himself as the person defamed ... The question in all cases is whether the words might be understood by reasonable people to refer to the plaintiff, subject to the qualification that where the words are published to persons who have special knowledge the issue will be decided by reference to what reasonable persons possessing that knowledge would understand by them.
 
 
 
Mr Khwaja submitted that F&N had no cause of action against his clients because the letter did not put them in a bad light. He explained in para 6 of his written submissions as follows: 
 
The thrust of the article is in respect of good corporate governance and specifically the duties owed by the board of CMB Asia towards its minority shareholders. The only reference to the first plaintiffs is of a purely factual nature: that CMB Asia is part of the restructuring of the F&N Group and that the first plaintiffs agreed to sell their shares to CCS at the offered price. With regard to the latter, all the readers of the letter would know that and that the first plaintiffs owed no duty to the shareholders of CMB Asia. Moreover, the first plaintiffs were free to sell their shares in CMB Asia to whomsoever, whenever and whatever price they chose. Consequently there cannot be nor was there any defamatory imputation against the first plaintiffs.
 
 
 
A perusal of the opening two sentences of the letter will show that the scope of the letter is wider than that suggested by Mr Khwaja. The sentences are as follows: 
 
 
 Hot on the heels
 of Times Publishing, we have another case of minority shareholders being 
 kept in the dark
 and not having sufficient time to consider an offer for a company. 
 Again
, the company in question, CMB Asia, is part of the restructuring of the 
 Fraser and Neave group
. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
Even if the thrust of the letter concerned good governance, there is clearly an insinuation that F&N is involved in keeping minority shareholders in the dark. It must not be overlooked that the CMB is first referred to in the letter as a part of the F&N group. `Kept in the dark` has negative connotations and suggests that minority shareholders have deliberately been denied information to which they are entitled with respect to the proposed takeover. The term `again` was obviously a carefully chosen word. Coming after the use of the words `hot on the heels` and `another case`, the reader must think that there is a connection between the restructuring of the F&N group and the keeping of minority shareholders in the two restructured companies in the dark.
The insinuation that F&N did something wrong continues in the following paragraph. It states that `Fraser and Neave, with 34 per cent, 
 readily assented 
` to a price which was at a `
 heavily written-down book value 
 and 
 not much above the company`s holding of cash in the bank 
`. Read with the rest of the letter, the impression given is that F&N was so keen to have the deal done that it was willing to accept an inadequate price for its shares and at the expense of not giving minority shareholders enough time to consider the offer or sufficient information to make an informed choice.
The following sentence from the letter rings the death knell for the assertion that the letter does not have any reference to F&N: 
 
 
 Once again
, as in the case of Times Publishing ... minority shareholders risk falling 
 victim
 to an `
 inside job
`. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
In the above sentence, the reader is reminded once again of the Times Publishing case, which also involved F&N. An allegation was made that in both cases, minority shareholders risked falling `victim` to an `inside job`. The terms `victim` and `inside job` have negative connotations. The term `inside job` refers to a crime or wrongdoing against anyone by an affiliated person or someone working for or trusted by the victim. As F&N was involved in both cases and there was an inside job in the two cases, the reader would think that F&N is party to the `inside job`, and especially so since they `readily` assented to selling their shares at a very low price. The word `victim` certainly suggests that the minority shareholders have been wronged by F&N as well.
In view of the aforesaid, I had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that F&N had reason to feel aggrieved by the letter and that there was a case for determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in the letter.
 MY CONSTRUCTION OF THE LETTER
 
 
I accepted that there was an insinuation in the letter that F&N acted improperly by agreeing with CCS and CMB to ensure that minority shareholders had no real alternative but to accept an inadequate price for their shares by ensuring that they were not given material information in respect of the takeover and that they were not given enough time to consider the offer. In that sense, they were `forced` to accept the offer. However, I was not satisfied that an ordinary reader of the Business Times would, without more, have assumed that there was a `conspiracy`. I also found it unnecessary to add the words `readily assenting in the sale of its shares to CCS at a heavily written down book value` to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, as proposed by F&N. Finally, I modified the words `suppressing material information with respect to the takeover` in the assistant registrar`s ruling. In view of the aforesaid, I ruled that the allegedly defamatory words in the letter were meant and were understood to mean that: 
 
[F&N] acted improperly by agreeing with Crown Cork & Seal (`CCS`) and CMB Asia Ltd in relation to the takeover of CMB Asia Ltd by CCS, to force the minority shareholders to accept an inadequate price for their shares by:
 
 
 
 
(a) ensuring that material information was not provided to the minority shareholders in respect of the said takeover; and/or
 
(b) ensuring that there was insufficient time for the minority shareholders to consider the offer.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The respondent was acquitted by the District Court after being tried on the following charge in 
PP v Selvakumar Pillai s/o Suppiah Pillai
 
[2004] SGDC 84
:
You Selvakumar Pillai s/o Suppiah Pillai (M/34 Yrs) NRIC No S6939745Z are charged that you, on 30 June 2003, some time after 6.15pm, at the Bukit Merah Branch office of the Housing & Development Board (“HDB”), located at Block 166 Bukit Merah Central, #03-3529, Singapore, being a servant of HDB, namely an Administrative Assistant with HDB, did commit theft of cash amounting to $199,575.78 (one hundred and ninety-nine thousand, five hundred and seventy-five Singapore dollars and seventy-eight cents) in the possession of HDB, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 381 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224).
I allowed the Prosecution’s appeal against the order of acquittal and now set out my reasons.
Background facts
2          The respondent was a cashier with the finance section of the Housing and Development Board (“the HDB”), Bukit Merah Branch. On 30 June 2003, he committed theft of $199,575.78 in the possession of the HDB’s Bukit Merah Branch.
The workings of HDB’s Bukit Merah Branch
3          The finance section of HDB’s Bukit Merah Branch receives daily payments for car park fines, season parking tickets, housing loan instalments, rental payments and late payment charges. At the end of each working day, the daily collection is counted, the figures are tallied and the cash is placed in a Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation (“CISCO”) money bag. The money bag is sealed and placed in a safe located in the strong room of the finance section. The strong room is secured by a key lock and an electronic alarm system. The alarm system is armed and disarmed by the same four-digit code. The safe is secured by both key and combination locks.
4          The keys to the safe and the strong room are placed in an unlocked plastic container on the desk of Tan Chuan Juan (“Tan”), the Finance Supervisor. Tan’s workstation has no door and most of the finance section staff know where the keys are kept. 
5          The official policy is that no staff member should know both the four‑digit code for the strong room and the combination for the safe. Thus, one group of employees in the finance section officially knows the four-digit code for the strong room. They are Tan and three assistant finance supervisors, including Chua Keng Hoon (“Chua”). Another group officially knows the combination for the safe and they comprise cashiers in the finance section – the respondent, Ho Choo Tong (“Ho”), Lee Chin Chong (“Lee”) and Soo Thoo Fok Loy (“Soo Thoo”). Strictly speaking, no person should have knowledge of both codes. However, it transpired that certain staff members including the respondent were apprised of both codes.
6          When the CISCO money bag is placed in the safe at the end of each day by one of the cashiers, the Finance Supervisor or one of the assistant finance supervisors is supposed to witness the money bag being placed in the safe before locking the safe with the key, and locking and arming the strong room. However, this procedure was not always followed. Additionally, Tan testified that he would leave the strong room door unlocked during the day so that the cashiers could have easy access to the strong room to obtain loose change as and when it was needed.
The events leading to the theft
7          On 30 June 2003, the respondent was on leave but he returned to the Bukit Merah Branch in the afternoon and assisted in the counting of the day’s cash collections. After the cash had been tallied, Ho placed the day’s takings in the CISCO money bag and put it in the safe. Chua entered the strong room only after Ho had closed the safe. Chua then locked the safe, and locked and armed the strong room. Ho testified that the cash collection for that day was $199,575.78. The breakdown of the cash denominations was as follows:
(a)        35 pieces of $1,000 notes;
(b)        104 pieces of $100 notes;
(c)        2,840 pieces of $50 notes;
(d)        1,085 pieces of $10 notes;
(e)        12 pieces of $5 notes;
(f)         351 pieces of $2 notes;
(g)        nine pieces of $1 notes; and
(h)        $554.78 worth of mixed coins.
8          Once the day’s takings had been safely stored, Chua, Ho, Lee and Soo Thoo (“the group”) prepared to leave the office. They had earlier arranged with the respondent to have dinner that evening and celebrate Soo Thoo’s retirement as it was Soo Thoo’s last day of work. As the group prepared to leave for dinner, they realised that the respondent was not in their midst. They eventually left the office at about 6.15pm without the respondent as Chua told the rest of them that the respondent had mentioned earlier that he intended to get a farewell gift for Soo Thoo at the nearby supermarket.
9          At the appointed venue, the group started dinner without the respondent. At about 7.20pm when they had finished their dinner, the respondent showed up with a bottle of liquor for Soo Thoo. He told them that he had gone home to get the liquor for Soo Thoo instead and it had been difficult to hail a cab. Soo Thoo testified that he had told the respondent previously that he did not drink but the respondent knew that Soo Thoo’s father did so. Chua, Ho and Lee also testified that it was common knowledge that Soo Thoo was a teetotaller. Ho and Lee left soon after the respondent’s arrival while Chua and Soo Thoo accompanied the respondent as he ate. After he had finished dinner, the three of them left together and the respondent gave Chua a lift home in a cab.
10        The next morning, 1 July 2003, Tan disarmed the strong room when Ho reported for work. Tan then went to answer a telephone call, leaving Ho to open the safe. Ho discovered that the CISCO money bag was missing. He immediately notified Tan and a police report was eventually made. There were no signs of a break-in.
The Prosecution’s case
11        The Prosecution alleged that the respondent had the motive, knowledge and opportunity to commit the theft. First, the Prosecution surmised that the respondent was in need of money. His monthly salary of $1,200 went towards supporting his wife who was a homemaker, his two children and his father-in law. Many of his bills were also unpaid. The respondent had installed an alarm system in his home and his security services bills were unpaid from January to June 2003. His Starhub Internet account was terminated on 26 June 2003 for non-payment. His Singapore Power bills from January to May 2003 were not paid until 30 May 2003.
12        Second, the Prosecution submitted that the respondent had easy access to the safe as several of the staff members had testified that the respondent knew both the code to the safe as well as the code to the strong room. The respondent had told Chua that he knew the code to the strong room and Ho had heard the former Finance Supervisor, the late Paul Foo (“Paul”), ask the respondent to arm the strong room. Moreover, the keys to the strong room and the safe were freely available.
13        Third, the Prosecution argued that once the group had left the office and the Bukit Merah Branch was locked up for the day, the respondent, having hidden himself in the office, had the means and opportunity to commit the theft.
14        At the same time, the Prosecution asserted that the respondent and his family members had a show of sudden wealth from 30 June 2003 onwards, the source of which was not satisfactorily explained. It averred that this newfound wealth was the spoils from the theft and cited the following incidents as proof of the respondent’s unexplained wealth:
(a)        On the night of 30 June and on 1 July 2004, the respondent deposited $1,600 into his POSB accounts which previously had little or no money in them.
(b)        On the morning of 1 July, instead of attending a scheduled medical appointment, the respondent went to two pawnshops and redeemed jewellery amounting to $21,000. At the first pawnshop, Thai Thong pawnshop, he paid about $12,000, out of which $11,000 was made up of $10 notes, $400 was made up of $50 notes and $600 was made up of both $2 and $5 notes. On the same day, the respondent paid his June 2003 Singapore Power bill. It was the first time in 2003 that he had paid his Singapore Power bill promptly.
(c)        On 2 July, the respondent’s father-in-law, Murugaiyah Thiruvengadam (“Murugaiyah”), deposited $16,400 into his own bank account.
(d)        On 4 July 2004, the police seized $2,000 in $50 notes from the respondent’s home.
(e)        On the same day, the respondent was offered $50,000 bail for his release. That night, his wife, Rajaswari d/o Thiruvengadam (“Rajaswari”), went to two cash deposit machines and deposited $5,000 cash in a hundred $50 notes into her United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”) account at Bedok. At Tampines, she deposited another $9,000 in eighty $50 and fifty $100 notes into the same account slightly past midnight on 5 July 2004.
(f)         Later that day on 5 July, Murugaiyah transferred $15,000 from his account into Rajawasri’s. Rajaswari also deposited $21,000 in sixteen $1,000 notes and a hundred $500 notes into her account. This brought her account balance to $50,000 which she used to bail the respondent out of jail.   
According to the Prosecution, the fact that all the denominations of notes used by the respondent and his family members were consistent with the HDB’s tally cast greater suspicion on the source of the money in the possession of the respondent and his family members. 
The Defence’s case
15        The respondent denied having committed the theft. Contrary to the Prosecution’s accusations that he was hard-pressed for money, he claimed that he always had substantial cash savings in his possession. He asserted that he had savings of between $22,000 and $25,000 at home which were meant for emergencies. This sum comprised of his savings from working with the HDB and from part-time jobs, Rajaswari’s savings, the leftover of an insurance payout of $35,000 he had received in 1999, and the leftover from a $30,000 loan to Paul which the latter had repaid. After Paul had repaid him by cheque, he had cashed the cheque and kept the money at home. Therefore, his savings had been amassed before June 2003. The respondent also testified that he had installed an alarm system in his home before 30 June 2003 as he kept substantial amounts of cash and jewellery in his home.
16        The respondent claimed that he had deposited money into his Post Office Savings Bank (“POSBank”) accounts because he had received a letter from POSBank threatening to terminate one of his accounts unless funds were deposited into it. He was afraid that he had missed the warning letter for the other account and thus decided to deposit money into it as well. The money which was deposited into his accounts and which was used to redeem the jewellery was from his savings. He had redeemed his jewellery because the pawn receipts were about to expire, and because his family was going to India in August 2003 with his mother for one to two months and Rajaswari wanted to use the jewellery in India. He had given Thai Thong pawnshop $11,000 in $10 notes because Rajaswari always had a habit of saving $10 notes in her piggy bank.
17        In respect of the $50,000 bail put up by Rajaswari, the respondent said that Rajaswari had borrowed $35,000 from his mother. Rajaswari then raised another $10,000 by pawning her jewellery and obtained $6,000 from her sister who had also pawned her jewellery. The respondent did not know about the $16,400 which Murugaiyah deposited into his own account.
18        The respondent averred that he was not cash-strapped. He regularly pawned his jewellery despite his savings because he preferred to have money at home. He had many unpaid bills because he had the habit of waiting till the last minute before paying them. He had paid the June 2003 Singapore Power bill promptly because he happened to be at the post office on 1 July 2003 and it was convenient to pay the bill then.
19        As for the allegations that he had the knowledge, means and opportunity to commit the theft, the respondent asserted that he did not know the access code to the strong room. He claimed that he returned to the Bukit Merah Branch on 30 June 2003 to help his colleagues even when he was on leave as he was a helpful person. In court, Chua and Soo Thoo agreed that he was indeed a very helpful person.
20        Thereafter, he had made his way to the nearby supermarket to buy Soo Thoo a gift even though he had already shared in a present with his other colleagues for the latter. This was because he had known Soo Thoo for a long time and wanted to get him something personally. He then remembered that he had a bottle of whisky at home and went home to get it. As Soo Thoo drank beer and Soo Thoo’s father drank alcohol, the respondent did not think that the liquor was an inappropriate gift. He had difficulties getting a cab and thus turned up late for dinner. After dinner, he gave Chua a lift before returning home. He was also on leave on 1 July 2003 and had no knowledge of the theft until the police visited his home on that day.
21        Rajaswari was the only other witness called by the Defence. She corroborated the respondent’s evidence that they had cash savings of between $22,000 and $25,000 at home and that she had the habit of saving $10 notes in her piggy bank. Though she had stopped working in 1997, she had continued to save part of her husband’s salary each month. She had borrowed $35,000 from her mother-in-law to raise the bail money. In this regard, she had written an IOU at her mother-in-law’s behest. Rajaswari testified that of the $16,400 in Murugayiah’s UOB account, her father’s friend had given him $15,000 for safekeeping. She returned the $15,000 in cash to her father’s friend from the $35,000 that her mother-in-law had lent her. Her father then transferred that sum from his UOB account to her account. As for the $1,400, it was her father’s money which had been intended for her mother’s death anniversary prayers. Since the prayers had been cancelled, the money was no longer needed. Thus, her father had deposited it into his account.
The 
voir dire
22        At trial, the Prosecution sought to admit into evidence the respondent’s cautioned statement recorded under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 168, 1999 Rev Ed) in which the respondent had confessed to the theft. Counsel for the respondent objected to its admission on the basis that it was not voluntarily made and that it had been made as a result of inducement, threat or promise. A 
voir dire
 was conducted. In this regard, the respondent, Rajaswari, three doctors, the police officers involved in interviewing the respondent as well as the lockup officers gave evidence in court.
23        The investigating officer, Razali bin Razak (“Razali”), testified that the respondent was first interviewed on the evening of 2 July 2003. Thereafter, he was kept in the lockup and interviewed a second time in the morning on 3 July 2003. The third interview with the respondent was at about 8.35pm on 3 July. Other than Razali, officers Sahlan bin Osman (“Sahlan”), Then Yen Loong (“TYL”) and Kothandom Vasanthan (“Vasanthan”) were present at the third interview. SSgt Jason Ng (“Jason”) joined them at about 9.10pm. Jason was a former member of the Property Offences Squad (“POS”) to which the other officers belonged, but he had been transferred to the Violence Squad three months earlier. Razali said that Jason had not been assigned to assist him in the investigations unlike the other officers. None of the POS officers knew why Jason had helped in the interview. They testified that they spoke in a normal or firm tone to the respondent while Jason spoke in a normal tone.
24        The POS officers testified that the respondent seemed responsive to Jason’s questioning. As such, they left the room and left the respondent alone with Jason. TYL however said he was certain that Razali did not leave the interview room. According to Razali, when he re-entered the room a few minutes later, he heard the respondent admit that he had committed the crime. Razali then brought the respondent up to his workstation in the POS office together with Jason, whereupon Razali recorded the cautioned statement of the respondent. The POS officers denied that any inducement, threat or promise was made to the respondent at any time.
25        Jason testified that it was his former officer-in-charge, Insp Richard Lim, who told him that the POS officers were interviewing the respondent and suggested that Jason assist them. When Jason entered the interview room, he observed the proceedings before asking the respondent questions. He recalled asking the respondent if he had stolen the money and to think of his family members. Jason stated that he spoke in a normal tone while the other officers spoke in a firm tone. The respondent began to nod in response to his questions after a while. When the other officers saw this, they left the room.
26        According to Jason, when he was alone with the respondent the latter did not really respond to his questions. Razali then re-entered after a few minutes, whereupon the respondent nodded in response to Jason’s questions. The two of them then brought the respondent to Razali’s workstation where Jason continued the questioning, but the respondent was not very responsive. Jason claimed that he was not present when Razali was recording the cautioned statement. He could not remember who else was at the POS office then or if he spoke to anyone. He denied that he had assaulted the respondent or that he had followed the respondent to Razali’s office to make sure that the respondent signed the cautioned statement.
27        The respondent testified that at the first interview, Razali had shouted at him when he denied committing the offence and had threatened to involve his family. He claimed that Sahlan had placed him in an arm lock and punched him in the stomach at the second interview. At the third interview, the POS officers had shouted at him and threatened to involve his family. Sahlan then stripped him and left him naked in the air-conditioned interview room. When he still denied committing the offence, Sahlan took a cloth, wrapped it around his fist and threatened to punch him. Sahlan then used the respondent’s T-shirt to cover his head so that he could not see. He was then pushed around the room until he felt dizzy. He also claimed to have been pinched on his nipples and assaulted. When the T-shirt was removed, the respondent began to cry.
28        The respondent also alleged that he had been punched by Jason when the latter joined in the interview. When they were alone, Jason had threatened to involve his family as well. Jason had then punched him in the stomach and slapped him. As the respondent could not take it any longer, he had told Jason that he would sign whatever was written. He was then brought to Razali’s office where he was told by Jason to sign whatever Razali showed him or risk being beaten up. The respondent claimed that he had signed the cautioned statement without reading it or knowing its contents.
29        He was released on bail on 5 July 2003 and fell asleep upon reaching home as he was very tired. He went to the hospital on 7 July 2003 when blood was found in his urine. There, he had told the doctor that he had fallen down the steps and injured himself. He had not dared to reveal the assaults by the police as he was afraid that he would be assaulted again during the recording of further statements. When he told Rajaswari about what had happened, she encouraged him to tell the doctors the truth so that he could be properly examined. Thus, the respondent returned to the hospital on 8 July 2003 and told another doctor that he had been assaulted while in custody. The respondent denied committing the theft at the subsequent recording of his long statements.
30        The collective evidence of the three doctors who examined the respondent on 7 and 8 July 2003 was that they did not find any bruises or fractures on him but that he had tenderness in his lower rib cage area and on his abdomen, 
ie
, he showed signs of pain by wincing. One of the doctors testified that the fact that there were no bruises did not mean that the respondent had not been assaulted as he had seen cases of assault without bruises. The respondent was eventually diagnosed with a urinary tract infection.
31        At the end of the 
voir dire
, the trial judge ruled that the confession was not admissible as evidence in the main trial. With the resumption of the main trial, the Prosecution conceded that there was no direct evidence that the respondent had committed the theft. It therefore sought to rely solely on
 the circumstantial evidence mentioned above to prove its case.
The decision below
32        With regard to the 
voir dire
, the trial judge found that the Prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was made voluntarily. She observed the demeanour of the police witnesses in court and found their stories and explanations suspect. Thus, she did not allow the confession to be admitted into evidence.
33        The trial judge went on to find that the circumstantial evidence before her was not such that she was prepared to draw an irresistible inference of guilt. In her view, the version of events propounded by the respondent and Rajaswari was believable and the series of coincidences raised by the Prosecution did not lead inexorably to the one conclusion that the respondent had committed the offence.
The appeal
34        The Prosecution raised two issues on appeal: first, whether the trial judge had erred in finding at the end of the 
voir dire
 that the respondent’s confession was inadmissible as evidence in court; and, second, whether the trial judge had failed to place sufficient weight on the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence.
35        I shall now deal with each of these issues in turn.
The voir dire
36        It is trite law that an appellate court is reluctant to overturn a trial judge’s findings of fact, especially where it hinges upon an assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
 at [24]. The appellate court does not have the advantages of seeing and hearing the witnesses and will defer to those findings: 
Ameer Akbar v Abdul Hamid
 
[1997] 1 SLR 113
 at [42]; 
Kong See Chew v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 94
 at [28]. It is also important to note that where the voluntariness of a confession is challenged, the burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was made voluntarily: 
Koh Aik Siew v PP
 
[1993] 2 SLR 599
 at 606, [23]; 
Gulam bin Notam Mohd Shariff Jamalddin v PP
 
[1999] 2 SLR 181
 at [53].
37        In the instant case, the trial judge found the police witnesses’ stories and explanations suspect upon observing their demeanour. She was unable to conclude that the Prosecution had discharged its burden of proof and did not allow the respondent’s cautioned statement to be admitted into evidence. The Prosecution now contends that even though the trial judge purported to base her findings on her observations of the police witnesses’ demeanour, those findings were based on erroneous inferences drawn from the evidence. It argues that there was little basis for the judge’s observation that the conduct of the police witnesses was dubious. Therefore, the critical issues here are whether the trial judge was plainly wrong in her assessment of the witnesses and whether she had drawn inferences from the evidence that no reasonable judge would have drawn. In this regard, I turn to three aspects of the judge’s findings.
Circumstances under which the respondent confessed to the offence
38        The trial judge found the events leading up to the confession to be very troubling. It was incredible that the respondent would simply open up to Jason when he had denied committing the crime from the time of his first interview till his third interview. It was also highly suspicious that all the POS officers who were specifically assigned to interview the respondent would leave him alone with Jason and that the respondent was all ready to confess when Razali re-entered the interview room. Jason had no cause to join in the interview and it was inconceivable that the officer-in-charge would have so casually told Jason to assist in the investigations.
39        The Prosecution conceded that it might be perceived as unusual that the respondent opened up to Jason after meeting him for about ten minutes whereas he had not responded to the POS officers who had interviewed him for two days. However, it surmised that the respondent was simply tired and was thus responsive to an officer who spoke in a civil manner to him. It was not unbelievable that the POS officers had decided to leave the Jason alone with the respondent when they saw that the latter was responding to Jason. The Prosecution further argued that the trial judge had placed undue weight on the fact that Jason helped in interviewing the respondent although he was no longer part of POS.
40        I was unconvinced by the Prosecution’s arguments in this regard. There was no evidence to show that Jason had superior skills in interviewing suspects as compared to the POS officers. It thus appeared strange that the officer-in-charge would instruct him to assist in the investigation when at least four POS officers had already been specifically tasked to do so. It defied logic that a senior officer would deploy the human resources of the police force in such a haphazard manner. Furthermore, the unequivocal evidence of the POS officers was that they did not know why Jason had assisted in the interview. Some of the POS officers even seemed surprised that he had done so.
41        Seen in this light, it was also doubtful that Razali, as the investigating officer, would have left Jason alone with the respondent even though he did not know why Jason, who was not part of POS, had joined them. What rendered this chain of events even stranger was that TYL, who had no reason to lie, emphatically averred under cross-examination that Razali never left the interview room and stayed with the respondent the whole time.
Circumstances surrounding the recording of the cautioned statement
42        The trial judge found contradictions in Razali’s and Jason’s testimonies which cast doubt on the veracity of their evidence. She deemed it highly suspicious that Razali had given the impression that he alone dealt with the respondent at his workstation during the recording of the cautioned statement whereas Jason said that he had continued to question the respondent even when he was at the POS office. The trial judge noted that although Jason had initially remembered Razali preparing and administering the charge to the respondent, Jason had later claimed that he was elsewhere in the POS office when the charge was administered. Jason had also been evasive in court as to who had been at the POS office and the identities of the officers whom he had spoken to.
43        In response, the Prosecution averred that the contradiction in Razali’s and Jason’s evidence was more apparent than real because the mere fact that Jason had known that the cautioned statement was being prepared and administered did not mean that he must have been present at Razali’s desk. In fact, he had known the statement was being recorded and thus stayed away. The fact that Jason could not remember whom he spoke to was also not material as his most important involvement in the matter was in obtaining the respondent’s co-operation.
44        I was unable to agree with the Prosecution’s contentions on this part of the appeal. While it was reasonable that Jason did not have to be present at Razali’s desk to know that the cautioned statement was being prepared and administered, the Prosecution’s submission that he stayed away because the statement was being recorded was unpersuasive. If Jason had been instructed to assist in the investigations, if Razali had trusted Jason so much that he left Jason alone with the respondent, and if Jason was so adept at handling the respondent, it would then be implausible that Jason should have had to keep away at the stage of the recording of the statement. Moreover, Jason testified that even when he continued questioning the respondent at Razali’s workstation, the respondent still “held back”. Thus, it appeared that Jason should, all the more, have remained with Razali when he recorded the statement. It was also strange that Jason could remember vividly the events that took place in the interview room, even to the most minute of details, yet failed entirely in recalling what he did at the POS office and to whom he spoke.
The medical evidence
45        The trial judge found that even though no bruises were found on the respondent, he was diagnosed with mild tenderness on his abdomen and bilateral flank. She also noted that one of the doctors confirmed that he had seen assault cases where there was no apparent bruising. In this regard, she found that the Prosecution had failed to challenge the respondent’s claim that he experienced pain, which it should have done robustly if its position was that the respondent had faked the pain.
46        On this point, I was of the view that undue emphasis had been placed by the trial judge on these factors. The Prosecution had put to the respondent at trial that he had never been assaulted by the police officers and that he had lied to the doctors when he told them that he had been assaulted. Accordingly, the Prosecution had clearly challenged the respondent’s allegation that he had sustained injuries while in custody. The judge also failed to place sufficient weight on the fact that the respondent never complained to the lock-up officers that he had been assaulted and that the doctors did not find any bruises or fractures on him even after conducting examinations and x-rays. At best, the respondent experienced mild tenderness, which was inconclusive as he merely showed signs of wincing in pain.
47        Nonetheless, I found that the first and second aspects of the judge’s findings were sufficient in raising a reasonable doubt that the respondent made his confession voluntarily. Against that background, I was unable to find that the judge misapplied the law or misapprehended the facts, or that her decision was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. It then followed that the trial judge’s finding that the respondent’s confession was inadmissible should not be interfered with since the Prosecution failed to reach the high threshold required to convince me that the trial judge’s findings of fact should be disturbed.
48        I now turn to the second issue raised by the Prosecution.
The circumstantial evidence before the court
49        The Prosecution acknowledged that if the confession were inadmissible, the remaining evidence would be wholly circumstantial. It averred, however, that the circumstantial evidence as a whole showed that the respondent had committed the theft. It further claimed that the trial judge had failed to accord sufficient weight to the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence.
The law on circumstantial evidence
50        It was laid down in 
Ang Sunny v PP
 
[1965–1968] SLR 67
 at 72, [14], that when the Prosecution is relying entirely on circumstantial evidence, the effect of all such evidence must lead the court “inevitably and inexorably” to one conclusion and one conclusion only: the accused’s guilt. Further, any notion that 
Ang Sunny
 
v PP
 laid down a higher standard of proof for cases where prosecution evidence is wholly circumstantial was dispelled in 
PP v Oh Laye Koh
 
[1994] 2 SLR 385
, at 392, [19], where the court stated that the same principle of guilt beyond reasonable doubt applies equally to cases where the prosecution evidence is wholly circumstantial as it does in those where direct evidence is adduced: 
PP v Nurashikin binte Ahmad Borhan
 
[2003] 1 SLR 52
 at [18].
51        In applying the principle of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the court is concerned with whether there is any other reasonably possible conclusion other than that the accused had committed the offence. The court is not concerned with “fanciful possibilit[ies]”: 
Nadasan Chandra Secharan v PP
 
[1997] 1 SLR 723
 at [89]. In 
Miller v Minister of Pensions
 [1947] 2 All ER 372, Denning J, as he then was, pertinently stated at 373:
If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence “of course it is possible, but not in the least probable,” the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.
52        Applying the above principles to the present facts, it was for me to decide, in light of the totality of the circumstantial evidence presented, whether an inevitable and inexorable inference could be drawn that the respondent committed the offence.
Whether the series of coincidences made the respondent’s defence impossible
53        The Prosecution argued that the respondent’s explanations for his sudden unexplained wealth were all fabrications because of the incredible series of coincidences that took place. To this end, it raised the following coincidences that were similarly canvassed before the trial judge:
(a)        The respondent was in the office until closing time when he disappeared for an hour. He gave Soo Thoo a bottle of whisky when it was common knowledge that the latter was a teetotaller.
(b)        On the night of 30 June 2003, the respondent suddenly decided to take the bank’s letter seriously and deposit money into his POSBank accounts.
(c)        On 1 July 2003, it was convenient for the respondent to pay his Singapore Power bill promptly for the first time since January 2003.
(d)        On 1 July 2003, he decided to redeem jewellery from the two pawnshops, and much of the money used comprised $10 notes, which tallied with HDB’s collection on 30 June 2003.
(e)        Rajaswari was in the habit of saving $10 notes.
(f)         Murugaiyah had a “friend” who gave him $15,000 for safekeeping on 2 July 2003, and it happened that that was also the day Murugaiyah decided that his late wife’s death anniversary prayers would be called off and he would deposit $1,400 into his account.
(g)        The respondent’s mother had $35,000 to spare for his bail when Rajaswari needed that amount.
(h)        The denominations of notes used by the respondent and his family members in all the transactions were within that of the HDB’s tally.
(i)         The respondent and Rajaswari did not generally keep track of the amount they keep at home but they knew for the purposes of the trial that they had about $22,000 to $25,000 at the time of the theft.
(j)         Although the respondent and Rajaswari had seven bank accounts between them, they preferred to keep their money at home.
(k)        The respondent preferred to pay the pawnshops interest rather than earn interest by depositing his money with the banks.
(l)         Although the respondent had over $20,000 in cash savings at home, he had his Internet connection terminated and almost never paid his bills on time in 2003.
54        Despite this series of coincidences, the trial judge found the explanations offered by the respondent and Rajaswari to be reasonably possible. In her view, it was conceivable that the respondent and Rajaswari could have been in possession of substantial amounts of cash from the respondent’s receipt of $35,000 from an insurance payout and $30,000 from Paul Foo in repayment of a loan. Together with Rajaswari’s savings of $10 notes over the years, which had resulted in the accumulation of a sum of money comprising $11,000 in $10 notes, the trial judge thought it eminently possible that the respondent had $22,000 to $25,000 in his house on 30 June 2003. The trial judge also accepted Rajaswari’s detailed account of how she had obtained the $50,000 required to bail out the respondent as believable.
55        Furthermore, the trial judge also found that there could be a variety of reasons why the respondent was not prompt in his bill payments. His tardiness did not necessarily mean that he was cash-strapped. The respondent had managed to pay his outstanding Singapore Power bills in May 2003. Thus, he was not so cash-strapped that he could not pay his bills at all. The installation of the security system in the respondent’s house also backed up his testimony that he kept large sums of cash and jewellery in his house.
56        I was unable to see how the respondent’s receipt of an insurance payout in 1999 could materially relate to his financial status four years later. This was especially so when the respondent was clearly short of money in 2003.
 On the same reasoning, since the respondent was unable to recall the period when he received the repayment of the $30,000 from Paul, it followed that this $30,000 was equally irrelevant to the respondent's financial status in 2003. 
As for Rajawari’s savings of $10 notes, I noted that she had stopped working as early as 1997. It was thus incredible that her savings amounted to $11,000 as at July 2003, which was a sum that substantially coincided with the number of $10 notes stolen from the Bukit Merah Branch.
57        In my opinion, Rajaswari’s detailed account of how she acquired the $50,000 required to bail out the respondent merely played up the shady nature of the respondent’s and his family’s financial dealings after the theft. I found it hard to believe that it was a mere coincidence that the respondent’s mother had $35,000 cash in her possession when that was the amount Rajaswari needed to borrow. Rajaswari had also claimed that her father had cancelled the death anniversary prayers for her mother on 2 July 2003. Thus, he deposited the money meant for the prayers on the same day. However, it seemed far-fetched that Rajaswari’s father would decide to cancel his wife’s death anniversary prayers in early July when the latter’s death anniversary was in November.
58        I also found that the respondent’s unusual habits of living off pawnshops, leaving his bills unpaid and his affairs unsettled rendered his defence highly suspicious. It was simply inconceivable that the respondent who allegedly hoarded his money painstakingly would opt to pay interest to pawnshops rather than earn interest from banks, especially when the respondent and Rajaswari had seven bank accounts between them. It defied logic that the respondent should have to pawn jewellery every time he was in need of money if he was as cash-rich as he claimed. He was clearly not flush with money even if he had installed an alarm system in his house. Moreover, seen against the fact that large sums of money were deposited into various accounts belonging to the respondent and his family members just hours after the money from the HDB went missing, his laborious attempts at explaining away the numerous coincidences rang hollow.
59        The trial judge found that the weakest part of the Prosecution’s case was that it did not address the issue of how the respondent had stolen the money without triggering the alarm or the motion detector in the Bukit Merah Branch.  In my opinion, it was difficult to see how the non-triggering of the alarm was materially connected to the plain fact that money had been stolen from the HDB without any signs of a break-in.  Based on the mass of evidence before me, it was clear that an irresistible inference of guilt on the respondent’s part could be drawn. In this light, it was pointless to consider the degree and probability of each item of evidence separately.            
60        While the trial judge conceded that the respondent’s behaviour was suspicious, she held that the Prosecution had failed to adduce more incriminating evidence that could remove doubts from her mind. In my view, the trial judge had placed unnecessary emphasis on certain factors while she failed to accord due weight to the probative force of the circumstantial evidence as a whole. It was clear that the series of undesigned and unexpected coincidences were not only suspicious, but were so damning that they collectively made the respondent’s defence a very fanciful possibility, if not impossible. Upon examining the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence, there was little doubt in my mind that no conclusion could be drawn other than that the respondent had committed the theft. Accordingly, I allowed the appeal and convicted the respondent on the charge.
The appropriate sentence to be passed
61        Having found that the respondent should rightfully be convicted of the offence, I turned to examine the appropriate sentence to be passed. Section 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) states:
Whoever, being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, commits theft in respect of any property in the possession of his master or employer, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
62        The offence attracts a mandatory imprisonment term. In 
Abdul Rahim bin Ali v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 269 of 1996, the accused claimed trial and was convicted of a charge under s 381 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. He had conspired to steal 168mt of plastic resin worth $581,000 from his employer. He had also arranged for the resin to be transported to his co-conspirator, and for a buyer for the resin. He had a clean record. He was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. On appeal, the accused’s appeal against sentence was abandoned: see 
[1997] 2 SLR 249
.
63        In 
Rajaynthran s/o Kasinathan v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 98 of 1995, the accused originally claimed trial to a charge under s 381 before pleading guilty to three charges under s 381 for stealing computer equipment in the possession of Singapore Airport Terminal Services Pte Ltd for whom he worked as a cargo assistant. The equipment in question was valued at about $570,000 and $900,000 for the first and second charges respectively. The offences were committed over a three-month period by the accused and two accomplices. The accused received $204,000 for his part in the theft but failed to make any restitution. He was a first-time offender. Two other charges were taken into account in sentencing. The trial court sentenced the accused to five years’ imprisonment on the first charge and six years’ imprisonment on the second charge. On appeal, the accused’s sentence on the first charge was reduced to four years’ imprisonment while the sentence on the second charge was reduced to five years’ imprisonment.
64        In 
Toh Chwee Yong v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 282 of 1995, the accused pleaded guilty to two charges under s 381 for stealing shares whilst employed as a clerk in the risk management unit of Citibank NA Singapore. The shares were valued at about $1.1m (the third charge) and about $74.8m (the fourth charge) respectively. The accused was responsible for accepting and verifying the lodgment of share scrips pledged to the bank. The share scrips were kept in an office safe. The accused knew the combination code to the safe and also had access to the key of the safe.
65        The accused stole the share scrips at her boyfriend’s instigation. Her boyfriend shared the sale proceeds from the shares with other accomplices. The accused did not receive any financial benefit or help in the disposal of the shares. The shares stolen amounted to over $75m in value and only about $50m worth of shares was recovered. The accused had a clean record. Two other charges were taken into account in sentencing. The trial court sentenced the accused to two years’ imprisonment on the third charge and five years’ imprisonment on the fourth charge. On appeal, the accused’s sentence was affirmed. 
66        In the present case, the respondent had stolen about $200,000 cash in the HDB’s possession. This was not a small amount. It was also the entire takings of the HDB’s Bukit Merah Branch for the day in question. While the respondent was not in a senior position, he had abused the trust reposed in him by the HDB where, as a banking cashier in the finance section, he was officially equipped with knowledge of the combination code of the safe and ostensibly given the access code to the strong room. As offences under s 381 of the Penal Code generally involve the offender abusing his employer’s trust, it is axiomatic that the greater the betrayal of trust, the more serious the offence will be.
67        In court, counsel for the respondent urged me to take into consideration the fact that the respondent was a first-time offender and that he had two children to support as the sole breadwinner. In my view, even if this was the respondent’s first conviction and given that an accused’s status as a first-time offender is generally accepted as having mitigating value (
Krishan Chand v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 291
), the above precedents have shown that a previous clean record is not of such compelling mitigating value as to prevent an imprisonment sentence of between two to five years for thefts of amounts between $570,000 to $1.1m from being imposed.
68        Additionally, any hardship to an accused’s family caused by his imprisonment is unavoidable and is not usually a factor that can affect what will otherwise be the right sentence: 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
. Counsel for the respondent did not show me that this was a case so unusual on its individual facts as to justify a departure from the general principle.
69        In the circumstances, bearing in mind that the regime of sentencing is a matter of law which takes into consideration a hotchpotch of such varied and manifold factors that no two cases can ever be completely identical in this regard (
Soong Hee Sin v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 253
), I sentenced the respondent to two years’ imprisonment.

Choo Han Teck J (delivering the judgment of the court):
1          The appellant was convicted on a charge of trafficking in a Class “A” controlled drug specified in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed). The drug in question was diamorphine with a gross weight of 583.04g and a net weight of 35.19g. The appellant was a 34-year-old rag-and-bone man who plied his trade in a rented cargo van, registration number GU9114C, which belonged to one Rahmah bte Arshad. Rahmah was not concerned in this case other than as the person who rented her vehicle to the appellant.
2          On 14 April 2003, about 12.10am, the appellant was driving the van along Hougang Avenue 7 with one Sazali bin Omar as his passenger. They were stopped by police officers Sergeant Pek Chee Keong (“Sgt Pek”) and Corporal Yeo Kee Hwa (“Cpl Yeo”) who were on patrol duty. The officers stopped the van because it was being driven without its headlights on.
3          The officers conducted a quick search of the van. Although at that time they saw nothing incriminating in the back compartment of the vehicle, Sgt Pek found a sachet of yellowish substance in the ashtray of the front compartment. At that point, Sazali threw something away and both he and the appellant ran in different directions. The two police officers gave chase and managed to capture the appellant. Sazali was caught later after police reinforcements arrived. After the two persons were brought back to the van, Sgt Pek searched the van again. This time he found three bags, namely, a black “Lafuma” brand bag which was a haversack, a black “Hayrer” brand bag, and a paper bag advertising “Soo Kee Jewellery”. The trial judge found that the evidence as to the precise spots from which these bags were found was not very satisfactory. However, it was clear from his findings that the bags were recovered from the front compartment of the van (as opposed to the rear cargo compartment). There was no challenge in respect of the “Hayrer” and “Soo Kee” bags, but the appellant disputed the prosecution evidence that the “Lafuma” bag was also found in the front compartment.
4          The “Lafuma” bag was found to contain a large packet of substance suspected to be heroin, a plastic bag containing 30 sachets of suspected heroin, another plastic bag containing 12 sachets of suspected heroin, a Ziploc bag containing seven sachets of suspected heroin, and a digital weighing scale. The “Hayrer” bag contained a plastic bag with several smaller plastic bags, 12 straws of suspected heroin, 13 empty straws, and a plastic bag containing ten white tablets. The “Soo Kee” bag had a Ziploc bag, which contained crystalline substances, as well as another container, which also had crystalline substances. Sgt Pek also found three sachets of yellowish substances on the ground at the front of the van. The Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) was notified of the arrests and discovery of the substances.
5          Inspector Sim Wui Tong (“Insp Sim”) arrived at the scene with his team of CNB officers and interviewed the appellant through a Malay interpreter. The evidence adduced at trial, with regard to this interview, was that the appellant confessed that the “Lafuma” bag, the Ziploc bag and the “Soo Kee” bag, as well as the heroin in the “Lafuma” and Ziploc bags, belonged to him. He also admitted that the substance known as “Tawas” in the “Soo Kee” bag belonged to him.
6          The appellant and Sazali were jointly charged for trafficking in the heroin seized from the van. Consequently, a statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) was recorded from the appellant. In it, he stated:
The heroin belongs to me. Sazali has nothing to do with the heroin. I want to plead for leniency as this is the first time encounter with this kind of stuff. That’s all.
The appellant also gave three other statements under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code. These are generally referred to as “investigation statements”. In these statements he gave an account of his involvement in the heroin trade. He stated that he was offered a parcel of heroin by a man known to him as “Ah Seng”. He purchased this heroin from Ah Seng for $15,000. He repacked the heroin and sold some to Sazali for $1,000. After selling to Sazali, the appellant gave Sazali a lift in the van and shortly after that the two of them were arrested when Sgt Pek and Cpl Yeo stopped the van.
7          The oral evidence of the appellant at trial differed significantly from the story in his statements. He testified that in referring to the “black bag” during his interview by Insp Sim he meant the “Hayrer”, and not the “Lafuma”, bag. His explanation was that the “Lafuma” bag was probably left in the van by Ah Seng. In his testimony he said that Ah Seng had borrowed his van on 12 April 2003 to transport some wares he had agreed to purchase from the appellant. He (Ah Seng) returned the van about 9.00pm on 13 April 2003. At that point a further deal was struck between them in that he (Ah Seng) would pay the appellant $500 for the wares he had taken, but would, in turn, sell ten sachets of heroin to the appellant for $3,000. The appellant agreed and took the heroin back home where he repacked part of the drugs into 12 straws, which he then put into the “Hayrer” bag together with another six of his own. He kept another four sachets in the ashtray in the front compartment of the van. He then went to meet Sazali to settle a debt in respect of drinks they had had previously. After that he gave Sazali a lift to Hougang where they were arrested at Avenue 7.
8          On appeal before us, the appellant’s first two grounds related to the judge’s finding that the “Lafuma” bag was in the possession of the appellant, and his rejection of the appellant’s explanations in court as to why he gave a different account in his statements to the police. No matter how the question is cast, the issue as to whether the “Lafuma” bag was in the front of the van together with the “Hayrer” and “Soo Kee” bags, or by itself in the rear of the van, was an issue of fact. The trial judge concluded that the “Lafuma” bag was in the possession of the appellant at the time of his arrest. There was nothing in the appellant’s appeal before us that warranted a pointed examination as to how those findings of fact were made. In this case, it was a matter of whether the appellant’s testimony in court adequately raised a reasonable doubt against the evidence adduced by the Prosecution which included the confessions of the appellant. The trial judge did not accept the appellant’s explanation. It was a finding that an appellate court will not interfere with, especially when it would have hinged on an evaluation of the appellant’s evidence in court.
9          The only ground of appeal that we ought to consider concerned the question of how the presumptions under ss 17(c) and 18(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act are to be used. For convenience, these two presumptions are set out verbatim:
Presumption concerning trafficking
17.        Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than —
(a)        100 grammes of opium;
(b)        3 grammes of morphine;
(c)        2 grammes of diamorphine;
(d)        15 grammes of cannabis;
(e)        30 grammes of cannabis mixture;
(f)        10 grammes of cannabis resin;
(g)        3 grammes of cocaine;
(h)        25 grammes of methamphetamine; or
(i)         10 grammes of any or any combination of the following:
(i)         N, α-dimethyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenethy-lamine;
(ii)        α-methyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenethyla-mine; or
(iii)       N-ethyl-α-methyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy)phene-thylamine,
whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose.
Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs
18.—(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control —
(a)        anything containing a controlled drug;
(b)        the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;
(c)        the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or
(d)        a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug, shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession.
10        The presumption under s 17 is one of trafficking, not of possession. Therefore, the Prosecution may invoke the presumption only after it has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person had the drugs in his possession. What then is meant by “possession” in this provision? That seemed to be the point counsel for the appellant was hoping to thrust before us. Relying on a brace of decisions from this court, namely in 
Low Kok Wai v PP
 
[1994] 1 SLR 676
 and 
Fun Seong Cheng v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 523
, counsel stressed that the obligation to prove possession must mean that the Prosecution had to prove “physical possession” of the drugs at the time of the arrest. So far, he has been correct. But, thereafter, counsel made an argument that, if accepted, would place an unreasonable strain on the meaning of the phrase “physical possession”. This term is not restricted to apply only where the drugs are found on the accused person physically. If a person walks into a restaurant with a bag in his hand and the knowledge that it contained drugs, he is clearly in physical possession of the bag and the drugs. The sense does not change when he places the bag on the ground next to him. The bag is physically detached from his person, but no one would argue that the bag was no longer in the physical possession of the man. Does the man lose physical possession if he leaves the bag where he had put it, and walks two steps to an adjoining table? We would think not. The question will then arise as to how far he needs to go before it can be said that the bag was no longer in his possession. That is a question of fact depending on the circumstances of the case. If the court finds that the man had left a considerable gap in terms of space and time between him and the bag, it may only mean that the stated timing of the moment of possession would have to be amended to reflect when it was that the man could still be regarded as being in possession of the bag.
11        Section 18, on the other hand, is a presumption of possession, not of trafficking. The material evidence, that the Prosecution needed to prove before the presumption can be invoked, is evidence that the accused person was in physical possession of a key to anything containing drugs, or of any container that contained drugs, or keys to any premises in which drugs are found, or of any document of title relating to drugs. It can easily be seen that s 18 is wider than s 17 and, consequently, there could be situations in which parts of it might overlap with s 17. The present case is an example in point. A person in possession of a bag of drugs, knowing that he was carrying a bag of drugs, would thus attract the application of s 17, but it would also naturally have attracted s 18(1)(a).
12        The trial judge found as a fact that the “Lafuma” bag was in the front compartment of the van of which the appellant was the driver at the material time. The judge further found that the bag belonged to the appellant. It was also found that the “Lafuma” bag contained the bulk of the heroin seized. The relevant part of his grounds (
[2004] SGHC 135
 at [59]) states as follows:
At the conclusion of my review of the evidence and the defence, I found the defence to be entirely unworthy of belief. There was no doubt in my mind that the accused was in possession of the Lafuma bag, the Hayrer bag and the heroin in them, as well as the sachet in the ashtray, and that he had admitted that they belonged to him.
However, on the evidence accepted by the trial judge, including the confession of the appellant to selling heroin to Sazali, no presumption of law under the Misuse of Drugs Act was in fact required to convict the appellant on the charge. Moreover, even if the trial judge had relied on the presumption under s 17 (as he was entitled to in this case), he had found no evidence to rebut it. Similarly, had the judge relied on the s 18 presumption, there was sufficient evidence of trafficking, and nothing sufficient to persuade the court to find a reasonable doubt. In cases such as the present, it is desirable that the court states whether its finding of guilt was based on direct evidence (as would be in this case), or under the presumption in s 17 or 18 as the case may be.
13        We are of the opinion that there was no error in fact or law that required us to set aside the conviction and sentence. The appeal was therefore dismissed.",2004-09-03 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Choo Han Teck J:
1          This was an application for an order of 
certiorari
 to quash the certification of a prison medical officer, Dr Ooi Poh Hin. Dr Ooi had certified that the applicant was fit to receive the punishment of caning imposed by a district court judge. The facts giving rise to the application are as follows. On 15 October 2003 the applicant, aged 22, pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery punishable under s 392 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), for robbing a man of his gold chain and handphone, and having put the man in fear of hurt in the course of the robbery. This offence carried a mandatory sentence of not less than 12 strokes of the cane. In the course of the oral mitigation plea, counsel for the applicant told the court that the applicant had Marfan’s Syndrome (sometimes referred to as “the Marfan syndrome”), and further directed that a medical report be produced to determine whether the applicant was fit for caning. A medical officer of the Queenstown Remand Prison, Dr Ooi Poh Hin, examined the applicant and produced a report dated 16 October 2004. The terse report merely stated that the doctor had examined the applicant on 16 October and that the applicant was found fit for caning. The district court judge stated at [17] of his grounds of judgment (see 
[2003] SGDC 284
) that:
It was not clear from the Mitigation Plea what Marfan Syndrome is, but the following posting on the web-site of the US National Marfan Organisation (
http://
www.marfan.org
) states that –
What is the Marfan syndrome?
The Marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder of the connective tissue that affects many organ systems, including skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart and blood vessels. The condition affects both men and women of any race or ethnic group. It is estimated that at least 200,000 people in the United States have the Marfan syndrome or a related connective tissue disorder.
What medical problems are associated with the Marfan syndrome?
1.         The Cardiovascular System
The most serious problems associated with the Marfan syndrome involve the cardiovascular system. The two leaflets of the mitral valve may billow backwards when the heart contracts (mitral valve prolapse). This can lead to leakage of the mitral valve or irregular heart rhythm.
In addition, the aorta, the main artery carrying blood away from the heart, is generally wider and more fragile in patients with the Marfan syndrome. This widening is progressive and can cause leakage of the aortic valve or tears (dissection) in the aorta wall. When the aorta becomes greatly widened, or tears, surgical repair is necessary.
2.         The Skeleton
Skeletal manifestations common in people with the Marfan syndrome include curvature of the spine (scoliosis), abnormally shaped chest
 
(pectus deformity), loose jointedness and disproportionate growth usually, but not always, resulting in tall stature.
2.         The Eyes
People with the Marfan syndrome are often near-sighted (myopic). In addition, about 50 percent have dislocation of the ocular lens.
2          On 29 October, the district court judge sentenced the applicant to four years and six months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. In his grounds, the district court judge, after noting the Internet description of Marfan’s Syndrome, stated (at [17]):
Although this appears to be a medical problem that can seriously affect a person’s health, there was nothing in the materials before me which showed that the accused was so affected. Therefore, while I accepted that the accused had a medical problem, as well as psychiatric and behavioural problems, these were of limited mitigating value.
On 31 October 2004 the applicant filed a Notice of Appeal against the sentence imposed by the District Court.
3          However, on 12 April 2004 the applicant applied before the High Court and sought leave under O 53 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed) to issue an application for an order of 
certiorari
 to quash the medical report of Dr Ooi Poh Hin dated 16 October 2004. The High Court (see 
[2004] 2 SLR 640
) granted the application and the relevant parts of the grounds of decision are set out as follows:
18         The argument is that the report dated 16 October 2003 will not be used as the basis for proceeding with the caning. At the time scheduled for caning, another certificate must be issued before caning is carried out.
19         That is correct, but it does not address the applicant’s concern over the medical assessment process. The provision does not require the medical officer to put up a report, only to issue a certificate that the offender is in a fit state of health to undergo caning. That is only to be done on the day of caning, and there is no provision for the certificate to be disclosed to the offender.
20         There is no assurance that the evaluation will be more thorough than the one carried out on 16 October 2003. If it is not, the applicant has a ground for complaint and redress.
21         Is it premature for him to seek redress now? When the respondent calls his action premature, that presupposes that there is a later, more appropriate time to do that. When I asked when that would be, there was no answer.
22         As the certification is to be done at the time of caning, how will the offender be able to seek redress after the certificate is issued, and before the caning is administered? If he is already caned by the time his application can be heard, it is too late to obtain the redress he seeks.
23         The argument that the application is premature, and should not be made until it is too late to prevent the risks of permanent and unintended injury, is self-defeating.
24         I suggested to counsel that the basic issue is the thoroughness of the medical assessment. The applicant’s concern is that he should not to be caned [
sic
] unless the medical risks and implications are considered more thoroughly than they were on 16 October 2003. If it can be arranged for a medical officer knowledgeable in Marfan Syndrome to examine him and his medical records and assess whether he is able to receive caning, then that would remove the basis of the complaint. When I asked if the respondent would agree to that, the suggestion was not taken up.
4          Before me, Mr Leong Kwang Ian, counsel for the respondent, advanced the same arguments that he made in the hearing at the leave stage, and Mr Rajandran, counsel for the applicant, likewise, made the same arguments, but this time both parties referred to various affidavits that were not previously used. Mr Leong referred to an affidavit of Dr Ooi Poh Hin dated 16 August 2004 and an affidavit of Dr Naranjan Singh of the same date. Counsel also relied on an affidavit of Terence Goh, the head of Operations Control of the Singapore Prisons Department. The applicant, in turn, referred to his affidavit dated 23 August 2004. For the purposes of the application for leave, the applicant relied on an affidavit of a general practitioner, Dr Paul Ho, dated 12 January 2004, and an ophthalmologist, Dr Lim Tock Han of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital dated 9 January 2004. Counsel for the applicant also referred to a medical report by a Dr C Sivathasan dated 16 January 2004. This medical report was not submitted by way of an affidavit and was handed to the judge during the application for leave. It is appropriate at this stage to deal with Dr Sivathasan’s medical report as well as the medical literature obtained by the district court judge through the Internet, in respect of which the High Court (see [3] 
supra
) made the following comment at [8] in regard to the dredging of Internet information:
The district judge’s initiative is commendable, but it is not a substitute for a proper medical report 
because he still did not get answers to the second and third questions
. [emphasis added]
5          Dr Sivathasan’s medical report is not evidence. If a medical report is deemed sufficiently important and the party concerned wishes to rely on it, it is incumbent upon that party to produce it as he would any other evidence, namely, by calling the maker on oath or affirmation, whether to give oral evidence in the witness box, or where the case permits, by way of an affidavit. There is no evidence properly adduced to show that Dr Sivathasan was in fact a doctor, or that the said report was made by him. A witness who is competent, compellable, and not excused under any statutory exemption (such as the exceptions to the direct evidence rule) cannot avoid being tested for lying under oath simply by not taking the oath. In respect of the use of the Internet information, that too was of no greater use than Dr Sivathasan’s medical report for similar reasons. The comment made in the previous hearing implied that had the district court judge found the answers to the second and third questions (
ie
, whether the applicant had Marfan’s Syndrome and whether caning would be fatal to him) it would have been acceptable for him to rely on the Internet information. For reasons that are apparent, such evidence would be immaterial and irrelevant. However, one might wish to pause and reflect on the wisdom of a judge, especially when he is sitting at first instance, in conducting his private research in matters of fact or on law. First, there might be no verification of the sources. Internet notices can be posted by well-qualified persons or by charlatans alike. Secondly, even if they were posted by the most renowned source, that source must be made available to the parties for clarification or cross-examination. Thirdly, a court of first instance is essentially a finder of fact. If its findings are to be respected, to the extent that an appellate court would not readily disturb them, the trier of fact must steadfastly maintain the neutrality of his role. He ought not to put himself in any position where he might have to defend his own conduct, be it in the rightness or wrongness of his effort, or in the discoveries he made, or in adopting a position taken without giving an opportunity to the parties to address the court on the merits of that position. Fourthly, when a judge undertakes the responsibility of research, can he be excused for errors and omission, or is he bound to exercise the same degree of care as counsel undertaking research? If so, in discharging his responsibilities in research, would he have distracted himself from the actual task of judging?
6          I now revert to the application proper. From the submission of Mr Rajandran and the affidavit evidence before me, it appears that counsel had aptly summarised the basis for the application as follows:
On the totality of the evidence before the court, there is still an inherent risk or real danger to be suffered by the applicant should he be caned and that in the circumstances, he should be spared the cane – to put the case of the applicant at its most basic level.
Section 232(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) provides that the “punishment of caning shall not be inflicted unless a medical officer is present and certifies that the offender is in a fit state of health to undergo such punishment”. It is not difficult to see that the punishment of caning is intended to achieve certain limited effects which do not include serious or permanent harm to the prisoner’s health. For that reason, a medical officer is duty bound to certify that the prisoner is fit for caning. That duty has to be performed under the requirements of s 232(1) of the CPC. The medical examination of the appellant by Dr Ooi Poh Hin on 16 October 2003 was not made under s 232(1) of the CPC because it was conducted under an order of court prior to sentencing. Section 232 of the CPC envisaged a post-sentence examination. The position becomes even clearer when one refers to s 233 of the CPC which provides for the continued detention of the prisoner who has his caning wholly or partially stopped so that he might be brought back to the court for a revision of his sentence. Furthermore, the provision under which the applicant was to be sentenced in this case, carried a sentence of mandatory caning. In such cases, the court is bound to impose the requisite sentence of caning. Whether the applicant in this case is fit to receive the punishment is a matter for the medical officer attending under s 232(1) of the CPC to determine subsequently.
7          Against the background of these statutory provisions, it is apparent that the applicant’s case that Dr Ooi Poh Hin’s certification ought to be quashed because he did not take into account matters in the 
Wednesbury
 sense (see 
Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v Wednesbury Corporation
 
[1948] 1 KB 223
), was misconceived. The making of this application indicated that the applicant had laboured under the mistaken belief that every act or conduct of a public servant is justiciable by way of a judicial review. In 
Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service
 
[1985] AC 374
, Lord Diplock held at 408 that:
The subject matter of every judicial review is a decision made by some person (or body of persons) whom I will call the “decision-maker” or else a refusal by him to make a decision.
To qualify as a subject for judicial review the decision must have consequences which affect some person (or body of persons) other than the decision-maker, although it may affect him too. It must affect such other person either:
(a)        by altering rights or obligations of that person which are enforceable by or against him in private law; or
(b)        by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past been permitted by the decision‑maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do so until there has been communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he had been given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-maker will not be withdrawn …
Lord Diplock further amplified what he said above by holding that:
For a decision to be susceptible to judicial review the decision-maker must be empowered by public law (and not merely, as in arbitration, by agreement between private parties) to make decisions that, if validly made, will lead to administrative action or abstention from action by an authority endowed by law with executive powers, which have one or other of the consequences, mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
8          The report by Dr Ooi was obviously a “decision” but that alone did not make Dr Ooi a “decision maker” in the sense explained in the Lord Diplock judgment above. The district court judge, as I had said, was duty bound to impose the sentence of caning irrespective of what Dr Ooi might have said in his report. Dr Ooi was a public servant discharging what I might call a “non-decision making” duty in the Diplock sense. Further examples of non-decision making conduct include acts of police officers such as in the arrest of a person suspected of committing an offence. Such decisions of an arresting officer are not amenable to judicial review. The rights of the arrested person lie in the criminal, as well as civil, law – not in an administrative action. A public officer performing such duties cannot be made accountable by way of judicial review because the law would have provided avenues for redress in the case of any error or wrongdoing on the part of the public officer. Sometimes the redress might not be adequate or obtained in time but that does not detract from the schematic structure of the complainant’s legal remedies. An arrested person might be freed or charged. If he is charged, he may defend himself at trial. If he is found guilty, he has his right of appeal. The arresting officer cannot be made to account for his action as to whether he had exercised 
Wednesbury
 reasonableness in deciding to arrest a suspect. Every public officer will have made numerous decisions on a daily basis. They cannot all be accountable for each and every one of those decisions in an administrative action, even if they affect another person or body of persons, otherwise the entire apparatus of public service might cease to function. Similarly, a medical officer performing his duty in determining whether a prisoner is fit for caning is not a “decision maker” in the Diplock sense. The substantive administrative action would have been the decision of the judge who ordered the caning. The remedy in the case of any dissatisfaction with that order lies in the appeal process. In the case of the medical officer reporting under a s 232 (1) situation, the substantive administrative action, or the Diplock “decision making” function, lies with the prison authority which may stop the caning. If it does not exercise that function, the remedy lies in an action against the prison authority for failing to discharge its statutory duty. For these reasons, the applicant had no merit in applying for leave to issue an application for an order of 
certiorari
. Accordingly, this application before me must be dismissed.
9          Mr Rajandran submitted that the crucial point in this application lay in Dr Ooi’s failure to take into account the real possibility that caning the applicant would be “potentially dangerous to [him].” It has to be noted, however, that the question whether the applicant was, in fact, suffering from Marfan’s Syndrome was not fully addressed before me. Dr Paul Ho, the general practitioner who examined the applicant on 10 November 2003 (after the applicant had been sentenced) reported that the applicant “has the features of Marfan’s Syndrome” but he did not explain which features and the degree in which they had manifested in the applicant. Dr Lim Tock Han, the ophthalmologist, reported that the applicant had features “suggestive of Marfan’s Syndrome” and was, in his opinion, a “glaucoma suspect”. Dr Ooi himself did not diagnose the applicant to have Marfan’s Syndrome, but noted that the applicant’s medical record in the army indicated that he had. That record was only indicative of the applicant’s medical history. For the purposes of s 232 of the CPC, it would be incumbent upon the examining doctor to make an independent finding. On the available evidence, it would be fair to conclude that there were indications that the applicant might indeed have Marfan’s Syndrome, but that is not the relevant issue. Mr Rajandran further argued that the point that we had to address was whether Dr Ooi was aware of the possibility that the applicant had Marfan’s Syndrome, and if so, whether the doctor took that into account. From his affidavit, Dr Ooi noted that the medical record from the Singapore Armed Forces referred to the medical downgrading of the applicant because of Marfan’s Syndrome. Dr Ooi then went on to say that he did not think caning would affect the applicant, and that in any event, there would be another medical examination before the caning could take place.
10        Whether or not there was, in fact, a correct diagnosis of Marfan’s Syndrome would not be crucial in a case for judicial review. However, it would be relevant to know whether the doctor had taken that possibility into account. Ultimately, this was not a judicial review case at all. Whether Dr Ooi was right or wrong in his diagnosis of the applicant, and whether he had taken the possibility of Marfan’s Syndrome into account, was not a relevant issue because the district court judge was bound to pass the sentence of mandatory caning in any event. The 
Wednesbury
 reasonableness principle, though clearly irrelevant, had been the subject of reference at many points in this case. And at the application for leave stage, the court formed the view that a failure to consider the applicant’s medical record would amount to 
Wednesbury
 unreasonableness. The court then cited Lord Greene MR’s judgment from the case from which we received the eponym 
Wednesbury
 reasonableness – 
Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v Wednesbury Corporation
 (see [7] 
supra
) at 228:
The exercise of such a discretion must be a real exercise of the discretion. If, in the statute conferring the discretion, there is to be found expressly or by implication matters which the authority exercising the discretion ought to have regard to, then in exercising the discretion it must have regard to those matters. Conversely, if the nature of the subject matter and the general interpretation of the Act make it clear that certain matters would not be germane to the matter in question, the authority must disregard those irrelevant collateral matters.
The High Court at the leave stage in the present matter (see [3] 
supra
) then stated (at [38]) that:
Here the applicant is complaining that the medical assessment ought to have regard to his medical history and his known medical condition. It is clearly arguable that it is implied that his medical history and condition must be considered, and that an omission to do that amounts to 
Wednesbury
 unreasonableness.
11        If the district court judge had rejected the report and decided not to impose caning, the Prosecution would have rightly appealed against that decision. Likewise, had the judge accepted the report as he might have done (he could have ignored it altogether), the applicant’s recourse would have been to appeal on the ground that the judge should not have acted on a flawed report. Of course, given the law as I have stated above, such an appeal would be doomed to fail since the district court judge did not have a discretion not to impose the punishment of caning. The applicant cannot hope to recover a lost cause by attacking the secondary source. If that were allowed, a party who is unhappy with a trial judge’s judgment, but who has no valid grounds of appeal, may be tempted to attack the evidence of witnesses such as the psychiatric expert, the prison doctor, the doctors examining the accused in a pre-statement medical examination and so on, on the basis that they had not taken various matters into account and, therefore, acted unreasonably in the 
Wednesbury
 sense. For the reasons above, I am of the opinion that it would be a pointless and unwarranted exercise to proceed to ask here, whether Dr Ooi had acted reasonably in the 
Wednesbury
 sense.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          This was a petition by Hong Leong Finance Limited (“HLF”) seeking criminal revision of the order for forfeiture of a vehicle made on 23 June 2003 under s 32(1) of the Wholesome Meat and Fish Act (Cap 349A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“WMFA”). I dismissed the petition and now give my reasons.
The facts
2          The petitioner, HLF, was the owner of a reefer truck bearing registration number YJ955K (“the vehicle”) by virtue of a hire purchase agreement entered into on 2 April 2002 with one Tan Kian Chye (“Tan”).
3          On 1 April 2003 at about 9.30am, officers from the Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (“the AVA”) attended to a complaint regarding the importation of meat products from Malaysia. The meat products were purportedly being stored at No 34 Jalan Siglap Singapore 678563 (“the premises”).
4          Upon arrival at the premises, the AVA officers spotted Tan, who was about to drive off in the vehicle. The AVA officers immediately stopped Tan from leaving the premises and proceeded to check the vehicle. They found 2,340kg of pig intestines in the vehicle and another 1,960kg of pig intestines in the freezers at the premises.
5          
Tan admitted to having imported the pig intestines from Malaysia. He also informed the AVA officers that the premises were used for the storage and processing of the pig intestines. Tan was subsequently charged with having in his possession meat products, which were imported from Malaysia without a permit, for the purpose of selling, an offence under s 23(1)(a) of the WMFA (“the first charge”). In addition, he was also charged with operating a processing establishment without a licence from the Director-General of the AVA, an offence under s 12(1) of the WMFA (“the second charge”).
6          
On 17 June 2003, Tan pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced on 23 June 2003 to a total of 14 months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of $30,000.
7          
Consequent to Tan’s conviction, the court ordered that the vehicle be forfeited under s 32 of the WMFA by the AVA (“the forfeiture order”). HLF was only informed of the vehicle’s forfeiture on 23 June 2003, after the order was made. Tan did not appeal against conviction, and no grounds were given for the judge’s decision.
8          
On 1 July 2003, counsel for HLF wrote to inform the AVA that HLF would be applying to the High Court for a criminal revision to set aside the forfeiture order. On 16 July 2003, counsel also wrote to the Attorney‑General’s Chambers (“the AGC”) requesting them to take up an application for criminal revision of the forfeiture order.
9          By their reply dated 4 August 2003, the AGC declined to take up the application. However, HLF took no further action for a year. On 12 June 2004, the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) wrote to counsel to ask if HLF still intended to file a petition for criminal revision, without confirmation of which the AVA would dispose of the vehicle.
10        On 21 June 2004, a year after the forfeiture order was made, counsel for HLF filed the present petition for criminal revision.
The petition
11        HLF submitted that it suffered hardship and serious injustice and that the trial court was wrong in ordering forfeiture of the vehicle as HLF was deprived of the opportunity to be heard before the order was made. The court therefore did not have regard to all the circumstances of the case in ordering the forfeiture. HLF also relied on the fact that it was an innocent party and had acted in a reasonably prudent manner in granting the hire purchase facilities to Tan.
12        
HLF therefore sought to have the forfeiture order set aside and the matter remitted to the subordinate court for the holding of a disposal inquiry with regard to the vehicle, where HLF would be given an opportunity to make representations to the court as to why the vehicle should not be forfeited.
The respondent’s case
13        The DPP submitted that the forfeiture order should not be set aside as the order of forfeiture was justified due to the gravity of the offence. Morever, even if HLF had suffered injustice, which was not conceded, the force of such injustice was greatly diminished by the delay of one year before HLF filed the present petition.
Principles of revision
14        The High Court’s revisionary powers are conferred by s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) and s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). It is established law that such powers of revision are discretionary and must be exercised sparingly. The test laid down by the courts is whether the failure to exercise revisionary powers will result in serious injustice being done. No precise definition of what constitutes serious injustice is possible. However, it must generally be shown that there was something palpably wrong in the decision by the court below, which strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power: see 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
, followed in 
Magnum Finance Bhd v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 523
 and 
Credit Corporation (M) Bhd v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 762
.
Whether the trial court should have exercised its discretion to forfeit
15        
The vehicle was forfeited under s 32 of the WMFA, which provides that:
(1) The court … may make an order for the forfeiture of any item which has been seized under the provisions of this Act if —
(a)        the court is satisfied that —
an offence under this Act or the rules has been committed; and
the item seized was the subject-matter, or was used in the commission, of the offence; and
(b)        having regard to the circumstances of the case, the court thinks it fit to order the forfeiture of the item.
16        There is no doubt that the elements of s 32(1)(a)(i) and (ii) were satisfied and that the vehicle was used in the commission of an offence under the Act.
17        The issue before me, therefore, was whether, in the circumstances before the court, the forfeiture order was justified.
18        I have stated that owners of vehicles ought to be charged to enable them to defend themselves:
 
Chandra Kumar v PP
 
[1995] 3 SLR 123
 and
 
Ang Poh Chuan
 
(at [14]
 
supra
). On the other hand, the courts have no duty to conduct an investigation into the ownership of the vehicle before ordering its forfeiture. Furthermore, HLF itself admitted that the Prosecution had no positive statutory duty to inform it of the intended forfeiture.
19        
In a case such as this where the offence is serious, the courts’ concern is to prevent the vehicle from being used in the commission of further offences. Moreover, the lack of opportunity to be heard only amounts to hardship on the part of finance companies: 
Ang Poh Chuan
 (at [14] 
supra
). Such hardship does not by itself lead to a finding of injustice upon which a criminal revision must be premised. To show injustice, it would have to be further shown that the trial court had erred in ordering forfeiture. It is to this issue that I now turn.
20        HLF relied on the case of 
Chandra Kumar v PP
, where
 
I had accepted that the degree of complicity of the petitioner in the offence and the fact that the petitioner could not reasonably have taken any preventive measures regarding the use of the vehicle in the commission of the offence were relevant considerations for the court in exercising its discretion to forfeit. I also accepted that the value of the vehicle was relevant in so far as it should be considered whether forfeiture was proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the maximum punishment that could be imposed.
21        
HLF also relied on the case of
 
Tanglin Cars Pte Ltd v PP
 
[1997] 1 SLR 428
, where I had stated that
 
it would also have to be shown that the petitioners were so grossly negligent in the manner they conducted their business that it could be said that they were “tainted with complicity” in having shown reckless disregard for the consequences of the use of their vehicle.
22        HLF submitted that it was an innocent party which did not connive or participate in or benefit from the offence Tan committed.
 
HLF further submitted that it was reasonably prudent in granting the hire purchase facilities to Tan.
 
HLF argued that it had verified the income of Tan and was satisfied that Tan’s debt serving ratio was sufficient for him to service the instalments. The vehicle was a refrigerated motor lorry which HLF believed was to be used for Tan’s legitimate business of supplying frozen food. The hire purchase agreement further provided that the vehicle should not be used contrary to law, and that in the event of such a breach of the agreement, HLF would be entitled to resume possession of the vehicle.
23       
 
However, this was not the first time that a finance company had argued its innocence before the court. In
 
PP v Mayban Finance (Singapore) Ltd
[1998] 1 SLR 462
, an order was made to forfeit a lorry under hire purchase which had been used to transport illegal workers. In that case, I stated at [33] and [34] that:
I was aware that this case could have tremendous repercussions on the finance or car rental companies. It is unfortunate that they should be the unwitting victims. In most cases, the finance companies would have no knowledge of the background of the applicant under the hire-purchase agreement. However, the finance and car rental companies could take certain precautions, 
eg
 requiring a guarantee from the purchasers of vehicles under hire-purchase agreements. This would increase the cost of persons using such vehicles for their business. However, I am confident that the slight increase in cost should not deter them from doing business. …
[T]he courts have to warn finance and car rental companies to take more precautions when entering into hire-purchase or rental agreements for their vehicles.
24        I reiterated (at [38]) in 
Credit Corporation (M) Bhd v PP
(at [14] 
supra
) that:
Car rental and finance companies should modify their trade practices to cover themselves. The cost will be passed down to car hirers or borrowers. With the deterrent effect of pecuniary loss, all parties will be made to be more careful in handling their vehicles
25        Finance companies are responsible for the use of their vehicles and for protecting themselves against loss of their vehicles. Finance companies are well aware of the 
commercial risk
 associated with lending out vehicles on hire purchase. Therefore, they should inquire more carefully about the customer’s occupation and place of work. If finance companies find difficulty in keeping watch on the use of their vehicles, they should insure themselves against the loss of their vehicles and, if they so desire, have the customer pay the cost of the insurance premiums.
26        
It was undisputed that HLF was an innocent party and that HLF had been reasonably prudent in granting the hire purchase facilities to Tan. Nevertheless, I agreed with the DPP’s contention that the trial court was justified in ordering the forfeiture of the vehicle due to the seriousness of the offence. In the present case, the amount of illegally imported meat products was immense, involving almost five tonnes of pig intestines. The meat, had it been diseased or contaminated, could potentially have had an adverse impact on the health of Singapore’s population if Tan had not been arrested in time.
27        I was thus of the view that forfeiture was appropriate due to the grave nature of the offence. The maximum punishment under s 23(2) WMFA is a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both. In this case, the offence was serious, and Tan was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $30,000. The value of the vehicle under the hire purchase agreement was $83,576. In the light of the gravity of the offence and the maximum punishment prescribed by the statute, it was evident to me that forfeiture of the vehicle was not a disproportionate order. I therefore found that t
he court below had correctly exercised its discretion to forfeit the vehicle.
28       
 
I recognised that it would have been desirable for HLF to have been given the opportunity to make submissions to the court below as to why the vehicle should not be forfeited. However, having regard to the circumstances of the case, I had no doubt that the lower court would nevertheless have come to the same conclusion and forfeited the vehicle.
 Therefore, as n
o injustice had been caused by the forfeiture order, I saw no reason to remit the case back to the subordinate court for a disposal inquiry and dismissed the petition for criminal revision. Nevertheless, I made the following observations on HLF’s delay in bringing the application for revision.
Delay
29        A party seeking revision must bring its application promptly. The effect of delay was clearly laid down in 
Ang Poh Chuan
 (at [14] 
supra
). In that case, I stated that while, in a case of injustice generally, delay would not be material, delay might indicate that there was in fact no injustice caused or that the force of any injustice was seriously attenuated by the delay, such that no exercise of the discretion ought to be made in favour of the petitioner.
30        Although HLF promptly wrote to the AGC asking them to take up a criminal revision after learning of the forfeiture order, it did not take further action for a year after receiving the AGC’s refusal to take up the application. The reasons given were, firstly, that delay was caused by counsel regarding the appropriate procedure, parties and correct forms to use in these proceedings. The delay was also caused by the HLF’s various overtures for cooperation from its agents who processed the application forms for hire purchase financing and the verification of income documents to ensure that Tan was in the financial position to pay the instalments due under the hire purchase agreement.
31       
 
In my view, HLF had not offered any credible explanation for the delay of almost a year. Counsel’s failure to ascertain the appropriate proceedings certainly did not justify such a delay. Furthermore, I found it difficult to see how the verification of Tan’s financial position, post-forfeiture, was relevant. In fact, such an argument was inconsistent with and would seem to undermine HLF’s earlier position that it acted reasonably prudently in the first place, in granting Tan the hire purchase facility, having previously assessed his debt serving ratio to be sufficient to service the instalments.
32       
 
In fact, as the DPP also pointed out, it was reasonable to infer from the circumstances that the petition for criminal revision was filed only in response to the letter from the Prosecution to counsel asking them to confirm HLF’s position, and the delay would have been longer if the Prosecution had not so written. The fact that HLF petitioned for criminal revision only one year after the forfeiture order was made further indicated that the forfeiture of the vehicle has had little, if any, adverse impact on it.
 The delay by HLF was inconsistent with its argument of having suffered gross injustice.
33       
 
Therefore, even if HLF had been a victim of injustice by virtue of the forfeiture order, which it was not, any injustice it suffered would have been attenuated by the considerable delay in bringing the petition and the failure to adequately explain the delay.
Conclusion
34        The lower court had rightly exercised its discretion to forfeit the vehicle. HLF’s delay in bringing the petition was also without excuse. The petition for criminal revision was accordingly dismissed.

Tay Yong Kwang J (delivering the judgment of the court):
1
         
 This is an application by motion made by the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”) to a court of three judges to make absolute an order to show cause under s 98(5) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”). It involves another sad case of the court having to impose the ultimate professional sanction on an advocate and solicitor.
The facts
2
         
 Junaini bin Manin (“the respondent”), 46 years old, is an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore of some 18 years’ standing, having been called to the Bar on 10 December 1986. He joined the firm of M/s Wong Khalis & Partners and became one of its partners in 1990. In 1995, he formed the partnership of M/s Junaini & Jailani with another advocate and solicitor. In 1999, he left the partnership and became the sole proprietor of M/s Junaini & Co.
3
         
 On 9 June 2003, Suratemin bin Ali (“Suratemin”), one of the respondent’s clients, lodged a police report alleging that the respondent had misappropriated a sum of $789,200, representing the proceeds of sale of a house which belonged to the said client’s late mother. Following this, police reports were also lodged by four other clients alleging misappropriation of their money by the respondent. On 28 August 2003, the respondent was arrested and remanded.
 
4
         
 Between August 2003 and January 2004, the Public Prosecutor preferred 13 charges of criminal breach of trust under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) against the respondent but subsequently proceeded on only five of these charges. On 25 February 2004, the respondent pleaded guilty in a district court to those five charges and agreed to have the other eight charges taken into consideration for sentencing. He was sentenced by the district court to a total of seven years’ imprisonment with the commencement of the sentences backdated to the date of remand, said to be 25 August 2003. However, the Statement of Facts (reproduced by the district judge in his grounds of decision) supporting the charges stated the date of arrest and remand as 28 August 2003. Nonetheless, nothing in the application before us turns on this apparent discrepancy in the dates.
5
         
 We now set out briefly the facts relating to the said five charges.
Facts relating to the first charge
6
         
 The complainant was Suratemin, who was the legal administrator and one of the beneficiaries to the estate of his late mother. On 6 March 1989, Suratemin and the other beneficiaries entered into a joint venture agreement to develop the plot of land that formed part of their late mother’s estate. This joint venture agreement was later assigned to Heng Properties Pte Ltd (“HPPL”). A civil suit over payment eventually arose between the beneficiaries and HPPL.
7
         
 Sometime in 1991, Suratemin engaged the respondent to settle the dispute. The respondent was then in the firm of Wong Khalis & Junaini. When the respondent left that firm, he continued representing Suratemin. The matter was later settled out of court. On 6 December 1996, the respondent received a cheque for $789,200 from HPPL’s solicitor made in favour of his firm. He deposited this cheque into the firm’s client account. However, he did not disburse the money to Suratemin or the other beneficiaries. Instead, he issued a cheque for $729,200 from the client account and deposited it into his personal account.
8
         
 On those facts, the respondent pleaded guilty to the following charge:
You, Junaini Bin Manin, Male 46 years, NRIC No: S1266992-E, are charged that you, between the 6
th
 day of December 1996 and the 11
th
 day of December 1996 at Junaini & Jailani Advocates & Solicitors, located at No 69 Geylang Serai, Geylang Serai Malay Village, Singapore, being the attorney of one Suratemin Bin Ali and entrusted with certain property, to wit, $789,200, being the agreed settlement fee arising from an Originating Summon no 633 of 1995 against Heng Properties, did commit criminal breach of trust, to wit, by dishonestly misappropriating a sum of $729,200 and converting it to your own use and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 409 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
Facts relating to the second charge
9
         
 Sometime around April 2001, Zahrah bte Jaafar (“Zahrah”) engaged the respondent for the sale of her late father’s property. The respondent received the sale proceeds of $1,200,002.20 from the buyer’s solicitors between 23 April 2001 and 30 October 2001, 
via
 cheques and cashier’s orders made in favour of his firm’s client account. Subsequently, between November and December 2001, the respondent disbursed $1,030,524.90 to Zahrah and eight other beneficiaries, $15,000 to his firm’s account as his legal fees and $12,360 as commission to the housing broker. However, the respondent did not disburse the balance sum of $142,117.30 to the beneficiaries. He dishonestly misappropriated this sum between 23 April 2001 and 29 January 2002.
10
       
 The charge against the respondent read as follows:
You, Junaini Bin Manin, Male 46 years, NRIC No: S1266992-E, are charged that you, between the 23
rd
 April 2001 and 29
th
 January 2002, in Singapore, being a practising advocate and solicitor and the sole proprietor of Messrs Junaini & Co, and entrusted in the way of your business as an agent with dominion over property, namely a sum of $142,117.30, entrusted to you by your client Zahrah Bte Jaafar, did dishonestly misappropriate the said sum by converting it to your own use and you have thereby committed an offence of Criminal Breach of Trust As An Agent, punishable under Section 409 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
Facts relating to the third charge
11
       
 Sometime in early 2003, Haji Syed Sultanul Aidin bin Abdul Mutaif (“Haji Syed”) engaged the respondent for the sale of his property. Between 10 March 2003 and 10 May 2003, the respondent received a total of $220,331.24 from the buyer’s solicitors. The respondent deposited this sum into his firm’s account. He later issued a cheque for $130,000 to Haji Syed, a cheque for $3,267 being his legal fees and another cheque for $260 to the solicitor representing the mortgagee bank.
12
       
 However, the respondent did not disburse the balance sum of $86,804.24 to Haji Syed but instead dishonestly misappropriated this sum. The charge brought against him was framed in the following terms:
You, Junaini Bin Manin, Male 46 years, NRIC No: S1266992-E, are charged that you, between the 28
th
 day of May 2003 and the 4
th
 day of June 2003, in Singapore, being a practising advocate and solicitor and the sole proprietor of Messrs Junaini & Co, and entrusted in the way of your business as an agent with dominion over property, namely a sum of $86,804.24, entrusted to you by your client Haji Syed Sultanul Aidin Bin Abdul Mutaif, did dishonestly misappropriate the said sum by converting it to your own use and you have thereby committed an offence of Criminal Breach of Trust As An Agent, punishable under Section 409 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 
Facts relating to the fourth charge
13
       
 Sometime in September 2000, Leong Lai Chan (“Leong”) engaged the respondent for her divorce proceedings against her ex-husband and for the completion of the sale of her matrimonial flat. Eventually, the solicitors acting for the buyer of the flat issued the final payment of $367,043.39 for the property 
via
 a cashier’s order and a cheque made in favour of Junaini & Co.
14
       
 The respondent deposited this amount into his firm’s account. He later issued a cheque for $50,000 to Leong and disbursed a sum of $15,000 being his legal fees. However, he did not disburse the balance of $302,043.39 to Leong and her ex-husband but instead dishonestly misappropriated it. For this, the charge against him read as follows:
You, Junaini Bin Manin, Male 46 years, NRIC No: S1266992-E, are charged that you, between the 18
th
 day of February 2003 and the 30
th
 day of June 2003, in Singapore, being a practising advocate and solicitor and the sole proprietor of Messrs Junaini & Co and entrusted in the way of your business as an agent with dominion over property, namely a sum of $302,043.39, entrusted to you by your clients namely Leong Lai Chan and Wong Fook Theem, did dishonestly misappropriate the said sum by converting it to your own use and you have thereby committed an offence of Criminal Breach of Trust As An Agent, punishable under Section 409 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
 
Facts relating to the fifth charge
15
       
 Sometime in 1998, Surianah bte Ahmad (“Surianah”) engaged the respondent to act for the estate of her late nephew. Following her nephew’s death, her nephew’s employers applied for and obtained a sum of $100,000 from the insurance company involved under the workmen’s compensation scheme. Two cheques, one for $20.19 (being the 
pro rata
 salary of the said deceased nephew) and the other for $100,000, were then issued by the employers in favour of Junaini & Co. These cheques were deposited in the firm’s client account.
16
       
 However, the respondent did not disburse the money to Surianah but instead dishonestly misappropriated the money. For this, the charge against him was:
You, Junaini Bin Manin, Male 46 years, NRIC No: S1266992-E, are charged that you, between 12
th
 August 1998 and 22
nd
 April 1999, in Singapore, being a practising advocate and solicitor and the sole proprietor of Messrs Junaini & Co, and entrusted in the way of your business as an agent with dominion over property, namely a sum of $100,020.19, entrusted to you by your client Surianah Bte Ahmad, did dishonestly misappropriate the said sum by converting it to your own use and you have thereby committed an offence of Criminal Breach of Trust As An Agent, punishable under Section 409 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
17
       
 The respondent dishonestly misappropriated a total of $1,360,185.12 in the commission of the five offences set out above. If the amounts stated in the other eight charges are taken into consideration, the total that the respondent misappropriated would be $1,682,929.55. There were altogether 12 clients who fell victim to the defalcation. The respondent used the misappropriated money to pay for his housing loan, his vehicle loans in respect of three cars, credit card bills and other personal expenses. There was no restitution made by the respondent.
18
       
 The district judge sentenced the respondent to the following terms of imprisonment:
First charge 
                
 -
          
 four years and six months
Second charge
            
 -
          
 two years
Third charge
                
 -
          
 18 months
Fourth charge
              
 -
          
 two years and six months
Fifth charge
                 
 -
          
 two years
He ordered the imprisonment terms for the first and the fourth charges to run consecutively, resulting in a total term of seven years.
The show cause proceedings
19
       
 As the respondent was convicted of an offence involving dishonesty, the Law Society, in accordance with s 94A of the LPA, made an application under s 98 of the LPA for the respondent to show cause why he should not be dealt with under the provisions of s 83 of the LPA. The order to show cause was made on 6 May 2004 and the Law Society subsequently took out this motion on 11 May 2004 to make the said order absolute.
20
       
 The respondent, currently serving sentence, was served personally in Changi Prison on 17 May 2004 with a copy each of the affidavit filed in support of this originating summons, the Order of Court dated 6 May 2004 and the motion filed on 11 May 2004. By a reply slip dated 25 June 2004 addressed to the solicitors for the Law Society, the respondent confirmed that he did not wish to be heard by the court of three judges and that the hearing could proceed in his absence.
21
       
 Section 83(6) of the LPA makes it clear that a court of three judges must accept the respondent’s conviction as final and conclusive. In 
Law Society of Singapore v Loh Wai Mun Daniel
 
[2004] 2 SLR 261
, Yong Pung How CJ, in delivering the judgment of the court, said:
6
         
 The respondent was not represented, nor was he present to make any submissions before us on this point. Nevertheless, by virtue of the fact that this court must accept his criminal convictions as final and conclusive: 
Law Society of Singapore v Wong Sin Yee
 
[2003] 3 SLR 209
, there was little that could have been said in this respect. Given that the offence involved dishonesty committed in his capacity as advocate and solicitor, that, in itself, was sufficient for this court to determine that due cause had been shown under s 83(2)(a) of the LPA, which provides as follows:
Such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence, implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession.
7
         
 As such, the sole issue that concerned this court was the determination of the appropriate order to be made under s 83(1) of the LPA.
Appropriate order to be made
8
         
 Where a solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence involving fraud or dishonesty, the court has almost invariably, no matter how strong the mitigating factors, chosen to strike a solicitor off the roll: 
Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel
 
[1999] 1 SLR 696
.
9
         
 In this case, we saw no reason to depart from the norm. This appeared to us to be a typical case of a solicitor who could not be trusted to keep his paws out of the honey pot.
22
       
 In that case, Loh Wai Mun Daniel, an advocate and solicitor of about 11 years’ standing, pleaded guilty to four counts of criminal breach of trust under s 409 of the Penal Code and consented to have four other such counts taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. In all, a sum of $881,887.68 was misappropriated between 1997 and 2001. He was sentenced to a total of four and a half years’ imprisonment.
23
       
 In 
Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Caleb Charles James
 
[2004] 2 SLR 256
 (“
Ezekiel’s
 case”), heard by the same court of three judges and on the same day as 
Law Society of Singapore v Loh Wai Mun Daniel
, an advocate and solicitor of 20 years’ standing was convicted, upon his plea of guilt, on one count of criminal breach of trust under s 406 of the Penal Code. Three other such counts were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He had made unauthorised withdrawals totalling $128,000 from the law firm’s omnibus clients’ account and paid the money to the Public Trustee in order to conceal his negligence in settling a suit in excess of the mandate given to him by his client. He eventually made full restitution of the money taken by him in this manner. He was sentenced to two weeks in prison. While appreciating that he “did not set out to defraud his clients and that his folly derived mainly from his negligence in settling a suit without mandate” (at [11]), the court nevertheless ordered him to be struck off the roll.
24
       
 These recent cases demonstrate that dishonesty committed in the capacity of an advocate and solicitor is tantamount to professional suicide. It did not appear to matter that the convictions in the two instances cited above were under two provisions of the criminal law with very pronounced differences in the possible maximum punishments. Section 406 of the Penal Code stipulates a maximum term of imprisonment of three years or a fine or both while s 409 of the same code allows the court to impose imprisonment for life or for a term of up to ten years, together with a fine. It also did not seem to matter that the actual imprisonment sentences meted out differed significantly in length reflecting the respective severity of the offences, the amounts embezzled and the personal circumstances of the advocates and solicitors in the cases in question.
25
       
 The settled position in such cases of proven dishonesty is, therefore, that mitigating factors do not tilt the balance towards the more lenient sanctions of suspension from practice for up to five years and of censure provided in s 83(1) of the LPA except where they are consistent with the objectives of preserving the good name of the legal profession and of the protection of the public (
Ezekiel’s
 case at [10]).
26
       
 These were the mitigating factors that we could glean from the district judge’s grounds of decision: the respondent was a first offender; he was the principal breadwinner for his two families (a 17-year-old son from his first marriage and a four-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter from the second marriage); he pleaded guilty at the first instance and had co-operated with the police; he had lost nearly half a million dollars in bad investments and had committed the offences out of sheer desperation; he was remorseful and had returned from Australia to face the music; his failure to make restitution was not a deliberate ploy on his part but was due to impecuniosity; and he had made social contributions to the community.
27
       
 These factors have hardly any relation to the objectives mentioned earlier. “The demands of life cannot be an excuse for dishonesty” (
Ezekiel’s
 case at [14]). Further, he was certainly no first offender in the sense of having used his clients’ funds on an isolated occasion only. The defalcation took place over a period of about seven years involving 12 clients. The respondent embezzled a huge sum of money and there is no prospect of him paying back the same or any significant part thereof to his clients. He squandered most of it on his extravagant ways, even maintaining three cars. Therefore, even if we were to draw distinctions between cases of dishonesty in the discharge of functions as an advocate and solicitor, the respondent’s case would have qualified for the “worst case scenario” category anyway.
Conclusion
28
       
 For the foregoing reasons, we were compelled to conclude that the respondent was clearly unfit for the legal profession and should not be allowed to remain on the roll of advocates and solicitors. We therefore ordered that the show cause order against the respondent be made absolute and that he be struck off the roll.
29
       
 Counsel for the Law Society asked that the respondent be ordered to pay the costs of these proceedings but added that he was not optimistic that the Law Society would ever recover those costs. For this reason, he requested us to fix the costs at any amount we deem fit as taxation of costs would only be a further drain on the Law Society’s funds.
30
       
 Costs of such proceedings are in the discretion of the court (s 103(3) of the LPA). Even though this matter is probably academic, nonetheless, as a small token of mercy for the respondent, we ordered only $3,000 as the amount of costs payable by him.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant, Jeffrey Ong Chin Keat, was convicted on one charge of trafficking in a Class A controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) for selling one tablet of Ecstasy to an undercover CNB officer, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA and punishable under s 33 of the MDA.
2          The appellant appealed against his conviction. I heard his appeal and dismissed it. I now give my reasons.
3          The charge against the appellant read as follows:
You, Jeffrey Ong Chin Keat, Male, 30 years, NRIC S7305455I are charged that you, on the 15
th
 day of July 2003 at about 11.40am, at Tiong Bahru MRT Station, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class “A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, by selling one (1) tablet marked “CU” which was analysed and found to contain 0.12 gram of N,
 
a-dimethyl-1,3-(methylenedioxy)phenethylamine [
sic
], to one W/Sgt Jennifer Lim, an officer of the Central Narcotics Bureau, at S$80/-, at the said place, without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations, made thereunder, you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 and punishable under Section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.
4          At trial, a Statement of Agreed Facts (“SOAF”) was agreed between the parties, and this was admitted under s 376 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”). The appellant did not challenge the contents of the SOAF.
The Statement of Agreed Facts
5          According to the SOAF, on 14 July 2003, Staff Sergeant Patrick Chan was chatting on an Internet relay chat program (“IRC”) under the nickname “Johnny” when he saw the appellant advertising the sale of Viagra in one of the chat rooms. SSgt Patrick Chan inquired into the price of the Viagra. After further inquiry by “Johnny”, the appellant agreed to sell one Ecstasy pill to “Johnny”. SSgt Patrick asked the appellant if he had any more Ecstasy to sell but the appellant answered in the negative. SSgt Patrick then obtained the appellant’s mobile phone number and they proceeded to discuss the details of the sale of the Ecstasy pill 
via
 short message service (“SMS”). SSgt Patrick arranged to meet the appellant at Tiong Bahru Plaza the next day.
6          On 15 July 2003, an operation was planned to arrest the appellant. As part of this operation, another officer, Sergeant Vikas posed as “Johnny” in order to meet with the appellant. “Johnny” was also accompanied by Woman Sergeant Jennifer Lim. At the meeting, “Johnny” asked for the original price of $140 for the Ecstasy pill to be reduced to $40. “Johnny” told the appellant that $40 was the market price. The appellant said that his lowest price was $80 and he left since the price could not be agreed upon. Later, “Johnny” called the appellant on his handphone and agreed to the sale of the Ecstasy pill at $80. The appellant then met with “Johnny” and W/Sgt Jennifer Lim again at Tiong Bahru Plaza, and sold one Ecstasy pill to W/Sgt Jennifer Lim for $80. Shortly thereafter, the appellant was arrested at Tiong Bahru Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”) station by a party of Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers. A search was conducted on the appellant and a marked $50 note and three marked $10 notes were found clutched in his right fist.
7          Investigations revealed that the appellant had previously sold Viagra pills to a customer over the Internet and had obtained the Ecstasy pill from the same customer in exchange. The Ecstasy pill was submitted to the Health Sciences Authority on 16 July 2003 for analysis. It was found to contain 0.12g of N,
 
a-dimethyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenethylamine, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.
The Prosecution’s case
8          The Prosecution’s case was based entirely on the SOAF, which was admitted under s 376 of the CPC. The Prosecution argued that the appellant should be found guilty of the trafficking charge because the elements of the trafficking offence under s 5 of the MDA had been satisfied by the appellant’s own testimony and by his admissions in the SOAF.
The defence
9          The appellant’s case at the trial below was based solely on issues of law. The appellant argued for the charge of trafficking to be reduced to that of possession on two grounds, namely that (a) the offence did not constitute “trafficking” under the MDA; and (b) the extent of the instigation from CNB inducing the appellant to sell the Ecstasy pill crossed the boundary of “fair and reasonable” entrapment.
10        In addition to the SOAF, the appellant raised additional facts in his defence and mitigation. He testified that in May 2003, a customer had asked for four pills of Viagra which were to be sold for $160 over the Internet. The appellant agreed to meet the customer, and gave the customer four pills in a strip. However, the customer had only $80, although the price was supposed to be $160. Instead of paying the remaining $80, the customer gave the appellant two pills, one of which was the Ecstasy pill mentioned in the charge. In cross‑examination, the appellant claimed that he had taken the pills because he wanted the shortfall in the payment to him to be made up. He claimed that if he had not taken the Ecstasy pills offered to him, and just accepted the $80 that the customer had with him, the customer might have tried to do the same thing again the next time, instead of paying the full amount. When the appellant returned home, he testified that he cut up one of the pills to see what it was like. He left the other pill, as well as fragments left from the first pill, on a shelf, and forgot about it.
11        About two months later, around July 2003, the appellant agreed over the Internet, to meet with SSgt Patrick to sell him one Ecstasy tablet at $150 (as per the SOAF). The appellant testified that when he was asked to supply seven more Ecstasy pills, he had replied that he did not have seven pills to sell as he was in the business of selling Viagra.
12        After his arrest, the appellant assisted the CNB by sending a text message to the person he had sold Viagra to. The appellant also testified that at the time of the transaction with “Johnny”, he did not know the market price of Ecstasy. He further testified that apart from the one pill in question, he had never sold Ecstasy previously. When questioned by the Prosecution, the appellant further claimed that although he knew that Ecstasy was a drug, he did not know that the sale of Ecstasy was so serious as to merit a jail term. He however knew that it was wrong to buy Ecstasy, and when it was put to him, he agreed that it was wrong to sell the Ecstasy pill.
The decision below
13        The trial judge found the appellant guilty as charged and sentenced him to five and a half years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane (see 
[2004] SGDC 130
).
14        The trial judge held that the facts, both in the SOAF and the testimony of the appellant, established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty as charged. He also held that the arguments on law advanced by the appellant had failed to convince the trial court that the appellant was not guilty of trafficking, or that because of entrapment, he should be convicted only on the lesser charge of possession.
The appeal
15        On appeal, the appellant sought to overturn the conviction for trafficking and to substitute this with a charge of possession. The appellant based his appeal on two main grounds:
(a)        that the offence did not constitute “trafficking” under the MDA but its true gravamen was one of possession; and
(b)        that, due to “entrapment”, the appellant should be convicted for possession under the MDA, and not trafficking.
16        I will now deal with each of these issues in turn.
Trafficking
17        On appeal, counsel for the appellant argued that the offence of “trafficking” under the MDA was not meant to apply to offenders such as the appellant, and that the appellant was not the “evil trafficker” envisaged by the drafters of the statute. The appellant argued that the MDA was aimed at punishing and deterring the traffickers who are truly and extensively trafficking in controlled drugs, and that the appellant did not fall within this category of offenders. The appellant also invited the court to consider the legislative intent of Parliament.
18        In the course of the hearing before me, counsel for the appellant conceded that Parliamentary debates were of no assistance to the appellant. Nevertheless, with reference to arguments advanced by counsel, I give my views below.
The meaning of “trafficking”
19        It was clear to me that there was no merit in the appellant’s first ground of appeal. The trial judge had carefully considered essentially the same issues of law, and I concluded that he was correct in dismissing the appellant’s arguments at trial. While it was legitimate under s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) to consider the purpose or object of the statute in construing its language, I agreed that the trial judge was right in adopting the plain meaning of the statute in the absence of any ambiguity in the provision.
20        In dismissing the appellant’s arguments at trial, the trial judge held at [33] that:
The evidence before the Court clearly established that the accused did sell the tablet of Ecstasy, which is a Class A controlled drug specified in the First Schedule to the MDA, to an undercover CNB officer. There was no authorisation under the MDA. The elements of the offence under s 5(1)(a) were made out.
21        The elements of the offence of trafficking in controlled drugs are set out under s 5 of the MDA:
Trafficking in controlled drugs
5.
 
—(1) Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore —
(a)        to traffic in a controlled drug;
(b)        to offer to traffic in a controlled drug; or
(c)        to do or offer to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug.
22        “Traffic” is defined in s 2 of the MDA as:
Interpretation
2.
 
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires —
…
“traffic” means —
(a)        to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or
(b)        to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a),
otherwise than under the authority of this Act, and “trafficking” has a corresponding meaning; …
23        The trial judge had carefully considered the plain words of the MDA and concluded that the appellant had committed the offence of “trafficking” under the MDA. I agreed that the trial judge was correct in holding (at [42]) that:
It is within the context of the language actually used that one must construe the purpose of the Act, and there is nothing to indicate that the provisions target those who traffic in little, whether on a part‑time basis or otherwise, from those who run it on a large scale, devoting the whole of their lives to the endeavour. …
24        The appellant cited the decision of 
Ng Yang Sek v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 661
, and alluded to the purposive approach taken by the Court of Appeal in that decision. The peculiar facts of 
Ng’s
 case, which concerned the use of opium as an ingredient of medicinal plasters prepared within the context of Chinese traditional medicine, were clearly distinguishable from those in the present appeal. The appellant also cited the case of 
Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 
[1980-1981] SLR 48
 with reference to the “draconian penalties” prescribed for trafficking in drugs. The appellant’s reference to 
Ong Ah Chuan
 was inapposite because, unlike in 
Ng Yang Sek
 or in 
Ong Ah Chuan
, there was no ambiguity as to the appellant’s guilt in the present case. Here, there was no doubt that the appellant had sold the drug. He had admitted to selling the drug, and had also admitted that he knew that he was selling Ecstasy.
25        As I previously observed in 
Ho Yean Theng Jill v PP
 
[2004] 1 SLR 254
 at [30]:
Under s 9A of the Interpretation Act, a court may refer to extrinsic materials only in 
limited circumstances
, for example, to ascertain the meaning of the provision when the meaning of that provision is 
ambiguous or unclear
. [emphasis added]
26        From a plain reading of ss 2 and 5 of the MDA, the meaning of “trafficking” is clear and unambiguous in relation to the sale of Ecstasy for consumption as a drug. Furthermore, in the present appeal, the appellant did not dispute the meaning of the operative words “to sell” found in s 2 of the MDA. The appellant failed to show any reason why I should depart from the plain words of the statute. On a plain reading of the statute, and in view of the SOAF, the appellant therefore fell within the intended class of offenders targeted by the MDA.
Purposive interpretation of the MDA
27        In his written submissions, counsel for the appellant contended that if the trial judge had adopted a purposive interpretation of the meaning of “trafficking” in the MDA, the conviction on trafficking would have been overturned. It was obvious to me that such a conclusion could not be sustained because it ignores the fact that Parliament has consistently taken a serious view of Ecstasy-related offences.
28        As stated above, because the words of the statute were clear and unambiguous, a plain reading was sufficient and it was not necessary to adopt a purposive interpretation of the statute in the present appeal. Nevertheless, I was of the view that even if I had adopted a purposive reading of the MDA with reference to legislative intent as suggested by the appellant, the sale of the Ecstasy pill by the appellant nonetheless clearly fell within the ambit of “trafficking”.
29        The appellant cited remarks made in Parliament on 9 November 1977 by Mr Chua Sian Chin (then Minister for Home Affairs) at the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill (see 
Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (9 November 1977), vol 37 at cols 169–170):
… This deterrent sentence is necessary to bring the message to recalcitrant drug addicts that the Government does not intend to see that time, money and efforts spent in rehabilitating them should go down the drain. Further, it would also put these recalcitrant drug addicts out of circulation for a longer period, thereby reducing the demand for drugs as well as preventing them from contaminating and influencing others into drug addiction.
30        There was nothing in the above passage that related to legislative intent in relation to drug 
traffickers
. The above passage dealt with deterrent sentences to deal with “recalcitrant drug 
addicts
”. In contrast, the present appeal was concerned with a simple case of the appellant selling an Ecstasy pill, which amounted to trafficking in drugs under the MDA.
31        There have indeed been relevant pronouncements pertaining to the trafficking of synthetic drugs, and of Ecstasy in particular. These relevant pronouncements are not only of no assistance to the appellant but, in fact, further supported my opinion that the appellant’s arguments could not be sustained.
32        During the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill on 1 June 1998, Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) stated (see 
Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (1 June 1998), vol 69 at col 40):
Firstly, psychotropic drugs are increasingly emerging as a major global threat …“Ice” and “Ecstasy” are examples of psychotropic drugs. These drugs are easy to produce and can be manufactured from easily obtainable chemicals and raw materials in makeshift laboratories … “Ecstasy” causes hallucinations, anxiety and can cause death by overheating of the body or dehydration …
… MHA is not proposing at this stage to introduce the death penalty for “Ecstasy”-related offences. 
Nevertheless, the penalties are still heavy as “Ecstasy” is a Class A drug.
 For example, trafficking in “Ecstasy” currently attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, 
and a minimum penalty of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.
 [emphasis added]
33        During the recent Budget Debate on 12 March 2004, Mr Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) reiterated Parliament’s concern about the trafficking of synthetic drugs (see 
Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (12 March 2004), vol 77 at col 1297):
Let me say that MHA takes a very serious view of what is happening on the drug scene. We are thankful that overall, the drug situation is well under control but 
we are focusing now on synthetic drugs
, but, of course, not neglecting heroin abuse, seeing what more can be done. For example, 
we are studying whether the penalty for trafficking of synthetic drugs should be enhanced to deter would-be traffickers
. We will look at that. The other area is that we will continue with strict enforcement. I think CNB does a good job to ensure that our laws are strictly enforced. [emphasis added]
34        Parliament has been consistently mindful of the problem of individuals trafficking in synthetic drugs like Ecstasy. The attention of Parliament has consistently been focused on strict enforcement and heavy penalties to deter would-be traffickers. Since Parliament has so clearly expressed its concern about deterring “would-be traffickers” who have not even begun selling drugs, it is absurd for the appellant to now argue that the MDA is any less concerned about dealing with “first-time traffickers” who have already engaged in the sale of drugs, albeit in a single transaction.
35        Thus, even if a purposive interpretation of “trafficking” were to be adopted in relation to the sale of Ecstasy, the actions of the appellant still fell squarely within the ambit of “trafficking” under the MDA.
Whether there was trafficking
36        The appellant argued that despite the plain words of the MDA, his acts nevertheless should not be construed as “trafficking”. However, I was of the view that whether the court proceeded on a literal or purposive interpretation of the MDA, the agreed facts and testimony of the accused made it clear that a simple case of trafficking has been made out.
37        First, the appellant knew that the pill that his customer had passed to him was Ecstasy. This was admitted by the appellant in the SOAF, and under cross‑examination:
Q:         Did he tell you that what the pill [
sic
] he was giving you was an Ecstasy pill?
A:         He told me these 2 pills is [
sic
] Ecstasy.
…
Q:         Satisfied that they were Ecstasy pills [
sic
]?
A:         Yes, I was satisfied with the Ecstasy pills …
38        Second, the appellant knew that buying and selling Ecstasy was illegal:
Q:         You knew it was wrong to receive Ecstasy from this person?
A:         Yes, buying Ecstasy is wrong.
 
…
 
Put:      On 15 Jan 2003, you were at Tiong Bahru MRT station.
A:         Yes.
 
Put:      On that date, you sold one ecstasy tablet to W/Sgt Jennifer Lee.
A:         Yes, it was to the guy.
 
Put:      Did so without any authorisation under the law [
sic
].
A:         I know it is wrong.
39        Finally, the appellant intentionally sold the Ecstasy pill to a customer for $80, with knowledge of the nature of the drug. This clearly satisfies the definition of “traffic” under s 2 of the MDA, which includes “to sell”.
40        Liability for the offence of trafficking under the MDA should not hinge on the capacity or background of the appellant, but on whether the appellant in fact engaged in acts of trafficking. Arguments that the appellant was a “one‑time seller” and not a “big-time trafficker” or “evil trafficker”, may be relevant for purposes of mitigation and sentencing, but are not relevant considerations for purposes of conviction.
41        As I previously observed in 
Aw Sei Kui v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 722
 at [50]:
The actual ‘harm’ done by a speeding offence or by possession of a minuscule amount of a prohibited drug may be insignificant, but that fact would not qualify either offender as exempt from punishment under the de minimis principle. In such instances, meaning can only be given to the law if it blankets the entire range of offenders, for the cumulative effect of many slight offences causes great harm to society as a whole. Naturally, however, the culpability of any particular offender will be reflected in the sentence he receives — but he is guilty of an offence nonetheless.
Entrapment
42        The appellant based a great deal of his case on the issue of entrapment. This issue had already been argued extensively at trial by counsel and had been carefully considered by the trial judge. After considering the appellant’s arguments in the light of the SOAF, I was of the view that there was no merit in the appellant’s submissions in relation to entrapment.
43        The trial judge observed correctly that there are four possible arguments that can generally be made in relation to entrapment: (a) entrapment as a substantive defence; (b) the exclusion of evidence obtained through entrapment; (c) entrapment as a reason for a stay of proceedings; and (d) entrapment as a reason for the court to exercise its discretion to convict the accused on a lesser offence than that arising out of the entrapment. The appellant’s submissions on appeal centred on (c) and (d), and he did not rely on (a) and (b). Thus, I shall deal with the first two points only briefly.
Entrapment as a substantive defence
44        As affirmed by the Court of Appeal in 
Amran Bin Eusuff v PP
 
[2002] SGCA 20
, it is trite law that entrapment is not a valid defence to a charge. In the present appeal, it is sufficient to note that the appellant had rightly conceded that entrapment was not a valid defence.
The exclusion of evidence obtained through entrapment
45        The trial judge considered the case of 
SM Summit Holdings Ltd v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 922
 for the position that entrapment may possibly render evidence obtained, prejudicial or inadmissible. However, on appeal, the appellant did not argue for the exclusion of evidence obtained through entrapment, neither did he challenge the decision of the trial judge on this issue. Therefore, this line of argument was also of no assistance to the appellant.
Entrapment as a reason for stay of proceedings
46        The appellant sought to place a great deal of emphasis on the case of 
R v Looseley
 [2001] 4 All ER 897. This case reflects the position in English law that where a defendant can show unfair entrapment, the court may grant a stay of proceedings to prevent an abuse of process. However, it was plain to me that this case was of little, if any, assistance to the appellant.
47        Counsel for the appellant argued at length about the merits of the decision in 
Looseley
. However, during the hearing before me, counsel for the appellant conceded that the local position on entrapment was consistent with the decision in 
R v Sang
 [1979] 2 All ER 1222, as affirmed locally in 
How Poh Sun v PP
 
[1991] SLR 220
, and recently re-affirmed in 
Amran Bin Eusuff v PP
 (at [44] 
supra
).
48        In any event, it was clear that the appellant had failed to appreciate the differences between 
Looseley
 and the present appeal. The appellant’s case on the point of discretion to stay proceedings to prevent an abuse of process rested heavily on allegations that there was some sort of unfair entrapment carried out on the appellant by the CNB officers. In this regard, the appellant made reference to the case of 
Nottingham City Council v Amin
 [2000] 2 All ER 946, cited in 
Looseley
, which described the test of unfair entrapment as whether the law enforcement officers in question behaved like ordinary members of the public. In that case, which concerned a police operation to flush out unlicensed taxi drivers, the actions of the police were deemed unobjectionable because the policemen involved had behaved like ordinary members of the public. Referring to 
Nottingham
, the Court in 
Looseley
 observed that if the policemen in question had waved
 
£50 notes at the taxi drivers or had pretended to be in distress, their behaviour would not have been that of ordinary members of the public.
49        To my mind, even if the principles espoused in the English cases above were held to be applicable to the present appeal, they were of no assistance to the appellant, because the agreed facts suggest that there was no excessive or unfair inducement. The appellant’s own testimony confirmed that he had bargained repeatedly over the sale price of the Ecstasy pill, and that he had wanted to make up for lost profits arising from a previous transaction concerning the sale of Viagra to a customer. The appellant’s allegation of “excessive inducement” to sell the Ecstasy pill was further weakened by the fact that the eventual sale price of $80 was actually lower than the price of $140 which had originally “induced” the appellant to first meet with the CNB officers in person at Tiong Bahru.
50        In this regard, the following passage from 
Nottingham
 (see [48] 
supra
 at 950), as cited by the Court in 
Looseley
 at [53], was instructive:
… [I]t has been recognised that law enforcement agencies have a general duty to the public to enforce the law and it has been regarded as unobjectionable if a law enforcement officer gives a defendant an opportunity to break the law, of which the defendant freely takes advantage, in circumstances where it appears that the defendant would have behaved in the same way if the opportunity had been offered by anyone else.
51        The appellant was clearly motivated by financial gain, and any inducement offered by the CNB officers did not in itself create the offence. The mere fact that the CNB officers happened to play the role of purchaser did not detract from the fact that the appellant intentionally sold a pill that he knew to be Ecstasy in order to make a profit.
Entrapment as a reason for the court to exercise its discretion to convict the accused on a lesser offence than that arising out of the entrapment
52        Finally, the appellant argued that the entrapment carried out by the CNB officers constituted a reason for the court to exercise its discretion to convict him on a lesser offence (
ie
 possession) instead of that arising out of the entrapment (
ie
 trafficking). I took the view that the appellant’s arguments in this regard were without merit.
53        The appellant’s reference to the case of 
Tan Boon Hock v PP
 
[1994] 2 SLR 150
 was wholly inapposite. In para 55 of his written submissions, the appellant claimed that:
Further, there is the interesting case of 
Tan Boon Hock v PP
 
[1994] 2 SLR 150
 where the Honourable Chief Justice intimated that the entrapment bringing about the offence may not have been appropriate.
54        The appellant’s reading of my decision in that case was incorrect. 
Tan’s
 case did not deal with the issue of entrapment, and it made no reference to any of the leading decisions on entrapment such as 
R v Sang
 and 
How Poh Sun v PP.
 Instead, 
Tan
’s case dealt with the issue of “consent”, or the appearance of consent, of an undercover police officer taking part in an operation to flush out homosexual activity in a secluded area. Moreover, 
Tan’s
 case was a decision on sentencing, and had nothing to do with the court’s discretion to convict the accused on a lesser offence. As I observed in that case at [9]:
Consequently, although a technical offence under s 354 might have been committed, I am somewhat bemused that an accused caught in the manner described above should nevertheless be charged with the offence of outraging another’s modesty; and should, furthermore, be sentenced not just to imprisonment but also to caning. In the present case, the appellant elected to plead guilty and so the above issues were not discussed. He chose solely to appeal against his sentence. 
I will only say, therefore, that having regard to the events leading to his committing the offence charged, a sentence of imprisonment and caning was quite unwarranted.
 [emphasis added]
55        The elements of trafficking were clearly satisfied in the present appeal. There was therefore no reason to amend the charge to one dealing with a lesser offence. Therefore, while the High Court has powers of amendment and alteration under s 256 of the CPC, the present appeal did not merit the exercise of those powers.
Conclusion
56        This was a simple case of trafficking. The present appeal did not merit a departure from the plain words of the MDA, and certainly did not merit a departure from the established line of local cases dealing with entrapment. For the above reasons, I dismissed the appeal.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant was convicted on one charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 324 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”), one charge of criminal intimidation under the second limb of s 506 of the PC and one charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the PC. All three charges arose from a single incident of maid abuse that occurred on the evening of 1 November 2001. The appellant was sentenced to a total of four months and two weeks’ imprisonment. She appealed against both conviction and sentence. At the trial, counsel for the appellant sought to address me specifically on the issue of sentence. However, I have, in the interest of completeness, dealt with both the appeals on conviction and sentence. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal on conviction but allowed the appeal on sentence in part. I now give my reasons.
The facts
2          At the material time, the appellant, a widow, lived at No 36 Carrisbrooke Grove with her three young children aged six years, four years and three months. From 12 February 2001 to 2 November 2001, the appellant had employed the victim, Nur Akbariyah (“Nur”), as a domestic maid.
3          On the evening of 1 November 2001, the appellant had allegedly threatened and assaulted Nur at the appellant’s residence, thereby giving rise to the three charges above.
The Prosecution’s case
4          The Prosecution relies primarily on Nur’s testimony. At or around 6.40pm on 1 November 2001, the appellant and Nur were in the kitchen of the appellant’s residence. The appellant was apparently unhappy with Nur because she had neglected to prepare dinner for the children.
5          At this time, the appellant was cooking porridge while nagging Nur. She had repeatedly asked Nur whether Nur “knew what she [the appellant] was doing”. As Nur had noticed that the appellant had prepared carrots and cabbage, and was in the process of cutting potatoes, she replied that the appellant was making soup. This served to further anger the appellant. The appellant ordered Nur to slap herself.
6          However, even after Nur had slapped herself, the appellant remained dissatisfied and proceeded to give Nur a hard slap on the left cheek. Nur then withdrew to the area behind the kitchen where she laid on the floor and cried.
7          Shortly after, the appellant summoned Nur back to the kitchen and demanded to know why she was crying. Nur responded that she was in pain, to which the appellant pushed Nur’s head against the kitchen wall. The appellant then took the kitchen knife that she had been using earlier and placed it against Nur’s chin, at the same time asking Nur in a loud voice, “Can you wake up?” When Nur responded in the affirmative, the appellant proceeded to place the knife on Nur’s chest and stomach area while repeating the same question.
8          Finally, the appellant rested the knife on Nur’s left collarbone and repeated the question. This time, Nur felt some pain in her collarbone area.
9          When the appellant’s tirade had ended, she assumed a conciliatory attitude and persuaded Nur not to cry and to speak to the appellant as a friend. The appellant then instructed Nur to run around the kitchen and to “put on a happy face”. Nur complied with these instructions.
10        At the conclusion of the entire episode, Nur continued with her chores. It was while Nur was preparing the bath for the appellant’s baby that she noticed a small cut on her collarbone. She also noticed that her T-shirt was stained with blood from the cut.
11        At about 11.30am the next morning, Nur took the opportunity to flee from the appellant’s residence while the appellant had gone to fetch her children from kindergarten. Nur proceeded straight to Serangoon Gardens Police Post (“the police post”) and reported the previous evening’s incident. On the same day, Nur was sent for a medical examination at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. As a result, the appellant was charged with two counts of causing hurt and one count of criminal intimidation.
12        The trial against the appellant thus proceeded on the following three charges:
(a)        voluntarily causing hurt to Nur by use of a knife (District Arrest Case No 3549 of 2004);
(b)        criminal intimidation of Nur by placing a knife at her neck (District Arrest Case No 3550 of 2004); and
(c)        voluntarily causing hurt to Nur by slapping her and pushing her head against a wall (District Arrest Case No 3551 of 2004).
The defence
13        The appellant denied all the allegations made against her. According to her testimony, on the evening of the alleged incident, Nur had informed the appellant that dinner had not yet been prepared. The appellant then went to the kitchen to prepare porridge, as her chief concern at the time was to prepare a meal for her children.
14        The appellant claimed to be merely “grumbling” as she prepared the meal. When Nur entered the kitchen, the appellant had simply asked why dinner was not yet cooked. Nur had responded by apologising repeatedly whereupon the appellant allegedly said to Nur, “Don’t apologise. You just quietly slap yourself”. The appellant then resumed cooking. Thereafter, the appellant went to breastfeed her baby while Nur fed the other children their dinner. Nothing further transpired that evening.
15        The following morning, the appellant discovered that Nur was missing only after she returned from fetching her children from kindergarten. As she was leaving her house to search for Nur, the appellant’s neighbour informed the appellant that her maid had seen Nur bleeding. The neighbour also related to the appellant that Nur had told the neighbour’s maid that she was going to report the matter to the police.
16        Upon hearing the neighbour’s account of what had occurred, the appellant called the police and was informed that Nur was indeed at the police post and that an ambulance had been called for. The appellant was then instructed to wait at home. The following morning, the police conducted a search of the appellant’s home. Nur was also present at the time and had allegedly said, “Sorry, Madam”, to the appellant.
17        The appellant denied that the threat and assault ever took place at her residence on 1 November 2001.
The decision below
18        Before commencing his evaluation of the evidence before him, the district judge referred to the decision of 
Choy Kok Meng v PP
 
[2003] SGHC 150
, and recognised that the court must exercise extreme caution in examining Nur’s evidence when the primary piece of evidence directly proving the Prosecution’s case came from Nur herself. After scrutinising the evidence in great detail, he concluded that Nur had been earnest and forthright in recollecting the events that transpired on 1 November 2001. While there appeared to be some inconsistencies in her evidence, the district judge ultimately found them to be inconsequential in nature, and found that it was not unusual that Nur could not recollect such details with crystal clarity. He found that Nur had no reason to lie and that her account was credible.
19        In contrast, the district judge found the appellant to be a guarded witness who had, during the course of the trial, slanted her testimony to dissociate herself from adverse evidence. He found certain aspects of the appellant’s version of the facts inherently incredible and observed that there were material discrepancies between the appellant’s testimony and her police statement. He thus held that the Prosecution had successfully impeached the appellant’s credit.
20        The district judge also noted that the Prosecution’s case was supported by the objective medical evidence of Dr Tan Bien Peng (“Dr Tan”). Dr Tan had examined Nur at Tan Tock Seng Hospital at 12.37pm on 2 November 2001 and reported the following injuries:
(a)        a 3cm diameter cephalohematoma over the right parietal region of the head; and
(b)        a 1cm linear scar over the left clavicular region.
The district judge therefore concluded that the Prosecution had proven its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and convicted the appellant on all three charges.
21        On the issue of sentence, the district judge considered the various mitigating factors, including the fact that the appellant had no previous antecedents. Hardship and mental stress suffered by the appellant were not deemed by the district judge to amount to valid mitigating factors. He did, however, take into account the fact that the threat had not lasted for a prolonged period and that the wound inflicted by the knife was relatively minor. Having considered the relevant benchmark sentences for the various offences and all the circumstances of the case, the district judge sentenced the appellant to:
(a)        two weeks’ imprisonment for voluntarily causing hurt with a knife;
(b)        four months’ imprisonment for criminal intimidation; and
(c)        two weeks’ imprisonment for voluntarily causing hurt by slapping the victim and pushing her head against a wall.
The sentences for the first two charges were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a total custodial term of four months and two weeks.
The appeal
22        The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence.
The appeal against conviction
23        The appellant’s grounds of appeal centred around the lower court’s findings of fact on the two charges of voluntarily causing hurt and voluntarily causing hurt with a knife. As to the grounds of appeal regarding the third charge of criminal intimidation, the appellant challenged the district judge’s findings of both fact and law.
24        Before delving into each particular charge, I revisited some general principles that an appellate court ought to take cognisance of when invited to scrutinise the findings of a lower court.
General approach in appellate trials
25        It cannot be over-emphasised that an appellate court must be cautious in exercising its powers to overturn a lower court’s finding of fact. This principle applies with equal force in cases where the appellate court has to decide whether the lower court ought to have accepted one party’s version of facts over another: 
Ong Ting Ting v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 156
.
26        An appellate court will therefore only depart from the findings of the trial judge when it has been shown that the lower court had reached a conclusion that is clearly erroneous and unsustainable on the evidence tendered: 
Sahadevan s/o Gundan v PP
 
[2003] 1 SLR 145
. To this end, due regard must be given to the fact that the trial judge has the benefit of observing the demeanour of the witnesses when arriving at any finding of fact.
27        In the present case, the district judge displayed an awareness of the pitfalls in relying primarily upon the evidence given by Nur to convict the appellant. He traversed the evidence carefully and arrived at the conclusion that Nur was indeed credible while the appellant, by contrast, was unworthy of belief.
28        With the above in mind, I proceeded to evaluate the merits of the appellant’s grounds of appeal.
DAC 3549/2004: voluntarily causing hurt with a knife
29        The main thrust of the appellant’s argument lay in the supposed mistake committed by the district judge when he reconciled the medical evidence with the other oral testimony given during the trial. The appellant relied upon the following part of the district judge’s grounds of decision (see 
[2004] SGDC 147
) at [42] and [43]:
Cut on collarbone region an old scar
 
– As for Dr Tan’s testimony that the cut on Nur’s collarbone region was an old scar and not a fresh wound (para 24(d)), I am of the view that this evidence alone does not discredit her evidence. After all, it is important to note that this wound is relatively minor (no more than 1 cm in size) and that some time had elapsed between the infliction of the injury and Dr Tan’s medical examination. Under the circumstances, it is not inconceivable that Nur’s injury might have healed by the time Dr Tan saw her. According to Dr Tan, the 1-cm scar over Nur’s left collarbone region is consistent with a cut that was small, dried up and which did not require any dressing or treatment.
Furthermore, there is the Accused’s own evidence that very soon after discovering Nur missing on 2 November 2001, one Mrs Huang (a neighbour) informed her that her own maid had seen Nur ‘bleeding’. This is consistent with Nur’s evidence that when she was leaving the Accused’s residence, she had shown her collarbone region injury to another maid from a neighbouring house.
From the above, the appellant contended that the district judge had implicitly accepted that Nur’s wound was still bleeding at the time she had left the house and that this finding was unsupported by the objective medical evidence of Dr Tan. It was also alleged that Nur had contradicted herself when she stated at the trial that the blood on the wound was not totally dry at the time of the medical examination. On this basis, counsel for the appellant urged me to find in favour of the appellant and to hold that the district judge, in deciding that the appellant had indeed inflicted the knife wound on Nur, had reached a conclusion that was unsupported by the evidence.
30        A careful reading of [42] of the grounds of decision makes it abundantly clear that the district judge had never accepted that the wound was bleeding. In fact, he had come to the conclusion that the wound had healed itself by the time Nur was examined by Dr Tan. References in [43] to the conversation with the appellant’s neighbour merely indicated that Nur had indeed shown her wound to the neighbour’s maid and not that the wound was bleeding.
31        A necessary corollary to the above finding would therefore be that Dr Tan’s report supports, rather than contradicts, the Prosecution’s case that the knife wound had been inflicted the day before the medical examination. Implicit in the appellant’s evidence that her neighbour’s maid had seen Nur bleeding on the morning of 2 November 2001 is the assertion that Nur may have sustained the injury in the morning and not the previous night. The district judge’s finding that the wound had dried up by the time Nur saw Dr Tan did not assist the appellant’s case in this respect.
32        As to the appellant’s submission that the district judge had failed to ascribe due consideration to the inherent contradiction between the medical evidence and Nur’s evidence that the blood on the wound was still not dry during Dr Tan’s examination, I was of the view that the apparent contradiction should have little bearing on the appellant’s conviction. It is clear from cases such as 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
 and 
Hon Chi Wan Colman v PP
 
[2002] 3 SLR 558
, that the court is entitled, for good reasons, to accept one part of a witness’ testimony and to reject the other. On the facts, the district judge had found Nur’s testimony to be credible and materially consistent with the nature of the injuries sustained by her. The apparent inconsistency may have been due to her anxiety over being placed on the witness stand and should not be used to prejudice the credibility of the rest of Nur’s testimony. Furthermore, the medical examination and the presence of blood on the collarbone region of the T-shirt that Nur had worn at the material time provided greater impetus to believe the rest of Nur’s testimony regardless of the alleged inconsistency.
33        In light of the finding that the wound had healed and that it corresponded to what was recorded in the medical report, the assertion that the medical report supported the appellant’s case naturally fell away.
34        Counsel for the appellant also sought to raise the issue that the district judge had erred in relying upon certain evidence that constituted hearsay to corroborate Nur’s version of the facts. These included Nur’s evidence that she had spoken to a nurse about her wound prior to her examination by Dr Tan and the evidence of the appellant’s conversation with her neighbour. As I was satisfied that the appellant’s conviction was founded on sufficient evidence such as the bloodied shirt, Nur’s credible testimony and the objective evidence of Dr Tan, whether those two pieces of evidence constituted hearsay evidence did not impact on the finding of the trial judge and I shall say no more on this matter.
35        The appellant further invited me to draw a negative inference from the fact that the Prosecution had failed to send the knife for deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) testing pursuant to s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) (“EA”). This would have required me to deem the DNA analysis of the knife as unfavourable to the Prosecution’s case by virtue of the Prosecution having failed to produce such an analysis. However, the Prosecution had drawn my attention to the case of 
Ang Jwee Herng v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 475
 where it was decided that an adverse inference was to be drawn under s 116 illustration (g) of the EA only if the Prosecution withheld evidence which it possessed and not merely on account of its failure to obtain certain evidence.
36        In 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
 (cited in the recent decision of 
Khua Kian Keong v PP
 
[2003] 4 SLR 526
), in the context of the drawing of a negative inference from the Prosecution’s failure to call certain witnesses, I had stated at [74] and [77]:
It must be emphasized that s 116 illustration (g) is not mandatory. That provision merely states that the court may draw a presumption, not that it must. In determining whether or not that presumption ought to be drawn the court will have regard to all the circumstances, but particularly and importantly the materiality of the witnesses not produced. The adoption of any other approach would be to encourage the adducing of unnecessary evidence, prolonging the trial and confusing the issues.
…
The discretion conferred upon the prosecution cannot be fettered by any obligation to call a particular witness. What the prosecution has to do is to prove its case. It is not obliged to go out of its way to allow the defence any opportunity to test its evidence. It is not obliged to act for the defence. Only if there is an intention to hinder or hamper the defence would the possibility of a miscarriage of justice arise, requiring interference by the courts.
37        In the present case, in choosing not to send the knife for DNA analysis, the Prosecution had not withheld any material evidence from the appellant. There was no cause to draw a negative inference. While it may have been true that a DNA analysis of the knife would be relevant and perhaps useful in the determination of the appellant’s guilt, I was of the view that Nur’s testimony, Dr Tan’s medical report and the blood-stained T-shirt were sufficient to establish the appellant’s guilt. There was no need to take the additional step of procuring the DNA analysis.
38        In light of the district judge’s finding that Nur was a credible witness, the substantial consistency of Nur’s testimony with the injuries she sustained, the supporting evidence of Dr Tan’s medical report and the blood found on the T‑shirt worn by Nur at the material time, I was of the view that the appellant had failed to show that the district judge came to an erroneous conclusion on the evidence. I found that the district judge was correct in convicting the appellant on the charge of voluntarily causing hurt with a knife.
DAC 3550/2004: criminal intimidation using a knife
39        This aspect of the appeal raised two distinct issues. First, whether the appellant’s utterances and conduct were capable of amounting to criminal intimidation under s 503 of the PC. Second, whether the conviction of the appellant under the 
second limb
 of s 506 of the PC, when the charge was framed under the 
first limb
 of s 506 of the PC, had the effect of rendering the conviction erroneous or merely went towards the determination of the sentence.
The first issue: conviction
40        The appellant disputed the veracity of the district judge’s findings. It was argued that the district judge had placed too great a reliance upon the sole testimony of Nur without considering that the appellant was, at the material time, unable to threaten Nur as she was carrying her baby while making dinner. Furthermore, the appellant alleged that the facts, at best, disclosed that she had moved the knife around as she scolded Nur and that this did not constitute a threat and thus did not assist the Prosecution’s case that she had threatened Nur.
41        It bears repeating that the district judge, upon hearing the evidence in its entirety, had decided that Nur was a credible witness and that the appellant, having had her credibility impeached, was not worthy of belief. He then found that the appellant had placed the knife on Nur’s chin, chest and stomach area while asking her to “wake up” in a “strong tone”. In the absence of the appellant producing any evidence to show that the district judge had erred in reaching the above conclusion, I was of the view that there was no reason to disturb the findings of fact.
42        The district judge then laid down the two-stage test that the Prosecution must satisfy before a conviction can be made out. First, whether the appellant had threatened Nur with injury to her person; and second, whether the threat was intended to cause alarm to her.
43        In ascertaining whether a threat was made, the learned district judge was guided by the case of 
Ameer Akbar v Abdul Hamid
 
[1997] 1 SLR 113
 where I had stated at [44] and [45]:
For there to be a threat, the words uttered must be such that they would actually cause the victim, and any reasonable man in the victim’s circumstances, to at least comprehend the words as having the 
effect
 of a threat to begin with. Otherwise, such words will not constitute a threat.
To this extent, the existence of a threat will depend on the factual matrix of the case — a threat is not issued merely because threatening words per se are used. Obviously, if the words ‘
I will assault you
’ were uttered when the parties were merry-making and sharing a joke, no threat would have been issued; no one would have comprehended such words as having the effect of a threat. Therefore, all the circumstances of the case have to be considered.
44        To this end, the learned district judge concluded that there was no principle in law that only words (not acts) can amount to threats.
45        The appellant relied upon 
Ratanlal & Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes,
 vol 2 (23rd Ed, 1988) at p 2026 for the proposition that where no words are spoken by the accused, there can be no threat and that the intention of a speaker to threaten the victim can only be gathered from the words uttered. It was therefore submitted that the words “wake up” could not amount to a threat under s 503 of the PC.
46        On the facts, it was clear that the appellant had uttered the words “wake up” to Nur. Furthermore, as already observed in the 
Ameer Akbar
 case, all the circumstances of the case must be considered. I was of the view that just as intimidating phrases when used in a light-hearted context cannot amount to a threat, purportedly light-hearted words may amount to a threat when used under intimidating circumstances. There was nothing in s 503 of the PC that required a threat to be ascertained solely from the words used and not from the surrounding circumstances. A sensible interpretation must be ascribed to the words of s 503 of the PC if we are to prevent persons such as the appellant from eluding justice by using sugar-coated threats.
47        As for the requirement of an intention to cause alarm to the victim, I thought that the conduct of the accused in placing the knife at various parts of Nur’s body, when viewed in conjunction with her repeated use of the phrase “wake up”, would be sufficient to cause alarm to any reasonable person in Nur’s position. I therefore found that the Prosecution had proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and that the conviction should be upheld.
The second issue: application of the wrong limb of s 506 PC
48        The appellant submitted that a conviction under the first limb of s 506 of the PC was sufficient. The first limb of s 506 of the PC deals with normal criminal intimidation and carries a maximum sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The second limb of s 506 of the PC deals with criminal intimidation to cause death or grievous hurt and carries a maximum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment.
49        The district judge had, in fact, convicted and sentenced the appellant pursuant to the second limb of s 506 of the PC. This was a matter of grave concern because a careful reading of the second charge revealed the particulars of the charge to be the appellant’s act of threatening to 
cause injury
 to the victim with a knife. This brought the charge squarely within the ambit of the first limb of s 506 of the PC.
50        Counsel for the appellant had made no submissions on this point except to urge me to sentence the appellant under the first limb of s 506 of the PC. The Prosecution conceded that the district judge had erred in this respect but had submitted that the lower court’s reliance on the second limb of s 506 of the PC did not occasion a failure of justice as far as the guilt of the appellant was concerned. To this end, the Prosecution relied on the case of 
Lim Chuan Huat v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 105
 where I had decided that where the error in question affects the sentence but not the determination of guilt, s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) may be invoked to allow the High Court to set aside a sentence that is manifestly excessive.
51        I think that the approach laid down in 
Lim Chuan Huat
 is equally applicable in the present case. The district judge readily found the appellant guilty of criminal intimidation by way of threat to cause death or grievous hurt. It is obvious that the appellant can likewise be found guilty of a lesser charge of criminal intimidation by threat to cause injury. The only step that remained was to review the sentence meted out by the district judge. To resort to any other procedure would result in duplicity of effort and a waste of resources.
52        I will deal with the issue of sentence in the later part of my judgment.
DAC 3551/2004: voluntarily causing hurt
53        The appellant submitted that the district judge had placed too much emphasis on Nur’s testimony without sufficient regard to the material discrepancies between her testimony and Dr Tan’s medical report. In addition, counsel for the appellant had submitted that the district judge had placed insufficient emphasis on the concession by Dr Tan in his testimony that there could have been an alternative way in which Nur could have sustained the injury.
54        Again, it was clear from the district judge’s grounds of decision that he found Nur’s testimony to be substantially consistent with her injuries. He noted that Nur had stated in her evidence-in-chief that she had been slapped once on the left check, whereas Dr Tan’s report reflected that Nur had claimed that the appellant had used her palms to slap Nur over both cheeks. Ultimately, the district judge, having expressly taken the discrepancy into account in determining the credibility of Nur’s claims, still found her to be a credible witness.
55        I was persuaded that there arose no instance whereby the district judge had arrived at a finding that was unsupported by the evidence. Both Nur’s testimony and the medical report indicated that Nur was indeed slapped. There was no need to disturb the district judge’s finding in this regard.
56        The fact that Nur had sustained a head injury as a result of the appellant pushing her head against the wall was borne out by Nur’s oral testimony and was further supported by the objective observations of Dr Tan. While the appellant alluded to the fact that Dr Tan had conceded that the head injury sustained by Nur could have occurred through other means, due regard must be had to the case of 
Teo Keng Pong v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 329
 at [68] where I had issued the following warning (in the context of the burden of proof on the Prosecution):
It bears repeating that the burden on the prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It is not to prove the case beyond all doubts. … The question in all cases is whether such doubts are real or reasonable, or whether they are merely fanciful. It is only when the doubts belong to the former category that the prosecution had not discharged its burden, and the accused is entitled to an acquittal.
57        The fact that Dr Tan had conceded the possibility of Nur sustaining a head injury by some other means did not take the appellant’s assertion out of the fanciful and into the realm of real or reasonable doubt. The appellant had to show more in order to substantiate her argument. The appellant, in raising this line of reasoning, had plainly failed in this regard.
58        Having reviewed the reasoning of the district judge, it was my view that the Prosecution had yet again succeeded in establishing the charge beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore upheld the conviction.
The appeal against sentencing
General mitigating factors
59        Counsel for the appellant submitted several general mitigating factors that were allegedly in the appellant’s favour. Chief amongst these were the appellant’s lack of antecedent, hardship to the appellant’s family and the inordinate delay of three years in the charging and prosecution of the appellant.
60        With regard to the absence of antecedents on the appellant’s part, the district judge was correct in finding it to be a valid sentencing consideration. However, the Prosecution submitted that the appellant’s lack of antecedents should be, at best, a neutral factor. To this end, reliance was placed on the authority of 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
. However, that case cannot stand for such a proposition. In that case, I had held that the weight ascribed to the fact that the accused was a first time offender would have been greater if there were positive evidence as to character rather than the negative inference from the absence of allegations of other convictions. That, by any reading, cannot be taken to mean that the lack of antecedents on the part of the appellant has no mitigating value whatsoever. It is trite law that the absence of a prior conviction provides some degree of mitigation for an accused person.
61        It has also been clearly established that potential hardship suffered by the appellant’s family plays no role in the determination of sentence. I had already stated in cases such as 
Lim Choon Kang v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 927
 and 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
 that hardship caused to the accused’s family when the accused was sent to prison carried little weight generally, and carried no weight at all when the term of imprisonment was short. Taking into consideration the relatively short custodial sentence meted out by the lower court, I found that the appellant’s submission on hardship as a mitigating factor carried no merit whatsoever.
62        On the third and final mitigating factor, the appellant submitted that the case of 
Tan Kiang Kwang v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 280
 supported the practice of granting a “discount” in sentence for the inordinate delay in the prosecution of the appellant’s case. The appellant’s proposition was, however, misconceived. In that case, I had drawn a distinction between situations where the prosecution of the accused had occurred long after the accused had been charged and the converse situation where there was a delay in charging the accused but with no delay in the prosecution thereafter. I had further stated that there was greater mitigating force in the former situation. Hence, based on the present facts, where the prosecution had followed a few months after the appellant was charged, there was no force in the appellant’s argument at all.
63        Before turning to review the specific sentences, I was mindful of some relevant mitigating factors that are indeed in the appellant’s favour. First, as alluded to above, the appellant is a first-time offender; second, the entire episode happened on the spur of the moment and was not premeditated; third, the incident was short-lived; and finally, the injuries sustained were not of a serious nature. These considerations guided me in my assessment of the reasonableness of the sentences.
DAC 3549/2004: voluntarily causing hurt with a weapon
64        In his grounds of decision, the District Judge had made reference to the cases of 
Lai Mei San Lily v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 23 of 1995 (unreported) and 
Ng Peng Kwang v PP
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 338 of 1990 (unreported). Both cases involved instances where the accused had stabbed the victim with a knife. The sentences meted out were one month’s imprisonment and six months’ imprisonment with three strokes of the cane respectively. I was of the view that 
Ng Peng Kwang
 should be distinguished as it involved a case of road rage, hence the impetus to mete out a harsher sentence. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that both cases involved instances of stabbing while, in the present case, the injury was a minor 1cm cut to the collarbone region.
65        As such, taking into account the above precedents, the nature of the injury and also the fact that the present case involves an incident of maid abuse, I found the sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment entirely reasonable.
DAC 3550/2004: Criminal Intimidation
66        As I have alluded to in [48] to [52], the district judge had erred in convicting the appellant on the second limb of s 506 of the PC. The appropriate remedy to this problem is to revise the sentence ordered by the district judge.
67        The Prosecution had sought to rely upon the case of 
PP v Luan Yuanxin
 
[2002] 2 SLR 98
 to show that the sentence of four months’ imprisonment was not manifestly excessive. Further, the Prosecution argued that the case was authority for the proposition that a harsher sentence should be ordered where the accused had used a weapon to intimidate the victim.
68        It is clear from the various cases involving criminal intimidation that the fact that the victim was not only alarmed but also put in fear for his or her safety was an aggravating factor. In addition, past cases have established that the use of a weapon in conjunction with the threat will inevitably lead to a custodial sentence. The above notwithstanding, I was mindful of the fact that the district judge had concluded that the appellant had uttered the threat in a moment of frustration, that the threat was not prolonged and that the appellant had not seriously intended to carry out the threat.
69        Having considered all the above, I decided that the Prosecution was wrong to rely on 
Luan Yuanxin
. In that case, the accused had brandished a meat cleaver while threatening to kill the victim. The facts there, as they were borne out, justified a conviction and sentence under the second limb of s 506 of the PC.
70        As the present conviction ought to have come under the ambit of the first limb of s 506 of the PC, I found the case of 
PP v Tan Beng Hoe
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 123 of 2002 (unreported) relevant in determining the appropriate sentence. In that case, the accused was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for pointing a chopper at the victim while pinning her to a wall. I accordingly allowed the appellant’s appeal against sentence with respect to the charge of criminal intimidation and reduced it to two months’ imprisonment.
DAC 3551/2004: voluntarily causing hurt
71        The appellant cited several cases to support the proposition that a fine would be a sufficient sentence. Those cases, however, did not involve instances of maid abuse. Previous cases have clearly stated that the courts should be ready to impose a custodial sentence in maid abuse cases to reflect the public policy of discouraging the ill treatment of foreign labour. In light of the tone I have set in such cases, it was reasonable for the district judge to have ordered a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment.
Conclusion
72        For the reasons above, I dismissed the appeal against conviction and upheld the sentence in part, with the sentence for DAC 3550/2004 to be reduced from four months’ to two months’ imprisonment.

13 September 2004
 
Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the majority):
 
1          This was an appeal against the decision of Belinda Ang Saw Ean J allowing the respondent’s claim in tort arising from the loss of a small steel tanker belonging to the respondent (reported at 
[2004] 1 SLR 300
). The appellant’s defence of limitation of liability under s 136 of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 179, 1996 Rev Ed) was also rejected. We heard the appeal on 28 July 2004 and by a majority, with Judith Prakash J being undecided, dismissed the appeal on both liability and quantum. We now give our reasons.
 
2          The main substantive question that arose for consideration at the appeal was whether, in the given circumstances, a duty of care was owed by the appellant to the respondent.
 
The background
 
3          In the early hours of 8 March 2001, the appellant’s vessel, the 
Sunrise Crane
, a chemical carrier of Panamanian registry, moored alongside a small steel tanker, the 
Pristine,
 and transferred approximately 34mt of nitric acid contaminated by hydraulic oil into the No 1 wing cargo tank of the 
Pristine
. A short while later, smoke was seen coming out from the forward vent of the 
Pristine
 which also listed a little to port. The crew from the 
Pristine
 evacuated to the 
Sunrise Crane
 and some of the crew members from the 
Sunrise Crane
, with protective equipment and breathing apparatus, boarded the 
Pristine
 to close its valves and openings. The 
Pristine
 eventually capsized. It was subsequently established that the cargo of contaminated nitric acid had bored holes into the hull of the 
Pristine
, causing leaks.
 
4          It was common ground that prior to the transfer of the cargo from the 
Sunrise Crane
 to the 
Pristine
, no one on board the former informed anyone on board the latter that the substance to be transferred was contaminated nitric acid.
 
5          Earlier, on 4 March 2001, the 
Sunrise Crane
 arrived in Singapore carrying a cargo of nitric acid. However, in its tank No 3C, which contained some 34mt of the acid, the cargo was found to have been contaminated due to a leak from the vessel’s defective cargo pump. The 34mt could not be discharged with the rest of the cargo of nitric acid on board the vessel. It had to be disposed of by other safe means. The appellant knew of the highly dangerous nature of such contaminated nitric acid and that only stainless steel tanks could receive it.
 
6          The director of the appellant, Mr Kashiwagi, requested the vessel’s Protection & Indemnity (“P&I”) Club to help in the matter. The Club appointed a surveyor, Capt Gill, to find a suitable licensed contractor to remove the contaminated cargo. Eventually, Capt Gill got in touch with two possible contractors for the job. One of them was Mr Windsor of Pink Energy Enterprises (“Pink Energy”) who was told that the cargo that required disposal was 34mt of contaminated nitric acid. The trial judge accepted Capt Gill’s evidence that Mr Windsor was so told in spite of Mr Windsor’s assertion to the contrary. It was agreed between Mr Gill and Mr Windsor that the price for removing the contaminated cargo was $9,000. The proposed place of transfer was to be at the outer port limit.
 
7          Pink Energy in turn engaged Pristine Maritime Pte Ltd (“Pristine Maritime”), who had the 
Pristine
 on time charter from the owner, the respondent, to remove the contaminated cargo from the 
Sunrise Crane
. However, Mr Windsor failed to advise Pristine Maritime, or the owner of the 
Pristine
, that the cargo was contaminated nitric acid. Instead he said it was “contaminated lubes”. The works order issued by Pink Energy to the 
Pristine
 referred to it as “Annex I slops”, 
ie
, petroleum slops.
 
8          The 
Pristine
 was constituted of mild steel and was used as a slop carrier. It was only capable of carrying MARPOL Annex 1 slops. It was clearly incapable of conveying MARPOL Annex II slops, which nitric acid is.
 
9          There was no direct contractual relationship between the respondent and the appellant. The respondent would undoubtedly have a claim in contract against Pristine Maritime and, in turn, Pink Energy. The question was whether the respondent nevertheless had a separate claim in tort against the 
Sunrise Crane
 for negligence for failing to inform the 
Pristine
 of the nature of the cargo immediately prior to the transfer of the contaminated cargo. In other words, having regard to the circumstances and the clearly dangerous nature of the cargo which required special precaution to be taken for its removal, did the 
Sunrise Crane
 owe a duty of care to so inform the 
Pristine
?
 
The decision below
 
10        The trial judge held that notwithstanding the fact that there was no direct contractual relationship between the appellant and the respondent, the law should still, in the circumstances, impose a duty of care on the appellant to the respondent, 
ie
, to inform the respondent of the nature of the cargo. She agreed that the test to be applied to determine whether a duty arose was that propounded in 
Caparo Industries Plc v Dickson
 
[1990] 2 AC 605
 (“
Caparo
”). That test consisted of three elements (see [14] below), which in her view were all satisfied in this case.
 
11        In coming to her conclusion that the 
Sunrise Crane
 owed a duty to inform the 
Pristine
 of the nature of the cargo to be transferred, the trial judge also took into account the following documents:
 
(a)        
The material safety data sheet (“MSDS”)
 
In the transportation of chemical products, a common mode of conveying information relating to such cargo is an information sheet entitled above. Its purpose is to let the receiving vessel know the characteristics of the cargo and to warn persons dealing with the product of any danger that might be associated with its use, including fire risk, accidental spillage and procedures for cleaning up. The object of the MSDS is, 
inter alia
, to promote safety. Mr Kashiwagi agreed that the MSDS was one of the most important documents. He admitted that the MSDS for the cargo of nitric acid was received by the 
Sunrise Crane
 before the cargo was loaded onto her in Korea. He also admitted that where such a cargo was loaded for the first time, they would insist on the furnishing of a MSDS. Capt Gu Ji Bon, the master of the 
Sunrise Crane
, also acknowledged that the MSDS was an important document and that those who shipped the cargo as well as those who received the cargo should have a copy of it.
 
(b)        
The International Chamber of Shipping Guides
 
The International Chamber of Shipping (“ICS”) had promulgated two sets of recommended rules to ensure good practice in the safe operation of vessels. One was the Tanker Safety Guide (“TS Guide”) and the other was the Ship-to-Ship Transfer Guide (Petroleum) (“STS Guide”). Both guides were in their third edition and will be referred to collectively as “the ICS Guides”. More will be said about these guides a little later.
 
12        The trial judge held that the 
Pristine
 was entitled to a warning from the 
Sunrise Crane
 before the discharge of the contaminated cargo. The fact that it was due to Mr Windsor’s default that the 
Pristine
 was not apprised of the nature of the cargo did not alter the appellant’s duty to inform.
 
13        The trial judge next found that the appellant was not entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability under the Merchant Shipping Act as the appellant had failed to show that the loss was without its fault or privity. There was no system in place to ensure that the master and crew of the 
Sunrise Crane
 would comply with its duty to warn recipients of dangerous goods.
 
Was there a duty to warn?
 
14        The threefold test enunciated by the House of Lords in 
Caparo
 to determine whether, in a given situation, a duty of care arises is as follows:
 
(a)        There must be foreseeability of damage;
 
(b)        There must be a relationship which can be characterised as one of proximity or neighbourhood; and
 
(c)        It must be fair, just and reasonable to impose such a duty.
 
15        In a situation like the present, if the contract of removal and disposal had been entered into directly between the appellant and the respondent, there would have been no doubt whatsoever that the appellant would have owed a duty to advise the respondent, both in contract and in tort, of the nature of the cargo which was about to be transferred. The question in the present case was whether the appellant, in view of the very dangerous nature of the cargo, still owed a separate duty to advise the 
Pristine
 of the nature of the cargo even though the appellant had informed the contractor, Pink Energy, of the nature of the cargo and it was through the default of the contractor that the information was never passed down to Pristine Maritime and, in turn, the 
Pristine
.
 
16        The evidence showed that nitric acid contaminated with hydraulic oil is very dangerous to human beings. Besides being highly corrosive, the fumes it generates are toxic and cancerous, being carcinogenic. The transfer process would require personnel to wear protective gear such as breathing apparatus, masks and gloves.
 
17        The appellant argued that while notionally, in a situation like the present, the appellant would owe a duty of care, the appellant could not have reasonably foreseen that damage would arise as it had specifically asked the P&I Club representative to look for a contractor who was licensed to carry such dangerous cargo. Pink Energy was told of the nature of the cargo. The appellant could not have reasonably contemplated that Pink Energy would sub-contract with another without informing the latter of the nature of the cargo resulting in the despatch of a vessel which was not suitable for the purpose.
 
18        The appellant relied upon the case of 
Surtees v Kingston-upon-Thames Borough Council
 
[1991] 2 FLR 559
 where the issue was whether the injury suffered by the appellant child was reasonably foreseeable by the second and third respondents, who were the child’s foster parents. Was it foreseeable that a two-year-old child would be able to turn on a hot-water tap? The English Court of Appeal by a majority held that the injury was not reasonably foreseeable because to the respondents, it did not seem possible that the appellant, who was then a two-year-old child, would turn on the hot-water tap. Stocker LJ said that to hold the respondent-foster mother to be in breach of a duty of care would be imposing an unreasonably high standard. However, it was clear that the majority, in coming to that view, had had regard to policy considerations. This appeared from what Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson VC said (at 583):
 
There are very real public policy considerations to be taken into account if the conflicts inherent in legal proceedings are to be brought into family relationships. Moreover, the responsibilities of a parent … looking after one or more children, in addition to the myriad other duties which fall on the parent at home, far exceed those of other members of society.
 
19        It seemed to us the position taken by the appellant was that in a situation such as the present, no duty of care would arise because the appellant would be entitled to assume that Pink Energy would have discharged its contractual duties of providing a barge which was in a position to remove the contaminated nitric acid, and thus the damage which arose was wholly unforeseeable. In this regard, the appellant further relied on the case of 
Hodge & Sons v Anglo-American Oil Company
 (1922) 12 Ll L Rep 183 (“
Hodge
”) where a serious explosion on a petroleum barge caused the death of a number of workmen. Others were injured. The barge-owner had contracted with a ship repairer, Miller, to undertake some work on the barge, involving the lifting out of a tank. Miller, in turn, sub-contracted the work to Hodge. Earlier on the fateful day, Miller had informed Hodge that the barge was on its way to the latter’s wharf. A lighterman employed by the owner brought the barge into Hodge’s wharf. Within 30 minutes, the foreman of Hodge commenced work on the barge’s tank with an oxy-acetylene burner before it was free of petrol vapour. An explosion occurred. Hodge sued the owner of the barge for property damage caused by the occasion. Willmott, an employee of Hodge and who was also injured, sued the barge-owner too. However, there was one important fact in that case which made all the difference. The lighterman on arrival at Hodge’s wharf had informed Hodge’s foreman, when he saw the oxy-acetylene burner being brought to the barge, not to use the oxy-acetylene burner until the tanker had been properly ventilated. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the claim of Hodge. However, by a majority, it also held that the barge-owner was not liable to Willmott for not informing him of the dangerous nature of the barge. Bankes LJ observed (at 184–185):
 
The Anglo-American Oil Co were, in my opinion, under a double duty, (a) the duty of using reasonable means for securing the efficient cleaning out of the tank, and (b) the duty of giving any necessary warning of the dangerous character of the tank even after a proper and sufficient cleaning. … With regard to the second duty, a warning would not, in my opinion, be required where the person who would otherwise be entitled to warning was already aware of the danger, or who might reasonably be assumed to be aware of it. … [I]f a warning was needed it was sufficiently given by the notice painted on the barge itself, and by the warning given by the lighterman who brought the barge to Messrs Hodge’s wharf …
 
20        Next, it is also pertinent to note what Scrutton LJ summarised to be the law on the point. First, (at 187), he referred to the case of 
Dominion Natural Gas Co, Ld v Collins
 
[1909] AC 646
 where Lord Dunedin said:
 
What that duty is will vary according to the subject-matter of the things involved. It has, however, again and again been held that in the case of articles dangerous in themselves, such as loaded firearms, poisons, explosives, and other things 
ejusdem generis
, there is a peculiar duty to take precaution imposed upon those who send forth or instal [
sic
] such articles when it is necessarily the case that other parties will come within their proximity.
 
He then went on to hold (also at 187) that:
 
In the case of things dangerous in themselves the supplier or circulator is liable to persons with whom he has no contract for damages which they could not avoid by reasonable care; but if he warns them of the danger, or the danger is obvious, so that they need no warning, he is not liable because they could avoid the danger by reasonable care. … The duty is to warn of dangers not obvious to a reasonably careful person.
 
21        Finally, Scrutton LJ opined that the law which should apply to the case was as follows (at 188):
 
The law, therefore, seems to be: (1) That if the barge which has carried petrol is an article dangerous in itself, it is the duty of the owners to take proper and reasonable precautions to prevent its doing damage to people likely to come into contact with it. These precautions may be fulfilled by entrusting it to a competent person with reasonable warning of its dangerous character, if that danger is not obvious. If such precautions are not taken, the owner will be liable to third persons with whom he has no contract for damage done by the barge, which they could not have avoided with reasonable care. (2) If the barge which has carried petrol is not dangerous in itself, but becomes dangerous because it has been insufficiently cleaned, and the owner is ignorant of the danger, the owner is not liable for damage caused by it to persons with whom he has no contract. … (3) In the case of a thing dangerous in itself, where either the danger is obvious or the owner has given proper warning to the person entrusted with it, not being his servant, the owner is not liable for negligence of such person causing injury to a third party; such negligence is 
nova causa interveniens.
 
22        Scrutton LJ further found (at 189), in relation to the facts of the case before him, that:
 
It appears to me that Miller, Hodges and Bennett had ample knowledge and warning that the barge was dangerous, and that after hatches had been closed for some unknown time lights might not be used on the barge without tests or other precautions. For the owners to hand a dangerous barge to competent people who had full knowledge of the probability of danger, even if they did not know the exact amount of it, appears to me to involve no further liability on the owners. If those competent people with knowledge are then negligent, that is, in my view, a new intervening cause, which may impose liability on the interveners, but breaks the chain of liability on the owners.
 
23        The facts in our present case were not similar to those in 
Hodge
. Both Bankes and Scrutton LJJ observed that there was ample knowledge on the part of Hodge and Miller that the barge was dangerous: there was a notice painted on the barge itself and in addition, the lighterman of the barge did warn Hodge’s foreman not to use the oxy-acetylene burner until the tanker had been properly ventilated. There was absolutely no similar warning given by the crew of the 
Sunrise Crane
 to the 
Pristine
. In fact, we note that the crew of the 
Pristine
 did ask the crew of the 
Sunrise Crane
 for a sample of the cargo that was going to be discharged into the 
Pristine
 but this request was turned down by the crew of the 
Sunrise Crane
.
 
24        The ultimate question that has to be answered is what was the degree or scope of care which a person in the shoes of the appellant should exercise. Lord Atkin put it well in 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 562
 in these words (at 596):
 
The nature of the thing may very well call for different degrees of care
, and the person dealing with it may well contemplate persons as being within the sphere of his duty to take care who would not be sufficiently proximate with less dangerous goods; so that not only the degree of care but the range of persons to whom a duty is owed may be extended. But they all illustrate the general principle. [emphasis added]
 
25        It is obvious that the law expects a person who carries a pound of dynamite to exercise more care than if he is only carrying a pound of butter, or putting it another way, to exercise more care with a bottle of poison than a bottle of lemonade: see 
Beckett v Newalls Insulation Co Ld
 
[1953] 1 WLR 8
. What is adequate for one set of circumstances may not be so in relation to a different set of circumstances. It stands to reason that more care must be exercised where a highly dangerous substance is involved.
 
26        It seemed to us that this was very much in the thought of Lord Roskill in 
Caparo
 when he said (at 628):
 
[I]t has now to be accepted that there is no simple formula or touchstone to which recourse can be had in order to provide in every case a ready answer to the questions whether, given certain facts, the law will or will not impose liability for negligence or in cases where such liability can be shown to exist, determine the extent of that liability. Phrases such as “foreseeability”, “proximity”, “neighbourhood,” “just and reasonable,” “fairness,” “voluntary acceptance of risk,” or “voluntary assumption of responsibility” will be found used from time to time in the different cases. But, as your Lordships have said, such phrases are not precise definitions. At best they are but labels or phrases descriptive of the very different factual situations which can exist in particular cases and which must be carefully examined in each case before it can be pragmatically determined whether a duty of care exists and, if so, what is the scope and extent of that duty.
 
27        In this regard, the following finding of the judge was germane to the question of whether the appellant still owed a duty of care at the time the transfer was effected (at [31]):
 
On the overall evidence before me, I find that Captain Gill [and hence in our view the appellant] knew that someone else [and not Pink Energy] would undertake the actual collection and disposal of the contaminated nitric acid. After the disposal contract was awarded to Pink Energy, the [appellant] knew the identity of the receiving vessel. The [appellant was] provided with certain information. [It was] given, in particular, the name of the receiving vessel, her registration No SB411J, the VHF channel for radio communication between 
Sunrise Crane
 and 
Pristine
 and the coordinates at OPL for the two vessels to rendezvous the night of 7 March 2001.
 
28        The appellant was in the business of transporting dangerous goods. The respondent was not. In our opinion, the judge was correct to hold that carriers like the appellant should not take for granted (a) their own common knowledge or assumptions about safety in the transportation of chemicals and (b) that their contractor, Pink Energy, who would not be the one actually carrying out the task, would properly discharge its contractual duties. Mr Windsor had, in fact, asked Capt Gill for a fax confirmation of the disposal assignment, but Capt Gill said that he was too busy to attend to it. The judge’s observation on this at [38] was most apt: “With a verbal contract, the opportunity for mistakes occurring is not so remote.”
 
29        Thus, the following features of the present case were critical. First, the cargo to be transferred was highly dangerous and toxic. Second, the appellant knew that Pink Energy would not be the party removing the cargo. Third, there was no written communication between the appellant (or Capt Gill) and Pink Energy as to the nature of the cargo and the request for one by Pink Energy was not acceded to. Fourth, the appellant’s and the respondent’s vessels were in close proximity to each other when the transfer was carried out. Fifth, the appellant, being in the business of transporting dangerous chemicals, would have appreciated the dire consequences if nitric acid were to be transferred to a vessel not built for receiving such a substance. Sixth, the practice of the 
Sunrise Crane
 of asking for a MSDS in relation to the first-time shipment of a particular chemical, illustrated the need for special care in regard to the shipment of chemicals, particularly chemicals of the nature of nitric acid. Seventh, the crew of the 
Pristine
 had asked for a sample of the slops but this was not provided to them by the crew of the 
Sunrise Crane
. Eighth, there was evidence to suggest that during the transfer of the contaminated cargo, the crew of the 
Pristine
 were without protective gear because after the transfer was effected and smoke appeared, the cargo officer of the 
Pristine
 had requested for the loan of some gas masks from the 
Sunrise Crane
 to enable the crew of the 
Pristine
 to close its manholes. Moreover, even with the borrowed gas masks, the crew of the 
Pristine
 refused to reboard the barge to close the manholes. This emerged from the evidence of the master of the 
Sunrise Crane
, Capt Gu.
 
30        In relation to ordinary or less dangerous chemicals, an advice to the main contractor could perhaps suffice. But, in our judgment, having regard to the circumstances of the present case, and the fact that a very dangerous substance was involved, more care should have been exercised by the 
Sunrise Crane.
 In a sense, this is not unlike the situation where an employer is nevertheless liable for the acts of an independent contractor where the acts involved special dangers to others. Accordingly, we agreed with the trial judge’s determination.
 
Man B&W Diesel S E Asia Pte Ltd v PT Bumi International Tankers
 
31        The appellant placed considerable reliance on the views expressed by this court in 
Man B&W Diesel S E Asia Pte Ltd v PT Bumi International Tankers
 
[2004] 2 SLR 300
 (“
Bumi
”) where it stated (at [34]):
 
We also acknowledge that the 
Donoghue
 principle is not a statutory definition. Its application has not remained static. It is evolving. It offers an avenue of redress for losses suffered by a person on account of the acts or omission of another, where such losses would otherwise be without a remedy.
 
32        It is, however, also important to note what the court there stated in the next sentence:
 
While we would not say that for every subsequent case to fall within the scope of the decision in 
Ocean Front
 [
ie
, 
RSP Architects Planners & Engineers v Ocean Front Pte Ltd
 
[1996] 1 SLR 113
], the facts must be identical or the same, extreme caution must be exercised in extending the 
Donoghue
 principle, or the decision in 
Ocean Front
, to new situations, particularly to a scenario which is essentially contractual.
 
33        The remarks quoted above of this court were made in relation to its decision in the 
Ocean Front
. In 
Ocean Front
, this court broke new ground when it held that the developer of a condominium was liable in tort for non-personal injury losses suffered by the management corporation of the development. In coming to that conclusion, the court took into account, 
inter alia
, the scheme of things laid down in the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1988 Rev Ed) and the role of the management corporation in a condominium development. It was in that statutory context that the court found that the developer owed a duty of care to the management corporation even though there was no actual privity of contract between the two.
 
34        Reverting to this court’s observations in 
Bumi
 quoted above, while it is true that the law of tort offers an avenue of redress for losses suffered by a person where such losses would otherwise be without a remedy, it does not conversely mean that remedies in tort become automatically unavailable simply because the plaintiff has a remedy in contract against another party. To conflate the two would be to ignore the fundamental difference between contract and tort. Tortious duties are primarily fixed by law while contractual duties are based on the consent of the parties.
 
35        More importantly, there is a fundamental difference between the claim in the present action and that in 
Bumi.
 Here, the claim was for direct physical damage to property; there was no attempt to extend the 
Donoghue
 principle to a new situation. In 
Bumi
, it was for pure consequential economic losses and there the shipowner and the contractor had by contract expressly provided for the remedies which would be available in the event that the vessel (and its engine) did not perform up to specifications. And that, in fact, happened. However, the engine was provided to the contractor by a sub-contractor. The court there held that the plaintiff was not entitled to claim in tort against the sub-contractor for the pure economic losses.
 
36        It is clear that the law does differentiate between a claim in pure economic loss and that for personal injuries or physical damage. In respect of the former, the law is more restrictive in imposing a duty of care. The rationale for this is expressed very eloquently by the authors of 
Clerk and Lindsell on Torts
 (18th Ed, 2000) as follows (at para 7-85):
 
Three features distinguish economic loss claims from most physical damage claims. First, whilst the links between negligence and physical damage depend largely on the laws of nature and necessarily limit the type of relationship giving rise to a claim, those between negligence and pure economic loss are primarily human in creation and can form a complex web through which economic losses can ripple out from the one negligent act. Secondly, because the economic relationships are frequently created rather than imposed, the participants in the web have a greater opportunity to use contracts to determine the level of risk to be taken and the degree of protection from loss required. … Thirdly, as Hobhouse LJ has observed, “in a competitive economic society the conduct of one person is always liable to have economic consequences for another and, in principle, economic activity does not have to have regard to the interests of others and is justifiable by the actor having regard to his own interests alone”. Furthermore, as McHugh J has noted, “pure economic losses frequently result in mere transfers of wealth. The plaintiff’s loss is the defendant’s or a third party’s gain”, whereas “harm to a person or property ordinarily involves a new loss to social wealth.” These features have led the courts to take a more restrictive approach to the imposition of a duty of care in relation to economic loss than in relation to physical damage.
 
37        Thus, the approach taken in 
Bumi
 can have no application to the present action which came very much within the traditional mould of a claim in negligence where direct property damage was caused. The only question was whether the owner of the 
Sunrise Crane
 had fulfilled its duty of care by merely engaging Pink Energy to remove the cargo and telling Pink Energy of the nature of the cargo. For the reasons given in [29] and [30] above, we did not think so.
 
38        While it is true that in 
Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd
 
[1996] 2 SLR 505
 (“
Soil-Build
”), a personal injury case, this court adopted the threefold test propounded in 
Caparo
, a case involving economic loss, it should not therefore follow that both types of cases stood exactly on the same footing. While the applicable test may be the same, the question whether in a given situation a duty of care arises, and the scope of the duty, must necessarily depend on all the circumstances. Here, again, we would reiterate what Lord Roskill said in 
Caparo
 quoted in [26] above.
 
39        In 
Soil-Build
, this court held that the owner and main contractor were not liable to a worker of a sub-contractor who was injured in the course of work. There was nothing inherently dangerous in what the worker was to do. The injured worker fell from a height because of an unsafe method of work which he and his fellow workers had adopted.
 
40        The appellant also relied upon 
Kubach v Hollands
 [1936] 3 All ER 907, 
Holmes v Ashford
 [1950] 2 All ER 76 and 
Norton Australia Pty Limited v Streets Ice Cream Pty Limited
 (1968) 120 CLR 635 to submit that notifying an intermediary of the risk is sufficient. We did not think these cases were helpful as they were clearly distinguishable. They did not involve ships transferring hazardous goods. In those cases, it was envisaged that the goods would physically pass from the manufacturer, through the intermediary, and eventually to the end user. A similar factual matrix could not be found in the present appeal. The highly hazardous cargo was directly transferred from the 
Sunrise Crane
 to the 
Pristine
 and the appellant had envisaged, right from the beginning, that there would be such a direct transfer onto a barge which would be coming to collect the highly hazardous contaminated cargo.
 
41        We did not think that in imposing a duty of care in the circumstances here, we had adopted an unreasonably high standard. Neither did we think it was unfair or unjust to impose such a duty. A higher standard of care was necessary because of the highly hazardous nature of the cargo and the appellant was aware that the actual licensed contractor who would be removing the cargo would not be Pink Energy but someone else. There was no way the 
Pristine
 could have known that the cargo was contaminated nitric acid. Indeed, 
Pristine’s
 request for a sample of the cargo was turned down.
 
The ICS Guides
 
42        We now turn to the ICS Guides. The appellant alleged that the judge was wrong to have relied on them because none of the witnesses were questioned as to their applicability. Furthermore, the appellant submitted that if the ICS Guides could properly apply, then its provisions should apply to both vessels.
 
43        However, we must point out that it was the appellant who first introduced the TS Guide into the proceedings in its closing submission at the trial to substantiate what it alleged to be the meaning of “slops”. As the appellant produced only a part of this Guide, which was helpful to the point it was trying to make, the respondent placed the entire document before the court. The respondent relied upon the parts of the TS Guide which had a bearing on the question of limitation of liability. It should also be noted that the TS Guide has references to the STS Guide. An example of such a cross-referencing can be found at para 5.14.1 of the TS Guide, which reads:
 
Navigational and ship handling aspects of an STS operation between chemical carriers will be very similar to those of an STS operation between oil tankers, as described in the ICS/OCIMF publication Ship to Ship Transfer Guide (Petroleum), which should be consulted ...
 
44        The appellant in reply had objected to the respondent’s reliance on the TS Guide. This was rebutted by the respondent who argued that the court should be entitled to see what the entire document contained; it was not for the appellant to pick and choose what the court could see. It stands to reason that as the appellant had relied on a part of the ICS Guides to substantiate its case, it should have no reason to object to another part of the ICS Guides being relied upon by the opponent to show global industry practices or standards.
 
45        The ICS is the international trade association for merchant ship operators and its membership comprises national shipowners’ associations representing over half of the world’s merchant fleet. The preface to the TS Guide states:
 
The purpose of this publication is to provide those serving on ships carrying hazardous and noxious chemicals in bulk with up to date information on recognised good practice in safe operation. … The recommendations cannot cover every possible situation that may be encountered on a chemical tanker, but they do provide wide general guidance on safe procedures and safe working practices when handling and transporting chemicals in bulk …
 
The Guide deals primarily with operational matters and good safety practices. ...
 
IMPORTANT NOTE
 
It is emphasised that this Guide is meant to complement, not supersede, any company safety and operational guidelines or ship emergency plans, including safety management procedures required by the IMO International Safety Management (ISM) Code.
 
Paragraph 1.1 of the TS Guide states:
 
Chemical tankers are required to transport a wide range of different cargoes, and many tankers are designed to carry a large number of segregated products simultaneously. The operation of chemical tankers differs from any other bulk liquid transportation operations, in that on a single voyage a large number of cargoes with different properties, characteristics and inherent hazards may be carried. Moreover, in port several products may be handled simultaneously at one berth, typically including different operations such as discharge and loading as well as tank cleaning. Even the less sophisticated chemical tankers are more complex to operate than oil tankers.
 
Paragraph 2.2 of the TS Guide goes on to state in no uncertain terms:
 
The IMO Codes require that certain information must be available on board the ship for each particular cargo, and prior to loading. … It is the shipper’s responsibility to provide the necessary information, which may be given in the form of a cargo information form or data sheet for each cargo. Loading should not commence before the master is satisfied that the necessary information for safe handling of the cargo is available to the personnel involved.
 
46        The reference to the ICS Guides made by the judge was only to show that the practice of the 
Sunrise Crane
 of requiring the furnishing of a MSDS whenever it was the first time a cargo of that particular chemical was being shipped on board, was completely in line with the safety practices adopted by the industry as a whole. She said at [40]:
 
The duty to inform the receiver of the dangerous nature of the goods is not foreign to the chemical tankers in the industry. Such disclosure is very much part of and inherent in the basic safety procedures and work practices of chemical tankers in the industry. The 
ICS Tanker Safety Guide (Chemicals)
, (3rd Ed, 2000) which is intended as a guide to complement and not replace a shipowner’s own safety or operational guidelines for chemical tankers sets out the reasonable steps the recipient of chemical cargo [is] to take once the information on the cargo is received. The section on ship-to-ship transfer contains a checklist to ensure compatibility of ships and their cargo handling equipment. It provides that when preparing for a ship-to-ship transfer, the two masters involved should agree at the earliest opportunity on every aspect of the transfer procedure. The guide also provides that the cargo operation should be planned and agreed between the two ships. The same safety measures for handling cargo should be observed when handling slops or contaminated cargo for disposal.
 
47        Taking the recommendations in the ICS Guides into account, which required the appellant to inform the 
Pristine
 of the nature of the cargo when the transfer was about to begin, all the more the acts of the appellant fell short of the standard of care required of it.
 
Proximity
 
48        Turning next to the test of proximity. In numerous cases, many attempts were made to elucidate this concept as applied in different circumstances. We think it would be expedient to revert back to basics, the very seminal pronouncement of Lord Atkin in 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 562
 at 580 where he said:
 
Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be – persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.
 
49        This statement of Lord Atkin was further elucidated by Deane J in the Australian High Court in the case of 
Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman
 (1985) 60 ALR 1 at 55 as follows:
 
It involves the notion of nearness or closeness and embraces physical proximity (in the sense of space and time) between the person or property of the plaintiff and the person or property of the defendant, circumstantial proximity such as an overriding relationship of employer and employee or of a professional man and his client and what may (perhaps loosely) be referred to as causal proximity in the sense of the closeness or directness of the causal connection or relationship between the particular act or course of conduct and the loss or injury sustained. It may reflect an assumption by one party of a responsibility to take care to avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the person or property of another or reliance by one party upon such care being taken by the other in circumstances where the other party knew or ought to have known of that reliance. Both the identity and the relative importance of the factors which are determinative of an issue of proximity are likely to vary in different categories of case.
 
50        Plainly, the position of the appellant’s vessel and the respondent’s tanker was as proximate as could conceivably be. The two vessels were moored alongside and, through hoses, the contaminated nitric acid was discharged into a tank of the 
Pristine
. The situation here could hardly be any different from the case where there was a collision between two vessels, causing physical damage to either or both vessels. It was beyond argument that the act of transferring the contaminated cargo from the 
Sunrise Crane
 to the 
Pristine
 was an act which directly affected the respondent.
 
Limitation of liability
 
51        Finally, we would like to state that we have seen in draft the dissenting opinion of Prakash J where she dealt with the question why the limitation of liability prescribed in s 136 of the Merchant Shipping Act was not available to the appellant in this case. We agree with what she has stated and do not wish to add anything more.

Judith Prakash J (delivering the dissenting judgment):
Introduction
52        This appeal raised interesting issues relating to the extent to which a duty of care can arise in tort in relation to actions carried out pursuant to contract and to the manner in which such duty may be discharged. There was also an issue as to whether the appellant shipowner had established that it was entitled to limit its liability for damage caused by its vessel on the ground that such damage was not caused by its actual fault or privity. The appeal was heard on 28 July 2004 and at the conclusion of the oral arguments I was undecided but Yong Pung How CJ and Chao Hick Tin JA were of the view that it should be dismissed. The appeal was, accordingly, dismissed. I have now had the opportunity of reconsidering the issues and the authorities and have come to certain conclusions which I set out below.
Background
53        The appellant, Doman Shipping SA, a Panamanian company, is the owner of the vessel 
Sunrise Crane
. The vessel is managed by a Japanese company, Setsuyo Kisen Co Ltd, and one Mr Akihiko Kashiwagi is a director of both the management company and the appellant. The vessel is a chemical carrier which is registered at the port of Panama. Its construction permits it to safely carry various liquid chemical products which are hazardous in nature. In February 2001, the vessel was carrying, among other things, a cargo of nitric acid for discharge in Singapore. Nitric acid is an extremely dangerous substance due to its highly corrosive nature. It can only be carried in stainless steel tanks as it corrodes mild steel.
54        The vessel arrived in Singapore on 4 March 2001. The next day, it was found that some 34mt of nitric acid stowed in tank No 3C had been contaminated by hydraulic oil. This contaminated cargo could not be discharged with the rest of the nitric acid and arrangements had to be made to dispose of it on an urgent basis. The vessel is entered with the Japan Ship Owners’ Mutual Protection & Indemnity Association (“the Club”) so Mr Kashiwagi asked the Club to look into the matter and find a licensed contractor to dispose of the contaminated nitric acid.
55        The Club’s representative in Singapore appointed a surveyor (Capt Gill) who investigated the situation and also attempted to find a contractor to remove the contaminated cargo from the vessel. Capt Gill contacted two outfits in Singapore that he knew were in the business of disposing of contaminated liquid cargo and, having told them the nature of the cargo, asked for quotations for its disposal. As a result of these enquiries, and after discussions between the Club’s representative, Capt Gill, and the management company’s local representative, a contract was made between the appellant and a business called Pink Energy Enterprises (“Pink Energy”) for the disposal of the cargo by transferring it from the 
Sunrise Crane
 to another ship which would then take it away and deal with it. The representative of Pink Energy was one Malcolm Windsor. He was told that the cargo to be disposed of was 34mt of nitric acid contaminated with hydraulic oil and was specifically asked whether Pink Energy was capable of carrying out the disposal of this cargo. Mr Windsor confirmed that it could do the job. He was also shown a sample of the contaminated cargo. In court, Mr Windsor denied that he had been told that the cargo was nitric acid but the judge found against him on this point and that finding has not been appealed against.
56        The ship-to-ship transfer was arranged for the night of 7 March 2001. Pink Energy informed the appellant that the recipient vessel would be the motor tanker 
Pristine
 of the port of Singapore. The 
Pristine
 was owned by the respondent, Cipta Sarana Marine Pte Ltd, who had let it out on time charter to Pristine Maritime Pte Ltd. The latter operated the 
Pristine
 as a slop carrier. It collected, from other vessels, petroleum slops falling within the category known as the “MARPOL Annex I slops”. Nitric acid is not an Annex I slop. It is an Annex II slop. The 
Pristine
 was constructed of mild steel and was not designed to carry Annex II slops. On behalf of Pink Energy, Mr Windsor employed Pristine Maritime Pte Ltd to collect the contaminated cargo from the 
Sunrise Crane
. He did not tell Pristine Maritime or the respondent that the contaminated cargo was nitric acid. He described it as “contaminated lubes”.
57        The 
Pristine
 arrived alongside the 
Sunrise Crane
 at the Western Petroleum Anchorage at about 1.00am on 8 March 2001. The hose of the 
Sunrise Crane
 was connected to 
Pristine’s
 tanks and discharging operations started. Within about half an hour all the contaminated cargo was transferred into the tanks of the 
Pristine
. A little while later whitish smoke was seen emanating from the sounding pipes of the 
Pristine
 and the vessel listed a little to port. Smoke continued to emerge and the vessel listed more. The crew were evacuated from the 
Pristine
 onto the 
Sunrise Crane
. Eventually, the 
Pristine
 capsized. Investigations subsequently determined that the nitric acid had bored holes into the hull of the 
Pristine
, thus permitting the ingress of water. It was not disputed that no one on board the 
Sunrise Crane
 had told anyone on board the 
Pristine
 before pumping started that it was contaminated nitric acid that was making its way into the latter vessel.
58        The respondent brought this action to recover the value of the 
Pristine
. In its statement of claim, it alleged that the appellant owed a duty of care to it as the owner of the 
Pristine
 to give it full details of the nature of the cargo before the cargo was to be received by the 
Pristine
 and/or to deliver cargo that was safe for the 
Pristine
 to carry. The appellant’s response was that it had engaged an independent contractor, 
ie
, Pink Energy, to dispose of the cargo and that Pink Energy was fully informed of the nature of the cargo and had inspected a sample of it. Pink Energy had nominated 
Pristine
 as the tanker barge to receive the cargo and there was no contractual nexus between the appellant and Pink Energy. Thus, the appellant did not owe the respondent any duty of care to inform the respondent of the nature of the cargo and even if it did, this duty had been discharged when it informed Pink Energy of the nature of the cargo prior to Pink Energy’s agreement to undertake the disposal job. In the alternative, the appellant pleaded that it was entitled to limit its liability in accordance with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 179, 1996 Rev Ed) as the loss of the 
Pristine
 had arisen without the appellant’s actual fault or privity.
The decision below
59        The action was heard before Belinda Ang Saw Ean J. The learned trial judge found in favour of the respondent. She held that the appellant owed a duty of care to the respondent to warn it of the dangerous nature of the cargo before the 
Pristine
 received it but made no finding in relation to the allegation that the appellant had a duty to deliver a cargo which was safe for the 
Pristine
. She found that the contractual relationship between the appellant and Pink Energy was no answer to the wholly independent consideration of whether the law should impose a duty of care on the appellant with respect to the respondent. Using the test established in 
Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman
 
[1990] 2 AC 605
 (“
Caparo
”), Ang J found that a duty of care was established as all three elements of this test had been satisfied. The judge mentioned a document called the material safety data sheet (“MSDS”) which is used in the transportation of chemicals as a mode of conveying information on such cargo and which is usually given by the shipper of the cargo to a carrier prior to shipment. She considered that the 
Sunrise Crane
 should have provided the 
Pristine
 with an MSDS. The judge also held that disclosure to a receiver of dangerous goods of the nature of such goods is very much part of and inherent in the basic safety procedures and work practices of chemical tankers in the industry. She referred to a document called “ICS Tanker Safety Guide (Chemical)” in support of that finding. On this basis, the judge found that the appellant had a duty of care to warn the 
Pristine
 of the nature and dangerous characteristics of the cargo it was proposing to discharge into the 
Pristine
 before commencing such discharge. By failing to give such warning, the appellant was in breach of its duty owed to the respondent to take reasonable care to prevent damage to the 
Pristine
 from the contaminated cargo.
60        Although Ang J found that on a balance of probabilities, Capt Gill did inform Mr Windsor that the cargo was contaminated nitric acid, she held that Mr Windsor’s failure to inform Pristine Maritime about it did not break the chain of causation. In her judgment, a disclosure to Pink Energy and Mr Windsor’s knowledge of the dangerous nature of the contaminated nitric acid could not, in law, be imputed to the respondent. She decided that the works order given by Pink Energy to Pristine Maritime which stated that the cargo was “contaminated lubes” was not an intervening act because it was issued before the appellant had failed to inform the respondent about the dangerous nature of the cargo. Nor did Mr Windsor’s breach of his contract to provide a licensed contractor break the chain of causation – regardless of its competence, the respondent was entitled to a warning prior to the cargo being loaded.
61        Finally, Ang J held that the appellant could not avail itself of the defence of limitation. The appellant’s appointment of a competent crew qualified to handle the nitric acid was not enough to show that the negligence of those on board the 
Sunrise Crane
 was without the fault or privity of the appellant. She also found that there was no evidence of what Mr Kashiwagi did at the management level to ensure that the master and those on board would comply with the appellant’s duty to warn recipients of dangerous goods.
Issues on appeal
62        The appellant appealed against the whole of Ang J’s decision. Thus, the main issues on appeal were the same as those in the court below. These were:
(a)        Should the law impose a duty of care on the appellant towards the respondent when the appellant had contracted with and relied on Pink Energy so far as the disposal contract was concerned?
(b)        Even if there was a duty of care on the part of the appellant towards the respondent, was it discharged when the appellant informed Pink Energy of the nature of the cargo to be disposed of?
(c)        If the appellant did owe the respondent a duty of care, was the loss suffered by the respondent caused by Pink Energy’s misrepresentation on the nature of the cargo or was it caused by the breach of duty on the part of the appellant that arose when the crew of the 
Sunrise Crane
 failed to inform the crew of the 
Pristine
 of the nature of the cargo to be discharged?
(d)        Was the respondent entitled to limit its liability?
Existence of a duty of care
63        In view of the judge’s finding that the appellant owed the respondent a duty to warn it of the nature of the cargo it was going to discharge into the 
Pristine’s
 tanks before commencing the discharge procedure, the duty of care that has to be considered is whether in the circumstances of this case such a duty to warn existed. As the appellant submitted, a duty of care is not an abstract matter. In each case what has to be established is the existence of a duty on the part of the particular defendant to avoid causing damage or injury to the particular plaintiff of the particular kind which he had in fact sustained.
64        In a much cited passage, Lord Bridge of Harwich in 
Caparo
 ([59] 
supra
 at 617–618) identified three elements that had to be present in order for the court to determine whether a duty of care was owed in any particular circumstance and if so what its scope was. The three elements were: foreseeability of damage, a relationship of “proximity” or “neighbourhood” existing between the party owing the duty and the party to whom it was owed and thirdly, that the situation was one in which the court considered it fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of a given scope upon the one party for the benefit of the other. Lord Roskill, who also sat in 
Caparo
, cautioned at 628:
[I]t has now to be accepted that there is no simple formula or touchstone to which recourse can be had in order to provide in every case a ready answer to the questions whether, given certain facts, the law will or will not impose liability for negligence or in cases where such liability can be shown to exist, determine the extent of that liability. Phrases such as “foreseeability,” “proximity,” “neighbourhood,” “just and reasonable,” “fairness,” “voluntary acceptance of risk,” or “voluntary assumption of responsibility” will be found used from time to time in the different cases. But, as your Lordships have said, such phrases are not precise definitions. At best they are but labels or phrases descriptive of the very different factual situations which can exist in particular cases and which must be carefully examined in each case before it can be pragmatically determined whether a duty of care exists and, if so, what is the scope and extent of that duty.
Caparo
 
was a case involving economic loss but its principles were applied by this court in 
Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd
 
[1996] 2 SLR 505
 (“
Mohd Sapri
”), a claim for physical injury, to explain why a specialist contractor on a building site owed no duty to a worker employed by an independent sub-contractor to provide him with proper equipment and to supervise his use of such equipment.
65        This court has had further occasion to consider the principles regarding the imposition of a duty of care in a series of cases starting in 1996 and ending just a few months ago. It appeared at first that of the three elements mentioned in 
Caparo
, that of proximity was pre-eminent and could be used as the main determinant of the existence of a duty of care. The first of these cases was 
RSP Architects Planners & Engineers v Ocean Front Pte Ltd
 
[1996] 1 SLR 113
 (“
Ocean Front
”). There the court conducted a wide-ranging review of the authorities both in England (including 
Caparo
) and in Australia and concluded at 139, [68] and [69] (
per
 L P Thean JA):
Whatever language is used the court is basically involved in a delicate balancing exercise in which consideration is given to all the conflicting claims of the plaintiffs and the defendants as viewed in a wider context of society. …
But the approach of the court has been to examine a particular circumstance to determine whether there exists that degree of proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant as would give rise to a duty of care by the latter to the former with respect to the damage sustained by the former. Such proximity is the ‘determinant’ of the duty of care and also the scope of such duty.
The court then went on to adopt a two-step test. The first step was to determine whether the necessary degree of proximity existed between the plaintiff and the defendant so as to give rise to a duty of care by the defendant to the plaintiff and to determine that duty. The second step was, having found such degree of proximity, to consider whether there was any material factor or policy which precluded such a duty from arising. The emphasis on proximity as being the main ingredient in the determination of the duty of care was reiterated in 
RSP Architects Planners & Engineers v MCST Plan No 1075
 
[1999] 2 SLR 449
 (see the discussion at [15]–[32]) where the main issue was whether 
Ocean Front
 had been correctly decided. Both these cases were cases that involved the recognition of a duty of care on the part of builders and architects to avoid causing economic loss to persons who purchased the buildings built or designed by them.
66        In the latest case on the issue, 
Man B&W Diesel S E Asia v PT Bumi International Tankers
 
[2004] 2 SLR 300
 (the “
Bumi
” case), this court declined to extend the duty not to cause economic loss to the situation of a builder of an engine 
vis-à-vis
 the owner of the ship in which that engine was installed when there was no contract between the engine builder and the shipowner. Chao Hick Tin JA, who delivered the court’s decision, reconsidered previous authorities including 
Ocean Front
. Whilst not disavowing the two-step test applied there, he drew attention to other factors that had been important in 
Ocean Front
 and stated (at [31]):
The court also indicated that there was no single rule or set of rules for determining whether a duty of care arises in a particular circumstance, and the scope of that duty. It said that in determining whether a duty of care existed, and the scope of such duty, all the relevant circumstances would have to be examined. This approach was similar to that enunciated by Gibbs CJ in 
The Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman
 (1984-1985) 157 CLR 424 at 441:
In deciding whether the necessary relationship exists, and the scope of the duty which it creates, it is necessary for the court to examine closely all the circumstances that throw light on the nature of the relationship between the parties.
It would appear therefore that the concept of proximity has been moved slightly from the centre of the exercise and the court has returned to what some may consider a more traditional balancing of the various factors involved without giving one or another pre-eminence. Thus, in deciding whether or not a particular defendant owed a particular plaintiff a duty not to cause the plaintiff the damage he in fact sustained, the court must give due regard to all the circumstances in which the transaction that gave rise to the damage occurred so as to understand the relationship between the parties at the time of the damage. Whilst the three cases referred to above were all cases involving economic loss, these principles apply equally to cases involving physical loss as was recognised by this court when it applied the 
Caparo
 formulation to the situation in 
Mohd Sapri
.
67        The relevant circumstances in this case are as follows:
(a)        First, that nitric acid is an extremely dangerous substance capable of causing physical damage to persons and property.
(b)        That the appellant was aware of the danger that nitric acid could cause.
(c)        That the appellant appointed a reputable agent, the Club, to obtain for it a licensed contractor to take the nitric acid off its ship.
(d)        That Capt Gill, a person with experience in the local marine industry, approached Pink Energy whom he knew to be in the business of disposing liquid waste from vessels.
(e)        That Pink Energy was informed of the nature of the cargo to be handled.
(f)         That the appellant only gave the contract to Pink Energy after receiving an assurance from Mr Windsor that Pink Energy was capable of carrying out the disposal of such cargo. As the judge found, Pink Energy acted as an independent contractor and it was not the employee or agent of either Pristine Maritime or the appellant.
(g)        That Pink Energy sub-contracted the job of disposing of the cargo to Pristine Maritime without telling the latter what the true nature of the cargo was and Pristine Maritime then sent its chartered vessel, the 
Pristine
, to collect the cargo on the basis that the same was contaminated lubes.
(g)        That when the 
Pristine
 arrived and moored alongside the 
Sunrise Crane
, no one on board the 
Sunrise Crane
 informed those on board the 
Pristine
 of the nature of the cargo to be transferred into the latter’s tanks.
On the above facts alone, I have difficulty in finding that the appellant owed either the respondent or those on board the 
Pristine
 a duty to warn them of the nature of the cargo prior to discharge. I will explain.
68        The respondent submitted that a person who is handing over dangerous goods to another has a duty to inform the party physically receiving the dangerous goods of their nature. In this respect, it relied on the decisions in 
Brass v Maitland
 (1856) 6 EL & BL 470; 119 ER 940, 
Bamfield v Goole and Sheffield Transport Company, Limited
 
[1910] 2 KB 94
 (“
Bamfield
”) and 
Hodge & Sons v Anglo-American Oil Company
 [1922] Ll L Rep 183 (“
Hodge & Sons
”). In the first case, the plaintiffs were common carriers who accepted all sorts of cargo on board their vessel for carriage. The defendants delivered bleaching powder packed in casks to the plaintiffs’ vessel without informing them that the bleaching powder contained a corrosive substance. The packing was inadequate and the corrosive contents escaped and caused damage to other cargo on board the vessel. Lord Campbell CJ and Wightman J held that there was an implied undertaking on the part of shippers of goods on board a general ship that they would not deliver, to be carried on the voyage, packages of a dangerous nature, which those employed on behalf of the shipowner might not on inspection be reasonably expected to know to be of a dangerous nature, without giving notice. That case established the duty of notification in a situation where the contract for carriage was directly between the shipowner and the shipper. The court rejected the shipper’s argument that he did not have to make any warranty as to the nature of the goods shipped and that it was the duty of the master of the ship to ask for information about the cargo. The rationale for the holding appears in the judgment of Lord Campbell CJ at 482–483:
But here there is an allegation that the plaintiffs and their servants neither had knowledge nor means of knowledge of the dangerous nature of the goods, or of the defective packing, which increased the danger. If, under these circumstances, there were not a duty incumbent on the shipper to give notice of the dangerous nature of the goods to be shipped, commerce could not be carried on. It would be strange to suppose that the master or mate, having no reason to suspect that goods offered to him for a general ship may not safely be stowed away in the hold, must ask every shipper the contents of every package. If he is not to do so, and there is no duty on the part of the shipper of a dangerous package to give notice of its contents or quality, the consequence is that, without any remedy against the shipper, although no blame is imputable to the shipowners or those employed by them, this package may cause the destruction of the ship …
69        In the next case, 
Bamfield
, the defendants delivered to the plaintiff’s husband, who was the owner of a keel, for carriage thereon by him as a common carrier, a quantity of a chemical called ferro-silicon, packed in casks. This was a dangerous substance as in certain circumstances it gave off poisonous gases. The defendants described the goods as “general cargo” and did not tell the plaintiff’s husband it was ferro-silicon. The plaintiff’s husband died from the poisonous gases emitted and the defendants were held liable for his death. Two of the judges made this decision on the basis that where a consignor, who delivered goods to a common carrier for carriage by him, did not give notice to the carrier that the goods were dangerous, he must, unless the carrier knew or ought to know the dangerous character of the goods, be taken impliedly to warrant that the goods were fit for carriage in the ordinary way and not dangerous. The third judge held that a shipper shipping dangerous cargo had a duty to give the carrier such information as he had as to the nature of the article being shipped and because the defendants had not discharged this duty by describing the cargo simply as “general cargo”, they were liable. Here again, there was a shipment of goods pursuant to a contract that was directly between the shipper and the carrier. Neither 
Brass v Maitland
 nor 
Bamfield
 is an apt precedent for the present case.
70        The facts of the third case, 
Hodge & Sons
, were different. To paraphrase Scrutton LJ (at 186), what happened was that a serious explosion on a barge which had carried petrol caused the death of a number of workmen and injuries to others. Willmott, one of the latter, sued the owners of the barge. The position of the owners was that they had contracted with one Miller to do certain work on the barge. This involved lifting out the tank and Miller sub-contracted with Hodges to lift the tank out. Willmott was a worker employed by Hodges. The owners had no contract either with Hodges or Willmott. The judge at first instance found that the explosion had been caused by negligence on the part of Hodges’ foreman who applied an oxy-acetylene flare to the tank without taking steps to see whether it was clear of petrol vapour. It was common ground that the barge was a dangerous thing whether it contained petrol or whether the petrol had been discharged and the tank cleaned. The owners of the barge were, by a majority comprising Bankes and Scrutton LJJ, held not to be liable to Willmott for not informing him of the dangerous nature of the barge.
71        Bankes LJ held that the barge owners were under two duties, one was the duty of using reasonable means to secure the efficient cleaning out of the tank and the other was the duty of giving any necessary warning of the dangerous character of the tank even after a proper and sufficient cleaning. The first duty extended to all who came into contact with the tank in the course of carrying out the repairs and that included Willmott. As regards the second duty, the warning would not be required where the person who would otherwise be entitled to a warning was already aware of the danger or who might reasonably be assumed to be aware of it. On the facts, Miller required no warning and the barge owners were entitled to assume that Hodges needed no warning as to the danger. As regards the individual workmen employed by Hodges, Bankes LJ said (at 185):
I do not think that the present is a case in which the Anglo-American Oil Co were under any duty to Messrs Hodges’ workmen to give them any individual warning. Whether a warning to an employer of the dangerous character of an article sent to him for repair is a sufficient warning to the workmen directed by the employer to carry out those repairs must be a question of fact depending upon the particular circumstances of each case. There are in this case, in my opinion, no such special circumstances as placed the Anglo-American Oil Co under any duty to give any warning to the plaintiff Willmott or to the other employees of Messrs Hodges.
Applying those views to the facts of this case, the appellant would have a duty to tell Pink Energy of the dangerous nature of the goods (and that is not a duty that has ever been disputed by the appellant) but would not be under a similar duty to warn the employees or agents of Pink Energy unless special circumstances existed. On that basis, no duty to warn would exist between the appellant and Pink Energy’s sub-contractors.
72        Scrutton LJ, in agreeing that the appeal should be dismissed, said at 188:
The law, therefore, seems to be: (1) That if the barge which has carried petrol is an article dangerous in itself, it is the duty of the owners to take proper and reasonable precautions to prevent its doing damage to people likely to come into contact with it. These precautions may be fulfilled by entrusting it to a competent person with reasonable warning of its dangerous character, if that danger is not obvious. If such precautions are not taken, the owner will be liable to third persons with whom he has no contract for damage done by the barge, which they could not have avoided with reasonable care. (2) If the barge which has carried petrol is not dangerous in itself, but becomes dangerous because it has been insufficiently cleaned, and the owner is ignorant of the danger, the owner is not liable for damage caused by it to person whom he has no contract. … (3) In the case of a thing dangerous in itself, where either the danger was obvious or the owner has given proper warning to the person entrusted with it, not being his servant, the owner is not liable for negligence of such person causing injury to a third party; such negligence is 
nova causa interveniens.
Again, applying 
dictum 
 (1) above to the facts of this case, since the nitric acid was an article that was dangerous in itself though the danger was not obvious, the appellant had a duty to take proper and reasonable precautions to prevent its doing damage to third parties and such duty was fulfilled by telling Pink Energy it was nitric acid and then entrusting it to Pink Energy, who held itself out to be a competent person, to handle the same.
73        It appears to me that the cases cited by the respondent do not support its submission that in the circumstances of this case, there was a duty on the appellant to warn the respondent of the nature of the cargo. The same result is reached by an application of the threefold test set out in 
Caparo
 and analysing the facts to ascertain whether the three elements required to impose a duty of care existed. The first element is foreseeability. It might appear that the damage caused was eminently foreseeable. After all, nitric acid is extremely corrosive and it could be “foreseen” that if the 
Pristine
 was not equipped with stainless tanks, the nitric acid would corrode its hull. But as stated by 
Clerk & Lindsell on Torts
 (18th Ed, 2000) at para 7-134:
The nature of foreseeability
  The test is not one of the actual foresight of the defendant. Rather the question is what the court, reviewing the evidence with hindsight and trying to do justice, determines to be foreseeable. In this way the foresseability test has become something of a cloak for the exercise of policy and discretion. It enables courts to exercise a supervisory power of deciding whether or not it is reasonable to ascribe liability towards particular claimants.
Further, as held in 
Surtees v Kingston-upon-Thames Borough Council
 
[1991] 2 FLR 559
, foreseeability is subject to three limitations: (a) an injury of the kind which, in fact, must be one which was reasonably likely to occur; (b) the injury in fact sustained must be the kind which was foreseeable; and (c) in the context both of foreseeability and the extent of the duty and its breach, those questions must be considered in the light of all the existing circumstances. It is also pertinent that in the 
Bumi
 case ([66] 
supra
), this court opined (at [38]) that foreseeability of harm does not automatically lead to a duty of care.
74        The appellant could foresee that nitric acid could cause damage to the ship receiving it from the 
Sunrise Crane
. It was because such damage could be foreseen that the appellant wanted a licensed contractor to undertake the disposal job. It was because such damage could be foreseen that the appellant appointed the Club’s local representative to look for such a licensed contractor and it was because such damage could be foreseen that it considered only the two contractors brought to it by the marine surveyor selected by the Club and asked for an assurance that Pink Energy could handle the cargo before awarding the contract. Finally, it was because such damage could be foreseen that the nature of the cargo was made known to everybody involved in the discussions and the awarding of the contract, including the Club, the surveyor, Capt Gill and the contractor’s representative, Mr Windsor.
75        Once the contract had been awarded under such circumstances, could the appellant have foreseen that the tanker sent to collect the cargo would not have been told its nature? I do not think so. The details of the 
Pristine
 were given to the 
Sunrise Crane
 before the tanker arrived alongside and since these details came from Pink Energy, the appointed contractor, the appellant and those on board the 
Sunrise Crane
 would have assumed that the 
Pristine
 was suitably equipped to handle the cargo. In fact the evidence was that the officers of the 
Sunrise Crane
 did make such an assumption before the discharge started. Capt Gu, the master of the 
Sunrise Crane
, testified that in all his years of experience sailing on chemical tankers, when there were chemical slops to be loaded, the slop disposal contractor would have been informed of the type of slops in advance so that the proper barge was sent out to receive them. The appellant and its crew could not have foreseen that Pink Energy would have sent out a vessel that was built of mild steel and did not have stainless steel tanks. Whilst theoretically it was foreseeable that nitric acid could corrode the hull of the vessel it was discharged into, it was not foreseeable in all the circumstances that existed then that it would corrode the hull of the 
Pristine
. In the light of all the circumstances of this case, I do not think that the injury in fact sustained was foreseeable by a person in the position of the appellant.
76        The next element to be considered is proximity. The Australian High Court case of 
Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman
 (1985) 60 ALR 1, in addition to the observation of Gibbs CJ on the necessity to take all relevant factors into account in determining the existence of a duty of care, is also useful on what constitutes the element of proximity. Having pointed out (at 53–54) that “[r]easonable foreseeability of loss or injury to another is an indication and, in the more settled areas of the law of negligence involving ordinary physical injury or damage caused by the direct impact of [a] positive act, commonly an adequate indication that the requirement of proximity is satisfied”, Deane J went on to say that Lord Atkin’s notions of reasonable foreseeability and proximity in 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 562
 were distinct. He then explained what the notion of proximity entailed. He said at 55:
It involves the notion of nearness or closeness and embraces physical proximity (in the sense of space and time) between the person or property of the plaintiff and the person or property of the defendant, circumstantial proximity such as an overriding relationship of employer and employee or of a professional man and his client and what may (perhaps loosely) be referred to as causal proximity in the sense of the closeness or directness of the causal connection or relationship between the particular act or course of conduct and the loss or injury sustained. It may reflect an assumption by one party of a responsibility to take care to avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the person or property of another or reliance by one party upon such care being taken by the other in circumstances where the other party knew or ought to have known of that reliance. Both the identity and the relative importance of the factors which are determinative of an issue of proximity are likely to vary in different categories of case.
77        It would appear that in this case all these types of proximity did exist. There was certainly physical proximity between the appellant and the respondent in that the 
Pristine
 was moored alongside the 
Sunrise Crane
 in order to enable the ship-to-ship transfer of cargo to take place. Then, while there was no direct relationship between the appellant and the respondent, there was circumstantial proximity as the 
Pristine
 had been sent by the appellant’s contractor, Pink Energy, to fulfil its contract with the appellant. The 
Pristine
 was not there by chance. Finally, the act complained of was that the appellant did not tell the respondent what cargo was being discharged. The evidence was that if the respondent had known it was nitric acid, those on board the 
Pristine
 would not have taken on the cargo. In this sense therefore, the failure to warn led to the receipt of the cargo and the consequential loss of the vessel.
78        Considering that there was proximity in the sense used in 
Caparo
 but, in my view, no reasonable foreseeability, it is now necessary to consider whether it would be just, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances to impose on the appellant a duty to warn the respondent of the nature of the cargo prior to discharging it into the respondent’s vessel. The present case serves as an example of a situation commonly met with in day-to-day life, though fortunately the disastrous consequences that resulted here are not the norm. The situation I am talking about is the employment by party A of party B to do a certain piece of work which may involve danger or dangerous elements, for example, repairing an unsafe roof or cleaning a tank from which a noxious cargo had been discharged or transporting a dangerous item or animal. In each of those cases, the person in the position of party A usually looks for a qualified person to undertake the work concerned and selects party B as having the necessary qualifications. In employing party B, party A will inform party B of what exactly has to be done. Once the contract has been made, party A leaves the execution of it to party B and does not usually check that the workmen or equipment that party B sends along to handle the job are aware of the nature of the job or are suited for it. He assumes that party B will provide suitably informed personnel and suitable equipment for the job. I do not think that party A, as long as he has given proper and full disclosure to party B, is wrong to make such an assumption. I do not think it is fair or reasonable or just to impose on party A the duty to countercheck just before the job starts that the person sent to do it knows what it is or that the equipment is suitable. It would be unduly onerous to require party A to be present to warn party B’s employees or sub-contractors of the dangers involved in carrying out the work.
79        In 
Mohd Sapri
 ([64] 
supra
), the defendant, SE, was a specialist sub-contractor for the installation of a sprinkler system at a warehouse. SE engaged two independent sub-contractors to install the sprinkler system and the plaintiff worker was employed by one of these, one Ishak. He was injured when he fell off a staging that was being pushed along by his fellow workers. This court (reversing a decision I made at first instance) held that SE did not owe the plaintiff a duty to provide proper equipment for his use and to supervise his use of it. In delivering the judgment of the court, Yong Pung How CJ said at 515, [36]:
In the present case, it would require a further extension of the duty of care to say that SE should have provided proper equipment for the plaintiff’s use, and that it should have supervised his use of the equipment. Such equipment would have been made available upon request by Ishak. There was no dispute that Ishak had never asked for the equipment and could not be bothered to collect it. In effect, SE was being made liable for Ishak’s sloth. The trial judge’s decision implies that while an independent contractor who employs workers (ie Ishak) may be responsible for carrying out an employer’s non-delegable duties, such duties would also have to be undertaken concurrently as a matter of general law by the party appointing the independent contractor (ie SE). As counsel for SE put it, this would ‘open new floodgates to claim against a whole new class of third parties’ and there will be ‘ambiguity as to the boundary of this class of third parties as well as the extent of their rights (and) duties’.
To impose a duty of care on the appellant in this case would be to make the appellant, as the employer, responsible for carrying out the duty of the independent contractor, Pink Energy, to inform its sub-contractor of the nature of the cargo to be collected. I agree that the imposition of such a duty would open floodgates to claims against a whole new class of third parties and therefore consider no duty should be imposed.
80        The 
Bumi
 case ([66] 
supra
) also contained some observations which, though the facts of that case are very different from the present, are helpful in considering whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care here. Chao Hick Tin JA said at [34]:
It is true that the principle enunciated in 
Donoghue
 – namely, that when a person can or ought to appreciate that a careless act or omission on his part may result in physical injury to other persons or their property, he owes a duty to all such persons to exercise reasonable care to avoid such careless act or omission – has been extended to claims other than for such personal injuries or property damage … We also acknowledge that the 
Donoghue
 principle is not a statutory definition. Its application has not remained static. It is evolving. It offers an avenue of redress for losses suffered by a person on account of the acts or omission of another, where such losses would otherwise be without a remedy. While we would not say that for every subsequent case to fall within the scope of the decision in 
Ocean Front
 the facts must be identical or the same, extreme caution must be exercised in extending the 
Donoghue
 principle, or the decision in 
Ocean Front
, to new situations, 
particularly to a scenario which is essentially contractual
. [emphasis added]
As long ago as 1922, Scrutton LJ observed in 
Hodge & Sons
 that, in the absence of special circumstances, a person in the position of the appellant did not have a duty to warn the employee of his contractor as to the dangerous nature of the goods that the contractor had agreed to handle. That position has not changed in the intervening years. The “special circumstances” that Scrutton LJ was referring to must have been circumstances which would make it foreseeable that without such a warning loss would be caused. In this case (subject to the caveat that I will discuss below) there were no special circumstances to require the warning to be given. The loss was not foreseeable despite the proximity of the parties and it would not, in my view, be fair or reasonable or just to impose on the appellant a duty to warn the respondent as the sub-contractor or employee of Pink Energy of the nature of the goods since Pink Energy had been given all necessary information.
81        Whilst I have largely used the 
Caparo
 test in this discussion, I believe the same result would have been arrived at by applying the two-stage test derived from 
Ocean Front
. In relation to the first stage, the necessary “proximity” would not be established notwithstanding the matters stated in [77] above, as the important element of foreseeability is absent and this element forms part of the concept of “proximity” in the two-stage test. Secondly, even if the first stage were satisfied, the second would not be because, as I have shown in [78] and [79] above, there are policy reasons why a duty of care should not be imposed in the circumstances of this case and others like it. Whilst in the past I have tried to extend the duty of care, I accept, as I must, the limits laid down by this court in the 
Mohd Sapri
 and 
Bumi
 cases and those limits, in my respectful view, necessarily prevent the existence of any duty of care here.
82        My decision above was arrived at on the basis that all the relevant facts were those stated in [67] above. The trial judge, however, did not rely only on those facts in order to come to her decision. She also relied on the contents and existence of three documents, 
viz
:
(a)        The International Chamber of Shipping Tanker Safety Guide (Chemicals) (3rd Ed) (“Tanker Safety Guide”).
(b)        The International Chamber of Shipping Ship-to-Ship Transfer Guide (Petroleum) (3rd Ed).
(c)   The MSDS for nitric acid.
The judge noted that the MSDS is an information form or data sheet on a particular chemical which is prepared for the purpose of warning persons dealing with such product of any dangers that might be associated with its use including fire risk, accidental spillage and procedures for clean up. She considered it an appropriate mode of conveying information of the cargo and noted that the master of the 
Sunrise Crane
 had acknowledged that the MSDS was an important document and those who shipped the cargo as well as those who received it should have a copy of the MSDS. Plainly the judge was of the opinion that the 
Sunrise Crane
 should have given a copy of the relevant MSDS for nitric acid to the 
Pristine
. She further stated that the duty to inform the receiver of the dangerous goods was not foreign to chemical tankers because such disclosure was part of and inherent in the basic safety procedures and work practices of chemical tankers as shown by the provisions of the Tanker Safety Guide. The judge was impressed by the fact that the guide contains operational guidelines on ship-to-ship transfers and that the safety measures provide that the cargo operation should be planned and agreed between the two ships and that the two masters involved should agree at the earliest opportunity on every aspect of the transfer procedure.
83        I agree that if the evidence had shown that the practice in the chemical transportation industry was for any chemical tanker discharging cargo to, just prior to discharge, as a matter of course for reasons of safety, notify the recipient of the cargo of the nature of the cargo and then work with that recipient on every aspect of the transfer procedure for the purposes of ensuring safety, notwithstanding that the recipient had previously been notified (or could reasonably be assumed to have been notified of the nature of the cargo by the shipowner or his representative), that would constitute the special circumstance that would impose a duty of care on the appellant and its representatives, the crew of the 
Sunrise Crane
, to notify those on board the 
Pristine
 of the nature of the cargo before the discharging operation commenced. From a consideration of the record, however, it appears to me that no such practice in the chemical trade was proved to exist on the balance of probabilities.
84        In regard to the MSDS, Mr Kashiwagi had testified that ordinarily the 
Sunrise Crane
 would still receive nitric acid as cargo even if the shipper had not given the vessel the MSDS for it. On this part of the evidence, the judge expressed the view that it did not follow that if the roles were reversed the appellant could reasonably adopt the same attitude as the whole purpose of disclosing the nature of the cargo and its dangers was to enable the recipient to take reasonable care to avoid damage. The appellant submitted that the judge had misunderstood the relevance of the MSDS. This was an important document giving information as to the first aid and clean up procedures to be followed when there was any incident involving the subject chemical. Accordingly, the shipper of the chemical would provide the vessel with a copy of the relevant MSDS so that it could be kept on board and the crew would have it available as a guide when necessary.
85        Mr Kashiwagi’s point was, the appellant submitted, and I agree, simply that although shippers routinely handed over the appropriate MSDS for the cargo shipped, the supply of such MSDS was not a pre-requisite prior to the shipment of the cargo. It was put to Mr Kashiwagi that if the MSDS was an important document, it would be prudent for a shipowner to require that it be provided whenever a cargo of nitric acid was loaded. His reply was that if it was the first time the vessel was handling nitric acid, he might make it a condition that the document be received and the main reason for this condition would be that the ship would want to compare the MSDS for nitric acid which it had on board with that supplied by the shipper to see whether the latter contained any changes in the way that the cargo should be handled. Otherwise, the 
Sunrise Crane
 did not need a copy of the document prior to shipment because its crew was trained to handle and was knowledgeable about nitric acid and also because the crew already had their own copies of the MSDS for all chemicals handled.
86        Capt Gu agreed that the MSDS was an important document as it contained general safety information and specified the hazardous property of the cargo. He also agreed that both parties who were involved in a discharge and loading operation should have the MSDS but he asserted that the MSDS booklet would be kept on board every ship that carried chemicals so that they could know about the cargoes they carried. Capt Gu was emphatic that the vessel sent to collect the contaminated cargo should have known what type of slops it was receiving and that it was his view that the 
Pristine
 must have known the nature of the cargo. Despite this evidence, it was not put to him at any time that those on board the 
Sunrise Crane
 had a duty to provide the 
Pristine
 with the MSDS for nitric acid before commencing discharge of the cargo and that this duty existed notwithstanding that it could be reasonably assumed that the 
Pristine
 knew what it was collecting.
87        It was also in evidence that a contractor who was experienced in dealing with the disposal of chemical slops would not require or ask for a copy of the MSDS in order to dispose of the contaminated nitric acid as it would have its own copy of the MSDS. This was the evidence given by one Mr Awtar Singh, the representative of Chem-Solv Technologies Pte Ltd, the other disposal contractor who had put in a bid to dispose of this cargo. His company specialised in handling, transporting, treating and disposing of toxic waste. It was licensed to carry out such treatment and disposal of toxic waste. Mr Singh said that his company commonly handled nitric acid and would not require any MSDS before transporting such cargo as it has its own MSDS. He also confirmed that the purpose of the MSDS was to get information on how to handle the product and the safety precautions to take.
88        Accordingly, it was not established that the purpose of the MSDS was to notify the receiving party of the nature of the cargo and its dangers. Its purpose was to advise on handling, first aid and clean up procedures in relation to that cargo. The evidence did not establish that it was the practice in the trade for each person discharging or receiving nitric acid or other chemicals to hand over or receive, as the case may be, an MSDS in respect of that cargo. What was established was simply that persons in the chemical transportation industry had access to the MSDS for each chemical carried because in most cases persons in the trade kept their own copies of these documents and also, if an intended recipient asked for an MSDS in respect of the cargo that was going to be loaded onto his vessel, he would be given one by the shipper.
89        As regards the tanker safety guide and the ship-to-ship transfer guide, there was no evidence that these documents represented the prevailing practice of the chemical transportation industry or that of the petroleum industry. Neither document was mentioned in the pleadings or produced during discovery. Further, neither document was shown to any of the appellant’s witnesses. They were not asked by the respondent’s counsel to comment on the procedures recommended by each guide. Nor was it put to them that those procedures represented the prevailing practice followed by chemical tankers and shore tanks and other recipients of chemical cargo. The point relating to the guides was brought up for the first time by the respondent in its written closing submissions. With due respect to the trial judge, I do not think that she was entitled to rely on those guides as evidence of the practice in the industry. The only evidence of the practice in the industry was that given by the appellant’s witnesses including Mr Awtar Singh and no part of that evidence supported the respondent’s contention that the chemical transportation industry followed an established practice whereby the persons on board a vessel receiving chemical cargo were invariably notified of the nature of that cargo prior to commencement of loading and notwithstanding that loading was taking place in accordance with a pre-existing contract for the loading of cargo of that nature.
90        Thus, in relation to the issues raised on appeal, I have come to the conclusion that the law should not impose a duty of care on the appellant to warn the respondent of the nature of the cargo when the appellant had contracted with Pink Energy for the disposal of that cargo and had given Pink Energy itself all necessary information about it. The appellant had a duty of care to inform the party it employed to dispose of the cargo of the true nature of the cargo. The appellant did not have a duty to give such information to the employee, sub-contractor or other person sent by Pink Energy to carry out the contract as it could not foresee that the latter would suffer injury by its omission to impart the information. Whilst I sympathise with the respondent in respect of the catastrophic loss that it has suffered, in my judgment, the law does not permit it to make this loss the responsibility of the appellant. The party who should have told the respondent the true nature of the cargo to be loaded was Pink Energy. Pink Energy was in the position of the shippers in 
Brass v Maitland
 and 
Bamfield
 and thus had the duty to inform the 
Pristine
 of the dangerous nature of the cargo that the latter would receive from the 
Sunrise Crane
. I assume this action was brought against the appellant rather than Pink Energy because the appellant has greater financial resources than Pink Energy. That, however, is not a good reason to make the appellant liable.
91        In view of these conclusions, I need not deal with the issue of causation. However, as my learned brothers have found a duty of care to exist and I have also expressed the view that had it been proved to be the industry-wide practice to inform recipients of the nature of the cargo being discharged immediately prior to the commencement of discharging operations, then there would have been such a duty on the appellant in relation to the respondent, I turn to consider whether in such circumstances the defence of limitation would be available to the appellant.
Limitation of liability
92        Section 136 of the Merchant Shipping Act provides, 
inter alia
, that where a ship has, in the discharge of its cargo, caused damage to any property, the owner of the ship is entitled to limit his liability for such damage to an amount based on the tonnage of his ship and calculated in accordance with the formula provided in the section as long as such loss or damage was sustained “without his actual fault or privity”. This section is the Singapore law enactment of the provisions of the International Convention Relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Seagoing Ships 1957 (“the 1957 Convention”), a treaty which over 50 state parties have ratified.
93        The concept that a shipowner should be entitled to limit his liability when by reason of negligent management or navigation his ship collides with and damages another vessel or other property and/or causes loss of life or personal injury to passengers or crew or others was first codified in France in the 17th century. It was subsequently adopted by several other European countries. Limitation of a shipowner’s liability for damage caused by the negligent management or navigation of his ship is an exception to the general rule that a person who negligently causes damage is responsible for the full financial consequences of the same provided such consequences are not too remote. However, this rule has been embodied in two international conventions in modern times, the 1957 Convention mentioned above, and the more recent treaty, the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976 (“the 1976 Convention”), and is apparently here to stay. 
Chorley & Giles’ Shipping Law
 (8th Ed, 1987) states at pp 394–395 the justification for the rule:
The convenience of the rule is responsible for its survival. The modern justification is not that it would be unfair to make a shipowner pay for all the damage he has caused: it is that a shipowner can obtain adequate insurance cover for third party claims if his insurers can calculate their maximum exposure with certainty. Victims generally benefit if the limits are set high enough and they can be sure that an insurer will pay their claim.
94        In order for a shipowner to rely on the limitation of liability provided by s 136, he has the onus of proving that the loss or damage caused by the negligent navigation or management of his ship took place without his “actual fault or privity”. The test of what amounts to “actual fault or privity” was set out by Lord Denning MR in 
The Eurysthenes
 [1976] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 171 at 178–179 as follows:
This was followed by a succession of Merchant Shipping Acts, all of them directed to limiting the responsibilities of the shipowner for the acts or defaults of his servants. He was not to be liable for acts done “without his fault or privity” beyond the value of the vessel. The object of these Acts was to limit his liability for his servants on the basis of respondeat superior, but to leave him fully liable for faults done by himself personally or with his privity …
This historical survey shows to my mind that, when the old common lawyers spoke of a man being “privy” to something being done, or of an act being done “with his privity”, they meant that he knew of it beforehand and concurred in it being done. If it was a wrongful act done by his servant, then he was liable for it if it was done “by his command or privity”, that is, with his express authority or with his knowledge and concurrence. “Privity” did not mean that there was any wilful misconduct by him, but only that he knew of the act beforehand and concurred in it being done. Moreover, “privity” did not mean that he himself personally did the act, but only that someone else did it and that he knowingly concurred in it. … Without his “actual fault” meant without any actual fault by the owner personally. Without his “privity” meant without his knowledge or concurrence.
…
[W]hen I speak of knowledge, I mean not only positive knowledge but also the sort of knowledge expressed in the phrase “turning a blind eye”.
95        Although it would appear from the above explanation of the meaning of “actual fault or privity” that it would not be very difficult for a shipowner to show that any particular negligent act in the management or navigation of his vessel occurred without his fault or privity, the courts do not favour limitation and, as the cases developed over the years, the opposite proved to be the case. A survey of the cases on the issue cited by the appellant itself shows that the threshold to cross before a defendant can avail himself of the limitation defence is very high. In 
The Norman
 [1960] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1, the shipowners failed to pass on to the master of the vessel information in circulars about navigation hazards in an area in which the 
Norman
 was likely to be navigated. The vessel struck an uncharted rock in fog at night and sank. The defence of limitation was denied. Lord Radcliffe, in coming to the conclusion that the owners had a duty to communicate the latest information that would assist navigation, found two questions to be pertinent:
(a)        What, if any, action should have been taken on receipt of the circulars by a prudent and conscientious owner who had a trawler around the area identified with navigational hazards; and
(b)        If action should have been taken, had the owners established with sufficient probability that even though it was not, the omission had no bearing upon the casualty that occurred so that it was not contributed to by their fault?
96        In 
The England
 [1973] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 373, the owners failed to ensure that copies of the Port of London River By-laws were placed on the ship. These by-laws required a vessel making a turning manoeuvre along the Thames River to give a whistle signal. The defendants’ vessel did not give such a signal and this resulted in it colliding with the plaintiffs’ vessel. The defendants asserted that they were entitled to limit liability on the basis that they had engaged a master who had sufficient knowledge to navigate the River Thames. The defence was rejected by the Court of Appeal. It was held that in the circumstances, the owner ought to have foreseen that, without specific instruction, the master, however competent, might fail to have the by-laws available or fail to study them and that therefore the owners were under a duty at least to give specific instructions to the master that in trading to the Port of London, he must have available a copy of the by-laws. Since they had failed to disprove that the absence of by-laws on board was a contributory cause of the casualty, they were not entitled to limit. Sir Gordon Willmer stated at 383:
[T]he decision of the House of Lords in the case of 
The Norman
 [1960] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1, seems to me to have thrown quite a fresh light on the extent of the managerial duties of owners and managers, especially in relation to the supply of navigational information and publications to their vessels. It seems to me that it is no longer permissible for owners or managers to wash their hands so completely of all questions of navigation, or to leave everything to the unassisted discretion of their masters.
This relatively new approach, as I think it is, was well illustrated by the decision of this Court in 
The Lady Gwendolen,
 
[1965] P 294
; … I venture to quote two sentences from the judgment which I myself delivered in that case, because they seem to me to be equally apt to the circumstances of this case. On pp 345 and 346 of the respective reports I am reported as saying:
… It seems to me that any company which embarks on the business of shipowning must accept the obligation to ensure efficient management of its ships if it is to enjoy the very considerable benefits conferred by the statutory right to limitation.
97        In 
Grand Champion Tankers Ltd v Norpipe A/S
 (
The Marion
) 
[1984] 1 AC 563
, the ship managers had left the matter of updating the charts entirely to the master. There was no system in place for the owners to supervise and ensure that the master updated the charts. Further, the managers’ alter ego was absent from the company for long periods of time and had failed to give instructions with regard to matters about which he required to be kept informed of. Consequently a document which was issued by the vessel’s port of registry warning of the 
Marion’s
 navigational charts not having been corrected for several years was not brought to his notice. The law lords agreed with the Court of Appeal who found that the managers had failed to operate a proper system of keeping the charts up-to-date, and the owners therefore could not prove that the loss was without their actual fault. The only judgment in the House of Lords was delivered by Lord Brandon of Oakbrook. Referring to 
The England
 and describing Sir Gordon Willmer as “the acknowledged master of Admiralty law in his time”, Lord Brandon (at 572–573) cited the passage set out above at [95] and endorsed what Sir Gordon Willmer described as “this relatively new approach” as being the correct approach in law to the problem of actual fault of shipowners or ship managers in contested limitation actions. I note here that Lord Brandon himself was an expert in admiralty matters and was the admiralty judge before he was elevated to the Court of Appeal.
98        It would appear therefore that in order to establish that its own fault did not contribute to the loss here, the appellant had to show that it had an efficient system of management of the vessel that ensured that, at the least, the standard industry practices for dealing with the dangerous chemical cargoes that the vessel carried were implemented and followed by the officers and crew of the ship. Such practices would have included the safety and other procedures to be followed when loading and discharging such cargo, whether from or to a shore terminal or from or to another vessel.
99        The appellant did not give any evidence as to the management system which it had adopted so as to ensure that the vessel implemented and followed the industry standards of practice in relation to the handling of chemical cargo. It relied on the fact that it had appointed a competent master and officers to serve on the 
Sunrise Crane
 and that these persons were specially qualified and trained to handle chemicals. Mr Kashiwagi testified that the master and chief officer were experienced chemical tanker officers who had received special training in chemical and hazardous cargo pursuant to the requirements of the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping 1995 (“STCW 95”), an international convention prepared by the International Maritime Organisation. The STCW 95 requires that all deck officers on board oil and chemical tankers undergo various courses so that they know how to handle chemical and hazardous cargo while sailing on board such ships.
100      The officers were qualified to handle dangerous cargo like nitric acid. This fact did not, however, in my view, absolve the appellant from its own duty to ensure that there was a proper system on board the vessel for dealing with such cargo, in particular in relation to the transfer of the cargo between vessels or between the vessel and a shore installation. No evidence was given of the existence of this system. If indeed there had been an industry-wide practice for chemical carriers to notify recipients of their cargo of the nature of the cargo prior to discharge, I would expect that any system on board the vessel would set out the procedures whereby such notification could be given. It would specify whether the notification could be oral or needed to be in writing and, if the latter, whether an MSDS or some other document had to be handed over to the recipient. In these circumstances, had I found that the duty to warn existed, I would also have found that the appellant had not discharged the burden upon it to show that the crew’s failure to comply with that duty arose without its actual fault or privity.
101      It is clear from the cases I have cited that, over the years, the courts have whittled down the protection available to a shipowner from the 1957 Convention and s 136 of the Merchant Shipping Act. There is hardly a reported case after 
The Norman
 where an owner has managed to show that his systems of management of the vessel were such that they in no way contributed to any negligence on the part of the crew of the vessel. Thus, the purpose of s 136 has to a great extent been negatived and the protection it offers to shipowners is, largely, illusory. That development was a major reason why many countries, including the United Kingdom, moved away from the 1957 Convention and adopted the 1976 Convention instead. Under the 1976 Convention, the monetary limits are much higher but the benefit to the shipowner is that, in almost every case, he will be able to limit because the right to limit is only lost if it is proved that the loss sued for “resulted from his personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such loss, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss would probably result”. That phraseology makes it very difficult for a claimant to break limitation. Bearing in mind that the object of the limitation statute is to assist shipowners in getting sufficient insurance to cover possible losses and therefore assist claimants in being paid at least a portion of their losses, it appears to me that the present state of the law of limitation in Singapore is not achieving that objective. It is time for us to consider ratifying the 1976 Convention and amending s 136 of the Merchant Shipping Act accordingly.
Conclusion
102      For the reasons given above, I must respectfully dissent from my brethren on their finding with respect to breach of duty. I concur that if there was a breach of duty, no entitlement to limit liability has been proved.",2004-09-13 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Yong Pung How CJ:
1
         
 This was a petition for the revision of a magistrate’s decision in withholding his consent to the composition of an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed).
The facts
2
         
 The petitioner, Timothy Chua Tian Bok, was charged under s 323 of the Penal Code with voluntarily causing hurt to one Toh Tong Lee (“the victim”) by punching him in the face. This incident occurred after a road accident where the petitioner had come out of his car and assaulted the victim. The petitioner was a passenger in the car. As a consequence of the alleged assault, the victim suffered three sets of injuries – a bruise on the right cheek, a superficial scratch below the bruise near the right side of the mouth and multiple elongated bruises on the left and right aspects of the front neck.
3
         
 An offence under s 323 of the Penal Code is compoundable under s 199 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”).
4
         
 Section 199(1) of the CPC states:
The offences punishable under the Penal Code shown in the sixth column of Schedule A as being compoundable may be compounded by the person mentioned in that column provided that when an arrest has been effected or an application has been made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons the consent of a Magistrate or, if the offence is not triable by a Magistrate’s Court, of a District Judge, shall first be obtained.
5
         
 The victim agreed to accept an 
ex gratia
 payment of $7,500 from the petitioner and confirmed his decision through independent counsel. The petitioner thereby applied for composition pursuant to s 199 of the CPC.
6
         
 Magistrate Gilbert Low exercised his discretion to withhold consent to the composition because he felt that to do otherwise would be tantamount to diluting the court’s strict policy against road rage incidents and allowing a person in the petitioner’s position to buy himself out of his predicament. The magistrate observed that this strict policy had been extended to passengers of motor vehicles who resorted to violence against other road users, as well as first-time offenders. He also noted that, as a result of the alleged assault, the victim sustained multiple injuries.
Whether the magistrate exercised his discretion correctly
7
         
 The main issue I had to decide was whether the magistrate erred in withholding his consent to the composition. It is undisputed that an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code is compoundable under s 199 of the CPC. As to the discretion of a judge to grant or withhold consent to composition, I have expressed my view in 
PP v Norzian bin Bintat
 
[1995] 3 SLR 462
 at 474, [52]:
[T]hat discretion is a judicial discretion and therefore one which must be exercised not only in accordance with the rules of reason and justice but also in accordance with the provisions of the law.
8
         
 Further, in two of my recent decisions in 
Kee Leong Bee v PP
 
[1999] 3 SLR 190
 at [21] and 
Ho Yean Theng Jill v PP
 
[2004] 1 SLR 254
 at [40], I have said that:
Where an order involves a discretion of the court, the appellate court will not interfere with the exercise of the discretion unless it was exercised on demonstrably wrong principles or without any grounds, or if the judge had ignored some relevant provision of law ...
9
         
 There are several general guidelines laid down in both foreign and local case law that may assist the court in the exercise of its discretion. I discussed these principles at length in 
Norzian bin Bintat
 
(at 474–475, [54] and [56])
:
[I]n a case where the public interest is involved, it is proper to withhold consent to composition. …
[I]n the absence of aggravating factors, the courts should lean towards the granting of consent in cases where the public interest does not figure strongly.
10
       
 Also, in exercising this discretion, the court should take into account factors including the interests of the parties, relationship between the parties, possibility of the parties living in peace and harmony if composition is allowed, the stage at which composition is sought, circumstances under which the offence is alleged to have been committed and the nature of the alleged offence.
11
       
 After considering the written and oral submissions of the petitioner and the Prosecution, I was of the view that the magistrate exercised his discretion correctly in withholding his consent to composition. I now give my reasons.
12
       
 I found that the magistrate did not err when he withheld his consent to compound the offence because he was conscious of the strong public interest against allowing composition in road rage incidents. Our courts have consistently emphasised the seriousness of such incidents of assault on motorists on the roads and have always adopted a strict policy against such incidents, often imposing a custodial sentence where the offence is voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code and caning where the offence is the more serious one of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code (
Ong Hwee Leong v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 794
; 
PP v Lee Seck Hing
 
[1992] 2 SLR 745
)
. I made it clear in 
Ong Hwee Leong v PP
 and 
PP v 
Lee Seck Hing
 that there can be no place on our roads for road bullies. In 
Ong Hwee Leong v PP
, I observed at 795–796, [7] that:
Such minor incidents occur on our roads many times every day. No doubt they are frustrating to those involved. But if, many times every day on our public roads, everyone were to lose his temper and react to the degree the appellant did, all semblance of order would quickly dissipate and only the most violent would prevail. The perceptible trend in this direction deservedly incurs the courts’ displeasure and must be determinedly discouraged.
13
       
 In the later case of 
PP v 
Lee Seck Hing
, I further commented at 748, [11] and [12] that:
Violent crimes are one of the curses of our society against which it is the primary duty of the courts to protect the public. This is especially so on a small island like Singapore, where citizens live in close proximity to each other: our daily lives are unavoidably intertwined to some extent, making the preservation of order and harmony all the more important.
… The court must also be mindful of the need to deter anyone else who would resort with impunity to violence on the roads, especially in view of the deplorable increase in such incidents. Our roads are progressively becoming more crowded each month, as more and more cars add to the traffic, and motorists must simply learn to live with one another. There can be no place on our roads for road bullies. Such persons must be made aware of the severe detestation the law expresses in regard to such crimes. They must not be allowed to go away thinking that they can beat up somebody else on the slightest provocation for the price of a few thousand dollars.
14
       
 Counsel for the petitioner argued in his written submissions that such a strict policy against road rage incidents only manifested in sentencing and did not translate into a veto against composition. This view was clearly misguided. At trial, counsel for the petitioner did not persist with this argument and I will only deal with it briefly.
15
       
 I found it only logical that in an offence where our courts have expressed a strict policy in sentencing, involving imprisonment as the appropriate punishment, the public interest would also extend to withholding consent to composition. I have previously held that consent should be withheld in outrage of modesty cases involving an abuse of a position of trust over a protracted period (
PP v Mohamed Nasir bin Mohamed Sali
 
[1999] 4 SLR 83
) as well as in maid abuse cases 
(
Kee Leong Bee v PP
; 
Ho Yean Theng Jill v PP
). The rationale for withholding consent to composition in maid abuse cases is to protect domestic maids who are more vulnerable to abuse by employers and their immediate family members than any other categories of employees. Similarly, we have to protect motorists on our roads. The strict policy adopted by the courts in road rage incidents is to deter anyone who would resort with impunity to violence on the roads, especially in view of the recent deplorable increase in such incidents. To allow composition of such offences, notwithstanding the strong public interest element involved, would be to run contrary to a steady bo
dy of case law from this court. This is a question of public policy which we have always enforced. Thus, I found that the magistrate was correct in deciding that there is an inherent public policy against allowing consent to composition in road rage incidents.
16
       
 I also agreed with the magistrate’s observation that the strict policy against road rage incidents extends to passengers of motor vehicles who resort to violence against other road users, as well as first-time offenders. Counsel for the petitioner argued in his written submissions that this was not the usual situation of what is colloquially known as “road rage” since the petitioner was not the driver of the car. This was a superfluous distinction. This offence arose from a dispute between the petitioner and the victim after a road accident and was clearly a road rage incident. Moreover, the public policy against road rage incidents where the driver is normally the aggressor applies with equal force in cases where a passenger is the aggressor. Regardless of whether the aggressor is the driver or a passenger, the public interest to be protected is the same – the prevention of sporadic outbreaks of violence on our roads so as to protect our motorists and road users. Thus, the strict policy against road rage incidents includes cases where the aggressor is a passenger.
17
       
 Counsel for the petitioner conceded this point at trial. He, however, tried to distinguish the present case from typical road rage cases where parties flash their headlights and try to cut into each other’s lanes. He argued that in this case, there was a near fatal accident, which had caused trauma and shock to the petitioner, who therefore reacted in a most unexpected way. The crux of the submission was that, since each case should be decided on its own facts, the petitioner should be given a chance to compound the offence, notwithstanding the public interest element involved in such road rage incidents.
18
       
 While I agreed that each case should be decided on its own facts, I could not agree that this case should be treated differently from other road rage cases and that the public interest element be overlooked. The petitioner was not entitled to go around attacking others and reacting in such a violent manner merely because he claimed that he was traumatised after a near fatal accident. Besides, as the Prosecution highlighted to this court, it could be pure speculation that the accident was near fatal as there was no report of any injuries sustained by the petitioner or his wife. In fact, the only injuries were those suffered by the victim. I found that any shock and trauma experienced by the petitioner after the accident should not extend to the infliction of multiple injuries on the victim. The fact that an accident occurred was no excuse.
19
       
 Counsel for the petitioner had a further argument, that this court should not disregard the victim’s informed decision to exercise a statutory right to compound an offence. In response, the Prosecution relied on the cases of 
Kee Leong Bee v PP
 and 
Wong Sin Yee v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 197
 to submit that, in cases where the public interest demands that composition be disallowed, this can override even the consent of the victim to compound an offence. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions. The mere fact that the victim agreed to composition after seeking independent legal advice was insufficient to warrant the court’s consent to composition as the court is not to act as a mere rubber stamp in exercising its discretion (
PP v 
Norzian bin Bintat
). Instead, where the public interest figures strongly, as in the present case, it would be proper for this court to withhold its consent.
20
       
 The petitioner, being the chairman of a new taxi company, was a man in a responsible position. He should have set an example for other road users instead of attempting to buy the victim out for a princely sum. To allow the petitioner to compound the offence would send a wrong signal to the public that it is acceptable to assault people with no regard for the consequences, so long as they have the means to pay off their victims.
Conclusion
21
       
 The vital element in deciding whether to grant or withhold consent to composition is to determine whether there is a public interest that figures strongly. In this case, it was clearly a road rage incident where the public interest in protecting road users figured compellingly. Thus, notwithstanding the peripheral issues raised by the petitioner, there was an inherent public interest in withholding consent to composition.
22
       
 I dismissed the petition for revision and remitted the case to the lower court for trial.",2004-09-16 00:00:00,SG High Court

MPH Rubin J:
Background
1          The accused, Sundarti Supriyanto, is a 23-year-old female Indonesian working as a domestic maid in Singapore. She was tried before me on a charge of murder by causing the death of her female employer (“the deceased”), on 28 May 2002 between 8.00pm and 10.41pm at Block 165 Bukit Merah Central #06-3661/3663. At the end of the trial, I reserved my judgment. I have now come to the decision to convict the accused on a reduced charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. I give my reasons.
Facts
2          On 28 May 2002, at about 10.41pm, a fire was reported at Block 165 Bukit Merah Central. Officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) and the police were immediately despatched to the scene.
Discovery of the bodies
3          SCDF Second Warrant Officer Jumahat bin Bakri (“WO2 Jumahat”), the officer-in-charge of Pump Ladder 012, arrived at the scene with his section at 10.49pm. He rushed up to the location of the fire with SCDF Lance Corporal Arif bin Amat (“LCP Arif”). WO2 Jumahat entered the unit to search for casualties. There, he observed that #06-3663 was connected internally to unit #06-3661. At the rear of unit #06-3661, WO2 Jumahat discovered the body of the deceased, lying motionless in a supine position on the floor in a corridor. With the assistance of LCP Arif, WO2 Jumahat carried the body of the deceased out to the common corridor. Two SCDF ambulance officers attended to the deceased, but failed to revive her; she was pronounced dead at 11.30pm.
4          At 11.33pm, SCDF first warrant officer Abdul Razak Senin (“WO1 Razak”), the officer-in-charge of Pump Ladder 011, arrived at the scene with his section. WO2 Jumahat briefed WO1 Razak on the situation, following which WO1 Razak entered the fire-affected units to assist in the search for other casualties. While searching the corridor towards the rear of unit #06-3661, he discovered a closed door leading to the toilet and kitchen. When he opened the door, he found the body of a girl, the deceased’s three-year-old daughter (“Crystal”), also lying motionless on the floor in a supine position. He immediately carried Crystal out of the unit, where a SCDF ambulance officer attended to her. Crystal was then conveyed to the Accident & Emergency Department of Alexandra Hospital. The medical staff at the hospital could not revive her, and she was pronounced dead on 29 May 2002 at about 12.20am.
Behaviour of the accused at the scene
5          Before the arrival of the officers, several members of public spotted the accused sitting along the common corridor outside units #06-3661/3663, with an infant boy (“the baby”) on her lap. The baby was later identified as the deceased’s 18-month-old son. According to eyewitnesses, both the accused and the baby appeared calm. The accused had also reportedly pointed to the direction of the said units uttering “Mum and daughter inside” and/or “Mama, 
Anak
 [child]”. One member of public then accompanied the accused and the baby down the block via the staircase.
6          At about 10.53pm Police Sergeant Suhaimi bin Md Kasim (“Sgt Suhaimi”) arrived at Block 165 Bukit Merah Central. He met the accused at the ground floor and proceeded to interview her. The accused identified herself to Sgt Suhaimi as “Sundarti”. Sgt Suhaimi observed that the accused appeared calm, but seemed to be in pain. Subsequently, the accused was conveyed to the A&E Department of Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”), where she was admitted for treatment on 29 May 2002 at about 12.23am.
The fire
7          A SCDF Fire Investigation Team conducted investigations into the cause of the fire, and drew up a report
[1]
 
of its findings. According to this report, the fire was most probably caused intentionally, through the introduction of a naked light to combustible materials around an office area within the units, with petrol being introduced to accelerate the fire. Annex G of the report showed that petrol was detected from the fire debris collected from the three points at the scene (points A1, C and D).
Injuries on the deceased’s body and the cause of her death
8          Senior Forensic Pathologist, Dr Gilbert Lau (“Dr Lau”), performed the autopsy on the deceased. In his autopsy report,
[2]
 
Dr Lau recorded that he found two stab wounds on the deceased’s neck. The first stab wound measured between 1.2cm and 1.4cm in length and the track proceeded downwards, towards the right and slightly backwards, ending at a depth of about 2cm. The second stab wound measured between 2cm and 2.2cm in length and the track proceeded downwards, towards the right and backwards. Dr Lau found that the second stab wound was the fatal injury, as it incised the right carotid sheath, the middle third of the right common carotid artery and terminated at an estimated depth of 6cm. This wound resulted in extensive, severe and acute haemorrhage.
9          Apart from the neck wounds, there was also a series of deep and gaping incised wounds across the deceased’s left forearm, as well as the wrist and hand. The deceased’s muscles, tendons, nerves and blood vessels were cut. There was a fracture of the left wrist joint and near dismemberment of the left hand at the wrist. There were also several incised wounds on the deceased’s right arm and right hand. Dr Lau found that the multiple incised wounds on the deceased’s arms were consistent with defensive injuries. Dr Lau also found that most of the defensive injuries on the deceased’s upper limbs were inflicted using a cutting instrument with a relatively heavy and sharp blade such as Exhibit P298 (a chopper) or a similar knife. In particular, Dr Lau testified that the injuries to the deceased’s forearms were caused by deliberate, downward blows directed at her head or neck with tremendous force.
10        Dr Lau testified that the deceased was already dead when the fire started, and he certified the cause of her death as acute haemorrhage due to the incised right common carotid artery caused by the second stab wound to the neck. Dr Lau opined that the track of this stab wound indicated that it was very unlikely that the fatal injury was self-inflicted. He also stated that a smaller knife (such as Exhibit P292) or a similar knife was likely to have been used to inflict the fatal injury.
Injuries on the accused
11        Dr Ong Lin Yin (“Dr Ong”) was the first doctor to examine the accused when the latter was admitted to the A&E Department at SGH. According to Dr Ong’s report,
[3]
 
the accused suffered four per cent burns over her right leg and right forearm and there were bite marks on her left back, left shoulder and left breast. No other injuries were observed on her. Dr Ong confirmed that the accused’s vital signs were stable and she was not in a state of shock. Dr Ong also testified that the accused was not very communicative.
12        Dr Goh Bee Tin (“Dr Goh”), a Senior Registrar of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, National Dental Centre, attended to the accused on 29 May 2002 at about 1.15pm at Ward 43, SGH. She noted three bite marks on the accused’s body. The marks were at the lateral aspect of the accused’s left breast (“S1”), on her left shoulder (“S2”) and on the mid-portion of her back (“S3”). Dr Goh examined the dentition of the deceased, Crystal and the baby. She took dental impressions from them and compared them with S2 and S3. S1 was too indistinct to be identified.
13        Dr Goh concluded that there was a good match between Crystal’s dentition and S2 and S3. The deceased’s and the baby’s dentitions did not match the said bite marks. From the orientation of the bite marks, S2 was inflicted with the biter facing the accused with his/her face over the shoulder of the latter. S3 was inflicted on the left of the accused, with the biter’s face over the back of the accused. Dr Goh also noted that since the bite marks were at the phase of acute inflammation at the time when they were first examined on 29 May 2002 at 1.15pm, it was likely that they were inflicted within the last 72 hours. Although she could not rule out that the deceased might have inflicted S1, she testified that the dimensions of S1 were 30mm by 30mm, and these were quite small for an adult, whose dimensions generally ranged from 34mm to 37mm. Further, the dimensions of S1, S2 and S3 were fairly close to each other.
14        Dr Jasmine Heng (“Dr Heng”) testified that the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (“DNA”) evidence showed that the accused’s clothes comprising one pair of shorts, one T-shirt, one pair of panties and one brassiere were stained with blood that matched the DNA profile of the deceased. Additionally her T-shirt and shorts were also stained with the accused’s own blood. However, Dr Heng also gave evidence that DNA testing on the knives and chopper found at the scene was inconclusive.
Testimony of some prosecution witnesses
15        Hong Ngah San Esther (“Esther Hong”), the deceased’s staff member, testified that before lunchtime on 28 May 2002, the deceased called her through the intercom and told her to make sure that the accused did not leave the office. The deceased also told her that on a previous night, the accused had brought Crystal out of the bedroom without any reason. Further, Esther Hong, together with Low Siew Kuan Margaret (“Margaret Low”) and Ee Kim Lian Nancy (“Nancy Ee”), two other employees of the deceased, testified that at lunchtime, when they were having food at the reception area in the office, the deceased came to them and complained that the accused had eaten her son’s food. They added that the deceased had also scolded the accused in front of them.
16        Esther Hong and Margaret Low also testified that they met the deceased, the accused, the baby and Crystal at a handphone shop at Block 166 Bukit Merah Central. While she was there, Margaret Low offered some fruits (longan) to the baby. The deceased stopped her and said that her son was having a cough. Margaret Low then offered the fruit to the accused. However, the deceased stopped Margaret Low from doing so.
17        Ang Kim Wah Rose (“Rose Ang”), the cleaning lady, testified that the accused told her that she was hungry and had not eaten for a few days. Rose Ang gave the accused three biscuits and the accused consumed them. Rose Ang also mentioned that the deceased had a total of eight maids coming and going from her employ over a period of one year or so. Joseph Anthony Nathan Lefort (“Joseph Lefort”) testified that on 28 May 2002 at about 8.46pm, while he was in the toilet of Block 165 Bukit Merah Central #07-3661, he heard a lady calling out the words “jangan, jangan”. He stated that the voice sounded like a desperate plea for help, and that it was very distressful. Immediately after that, he heard a young child scream.
The accused’s statements to various people
18        When the accused was admitted to the A&E Department of SGH, she was attended to by nurses Bebe Zaiton bte Abdullah (“Nurse Bebe”) and Wong Martin alias Van Ah Kiong (“Nurse Martin”). She was asked about what had happened, whereupon she informed Nurse Martin that there was a fire, the lights went out and there was smoke.
19        Nurse Aidah Mohd Kassim (“Nurse Aidah”) attended to the accused at Ward 43, SGH on 29 May 2002 at about 12.40pm. Nurse Aidah asked the accused in Malay about what had happened. The accused informed Nurse Aidah that she was with her female employer and two children in the office at Bukit Merah at about 9.00pm. She claimed that 11 people came into the office wearing masks that covered their faces. The room then became dark and suddenly, a fire broke out. She also told Nurse Aidah that a woman caused the bites that were found on her body. The accused’s narration of events was recorded by one Chua Wee Lian.
[4]
20        Assistant Superintendent of Police Michael Sim (“ASP Sim”) interviewed the accused in Malay in Ward 43, SGH on 29 May 2002 at about 2.00am. The accused gave him her name as Sundarti and told him that three female persons came into the Bukit Merah units, following which the lights went out and a fire started. She also claimed that another nine male persons entered the units as well. According to ASP Sim, the accused kept on repeating the words “three female persons came, the lights went out and fire started”.
21        Nurse Noor Ashikin bte Abdul Kahar (“Nurse Ashikin”) interviewed the accused in Ward 43, SGH on 29 May 2002 at about 7.30am. Nurse Ashikin spoke to the accused in a mixture of Bahasa Indonesia and Malay. The accused informed Nurse Ashikin that she was at the shop (the Bukit Merah units) when three women came in and switched off all the lights. The three women were wearing stockings as masks and one of them shouted “quiet” in English. When Nurse Ashikin asked the accused how she sustained the bite marks on her body, the accused replied that a woman had bitten her. Nurse Ashikin then asked the accused whether she fought back, to which the accused replied that she did.
22        Anita Foo interviewed the accused twice in Ward 43, SGH on 30 May and 6 June 2002. Anita Foo spoke to the accused in English and obtained some background information on the accused’s family. The accused told her that the assailants had carried and bitten her. They then placed her in a dark and smoky room. The accused claimed that she had dark and vague memories of the event, but was unable to recall the whole incident. The accused also informed Anita Foo that she had no problems and enjoyed her work with her current employer. The accused also allegedly informed her that she was hoping to go back to work after her discharge.
23        Apart from the statements given by the accused soon after the fire and at the hospital, there were 11 other statements made by her on or after 10 June 2002 to two police officers, namely, Assistant Superintendent of Police Ang Bee Chin (“ASP Ang”) and Inspector of Police Bahar Bakar (“Insp Bahar”). Two of these were verbal statements and the rest were written. The accused was formally arrested at 3.00pm on 10 June 2002. The Prosecution sought to admit seven of the accused’s statements during the conduct of the Prosecution’s case, and the Defence sought to admit four when the defence was given. Being satisfied that all the statements sought to be admitted in evidence were given by the accused voluntarily without any threat, inducement, promise or any form of oppression or coercion, the said statements were admitted in evidence. The statements contained both incriminating and exculpatory parts.
24        In brief, the accused claimed that on the night of 28 May 2002, she and the deceased had been involved in a fight, during which both women brandished knives. The accused then claimed that she did not cause the fatal injury to the deceased, as the deceased had inflicted the fatal injury on herself. Additionally, the accused insisted that the injuries on the deceased’s limbs were self-inflicted. Several portions of the accused’s cautioned statement
[5]
 
were significant. These portions are reproduced below:
Mom [the deceased] ill-treated me. At home, I was made to eat the 2 children’s faeces on 3 occasions. Whatever mom held she would throw at me. When I was holding a knife, mom would take it and throw it at me. When I was preparing milk, mom would take the milk and throw it at me. There was a vegetable container in the fridge at home. Sometimes, mom forgot to close the container but she would throw the container at me and told me to close it properly. Sometimes, mom also punished me by telling me to kneel down for 2 hours as punishment and at the same time, I had to pull my ears. These were when mom scolded me for cooking too much porridge for the baby or for [
sic
] the porridge was no tasty enough. If I did not pull my ears, mom would cut $10/= from my pay. If I did not clean up the faeces of the children in the office and mom thinks that I did not clean it thoroughly, mom would throw the wet tissue used to clean up the faeces at my face. In the office, the children urinated on the carpets with the words ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and so on. Sir would scold mom because there was urine smell in the office, which was air-conditioned. Mom would scold me for not cleaning up the carpets. I had already cleaned them but there was smell because mom did not allow me to use soap. There was no soap in the office. When the porridge fell on the baby’s clothes, I would take tissue to take out the porridge from the clothes but mom would scold me for wasting the tissue, asking me if the tissue belonged to me or my mother, that as if it was my own place. When mom’s daughter cried, Sir would scold mom and mom would beat the daughter and she would scold [me] for not knowing how to take care of the children. I could not bear to see mom use cane on her daughter. This is enough. I am pleading guilty to the offence. I am remorseful. I hope the Judge would take into consideration what I have said about mom and give me a fair sentence. There is more I want to say. There are 7 staff in the office and whatever Sir was not happy with the performance of the staff, he would show it to mom. Both of them would argue in the car on the way home and the daughter would be frighten and she would be crying. Sir would also tell mom the maid, meaning me, was not capable of looking after the children. There is one staff by the name of Esther. She likes to give foodstuff to the children. I did not tell mom about this. However, mom knew about this, mom scolded me for allowing Esther to give foodstuff to the children, saying that the children would fall sick. When the son got wind in the stomach, mom also blamed me. The son always fell sick and mom would blame me. I also felt pressurized because of what mom did to the previous maids. I am responsible for causing the office to be burnt. I am responsible for causing mom to die. I am responsible for causing mom’s daughter to die. I am angry with mom for pouring hot water on my hands and my left leg, mom also bit me and pulled my hair. Mom also threw telephones at me. Mom tried to kill me with a knife but the knife accidentally struck her daughter twice on the chest. The daughter bled badly. Mom took the knife as if she was in a trance and she was very fierce. I ran towards the kitchen. I took a knife and told mom to stop, otherwise I would use the knife on the son. When I took the knife, I also carried mom’s son. I told mom I would count until three and if she did not stop, I would kill her son. Mom was trying to strike me with her knife and I was trying to strike her with mine. Mom’s knife is a chopper and mine is a vegetable knife. Mom’s knife did not strike me and my knife did not strike mom. Mom’s knife cut mom on her own hand. Mom and I struggled in the toilet until the door broke. I managed to escape but mom pursued me. I told mom I was going to count until three and she must kill herself and if she did not, I would kill myself and her son. Before I escaped, mom actually took a kettle in the kitchen and splashed hot water at me. The hot water touched me and also mom. In fact, when I threatened mom that I would kill her son, I was chasing after her son and mom was chasing after me. Mom had some magical power, which nobody could win her. There is a playroom in the office. Mom entered the playroom. Mom poked a knife against her throat and her chest and she was bleeding. I then pulled mom and her daughter to the kitchen. I washed all the knives that had blood. There were 3 knives. I put my shorts that had blood in a pail and put soap and water. I also put my T-shirt in the oven to dry. I then went to mom’s office and took money, 2 cards, 2 handphones and went to buy petrol. I took a taxi to the nearby petrol kiosk. After obtaining the petrol, I returned to the office. I poured the petrol in the office at several locations. I lighted a flame. Then, I went to the playroom. The fire became big. I took mom’s son but as I did not have the strength, the baby managed to escape. The baby ran towards the door of the playroom. There was fire there. I saved the baby by carrying him and used a chair to break the glass door to come out of the unit. I sat outside the office. I had no strength as I was injured badly. Many people came and saved us. When I was in the hospital, the police took away my clothings. Inside my shorts, there were the money, 2 cards and 2 handphones.
25        These were the primary facts before me. At the close of the Prosecution’s case, there was no submission by the counsel for the accused. Having considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution thus far, and having regard to the principles articulated in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
[1980–1981] SLR 73
, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had made out a case against the accused which if left unrebutted would warrant her conviction. Consequently, the standard allocution was given to the accused, and the courses available were explained to her. The accused, in the event, elected to testify from the witness box.
The defence
26        The accused’s testimony follows.
27        The accused was the eldest in a family of three children. Her father passed away in September 2001. Thereafter, she joined a company in Jakarta where she was trained as a domestic maid, and was taught English, cooking and housekeeping. After her training, she was offered work in Singapore as a domestic maid for a Chinese family with three children. She took up the offer and arrived in Singapore in April 1999.
28        After a two-year stint in Singapore, she returned to Jakarta for further training. She returned to Singapore sometime in April 2002, where she met the deceased at an interview. After the interview, the deceased decided to employ the accused on a trial basis. The accused was brought to the deceased’s office premises in Bukit Merah. There, she noticed that the deceased had two other maids, referred to as Jami and Aminah. She discovered that she was supposed to replace Jami.
29        In her first two to three days in the employ of the deceased, the accused claimed that she saw the deceased abuse Aminah by pulling her hair, pinching and kicking her. On one occasion, the deceased threw Aminah out of the house, citing unsatisfactory work standards. The police was eventually called in to settle the matter. The next day, Aminah was sent back to her maid agency. The accused also claimed that the deceased abused Jami by slapping her and pushing her head.
30        In this respect, Jami’s evidence at trial matched the accused’s claim. Jami testified that she was unhappy working for the deceased, who had a tendency to scold, slap, poke and kick her when she made mistakes while working. Sometimes, the deceased would make Jami hold her ears and kneel as a form of punishment. After witnessing the manner in which Aminah and Jami were treated, the accused became frightened and asked the deceased to send her back to the agency. However, the deceased refused her request, telling her that she was new and could learn from Jami.
31        The accused then continued to work for the deceased. Her daily work routine revolved mainly around preparing food, and caring for the children at the deceased’s home and office premises in Bukit Merah. The accused’s meals usually consisted of leftovers from meals she was told to prepare at home for the deceased’s husband (“the husband”), or bread, when there was some at home. For breakfast, she would have one or two slices of bread, and nothing else. She used to have food to eat for lunch when Jami and Aminah were around, as the latter two maids would prepare lunch in the office premises.
32        However, when Jami and Aminah left the deceased’s employ, the accused did not eat anything at the office, save for some bread and snacks, which were offered to her by the deceased’s staff members at the Bukit Merah office, namely Ong Lay Hong Fiona (“Fiona Ong”), Esther Hong, Margaret Low or Nancy Ee. At times, the accused would help herself to some bread left in the office premises.
33        The deceased was reportedly unhappy whenever her staff gave the accused food, and expressed her displeasure to the accused. However, the accused still accepted the food offered to her because she needed to have something to eat. For dinner, the accused relied on the leftovers from dinners she cooked at home for the husband. However, when the husband went overseas, the deceased would forbid her from cooking. As a result, the accused would have to go without food. Three weeks before the incident on 28 May 2002, the deceased stopped the accused from cooking at home, thereby preventing her from receiving her rations of leftovers. The deceased’s reason for doing this was because she felt that the accused’s job performance was not up to mark.
34        The accused then claimed that on two occasions before 28 May 2002, the deceased had gotten frustrated with her and told her to eat the children’s faeces. The first occasion was a Sunday afternoon, when the accused told the deceased that she was hungry. The deceased responded by saying that if she was hungry, she should eat Crystal’s faeces. The second occasion took place in the husband’s room when he was not in Singapore. The accused had asked the deceased whether she should feed the children porridge. The deceased found the accused’s question foolish. She told the accused that if the children did not eat the porridge, the porridge would be thrown away, and if the accused wanted any food, she could just eat Crystal’s faeces. On both occasions, the deceased did not force the accused to eat the faeces. However, on the second occasion, the accused voluntarily ate the faeces to show the deceased that she would rather eat the faeces of the baby she loved, than the food provided by the insincere deceased.
35        On 26 May 2002, the husband left for Myanmar on business. The accused ate a slice of bread for breakfast. At about 1.30pm she left for the husband’s parents’ flat with the deceased and the children. The accused stated that the husband’s mother had cooked “
bee hoon
”, and the deceased gave the accused a bowl of “
bee hoon
” to feed the baby. The accused alleged that she was not given any food to eat when she was at the flat, although she was allowed a drink of warm water. Although she could have asked for a warm beverage, she did not make such a request because she felt shy to ask for food there. When they returned home, the deceased told the accused not to cook, as the husband was not at home. The accused did not prepare anything for herself, fearing a scolding from the deceased if she were spotted doing so. As such, the accused went to sleep without any food.
36        The accused claimed that on 27 May 2002, she did not have anything to eat, as there was no bread at home and the deceased had stopped her from cooking at home. She only had a drink of warm water and went to sleep at night after doing the laundry.
37        On 28 May 2002, the accused woke up at 5.30am and proceeded to do the household chores. At about 8.30am, she fed the baby porridge for breakfast, while the deceased fed Crystal. The accused did not have any porridge, as it contained pork. By this time, the accused was feeling extremely hungry, as the last time she had eaten any food was on the morning of 26 May 2002, when she had had the slice of bread. She then told the deceased that she was hungry, and the latter grudgingly gave her two packets of instant noodles. The accused tried to cook the instant noodles in a cooking pot, but was stopped by the deceased, and told to eat the noodles raw.
38        Nevertheless, the accused took out a plastic container, filled it with hot water and placed one packet of instant noodles in it, together with the sauces. She then sat on a chair in the kitchen and was about to eat the noodles when the deceased came in and told her not to sit on the chair. The accused stood up, and the deceased ordered her to eat the noodles in the toilet. The accused complied. She ate about two to three spoonfuls of noodles when the deceased called for her to leave for the office. Upon hearing the deceased, the accused left the plastic container with the noodles and the unopened packet of instant noodles in the toilet. These items were later recovered by the police in the course of their investigations in the same place and position as described by the accused.
[6]
39        At about 11.30am, the accused and the deceased left for the office with the two children. At the office, the accused looked after the two children in a playroom within the office premises, while the deceased attended to her work. At about 2.30pm, the deceased entered the playroom and gave the accused a thermos flask containing noodles to feed the baby. The deceased fed Crystal. While the accused fed the baby, some of the noodles fell on his shirt. The accused used tissue paper to clean the baby’s shirt. The deceased noticed this and scolded the accused for using too much tissue paper, “as though it belonged to the accused’s parents”.
40        Subsequently, the baby urinated on the carpet. The deceased scolded him and used a cane to hit him. Following this, the deceased turned to the accused and hit her on the buttocks with the cane, alleging that she had eaten the baby’s food. The accused responded by telling the deceased that she had not eaten the baby’s food, but had only blown at the food to make it cooler before feeding the child. The accused was saddened and angered by the deceased’s actions. Esther Hong, Margaret Low and Nancy Ee, who were in the office premises at the time, heard the commotion in the playroom.
41        After the children were fed, the accused went to the kitchen to wash the dishes. While she was there, she met Rose Ang, the cleaning lady. The accused told Rose Ang that she was hungry and that the deceased had not given her food for three days. Rose Ang gave the accused three biscuits and the accused consumed them. At trial, Rose Ang, who was called as a witness for the Prosecution, substantially corroborated this aspect of the accused’s version of events.
42        The accused then prepared rice, porridge and soup for dinner. At about 6.00pm, the deceased brought the accused and the two children out of the office to run some errands. They were at a handphone shop when they met Esther Hong and Margaret Low, where Margaret Low offered some fresh fruits to the baby. The deceased stopped her, saying that the baby was coughing. Margaret Low then offered the fruits to the accused, but the deceased stopped her saying, “Don’t give her”. The accused testified that she felt slighted and disappointed when the deceased stopped Margaret Low.
43        The deceased, the accused and the two children then went back to the office. In the office, the deceased spoke to Fiona Ong for some time and then went to the kitchen to get the food ready for the two children. At about 8.00pm, Fiona Ong left the office. Around that time, the deceased and the accused were feeding the two children in the playroom. The accused fed the baby while the deceased fed Crystal. Both women had difficulty in feeding the children, as the children kept moving about. The deceased got impatient and began to scold the accused, claiming that she had come to the office only to sit and eat and did not take proper care of the children.
44        The deceased then took a melamine feeding-spoon and poked it in the ear of the accused. The accused felt pain, although she did not bleed. The accused also testified that this was not the first time the deceased had used a spoon to poke her ear, claiming that the deceased had done the same thing on one other occasion at home. Around this time, the baby had to pass motion. The accused took a pink-coloured potty for the baby to use.
45        After the baby had finished, the accused used a wet tissue to clean him. While she was cleaning the baby, the deceased began to scold her for being too slow and not cleaning the baby properly. The deceased then snatched the soiled wet tissue from the accused and threw it at her face. The soiled tissue hit the left side of the accused’s face and left traces of faeces behind. The accused felt like vomiting and was angry.
46        The accused then took another wet tissue to clean the baby. The deceased snatched the second soiled tissue and threw it at the accused’s face again. The tissue hit the accused’s nose and bits of faeces were left behind. The accused continued to try to clean the baby with another wet tissue. However, for the third time, the deceased grabbed the wet tissue and threw it at the accused’s face. The accused then picked up the three tissues and placed them into the potty. She felt nauseous and told the deceased that she wanted to drink some water, as she was feeling hungry. The deceased told her to continue feeding the baby. The accused then told the deceased a few more times that she was very hungry and wished to go to the kitchen to have a drink. The deceased told the accused to eat the baby’s faeces if she was very hungry. The accused felt insulted and angry by the deceased’s words.
47        The accused then took a spoonful of faeces from the potty and put them in her mouth. The accused’s intention was to show the deceased that she preferred eating the faeces of the baby she loved, rather than to eat the food provided by the deceased. After she ate the faeces, the accused threw the spoon onto the floor and brought the potty to the toilet. She washed her face and went into the kitchen to get a drink of water. While in the kitchen, the accused thought about the way she had been treated by the deceased thus far, and her anger intensified.
48        While drinking the water, the accused did not realise that the deceased was standing behind her. The deceased pulled the accused by the back of her shirt-collar and dragged her into the playroom. The accused fell and sat on the floor. The deceased then told the accused to finish feeding the baby. While the accused was feeding the baby, the child grabbed a computer mouse and played with it. The deceased took the mouse away from him, and the baby started to cry. This annoyed the deceased and she scolded and caned the child.
49        The deceased then told the accused to pack up to leave for home. While packing up and changing the children, the accused asked the deceased whether she wanted Crystal to be dressed in her pyjamas. This question annoyed the deceased further. She pulled a red backpack which the accused was holding, causing her to fall backwards onto Crystal, who was behind her. Crystal started to cry and the deceased attempted to pacify the child.
50        Then the baby took the computer mouse again. The accused took the computer mouse away from him and he began to cry. The accused then tried to give the computer mouse back to the baby to stop him from crying, but the deceased snatched it from her hands, causing the accused to lose her balance and fall on the baby. The deceased then threw the computer mouse at the accused, but missed her.
51        The accused became disturbed by this, stood up and told the deceased, “Ma’am why you do to me everyday like that, I very pain”. The deceased reacted by scolding the accused and used her fingers to scratch the accused’s face. Although the deceased’s fingernails did not leave scratches on the accused’s face, the accused felt pain and became angry. She pulled at the deceased’s dress, and both women began to wrestle with each other.
52        The accused tried to punch the deceased several times, but the deceased managed to ward off the blows. The accused then grabbed a cable under a table to tie the deceased’s hands, but did not succeed. The accused ran to the kitchen to look for something to tie the deceased’s hands. While in the toilet, the accused found a rope and returned with it to the playroom. She tried to tie the deceased’s hands again, to stop the deceased from fighting. However, she failed and the two women ended up wrestling again. The accused then pressed the rope against the deceased’s neck, choking her. At that time, the accused was furious at the treatment she had received all along. She testified that the thought of the treatment made her “blood rise”.
53        The deceased had become limp by this time. The accused then threw the rope away and went towards the two crying children to pacify them. She hugged the two children, with Crystal on her left. While the accused was hugging them, Crystal pushed the accused away. According to the accused, Crystal could have bitten her on the left shoulder, but she did not feel any pain. She was, however, unsure of whether Crystal had indeed bitten her. At this point, the deceased got up suddenly and kicked the accused from behind. The two women started to wrestle with each other again. The deceased pulled the accused’s hair and banged her head against the wall. They continued to wrestle. The accused then pushed the deceased away and managed to break free. She ran towards the kitchen to look for something to fight the deceased with. The deceased followed the accused into the kitchen and pushed her, causing the accused to lose her balance.
54        The deceased grabbed a kettle and attempted to throw it at the accused. The accused kicked the deceased’s leg, causing the deceased to fall into the toilet together with the kettle. As a result, hot water from the kettle spilled onto the accused’s left hand and leg. They then wrestled in the toilet. In the process, the toilet door was dislodged and fell on the accused.
55        The accused managed to break free from the deceased again and ran towards the glass door of unit #06-3663. As she was running away, she noticed that the deceased was chasing her with a small knife. The accused reached the glass door but was unable to open it. The deceased stood about two feet away from the accused and tried to stab her. The accused shouted “
jangan
, 
jangan
” (meaning “stop, stop” in Bahasa Indonesia), dodged the stabs and ran back to the playroom.
56        When the accused entered the playroom, she spotted the baby and Crystal. She carried Crystal on her left and the baby on her right, intending to use them as human shields to prevent the deceased’s stabs. The accused claimed that the deceased continued to attack her with the knife, despite the fact that her two children were being used as shields. The accused became exhausted and dropped the baby on the floor, while continuing to carry Crystal.
57        She then held Crystal in front of her and shifted from left to right to avoid the deceased’s stabs. In the process, the knife the deceased was holding came into contact with Crystal’s left chest once. Despite this, the deceased allegedly continued trying to stab the accused. The accused managed to back out of the playroom and while she was near the playroom door, she dropped Crystal onto the floor and ran to the kitchen to find something to fight the deceased with.
58        In the kitchen, the accused took a knife
[7]
 
and ran back to the playroom with it. In the common office area outside the playroom, the accused saw the deceased running towards her. She side-stepped the deceased, whereupon the deceased ran into the kitchen and emerged carrying two knives in both her hands, a small one
[8]
 
in her left hand and a big knife
[9]
 
in her right. Both women then fought at different spots in the office. The deceased failed to stab the accused, hitting a computer and table in the office area instead.
59        The accused claimed that the deceased hit her own left hand with the big knife about three to four times. The accused was unsure whether the knife she was holding hit the deceased, although she conceded that the knife she was holding could have touched the deceased when they were fighting in the kitchen. The accused was not injured. The accused then ran to the office common area and picked up the baby. The deceased followed her. The accused held the baby and placed a knife at his neck. She then told the deceased that she would kill the child unless the deceased cut her hand. Subsequently, the deceased allegedly entered the playroom while the accused remained in the office common area. The accused repeated her threats to the deceased. The deceased then sat down and started to “slice” her left hand with the big knife, in a cutting and chopping motion.
60        The accused claimed that the deceased got up and with both knives in both hands, went after the accused again. When the deceased reached Margaret Low’s desk, she dropped the big knife and threw books, stationery and telephones at the accused using her right hand. The accused then told the deceased to kill herself, failing which she would kill the baby and subsequently commit suicide. There was a stand-off for about one to two minutes before the deceased went back to the playroom, holding the small knife in her right hand. The accused remained in the office common area holding the baby and pointing the knife at his neck.
61        After the deceased entered the playroom, the accused heard her saying, “I die”. There were no more sounds thereafter. The accused then waited a while and entered the playroom. She discovered the deceased lying on the floor of the playroom, with her right hand holding the small knife, which was in turn embedded in the right side of her neck. There was blood flowing from her neck, arms and other parts of her body.
62        She approached the deceased’s body and used her right leg to check if the deceased was still alive. There was no response from the deceased. She then withdrew the knife from the deceased’s neck, collected all three knives and the deceased’s watch, and brought all the items to the toilet, where she washed them. She claimed that the knives were not washed properly. She applied some toothpaste on her arms and legs, as they had been scalded earlier by the hot water from the kettle.
63        The accused then pulled the deceased into the kitchen and left the body there. She took Crystal and placed her on the deceased’s body. She did not know whether Crystal was still alive at that time. She also did not call for an ambulance for Crystal, as she claimed she did not know the number of the hospital. She testified that she was in a confused state at that time and did not know what to do. After moving the bodies, she went into the playroom and decided to get rid of the blood with fire. She claimed that she recalled that one could remove blood with fire, as she had seen this being done on television.
64        She then opened the deceased’s room using a set of keys found in the playroom. She took the contents of the deceased’s wallet (which included US$355 and about S$100) and other valuables from the room. The accused stated that she intended to buy petrol to burn the office. However, she noticed that there was blood on her shirt. She washed her shirt and dried it in the microwave oven before going out of the office. She also found and cleaned a container to keep the petrol in.
65        The accused then left the baby in the office and carried the container with her to buy petrol. She took a taxi to the petrol station and gave the taxi driver, one Haron bin Hashim (“Haron”), a $50 note taken from the deceased’s wallet, requesting him to buy some petrol for her. He obliged. She then asked Haron to send her back to Block 165 Bukit Merah Central. After disembarking from the taxi, the accused claimed she spotted a Chinese woman sitting at the taxi stand smoking a cigarette. She approached the woman and bought two disposable lighters from her, one of which was orange in colour
[10]
 
and the other, blue.
[11]
66        She then returned to the office through the door of unit #06-3663 and spotted the baby near the glass door. She poured the petrol on the tables used by Fiona Ong, Nancy Ee and Margaret Low and on the metal cabinet. She went into the deceased’s room and the playroom and poured some petrol in these areas. She then went into the playroom and sat on the floor. She ignited the orange coloured disposable lighter and started the fire. The fire began to spread. She placed the baby beside her and lay on the floor with him. According to the accused, she wanted to die because she could not go back to Indonesia or approach anyone for help. She also claimed that she thought of killing herself, as she assumed she would be arrested and sentenced to death.
67        Then, the baby got up and walked towards the fire. The child’s hand and hair caught fire. When the accused noticed this, she quickly got up, grabbed the child and used her hands to put out the fire on him. She tucked him under her shirt and rolled on the floor until she reached the glass door entrance adjoining the two units. While rolling, her lower right hand and part of her right thigh and calf caught fire. She got up and carried the baby to Esther Hong’s table. There, she took a chair and broke a glass panel on the door to give the baby some fresh air. By then, the fire had gotten fiercer. The accused walked back to the fire, as she wanted to die. However, she returned to the baby after hearing him cry out for her, and carried him out of the office. The accused then sat along the corridor with the baby on her lap.
68        By this time, a crowd had gathered along the corridor. The accused recalled people talking to her, whereupon she informed them that the deceased and Crystal were still inside. She then told a Chinese man in the crowd that she wanted to go to the hospital because she and the baby were burnt. The man then followed the accused and the baby to the void deck. The accused claimed that she could not recall if she met a police officer (Sgt Suhaimi) at the void deck.
69        She was then conveyed to SGH, where Nurse Bebe and Nurse Martin attended to her. She recalled Nurse Martin asking her some questions, to which she responded that there was a fire, the lights went off and there was smoke. She was then given an injection that made her dizzy and heavy headed. She was having a headache, felt sleepy and was not aware of the things that were taking place around her.
70        She claimed that when she was at the hospital, she did not think of anything because she was putting up with the pain that she was under. She was also scared that the deceased’s and Crystal’s faces would haunt her, although she did not feel responsible for their deaths. The accused then recalled meeting various hospital staff and police personnel, to whom she narrated her initial version of events, as set out earlier. She was extensively questioned on her statements given to the police. She changed and chopped her stories and there were substantial retractions on her part.
Closing arguments for the Defence
71        The Defence relied on the accused’s testimony and argued that she was not guilty of the offence of murder, as she had not stabbed the deceased, the deceased having killed herself. The Defence also contended that three exceptions to the offence of murder were available to the accused. These were the exceptions of provocation (Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”)), private defence (Exception 2 to s 300 PC) and sudden fight (Exception 4 to s 300 PC). The latter argument was made as an alternative, in the event that I was to find that the fatal wound was indeed caused by the accused.
Exception 1 – Provocation
72        The Defence argued that culpable homicide was not murder if the offender, while deprived of his or her self-control by grave and sudden provocation, caused the death of the person who offered the provocation. In this case, the Defence claimed that the provocation emanated from the deceased. Counsel argued that on 28 May 2002, the deceased had acted unreasonably, and in a humiliating and insulting manner towards the accused. The accused was angered by this treatment and was therefore provoked into causing the death of the deceased.
73        The Defence then detailed the deceased’s alleged acts which constituted the grave and sudden provocation. I reproduce this aspect of the Defence’s submissions:
[12]
1. depriving her of her food by not providing food since her last breakfast on 26

] on her buttocks;
8. scolding and accusing her of eating Baby’s food in the office;
9. preventing Margaret (PW37) from even giving some fruits to the Accused;
10. poking the spoon into her ears;
11. slapping and throwing the soiled tissues on [her] face;
12. refusing the Accused [
sic
] to drink water to relieve her hunger;
13. asking the Accused to eat Baby’s faeces in the potty;
14. dragging her by the neck of her T-shirt from the kitchen to the playroom;
15. pulling the red backpack from the Accused causing her to fall backwards on Mei Mei [Crystal];
16. pulling the computer mouse from the Accused causing her to fall on Baby;
17. throwing the computer mouse at the Accused;
18. scratching the Accused[’s] face with her fingers.
74        Additionally, defence counsel argued that the accused had been feeling angry at the manner in which the deceased was treating her since she commenced work. In this respect, the accused claimed that she was subject to much abuse over a period of time prior to 28 May 2002. As such, on the fateful day, after having been subject to all of the above ill-treatment, abuse and humiliation, the accused claimed that she was in a state of anger.
75        The accused also alleged that the deceased had pulled her by the back of her collar and dragged her, thereby causing her to feel incensed. The accused added that the acts of provocation did not end there, but continued when the deceased pulled a red backpack and a computer mouse that the accused was holding, causing her to fall. The accused then confronted the deceased, whereupon the deceased scratched the accused’s face.
76        It was further submitted by defence counsel that it was this last act of the deceased that was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. The accused then lost her self-control and pulled at the deceased’s dress, leading to the fight and subsequently, the deceased’s death. The Defence tried to distinguish the facts in the cases of 
Ithinin bin Kamari v PP
 
[1993] 2 SLR 245
 and 
Lau Lee Peng v PP
 
[2000] 2 SLR 628
 from the present case. Counsel submitted that in these two cases, the acts of provocation were minor or did not stretch for a period of time, whereas in the present case, there was a series of grave acts of ill-treatment, abuse and humiliation, all of which constituted the grave and sudden provocation emanating from the deceased towards the accused, and caused the accused to lose her self-control.
Exception 2 – Right of private defence
77        Defence counsel next argued that when a person exercises his right of private defence of person or property against someone, and thereby causes the death of that person without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for such private defence, his act of causing the other person’s death is not murder, but culpable homicide.
78        Defence counsel relied on the Court of Appeal decision of 
Soosay v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 272
 to argue that for this exception to apply, the accused only had to prove on a balance of probabilities that:
(a)        the right of private defence has arisen;
(b)        the right was exercised in good faith;
(c)        the death was caused without premeditation; and
(d)        the death was caused without any intention of doing more harm than was necessary for the purpose of such defence.
79        Counsel then submitted that the deceased had confronted the accused with a small knife in her hand, and had chased her to the glass door of unit #06-3663. Counsel submitted that, as in 
Soosay v PP
, the accused’s right of private defence arose when this incident occurred. Additionally, counsel argued that the threat from the deceased continued when the deceased attacked the accused with a chopper and a knife as well. The accused then responded by fighting back. Counsel argued that in both instances, the accused was in imminent danger of harm, if not death.
80        Counsel thus submitted that at all times, the accused’s act of arming herself with a knife to act against the deceased was for the protection of her own life, and was not for the sake of gaining an undue advantage over the deceased. If not for the accused’s exercise of her right to private defence, she would have been hurt or even killed by the deceased. As such, counsel argued that, given the circumstances, the accused was entitled to exercise her right of private defence.
Exception 4 – Sudden fight
81        Finally, the Defence relied on Exception 4 to s 300 PC, which states that culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Counsel relied on the Court of Appeal decision in 
Tan Chun Seng v PP
 
[2003] 2 SLR 506
, where it was held that there are three main ingredients in the defence of sudden fight, namely:
(a)        a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel;
(b)        the absence of premeditation; and
(c)        no undue advantage or cruel or unusual acts involved.
82        Counsel evidently relied on the accused’s testimony pertaining to the events of 28 May 2002 to submit that the fight between the accused and the deceased, which led to the death of the deceased, was not planned by the accused at an earlier date, but was one which erupted unexpectedly when the deceased scratched the accused’s face. Additionally, counsel submitted that the accused was unarmed at the time the fight started and that it was the deceased who first armed herself with a knife and chased the accused. Counsel also argued that the accused did not gain any undue advantage over the deceased, as it was the deceased who was the aggressor at all times.
83        Further, although the accused may have been a little bigger than the deceased, defence counsel submitted that she never used her slight advantage in size or height to start the fight and overwhelm the deceased. Counsel therefore argued that the three main ingredients in the defence of sudden fight had been satisfied and, as such, Exception 4 to s 300 PC should apply in this case. Defence counsel further submitted that since the Defence had raised the foregoing issues, it remained for the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Prosecution’s response to the Defence’s contentions
84        The Prosecution tackled the Defence’s contentions on three levels. First, the Prosecution submitted that the objective facts of the case proved that the accused was guilty of murdering the deceased. Second, it was submitted that the accused was not a credible witness and that her testimony in court was entirely unbelievable. Third, the Prosecution attempted to show why each of the three exceptions to s 300 PC, as raised by the Defence, did not apply in this case.
The Prosecution’s arguments on the accused’s guilt
85        The Prosecution charged the accused under s 300(c) PC. I reproduce the relevant section below:
Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
86        The Prosecution relied on the case of 
Tan Cheow Bock v PP
 
[1991] SLR 293
, where the then Court of Criminal Appeal cited the judgment of Bose J in 
Virsa Singh v State of Punjab
 AIR (45) 1958 SC 465. The Prosecution submitted that in order for s 300(c) PC to be made out, it had to prove the following beyond a reasonable doubt:
(a)        that a bodily injury was present;
(b)        the nature of the bodily injury;
(c)        that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of bodily injury was intended; and
(d)        that bodily injury inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
For convenience, I shall term the above “the test in 
Virsa Singh
”.
87        The Prosecution reiterated that Dr Lau’s evidence clearly showed that the injuries suffered by the deceased were not suicidal, as suggested by the accused, but homicidal. Therefore, the Prosecution submitted that limbs (a), (b) and (d) of the test in 
Virsa Singh
 had been established. The Prosecution was then left to prove limb (c) of the test in 
Virsa
 Singh, that is, whether the accused had intended to inflict that particular bodily injury on the deceased. The Prosecution referred to the cases of 
Ang Sunny v PP
 
[1965–1968] SLR 67
, 
Shepherd v R
 (1990) 97 ALR 161 and 
PP v Oh Laye Koh
 
[1994] SGHC 129
, submitting that these cases represented the law on circumstantial evidence in Singapore. I reproduce a portion of the judgment in 
Shepherd v R
 (
per
 Mason CJ at 165), which is a succinct statement on this aspect of the law of evidence:
As I have said, the prosecution bears the burden of proving all the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt. That means that the essential ingredients of each element must be so proved. It does not mean that every fact – every piece of evidence – relied upon to prove an element by inference must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt. … Indeed, the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately.
88        The Prosecution then highlighted the following series of what it termed objective facts, that had been proved by the evidence of witnesses other than the accused:
(i)         On 28 May 2002, the deceased, her two children and the accused arrived at the office at Bukit Merah Central at about noon.
(ii)        Throughout the day, the accused was looking after the two children in the office.
(iii)       The deceased and accused fed the children lunch.
(iv)       During lunchtime, the deceased complained to her staff that the accused had eaten her son’s food.
(v)        The deceased scolded the accused in front of the staff.
(vi)       At about 5pm, the deceased left the office with the two children and the accused to do some errands.
(vii)      The deceased purchased a new hand-phone at about 6.25pm.
(viii)      They returned to the office at about 7pm with groceries and the new handphone.
(ix)       At about 8pm, Fiona Ong (PW21) left the office and locked the main door, leaving behind the deceased, her two children and the accused. The deceased and the accused were feeding the two children in the playroom.
(x)        At about 8.43pm, a “999” silent call was made from the office.
(xi)       At about 8.46pm, Anthony [Joseph] Lefort (PW35) heard someone shouting “Jangan, jangan” followed by the scream of a young girl.
(xii)      At about 10pm, the accused boarded the taxi of Haron (PW28).
(xiii)      At about 10.08pm, Haron helped the accused to purchase petrol at a Caltex Petrol Station along Jalan Bukit Merah.
(xiv)     At about 10.41pm, the fire was reported to the police.
(xv)      Sometime past 10.30pm, members of the public arrived at the scene and they saw the accused sitting along the corridor outside the office unit with [the baby] on her lap.
(xvi)     At about 10.49pm, the first firemen arrived at the scene.
(xvii)     The deceased and Crystal’s bodies were recovered from the burning premises. They had died before the fire started.
(xviii)    The deceased suffered numerous defensive injuries on her left and right arms as well as her hands. She also sustained two stab wounds, one of them fatal, on her neck.
(xix)     The defensive injuries and the stab wounds found on the deceased were likely to have been inflicted by the knives found in the office premises.
(xx)      The defensive injuries were caused before the stab wounds to the neck.
(xxi)     Crystal suffered a single stab wound to her chest.
(xxii)    The accused lied to the nurses at SGH, ASP Sim (PW49) and Anita Foo (PW36) about the incident.
(xxiii)    The accused suffered 3 bite marks, 
two of them caused by Crystal, and the other could have been caused by Crystal.
(xxiv)    The accused sustained burns on her right leg and hand.
(xxv)    The accused did not sustain any other injury.
(xxvi)    The accused’s T-shirt, white shorts, bra and panties were stained with the deceased’s blood.
During the course of its final submissions, the Prosecution deleted the words shown in italics in items (xix), (xx), (xxii) and (xxiii).
89        The Prosecution then contended that the circumstantial evidence in this case was compelling against the accused, and as the fatal stab wound was homicidal and not suicidal, the only logical inference was that the accused had stabbed the deceased in the neck. The Prosecution relied on the principle in 
Ang Sunny v PP
 ([87] 
supra
) and submitted that the cumulative effect of all the evidence led to the irresistible inference that the accused intentionally attacked the deceased and inflicted the injuries to the deceased’s arms and hands and further, she intentionally inflicted the two stab wounds on the deceased’s neck. One of these stab wounds to the neck was then sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, thereby coming under s 300(c) PC.
The Prosecution’s arguments on the veracity of the accused’s evidence
90        The Prosecution next submitted that from the evidence, it was clear that the accused had given two versions of the events of 28 May 2002 and/or including the events leading up to 28 May 2002: the first was her version to the people at SGH and the second, that gleaned from her statements to ASP Ang and Insp Bahar, and her testimony in court. The Prosecution contended that the fact that there were two differing versions of events spoke volumes about the accused’s veracity, or lack of it. Additionally, the Prosecution argued that the accused’s second version of events was riddled with lies and inconsistencies.
91        The Prosecution argued that the accused had repeatedly lied in court and that her evidence in the oral and written statements she had provided out of court were filled with lies and material inconsistencies. The Prosecution submitted that the lies told by the accused out of court, in her statements, corroborated her guilt. The Prosecution relied on the case of 
R v Lucas
 
[1981] QB 720
 in support of this proposition. I reproduce the relevant portion of the judgment in 
R v Lucas
, where the court (at 724) enunciated a four-fold test in determining whether the lies of an accused could amount to corroboration of that accused’s guilt:
To be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie told out of court must first of all be deliberate. Secondly, it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly, the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. The jury should in appropriate cases be reminded that people sometimes lie, for example, in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or out of a wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from their family. Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of the accomplice who is to be corroborated, that is to say by admission or by evidence from an independent witness.
92        The Prosecution highlighted that this four-fold test was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
. The Prosecution then highlighted what it alleged were crucial lies made by the accused. I reproduce the Prosecution’s submissions as follows:
In Exhibits P209, P211, P213 and even in Court, the accused lied that the deceased had cut her hands and stabbed herself twice in the neck. This is in contrast to the 
expert
 evidence by Dr Lau (PW23), who opined that the first deceased’s injuries were homicidal and not likely to be self-inflicted.
In Exhibit P212, the accused lied that the deceased had bit her on her left shoulder blade and left chest. Dr Goh found three bite marks on the accused and opined that two of the bit marks matched Crystal’s dentition and not the deceased (S2 and S3).
In Exhibits P209 and P211, the accused lied that the deceased had splashed hot water on her. In Exhibit P212, the accused claimed that she knocked over the flask causing hot water to fall on her lower hand and lower leg. However, the medical evidence shows that the accused did not suffer any scalding injuries.
In Exhibit P212, the accused lied that the deceased had scratched her face. Furthermore, in her evidence in court, the accused lied that the deceased had poked her ear with a spoon, thrown soiled tissues at her and thrown a computer mouse at her. She also lied that she sustained several injuries during the fight with the deceased. Despite this, the medical evidence shows that no injuries were found on the accused apart from the burn wounds on her arm and leg, and the 3 bite marks.
The accused lied to ASP Sim (PW49) that three female persons and nine male persons had entered the office and the fire started. The accused also lied to Nurse Aidah (PW48) and Nurse Ashikin (PW43) that three women came into the office and switched off all the lights. The accused alleged to Nurse Ashikin that the three women were wearing stockings over their faces and one of them shouted at her to keep quiet as the baby was crying. The evidence shows that there were no signs of forced entry into the office and no other person was involved in the incident. Further, it was the accused who had poured the petrol and set off the fire in the office.
The accused lied in her police statements and in Court that the deceased had stabbed her daughter.
The accused lied to Haron (PW28) about the reasons for wanting to buy petrol.
93        The Prosecution submitted that the accused’s alleged lies in her statements could not be cursorily dismissed as mistakes made out of confusion or fear. The Prosecution argued that the various witnesses who came into contact with the accused were struck by her calmness and lack of emotion. Moreover, Exhibit P208 was written by the accused herself. The Prosecution argued that the length and details to which the accused narrated the events showed that she was able to give a full account of what had happened. The number of lies in her statements only served to show that the accused was trying to cover up her lies with even more lies.
94        The Prosecution therefore submitted that these lies were deliberately made up by the accused. The Prosecution also argued that the lies obviously related to material issues, since a large number of them pertained to the circumstances surrounding the deceased’s death. As the lies went directly to exculpate the accused, they were clearly motivated out of guilt and a fear of the truth. Further, the Prosecution contended that a number of independent witnesses had provided evidence to show that the various statements made by the accused amounted to lies. As such, the Prosecution argued that the test in 
R v Lucas
 was satisfied, and that the accused’s lies not only went towards her credibility, but were also evidence corroborative of her guilt.
The Prosecution’s arguments on the exceptions to s 300 PC
95        Lastly, the Prosecution argued that the burden was on the Defence to prove that the exceptions to s 300 PC applied in this case: 
Mohamed Kunjo v PP
 
[1975–1977] SLR 75
; 
Somwang Phatthanasaeng v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 850
. The Prosecution then argued that the Defence would not be able to discharge this burden, since the accused’s position from the outset was that she did not kill the deceased and that the deceased had killed herself.
96        As such, the Prosecution submitted that the moment the Defence failed to show that the accused did not kill the deceased, the accused ought to be convicted as charged, with no room for the application of the exceptions. However, for the sake of completeness, the Prosecution did make submissions pertaining to whether the exceptions to murder applied in this case.
Exception 1: Provocation
97        The Prosecution submitted that two requirements must be met before the defence of grave and sudden provocation can be raised successfully. In support of this proposition of law, the Prosecution cited the cases of 
PP v Kwan Cin Cheng
 
[1998] 2 SLR 345
, 
Lau Lee Peng v PP
 ([76] 
supra
) and 
Seah Kok Meng v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 135
. First, there is a subjective requirement that the accused must have been deprived of her self-control by the provocation. Second, there is an objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and sudden”, which incorporates the application of the “reasonable man” test. This latter test involves considering whether an ordinary person of the same gender and age as the accused, sharing such of his/her characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, and placed in the same situation as the accused, would have been so provoked as to lose her self-control. Individual peculiarities which merely affect the accused’s power of self-control but not the gravity of the provocation should not be taken into account: 
Ithinin bin Kamari v PP
 ([76] 
supra
).
98        A further relevant consideration to the second requirement would be the test of proportionality. I reproduce a part of the judgment in 
PP v Kwan Cin Cheng
, where the court (at [69]) described this requirement in succinct terms:
However, in our view, a “proportionality” criterion would be more accurately expressed in the following terms: in deciding if an accused had exercised sufficient self-control for the objective test, a relevant question may be whether the degree of loss of self-control was commensurate with the severity of the provocation.
99        The Prosecution made submissions on the first issue of whether the accused was deprived of her self-control. This was the subjective requirement. It was argued that in ascertaining this, the accused’s behaviour during the material time would be of great evidential value. The Prosecution raised the case of 
Lim Chin Chong v PP
 
[1998] 2 SLR 794
 in support of this argument. There, the Court of Appeal held that the appellant in question did not lose his self-control. Instead, the appellant “went about killing the deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way”, which was an indication that the murderous acts “were not the acts of a man who has lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They were calculated and premeditated acts”.
100      The Prosecution relied on the judgment of the court in 
Lim Chin Chong v PP
 and drew parallels to the present case. It was submitted that no evidence was adduced to show that the accused was in fact deprived of her self-control when she killed the deceased. The Prosecution argued that the accused’s version of events had always related to how she was reacting to the deceased’s alleged aggressive behaviour. Based on the accused’s own version of events, she was seen to have had the presence of mind to use the children as human shields and to run to the kitchen in search of a knife to defend herself with. From this, the Prosecution argued that it was clear that the image of the accused was not one of an enraged killer who had lost her self-control, but one very much in control of her mental faculties.
101      Additionally, the Prosecution argued that the behaviour of the accused following the commission of the offence should be taken into account in considering if there was a deprivation of self-control: 
Lau Lee Peng v PP
 ([76] 
supra
). The Prosecution submitted that in this case, it could not be inferred that the accused had lost her self-control, as she had shown great composure and acumen in moving the bodies, washing the knives, ensuring that her clothes were clean of bloodstains, applying Colgate to her scalds, taking a taxi to purchase the petrol and eventually setting the office on fire. Further, witnesses, including the taxi driver (Haron), had observed that the accused seemed calm and composed at all times.
102      The Prosecution thus argued that these calculated and methodical actions did not depict a person who had lost her self-control, but showed a person who was very conscious and aware of what she was doing at all times. As such, the Prosecution argued that the accused failed to show that she had subjectively lost her self-control. The Prosecution then addressed the objective second requirement of whether there was grave and sudden provocation.
103      The Prosecution argued that there were two important elements in this objective requirement, that is, the provocation must be grave and sudden. No matter how grave the provocation is, if it did not take place contemporaneously or shortly before the killing, the exception would not apply. Likewise, no matter how contemporaneous a provocation is to the act of killing, the defence would not be available if the provocation is not sufficiently grave. The Prosecution then detailed a series of alleged abuses the accused endured at the hands of the deceased. It was argued that first, the alleged abuses never occurred and second, even if these allegations were true, they could not have amounted to such grave and sudden provocation that would have caused a reasonable person in the accused’s position to lose her self-control.
104      The Prosecution recapitulated the testimonies of the husband and some of the deceased’s staff, who had testified that apart from the deceased scolding the accused, they did not observe the deceased abusing the accused in any other manner. The Prosecution posited that the accused had on one occasion left a previous employer because they had been too “fussy”. As such, it was argued that the accused knew her avenues of recourse if she had indeed been abused by the deceased, that is, to lodge a complaint with her agent, the police, the Ministry of Manpower or the Indonesian Embassy. However, she did none of the above. The Prosecution submitted that this was an indication that the allegations of abuse were suspect.
105      The Prosecution also attempted to play down the accused’s claims that she was deprived of food prior to the events leading up to the death of the deceased. It was argued that there was ample evidence that food was readily available in the deceased’s office and home. The accused had also admitted that on the morning of 28 May 2002, the deceased had given her two packets of instant noodles.
106      The Prosecution then went on an alternative argument and submitted that even if one were to assume that the accused was a truthful witness, the deceased’s abusive acts would still not amount to grave and sudden provocation. First, the Prosecution argued that much of the accused’s accounts of abuse occurred before the accused and the two children left with the deceased to run some errands. As such, the requirement of suddenness was not satisfied, and thus these acts of abuse could not be relied upon as grave and sudden provocation. However, the Prosecution did concede that these abusive acts could still be relevant to the “mental background” they created in the accused on the evening in question.
107      A similar issue of a “mental background” was discussed in 
PP v Kwan Cin Cheng
 ([97] 
supra
), where the accused had been subjected to derogatory remarks made by his girlfriend prior to him killing her. However, the Prosecution submitted that unlike in the case of 
PP v Kwan Cin Cheng
, the acts of abuse here did not contribute significantly to the question of whether a reasonable person would have lost his/her control at the material time. The Prosecution added that not only were some of the acts of abuse trivial, but there was also a significantly long cooling-off period between the alleged abuse and the killing, which would have mitigated their effects on the accused’s mind.
108      The Prosecution then dealt with the English Court of Appeal decision of 
R v Ahluwalia
 [1992] 4 All ER 889. In that case, the accused contended, 
inter alia
, that the history of violence and humiliation caused by her husband amounted to provocation and that the trial judge erred in failing to consider that she suffered from a “battered woman syndrome” when she killed her husband. As such, she argued that her conviction for murder should be reduced to manslaughter. In coming to its decision, the court (at 896) held:
We accept that the subjective element in the defence of provocation would not as a matter of law be negatived simply because of the delayed reaction in such cases, provided that there was at the time of the killing a “sudden and temporary loss of self-control” caused by the alleged provocation. However, the longer the delay and the stronger the evidence of deliberation on the part of the defendant, the more likely it will be that the prosecution will negative provocation.
109      The Prosecution then considered the applicability of the accused’s arguments in 
R v Ahluwalia
, and noted several points. First, the tests for provocation in England and Singapore are different. The requirement of suddenness relates not to the provocation but to the loss of self-control. Second, the accused person in 
R v Ahluwalia
 had suffered years of physical and psychological abuse before killing her husband. This abuse was far more serious than that alleged by the accused in the present case. Third, while the court did not dispute that mental characteristics of a person should be taken into account in determining if a reasonable person with the same characteristics would have lost his/her self-control, the court (at 898) found that:
[T]here was no medical or other evidence before the judge and jury, and none even from the appellant, to suggest that she suffered from a post-traumatic stress disorder, or “battered woman syndrome” or any other specific condition which could amount to a “characteristic” as defined in 
R v McGregor
 
[1962] NZLR 1069
.
110      The Prosecution then argued that the same could be said in the present case, as there was no evidence that the accused was labouring under any “battered woman syndrome”. As such, the Prosecution urged that in applying the objective reasonable person test, this factor should not be taken into account.
111      The Prosecution then made submissions relating to the acts of abuse that occurred after the accused, the two children and the deceased had arrived at the office unit after finishing with the errands. The Prosecution argued that although the accused claimed that the deceased told her to eat faeces on three occasions, the deceased did not force her to do so. Further, the accused claimed that she had eaten the baby’s faeces on 28 May 2002 voluntarily, in order to spite the deceased. This act, the Prosecution claimed, depicted a person with resolute will and self-control, rather than a person who had been overwhelmed by grave and sudden provocation.
112      The Prosecution also submitted that the acts involving the deceased pulling the accused’s shirt, making her lose her balance and throwing the computer mouse at her would not be sufficiently grave or sudden to make a reasonable person lose his/her self-control. It was also argued that the same could be said of the allegations that the deceased scolded the accused. Such scolding would not be serious enough to warrant any drastic action by any reasonable person.
113      The Prosecution also asserted that the severity of the injuries inflicted on the deceased suggested that the objective element of the test for provocation had not been satisfied. In 
PP v Kwan Cin Cheng
, it was held that a relevant question to be asked in considering if the objective element was present is whether the degree of loss of self-control is commensurate with the severity of the provocation. The Prosecution argued that if indeed the accused had lost her self-control, the severity of the injuries she had inflicted on the deceased indicated that the degree of loss of self-control far surpassed the severity of the provocation. The Prosecution relied on the words of the Court of Appeal in 
Seah Kok Meng v PP
 ([97] 
supra
) where it was held at [26] that “[a] reasonable person, who was not out to get even, would not, in the circumstances, have gone on to search for some weapon and carry out an assault of this kind”.
114      The Prosecution’s final submission in relation to provocation was that even if it was accepted that the deceased’s alleged acts were sufficient to have provoked the accused, the provocation would clearly have “evaporated” when the accused strangled the deceased until she became limp. The accused could, and should have, left the office or tied the deceased up. In relation to this submission, the Prosecution referred to
 
Lim Chin Chong v PP
 
([99] 
supra
), where it was held at [31]:
Neither, in our view was the provocation, if indeed there was provocation, grave and sudden. … If it did, then the immediate and spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which on our understanding of the appellant’s own evidence immobilised the deceased to such an extent that he was able to leave the room, find the electrical wire and return to tie the deceased up and gag him. On any objective test the provocation of being sodomized had simply evaporated …
115      On these bases, the Prosecution argued that Exception 1 to s 300 PC, the exception of provocation, ought not to apply. The Prosecution then turned to the other exception relied on by the accused, the right of private defence.
Exception 2 – The right of private defence
116      The Prosecution’s argument on this issue was that the right of private defence never arose in favour of the accused, since it was the accused who was the aggressor from the outset, and not the deceased. The Prosecution then relied on Dr Lai’s evidence regarding the defensive injuries on the deceased’s arm, arguing that it was an indication that the deceased was on the defence against the accused’s attacks at all times.
Exception 4 – The defence of sudden fight
117      The Prosecution submitted that contrary to the Defence’s claim, there was no evidence of any sudden quarrel between the deceased, which then erupted into a sudden fight. It was also argued that there were no injuries found on the accused, apart from some burn injuries sustained by the accused, and the three bite marks. This was submitted as an indication that no fight or struggle had taken place involving the accused. The Prosecution also argued that it would have been impossible for the accused not to sustain any injuries, considering the struggle and the knife-fight, all within the confines of a narrow office space. As such, since the sudden fight exception to murder was premised upon the occurrence of a fight to start with, the lack of a fight would make the defence unavailable.
118      Additionally, the Prosecution argued that the amount of injuries found on the deceased’s body, coupled with this lack of injuries on the accused, showed that the accused was the aggressive attacker throughout the incident. In the alternative, the Prosecution argued that even if there was a sudden fight between the two women, the accused had clearly taken undue advantage and acted in a cruel and unusual manner. The Prosecution submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that the deceased was armed, since the accused suffered no knife wounds. This, the Prosecution claimed, was clear evidence that the accused had taken undue advantage of the deceased. In this respect, the Prosecution referred to the case of 
Phua Soy Boon v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 285
, where the Court of Appeal (at 291–292, [31]) held, in relation to the issue of sudden fight:
Even if we were to accept that there was a sudden fight, which we were not inclined to, the fact that the appellant used a sharp chopper against the unarmed deceased showed that he had taken undue advantage of the deceased. There was no evidence that the appellant suffered any injury from the alleged fracas with the deceased, yet he had inflicted, not one, but two gaping wounds on a very vulnerable part of the deceased’s body.
119      The Prosecution then submitted that it was Dr Lau’s evidence that the fatal stab wound to the deceased’s neck was inflicted after the various defensive injuries were caused to her left arm. Therefore, the accused clearly had an “unfair advantage”, to use a phrase adopted by the court in 
Mohamed Kunjo v PP
 ([95] 
supra
) as another meaning of “undue advantage”, when she delivered the fatal stab to the deceased’s neck, as the latter was already severely injured and in a vulnerable state.
120      The Prosecution also submitted that the horrific injuries suffered by the deceased were evidence of an unmistakably savage and cruel attack by the accused. There were no less than ten slash wounds found on the deceased’s left arm alone. The Prosecution posited that these slash wounds were probably inflicted when the deceased raised her arms to fend off the accused’s attacks, which were targeted at the deceased’s head region. This was further evidence of the viciousness of the accused’s attack. As such, the Prosecution submitted that the accused’s arguments in relation to the defence of sudden fight could not succeed.
The decision
121      I considered both the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s arguments in their entirety before arriving at my decision to convict the accused on a lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. My reasons are as follows. From my analysis of the arguments from both sides, three main issues emerged. They were:
(a)        whether the accused’s version of events in relation to how the deceased had died should be accepted;
(b)        whether the accused was guilty of murder under s 300(c) PC; and
(c)        whether the exceptions to s 300 PC applied in favour of the accused.
Issue 1 – The accused’s version of events
122      Much of the difficulty about this case revolved around the fact that apart from the accused’s version of the events of 28 May 2002 from 8.00pm to 10.41pm (“the material time”), no other versions were available. There were no eyewitnesses to what occurred during the material time, and therefore no witnesses to corroborate most parts of the accused’s story.
123      The only witness available to speak of the incident as it was unfolding was Joseph Lefort, and even then, his account was merely with regard to what he had heard, not what he had seen. Nothing conclusive could be arrived at from the shouts of “
jangan, jangan
” that Joseph Lefort heard, although it pointed more strongly to the possibility that they could have been uttered by the accused. Even then, this account did not reveal anything about the 
actual
 events during the material time, only weakly confirming that a fight had occurred. The situation being such, I had to turn to the objective evidence at hand and infer from these facts the most likely account of what happened during the material time.
124      In this respect, the only evidence I could refer to was the pathologist’s report on the post-mortem performed on the deceased’s body. I found Dr Lau’s report of strong evidential value. It was a detailed description of all the injuries suffered by the deceased, and a clear explanation as to her death. After closely scrutinising Dr Lau’s report together with his testimony in court, I accepted his description of the deceased’s injuries as “defensive”, and his finding that the fatal stab wound to the deceased’s neck was not self-inflicted.
125      This therefore neutralised one crucial part of the accused’s version of the events during the material time. This was the part where the accused claimed that it was the deceased who cut her own left hand and stabbed herself in the neck, following threats from the accused. The only persons present at the scene during the material time were the accused, the deceased and the deceased’s two children. As such, apart from the accused, no other person could have inflicted the injuries and the fatal wound on the deceased, considering the nature of these injuries.
126      At this juncture, I noted that the accused had clearly abandoned her initial version of events regarding the 11 persons who had entered the office and turned off the lights, electing to proceed with the version that was under scrutiny at trial. There was then a credibility gap between the accused’s initial and final versions. As the trial proceeded on the basis of the accused’s final version of events only, I found little difficulty in throwing out the accused’s initial version of events. I therefore found the circumstantial evidence in this case to be strong enough to lead me to infer that it was indeed the accused who had inflicted the injuries and the fatal wound on the deceased. I then turned to the implications of this finding on the charge of murder against the accused.
Issue 2 – s 300(c) PC
127      Before I proceeded with my decision on this issue, I would like to make some observations on the state of the law with regard to s 300(c) PC. Recently, I read with interest an article by Stanley Yeo, “Academic Contributions and Judicial Interpretations of Section 300(c) Murder” in 
The Singapore Law Gazette
, April 2004 at p 21. The article discussed several Singapore cases in relation to the interpretation our courts have attributed to s 300(c) PC. I found this article extremely helpful to my own observations on s 300(c) PC.
128      Most recently, our law pertaining to s 300(c) PC has taken a shift in terms of the interpretation that has been given to it. The Court of Appeal in 
Tan Chee Wee v PP
 
[2004] 1 SLR 479
 at [43] held that:
[I]n examining whether s 300(c) has been made out, the court’s approach to 
mens rea
 is only to determine whether the accused had intended to cause the injury that resulted in the victim’s death.
Until recently, the interpretation our courts have attributed to s 300(c) PC has remained very much objective. However, the court in 
Tan Chee Wee v PP
 has taken a step towards a subjective interpretation of the said section. As such, I feel that some comment on the recent state of the law would be merited. I therefore take this opportunity to revisit the local judicial interpretation pertaining to s 300(c), up till the decision in 
Tan Chee Wee v PP
, before coming to my decision.
129      Essentially, much of our jurisprudence pertaining to s 300(c) PC has involved some discussion of the Indian Supreme Court’s decision in 
Virsa Singh v State of Punjab
 ([86] 
supra
). However, not many of our decisions have managed to capture the essence of the test in 
Virsa Singh
. Some of our former decisions have attributed an entirely objective interpretation to s 300(c) PC, interpreting it to mean that once it has been proved that an accused intended to cause some form of bodily injury, the remaining inquiry immediately becomes an objective one of whether the injury in fact inflicted was indeed sufficient to cause death. That being the case, even if an accused intended to inflict only a minor injury, it was sufficient to result in a conviction for murder so long as the injury 
actually inflicted
 was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
130      I found this situation to sit very oddly with the test in 
Virsa Singh
, which takes a different approach to interpreting s 300(c) PC. One need only turn to another Indian Supreme Court decision for a clear explanation of the test in 
Virsa Singh
. In 
Rajwant Singh v State of Kerala
 AIR (53) 1966 SC 1874, it was held at 1878:
As was laid down in 
Virsa Singh v State of Punjab
, … for the application of this clause it must be first established that an injury is caused, next it must be established objectively what the nature of that injury in the ordinary course of nature is. If the injury is found to be sufficient to cause death one test is satisfied. Then it must be proved that there was an 
intention to inflict that very injury and not some other injury
 and that it was not accidental or unintentional. If this is also held against the offender the offence of murder is established. [emphasis added]
From this, it would appear that it was necessary to establish that an accused did not intend any other injury but that very injury that indeed caused the death of the deceased. With this principle in mind, I proceeded to analyse the application of s 300(c) PC on the facts of the present case.
131      I scrutinised the Prosecution’s submissions in relation to the test in 
Virsa Singh
 and found that the Prosecution’s division of the test into four limbs was largely accurate. However, I held that in terms of structure, it would have been more appropriate to lay out the test in this manner:
(a)        show that a bodily injury was present;
(b)        establish objectively the nature of the bodily injury and whether it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; and
(c)        prove that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of bodily injury was intended.
In this way, the objective factual inquiry pertaining to the presence and the nature of the bodily injury (limbs (a) and (b)) is established first as a matter of course, before the subjective legal test as to whether the accused had an intention to inflict that particular injury that indeed caused the death of the deceased is applied. I found that it was important to maintain this clear separation between the two inquiries in order to avoid any confusion between the terms “objective” and “subjective”. The first inquiry is thus an objective forensic inquiry and the second, a judicial one. This then took me to my decision on the main issue, which is whether the accused was guilty of an offence under s 300(c) PC.
132      I had to rely on Dr Lau’s evidence in relation to the factual inquiry encompassed in limbs (a) and (b) of the test I laid out above. I had already accepted Dr Lau’s evidence in relation to the fatal injury found on the deceased’s body. This was the second stab wound that incised the deceased’s right carotid sheath, the middle third of the right common carotid artery, and terminated at an estimated depth of 6cm, resulting in extensive, severe and acute haemorrhage that ultimately caused the death of the deceased. As such, I found that the medical evidence before me clearly showed that there was indeed a bodily injury, the nature of that bodily injury was clear and it was established that this bodily injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. I was therefore convinced that the first two limbs were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.
133      The next inquiry was the judicial one. Here, as mentioned by me earlier, the circumstantial evidence was clear enough for me to infer that it was the accused who had inflicted the injuries on the deceased, including the second fatal stab wound. From the nature of the multiple injuries that had been inflicted on the deceased’s body, it was clear to me that the injuries had not been caused by accident. The inflictor of the injuries must have intended to inflict them. In this regard, I took into consideration Dr Lau’s evidence that the injuries were inflicted with “tremendous force”. Such use of force must have been deliberate.
134      I then turned to consider the two injuries found on the deceased’s neck, one of which was the fatal blow. Taking these injuries, inflicted on a most vulnerable part of the human body, in light of all the other injuries that had been inflicted, it was clear to me that the fatal wound too was not caused by accident.
135      I was convinced that the Prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had intended to inflict the particular neck injury that was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and that had indeed caused the death of the deceased. With this, I moved to the last issue, that of whether the exceptions to s 300 PC raised by the accused were indeed available to the accused.
Issue 3 – The exceptions to s 300 PC
136      As detailed earlier, the Defence relied on three exceptions to s 300 PC, those of provocation, right to private defence and sudden fight. I dealt with each exception in the order in which they were raised.
Provocation
137      I found that the key factor here was the accused’s version of events regarding the acts of alleged abuse committed by the deceased. I had to make a finding of whether these acts of abuse had indeed occurred, and if they did, whether they amounted to provocation within the meaning of Exception 1 to s 300 PC. In a nutshell, the Defence attempted to portray the accused as a maid in an abusive employer-employee relationship, who had completely lost her self-control during the material time, whereas the Prosecution attempted to portray the accused as a calm, methodical killer who was in full control of her senses. In this respect, the Prosecution also made submissions to the effect that the accused was not a credible witness. As such, the Prosecution urged that her accounts of abuse be discredited.
138      I first turned to the Prosecution’s submission that the accused was not a credible witness because she had given two very different versions pertaining to the events of 28 May 2002. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had indeed lied in her initial version of events. The Prosecution urged me to apply the test in 
R v Lucas
 ([91] 
supra
), where it was held that an accused’s false statements out of court could be used at her trial in order to corroborate her guilt. Likewise, it was argued that the accused’s statements out of court must be held against her different version in court, thereby corroborating her guilt. I thoroughly understood the Prosecution’s point. However, what I was being invited to do was to disregard the accused’s final version of events relied upon in court solely on the basis of her false statements out of court.
139      I was unable to accept this contention. On my perusal of the accused’s testimony in court, I found that there was some truth to various aspects of the accused’s version of events. I scrutinised the accused’s version of events in three main parts. First, there were the accounts of abuse. Second, there was the account pertaining to the quarrel and scuffle between the two women (which commenced at the point when the deceased scratched the accused’s face). Finally, there was the account where the accused claimed that the deceased cut her arms and stabbed her neck pursuant to threats by the accused. The objective evidence before me has already led me to a finding that it was the accused who had caused most, if not all, the injuries found on the deceased’s body. Therefore, I rejected the last part of the accused’s version of events.
140      I then scrutinised the first part of the accused’s story pertaining to the abuse she suffered. The Prosecution urged me not to accept the accused’s accounts, arguing that she had falsified them entirely. In this regard, the Prosecution adduced evidence from the husband and some of the deceased’s staff to show that apart from scolding the accused, they did not see the deceased abuse the accused. However, one had to bear in mind that many an act of abuse is usually carried out when no inquisitive eyes are present.
141      I recalled that the Prosecution made an attempt to disclaim each of the accused’s alleged episodes of abuse. For instance, it was argued that even if the accused had eaten the children’s faeces, this could not have been abuse since the deceased did not force the accused to eat the faeces. I felt that it was not necessary to analyse whether each and every incident of abuse actually occurred before I made a finding that the accused was indeed abused 
in general
. I was convinced that the accused was telling the truth with respect to some, if not all, of her accounts of abuse.
142      In this regard, I accepted the accused’s story that the deceased had ordered the accused to eat noodles in the toilet. Here, I noted that the accused’s story was corroborated by the fact that the police had actually discovered the noodles in the toilet. I found that the accused must have felt humiliated by being disallowed to eat on a chair like a normal person, but being made to eat in the toilet instead. Further, I also accepted the accused’s assertions that the deceased had refused to give her food. In this respect, I found that the accused’s assertions were corroborated by the evidence of Rose Ang, to whom the accused had complained of hunger, and of not being fed for a few days. Margaret Low’s evidence also confirmed the accused’s claim that the deceased prevented other people from giving the accused food. These are but a few incidents. In all probability, there might have been more.
143      I then came to the next part of the accused’s version of events pertaining to the scuffle between the two women. I accepted that there had indeed been a struggle between the two women during the material time. In this respect, I referred to Joseph Lefort’s testimony pertaining to what he had heard during the material time. Although his testimony did nothing to reveal what actually happened, it was sufficient to convince me that, at least, a fight had broken out between the two women.
144      I therefore accepted the accused’s version of events pertaining to the abuse she had suffered and the fight between her and the deceased. However, I rejected the part of her story regarding the actual slashing and stabbing of the deceased. At this juncture, I recalled that I was entitled to accept one part of a witness’s story while rejecting another part: 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 15
; 
Ng Kwee Leong v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 942
. This brought me back to the issue of the test in 
R v Lucas
 ([91] 
supra
) raised by the Prosecution. I found that although the accused had lied in her statements out of court, holding these falsified statements against her to corroborate her guilt or to discredit her as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly acceptable portions of her testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate reaction, especially in a trial where the capital punishment was involved. Having found that parts of the accused’s evidence in court were indeed truthful, I declined to make a finding that the accused’s falsified statements out of court corroborated her guilt.
145      I noticed that the Prosecution also argued that in the course of the trial, the accused clarified some of her evidence and was thus inconsistent. For instance, the Prosecution claimed that the accused first mentioned that there was no food in the office for lunch and then later clarified that there was some bread in the office. In my evaluation, the said clarification is not such a significant inconsistency as to undermine the accused’s defence of grave and sudden provocation.
146      I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions pertaining to the law on provocation in Singapore. Essentially, there are two requirements to be met, the first being the subjective requirement that the accused must have been deprived of her self-control by the provocation, and the second being the objective requirement that the provocation must have been grave and sudden.
147      In relation to the first requirement, the crux of the issue was really whether the accused had lost her self-control as a result of the provocation that she had been placed under. In this respect, I noted that the Defence relied on the long series of abuse suffered by the accused and the fight that had occurred between the two women as being the provocation in this case. I had already accepted that on the facts, there was indeed a series of abuse and a fight during the material time. The inquiry into whether this provocation was then “grave and sudden” enough fell within the ambit of the second objective requirement. I will therefore discuss this issue in greater detail later.
148      I encountered some difficulty in relation to the first requirement of a loss of self-control. The accused’s story throughout the trial had been that she had not stabbed the deceased. As such, it became difficult for the accused to turn around with another story saying that she had stabbed the deceased, but had been provoked into doing so. This sort of difficulty is not unexpected in any case where an alternative argument of this kind is submitted. However, having already found that it was the accused who had inflicted the injuries found on the deceased’s body, the only issue that was still left to be determined remained at whether the accused had lost her self-control when she inflicted these injuries. I noted that Dr Lau’s evidence was highly pertinent in this regard. I reproduce, again, the aspects of his evidence that was crucial to my decision on this issue:
There were at least 10 wounds on the deceased’s left forearm. The injuries were arranged in a haphazard manner and their distribution suggest that they were inflicted by downward blocks of a cleaver or chopper with tremendous force to such an extent that the deceased’s left hand was nearly dismembered at the wrist … The distribution and haphazard nature of these injuries would indicate that they were sustained in self-defence and the depth and severity of the injuries would also indicate that a great or large amount of force had been used.
149      The pathologist’s description of the nature of the injuries found on the deceased’s body was chillingly graphic. I found it necessary to repeat his description here. Dr Lau recorded that the deceased’s left forearm, wrist and hand had a series of gaping, and deep incised wounds. The deceased’s muscles, tendons, nerves and blood vessels were cut. There was a fracture of the left wrist joint and near dismemberment of the left hand at the wrist. There were also several incised wounds on the deceased’s right arm and right hand. In particular, Dr Lau noted that deliberate, downward blows directed at the head or neck with tremendous force caused the severe injuries to the deceased’s forearms. The question that then struck me was what could have led the accused to participate in such a bloody attack.
150      The accused appeared to me to be a mild-mannered, soft-spoken person, frail in appearance with a light frame. At the material time, she was also weak with hunger and had been involved in a violent and gruesome encounter with the deceased.
151      From the objective facts before me, I found that to inflict the kind of injuries found on the deceased’s body, the accused had to have been in a frenzy of sorts. She must have been so blind with rage that she lost all control over herself and lashed out repeatedly at the deceased, resulting in the “haphazard” nature of the injuries. The loss of self-control must have also been of such magnitude that she was able to inflict the severe wounds on the deceased “with tremendous force”. This was despite the fact that the accused was probably drained of energy during the material time. I found this to be a strong sign of an enraged attack committed by one who had lost all self-control. I emphasise that this was not a view I arrived at based only on the number of injuries suffered by the deceased. It was an irresistible inference I drew from the nature of the injuries and the surrounding circumstances as well.
152      At this juncture, I wish to make it abundantly clear that it is not the case that in all situations where a deceased has suffered multiple wounds that there will invariably be a finding of a frenzied attack. If this were so, situations of a purely intentional, vicious attack would slip through the cracks and allow an unmeritorious accused the defence of provocation. Everything depends on the facts of each case. On these facts, there was sufficient evidence to show that the accused had indeed lost her self-control due to the lengthy term of provocation she had endured.
153      I then observed that the Prosecution relied on the case of 
Lau Lee Peng v PP
 ([76] 
supra
) and urged me to consider the accused’s behaviour after the material time. The Prosecution submitted that the accused looked calm and in control of herself. It was argued that her actions after the killing were calculated and methodical, depicting a person who was conscious and aware of what she was doing at all times. I was unable to accept this argument. I agreed that the manner in which a person behaved after the commission of an offence is important. However, there is no definite formula in cases of this kind.
154      It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviour 
must
 be observed on the part of an accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her self-control during the time of the killing. Different people react differently in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the actions of the killer post-killing in 
PP v Kwan Cin Cheng
 ([97] 
supra
) differed from the actions of the killer in 
Lau Lee Peng v PP
. Everything depended on the facts of the individual case. A general submission that the calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm throughout the time of the killing was not convincing. I therefore found that the subjective requirement that the accused had lost her self-control as a result of the provocation was satisfied. I then turned to the objective requirement of a “grave and sudden” provocation.
155      The Prosecution argued that the requirement of suddenness, for one, was not satisfied on the facts of this case, as the accounts of abuse occurred long before the events of 28 May 2002. I agreed, in so far as the Defence sought to adduce the entire period of abuse prior to 28 May 2002 as going towards the acts of provocation, that these acts of abuse were too remote in time from the killing to constitute a “sudden” provocation. However, I found that these acts of abuse were still relevant to the question of whether the provocation that was offered was “grave” enough. The Prosecution had itself conceded that the abusive acts could still be relevant to the “mental background” that they created in the accused during the material time.
156      In this regard, I found that these seemingly separate events of abuse linked up with each other like a chain. The effect of each separate event was consistent, 
ie
 the deceased had acted in a manner that humiliated the accused and caused her physical pain. As such, I was able to find that these many separate events were actually closely linked to each other, as they presented an overall picture of an abusive and poor employer-employee relationship. This was extremely relevant to establishing the accused’s “mental background” at the time of the killing. This thus went towards showing whether the events of 28 May 2002 satisfied the requirement of a “grave” provocation.
157      The Prosecution then argued that the events of 28 May 2002 were not so serious as to justify the reaction from the accused. I do not accept this argument. The Prosecution’s contention seemed to ignore the totality of the provocative acts together with the accused’s “mental background”, choosing to focus on the individual events of abuse only. A mild scolding or a nagging from the deceased on one day would not be considered a grave provocation. However, a series of nagging, scolding, insults, humiliation, physical abuse and lack of food over a period of time, culminating in a quick succession of abuse on 28 May 2002, would be sufficiently grave to provoke a reasonable person in the accused’s position.
158      At this juncture, it might perhaps be instructive to refer to the facts and findings of an English case. The appellant in 
R v Roberts
 [2002] EWCA Crim 1069 was a man who had cared for his aunt in her old years. However, his aunt’s response to his care was to nag at him constantly. I found these portions of the findings of the English Court of Appeal at [7]–[15] particularly instructive:
7          … Quite apart from the daily routine, on the occasions when she went to the hairdresser for an appointment, he was responsible for washing her and helping her dress. She claimed that she could not wash her genitalia, and although he found the process profoundly distasteful, he did what was necessary. He would then take her to the hairdresser in a wheelchair, collecting her afterwards and returning her home. On Sundays he would take the lunch prepared by his wife to his aunt’s. She insisted that her food was cut up so that she could use a spoon rather than a knife and fork. When he used one of her knives in order to cut the food, she complained that the food looked like scraps, so he took to bringing a knife from his home for the purpose. Without going into any further detail, the responsibilities for his aunt meant that the appellant had only been on holiday three times in the previous 10 years, and then only for a few days. When he suggested that he might go away, there was always a row in which he was accused of neglecting her. He had taken to altering dates on documents, to pretend that he was attending seminars in connection with his work.
8          None of these essential features of the case was in dispute. Equally, his aunt’s reaction to all this care and devotion was the opposite of kind. She nagged constantly at him, complaining generally about the lack of care, and his inadequacies. The nagging descended into abuse, and sometimes hysteria. We can summarise the effect of the evidence by quoting the language used by the trial judge:
There is ... a vast amount of unchallenged evidence that this old lady was persistently and ungratefully offensive to Mr Roberts, who had been looking after her for years. The evidence you may think indicates that during all this time his response, at worse, had been to shout at her in frustration.
…
11         Events on 7 June 1993 itself can be described shortly. Before leaving for work, the appellant visited his aunt as usual that morning. He set about the chores. Although she normally woke up during this process, on this occasion she did not do so, and he decided to save time, and probable trouble, by leaving her asleep. He went home, changed into his work clothes, and drove to work. He realised that his failure to wake his aunt would be likely to cause trouble when he next returned, so as a distraction, he tried to make arrangements for her to visit a relative. He felt tired at work all day, and as he drove home that evening he kept nodding off. By the time he arrived home he was ‘totally shattered’. He flopped into a chair and, as a ‘tonic’ he had [a] wine glass full of elderberry wine. Mrs Edwards [the aunt] was visited during the day by the community nurse, and a former neighbour. They found her in good form. At about 7.30 pm the community nurse returned and stayed for between 5 – 10 minutes. She noticed that Mrs Edwards was upset about some mail that had arrived during the morning post.
12         At about 8 pm the appellant went, as he saw it, to ‘face the music’ with his aunt. As he anticipated she was annoyed at him for not waking her. She waved a bank statement at him, complaining that she was heavily overdrawn at the bank. An argument developed. It was heard by a neighbour. He told her about the possibility of a trip to a relative. The argument continued. He explained that the bank statement was out-of-date. There had been a recent payment in. The argument turned to money. He reminded her that she was getting more rent from one of her properties because he had intervened to help. She dismissed this, saying he had done nothing to help her. When he insisted that he had, she kept shouting at him ‘no, no, no’, and would not let him get a word in. He lost his temper, put his hand over her mouth shouting at her ‘yes, yes, yes’. He then left her house. He went to the Park Place Hotel, where according to his evidence, he drank two soft drinks and one pint of beer. In the meantime Mrs Edwards telephoned a neighbour in a distressed state. She also telephoned the doctor complaining that she had suffered a heart attack. Such complaints were not unusual. Mrs Duncan, the neighbour, went to see her, remaining until 9.10 pm. The doctor visited her, staying for about 15 minutes. Mrs Duncan returned about 1/2 hour later, staying for another 10 minutes. In the meantime the appellant went to his wife’s home. He said he was distressed about his aunt. He wanted to talk the situation over. Unfortunately there was a row with his wife. He left her house in a temper. He slammed the door. He put his fist through the glass. He hurled a bicycle to one side. He returned to his one address in Mwrog Street. There he drank two half pint tumblers of elderberry wine, and pottered around the house.
13         At about 9.50 pm, he was standing by his own front door, preparing himself and plucking up the courage, as he put it, to go back to his aunt’s house to sort out her food and settle her down for the night. Mrs Duncan saw him standing by his own front door. She thought, from the movements of his hands and general attitude, that he was in a bad mood about something. He said that he did not want to respond to her, because he had already had enough for that night, and still had to face his aunt.
14         He walked over to his aunt’s house. He was carrying a knife, for use in the preparation of her food. It was common ground that there was nothing unusual or significant about him taking a knife with him for this purpose during his evening visits to his aunt. When he arrived at his aunt’s home, and she saw him, she immediately started screaming and shouting at him that he was ‘rotten’. Something inside him snapped. He stabbed her. He could not recall how many times he had stabbed her and indeed he did not really realise what he had done for a little while. When he did, he made a telephone call to the police. At 9.58 pm a telephone call was received in which he admitted that he had killed his aunt at her home. He also telephoned his brother-in-law. At 10.08 two police officers arrived at Mrs Edwards’ house. They found the appellant at the rear living room standing at the foot of a single bed. Mrs Edwards was lying there. He said ‘I’ve killed her, fuck me, there’s the knife, I’ve stabbed her’, and pointed to a telephone table.
15         The appellant was arrested and cautioned. He replied, ‘Yes, okay, I am not going to try to run away otherwise I would not have rung you’. He was escorted out of the room into the front living room. He then became agitated saying, ‘Fuck me, I’ve done it now I am a murderer. I am really in the shit now. I cannot believe I killed her’. On medical examination at the police station, minor superficial injuries were noticed to his right wrist, left hand and left shin, which were consistent with the earlier outburst of bad temper at his wife’s home. …
159      The question before the Court in 
R v Roberts
 pertained to whether the defence of provocation was adequately canvassed before the jury. The court held (at [25]) as follows:
By current standards, provocation was not adequately canvassed before the jury. The issues which arise are not new found. There was a significant body of evidence before the jury, relevant for their consideration on provocation, but confined at trial to diminished responsibility. 
If that evidence, and the further evidence which would have been available to support provocation
 [
in
] 
its full modern ambit had been appreciated, in our judgment there would have been a realistic prospect that the trial jury would not have excluded provocation
. We are troubled by this conviction. We do not think it safe. Accordingly the appeal will be allowed. The conviction for murder will be quashed. A verdict of manslaughter will be substituted. A new trial would serve no useful public interest.
[emphasis added]
Although the question in the present case was different from that in 
R v Roberts
, the similarities in the facts of both cases could not be ignored. In my view, each instance of abuse should not be taken apart and scrutinised separately.
160      I have already established that these individual events of abuse over a period of time went towards forming the “mental background” in the accused at the time when the acts of provocation, 
ie
 the events of 28 May 2002, were offered. In 
R v Roberts
, it was apparent that the incessant nagging of the deceased formed such a “mental background” (although the court in 
R v Roberts
 did not use these very words) in the appellant, so much so that the deceased’s accusation of his being “rotten” caused him to lose his self-control. On a normal occasion void of any “mental background”, the word “rotten” might not have sparked the appellant into a frenzied rage. However, when the word “rotten” is observed alongside the appellant’s “mental background”, it is understandable why that particular word was a sufficiently “grave” provocation.
161      Likewise, in the present case, I found that the instances of abuse added up over a period of time and weighed on the mind of the accused. The accused’s words to the deceased before the scuffle between the two women was an example of the 
total
 effect the separate instances of abuse had on her: “Ma’am why you do to me everyday like that, I very pain.” The question to be asked then was whether a reasonable maid in the position of the accused, that is a maid with this sort of “mental background”, would have been so provoked by the acts of the deceased at the material time. I would have to answer this in the positive. The “mental background” caused by the sustained abuse suffered by the accused generated enough tension, such that the provocative actions of the deceased on 28 May 2002 became sufficiently “grave” the moment they occurred. Therefore, I found that the element of a “grave” provocation was met.
162      I then turned to consider the requirement of “suddenness”. The Prosecution argued that the accused could not be allowed to rely on the events of 28 May 2002, as there had been a significantly long cooling-off period between the alleged abuse the accused suffered on 28 May 2002 and the killing. The Prosecution submitted that this cooling-off period negated the possibility that the acts of provocation were sudden. The Prosecution also submitted that during the scuffle, there were moments when the accused had time apart from the deceased in order to cool down. I disagreed with this argument.
163      I was unable to find that there was a sufficient break in time that provided the accused with a cooling-off period. From the accounts of the events of abuse and fighting on 28 May 2002, up to the point when the deceased was killed, I found that the incidents between the two women were part of an ongoing process. The events were actually contemporaneous and not spaced out, as the Prosecution contended.
164      One of the Prosecution’s main contentions was with regard to the point in time when the accused choked the deceased till she became limp. The Prosecution argued that this was a sufficient break in time for the accused to “cool off”, putting an end to the provocation. I disagreed. I found that the Prosecution failed to consider that after the incident where the accused choked the deceased till she became limp, the deceased had gotten up after a while and kicked the accused, sparking off another series of fights. There was therefore sufficient evidence before me to find that the provocation from the deceased had also continued throughout the material time.
165      The Prosecution’s arguments, while understandable, failed to take into account the fact that the provocation was ongoing on the facts of this case. There were most certainly the odd moments when the accused had a breathing space of a minute or so. However, the deceased would then re-ignite the fight. The “breathing spaces” in between were thus not so significant or lengthy enough to constitute a cooling-off period sufficient to put an end to the provocation. I was therefore able to find that the provocation offered by the deceased was indeed real and present during the material time, thus satisfying the requirement of a “sudden” provocation.
166      Although this would be sufficient to determine the issues pertaining to the exception of provocation, I noted that the Prosecution raised the English Court of Appeal case of 
R v Ahluwalia
 ([108] 
supra
). The Prosecution raised this argument as a pre-emptive one, as the Defence did not raise this case in their arguments. The Prosecution attempted to distinguish this case by arguing that the abuse suffered by the appellant in 
R v Ahluwalia
 was far worse, and over a longer period of time, than by the accused. As such, the Prosecution argued that the principles in 
R v Ahluwalia
 were not helpful to the Defence’s case.
167      The most interesting position in the case of 
R v Ahluwalia
 was in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”, and I noticed that the Prosecution brought most of its arguments in respect of this part of the judgment. However, I found that the Prosecution’s arguments were premature. The accused did not rely on the principles pertaining to the “battered woman syndrome”, found in 
R v Ahluwalia
. If indeed the Defence had raised the case of 
R v Ahluwalia
 in support of an argument that the accused was suffering from the “battered woman syndrome”, I would have in the end dismissed the argument. This was because there was no evidence before me to hold that the accused was indeed suffering from such a depressive condition. In fact, this was the very reason why the appellant in 
R v Ahluwalia
 could not prove to the court that she was suffering from the “battered woman syndrome”.
168      Additionally, I found that the Prosecution’s arguments, that the abuse suffered by the appellant in 
R v Ahluwalia
 was far worse than that suffered by the accused in the present case, led nowhere. At most, this argument assisted the Prosecution in factually distinguishing the case of 
R v Ahluwalia
 from the present case. However, as the Defence itself had not raised 
R v Ahluwalia
 in support of any aspect of its arguments, I found that the Prosecution’s arguments were essentially against a non-issue.
169      As I found that the exception of provocation was indeed available to the accused, I held that the accused was only guilty of the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. As such, the charge of murder had to be reduced accordingly. Although this would have been sufficient to dispose of this case, for the sake of completeness, I must deal briefly with the two other exceptions to s 300 PC that were raised by the accused.
Right of private defence and sudden fight
170      Here, I was in agreement with the Prosecution. The exceptions hardly applied to the accused in this instance. Going by the defensive injuries found on the deceased’s body and the fact that the accused was not harmed, it could not be said that the accused had an extending right of private defence.
171      As for the defence of sudden fight, I found that there had indeed been a fight between the two women that came within the meaning of Exception 4 to s 300 PC. However, I also found that the accused did not meet the proportionality requirement for a successful invocation of the exception.
Conclusion
172      This is an exceptionally tragic case. It is tragic and sad both for the deceased and the accused. The baby has lost his mother and sister. The husband has lost his wife and a daughter. The court heard that the deceased’s family has a strong Christian background and persuasion, and I trust that the abiding faith and the love of the Lord in them will heal their wounds and give them the solace and strength which they much deserve. I must say that I feel their pain and share their sorrow.
173      As for the accused, the situation is no less tragic. She is a frail and helpless-looking woman who came from Indonesia to work as a domestic maid. She came here to eke out a living in order to support herself and members of her family. Now, she faces a grave charge which attracts the death penalty.
174      The question is, why did all of this happen on the fateful evening of 28 May 2002? What went wrong so suddenly that caused the mayhem and the death of two persons? What triggered all of this? Was this a mindless killing carried out by a cold-blooded killer, as was suggested by the Prosecution, or was it an act due to a sudden burst of pent-up feeling and rage, as a result of insults and ill-treatment brought to bear on the accused?
175      In sum, the Prosecution’s case was that the accused wantonly killed her employer and having done it, tried to conceal it by not only lighting a fire to the office where the incident took place, but also endeavouring to fabricate a host of stories to escape the consequences.
176      The accused, who was the only person alive to tell what happened on that day, was found to be wanting in her explanation as to how the injuries seen on the deceased came to be inflicted. Her claim, that after a struggle between them the deceased dealt the mortal blows on herself, cannot possibly be true, having regard to forensic evidence that conclusively proved that the injuries found on the deceased were defensive in nature, and that they could not have been self-inflicted. Available evidence inescapably pointed to the conclusion that it was the accused who had caused the injuries on the deceased, and that it was she who dealt the mortal blows. The question is, why?
177      The story of the accused that she was deprived of food and suffering from hunger, at least on 28 May 2002, received a measure of confirmation from some of the Prosecution’s witnesses. First, Rose Ang, the cleaning lady working for the deceased, said that on the fateful day, around noon, the accused told her that she was hungry and had not eaten for sometime. Rose Ang then gave the accused some biscuits out of pity. Second, Esther Hong, Margaret Low and Nancy Ee, all employees of the victim, confirmed that the deceased was seen scolding the accused for eating spoonfuls of the baby’s food. Third, Margaret Low confirmed that when she offered some fruits to the accused that evening at a handphone shop, the deceased prevented her from doing so.
178      Next, the account of the accused that on the morning of 28 May 2002, she practically had to gulp in a hurry a few mouthfuls of noodles in the kitchen toilet, as she was rushed by the deceased, was corroborated when the police found a plastic container with the remnants of noodles floating in some red coloured liquid in the kitchen toilet of the deceased’s flat. Furthermore, there was also evidence of some serious unhappiness on the part of the deceased towards the accused for many a lapse on the part of the accused, such as not doing her work properly, carrying Crystal in the middle of the night for no reason and allegedly eating the baby’s food. Despite all the lies uttered by the accused to extricate herself from her guilt, there was cogent evidence to conclude that the deceased subjected her to some measure of ill-treatment. However, I must add that I found the accused’s claims that the deceased made her eat faeces to be extravagant. These claims were discounted in the final analysis.
179      Nevertheless, given the simmering tension and a readiness on the part of the deceased to fault and be severe to the maids in her employment where there was any shortcoming or any further deficiency, a reasonable inference was that there was a sudden eruption; the accused, having had enough, lost her self-control and went berserk in fatally attacking the deceased. The nature of the injuries found on the deceased strongly suggested to me that these were the acts of a person possessed of a frenzy and denuded of self-control. In my view, the cord of reason suddenly snapped when the accused could no longer control her emotions and feelings of despair. No doubt, she told many lies to extricate herself from the dilemma she was found to be in. However, the evidence from the prosecution witnesses showed that there were acts on the part of the deceased to bring about the frenzied reaction from the accused, availing her to the defence of grave and sudden provocation.
180      Blackstone in his 
Commentaries on the Laws of England
 (15th Ed, 1809) vol 4, at p 190 says that there are degrees of guilt, which divide the offence of criminal homicide into manslaughter and murder. He further says that “manslaughter arises from the sudden heat of the passions, murder from the wickedness of the heart”. It was not lost on the court that whatever the accused did that day should be juxtaposed with her act of holding on to the baby and saving him from the very fire that she lit. This act clearly evinced to the court that the accused was not an embodiment of wickedness and evil, but a woman of normal emotions who went awry momentarily.
181      In my view, having regard to all the objective facts, notwithstanding the untruths uttered by the accused in court over the injuries, the Defence had proved on a balance of probabilities that Exception 1 to s 300 PC, namely the defence of grave and sudden provocation, applied in this case. This was sufficient to reduce the charge to the lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Consequently, I find the accused guilty of the lesser charge punishable under s 304(a) PC and convict her accordingly. I shall hear counsel on the question of sentence.

Andrew Ang JC:
1          The plaintiff, trading as Niklex Supply Co (“Niklex”), is a creditor of Amrae Benchuan Trading Pte Ltd (“the Company”), now in liquidation, of which the first and second defendants were at all material times the directors and shareholders. The third defendant was an employee of the Company.
2          The gravamen of the claim by the plaintiff is that the business of the Company had been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the Company (in particular the plaintiff or Niklex) in breach of s 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the Act”).
3          Adopting a “blunderbuss approach” in the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff also alleged breaches of ss 157 and 339(3) of the Act and sought to invoke s 409A of the Act. However, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr P Suppiah did not, at any stage of the trial, pursue them. That is just as well; no civil suit can be commenced in respect of a breach of s 339(3) until there has been a conviction for the offence. As for s 157, it merely imposes upon a director a duty at all times to act honestly and to use due diligence in the discharge of his duties. By itself, it confers no rights on a creditor. Although the provisions of s 409A could, in an appropriate case where the court has power under the section to grant an injunction, be invoked to found a claim for damages in respect of a breach of s 157 (or indeed of any other provisions of the Act), the remedy is not available to the plaintiff in this case; the interlocutory injunction taken out by the plaintiff has been discharged by the order of Lai Kew Chai J and this has been upheld despite the plaintiff’s appeal to the Court of Appeal.
4          As set out in the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff’s numerous allegations against the first and second defendants, with a view to proving intent on their part to defraud the Company’s creditors, included the following:
(a)        Although the Company was insolvent from 1999 onwards, the first and second defendants caused the Company to continue trading;
(b)        The first and second defendants paid salaries, bonuses, travelling expenses to themselves and to the third defendant in 2000 and 2001;
(c)        The first and second defendants wrongfully caused the Company to grant loans to themselves and to the third defendant in 2000 and 2001, which loans were never repaid;
(d)        In order to dissipate the Company’s assets, the first and second defendants wrongfully caused the Company to:
(i)         pay $32,067.84 to Axum Marketing Pte Ltd (“Axum”) of which the defendants were shareholders and directors;
(ii)        spend $283,769.31 on advertising and promotion in 2002 when the Company was insolvent;
(iii)       pay $100,000 as reimbursement of petty cash; and
(iv)       pay Concept Gifts Pte Ltd (“Concept Gifts”) $125,000;
(e)        The first and second defendants wrongfully dissipated the Company’s assets in order to put them out of the reach of Niklex by transferring them to allegedly related companies, 
ie
, Amrae Benchuan Sdn Bhd (“Amrae Sdn Bhd”), Amrae Benchuan International Pte Ltd (“Amrae International”), Axum, Concept Gifts, Concept Gifts (M) Sdn Bhd, Edge Point (M) Sdn Bhd and Edge Point (S) Pte Ltd;
(f)         The first and second defendants conspired with the third defendant to make to the third defendant the fraudulent payments described in paras (b) and (c) above.
5          Against the third defendant, the plaintiff’s allegations may be summed up as follows:
(a)        He conspired with, aided and abetted the first and second defendants in the dissipation of the assets of the Company, in particular by his receiving moneys as purported salaries, bonuses and loans;
(b)        He conspired with, aided and abetted the first and second defendants, and was knowingly a party to the fraudulent conduct of the business of the Company to defraud the plaintiff, in particular:
(i)         by the setting up of Amrae Sdn Bhd, Amrae International and Axum and transferring to them goods bought by the Company from the plaintiff without the Company or the plaintiff being paid for the same;
(ii)        by the transferring of goods (bought by the Company from the plaintiff) to Concept Gifts (of which the third defendant was sole proprietor but which was later converted into a private limited company owned by the three defendants) without the Company or the plaintiff being paid for the goods.
6          The defendants were able to show that some of the allegations arose out of the plaintiff’s misinterpretation of accounting entries. For example,
(a)        the loans which the first and second defendants were alleged to have caused the Company to grant to themselves and to the third defendant were in fact payments of outstandings owed by the Company to the defendants in respect of accrued directors’ fees and/or loans made by the defendants to the Company; and
(b)        the $283,769.31 (allegedly spent on advertising and promotion in 2002 when the Company was insolvent) was shown to have been incurred previously, accounting adjustments having been made belatedly in 2002.
Others were explained away with apparent certitude by the defendants. The plaintiff was unable to adduce any evidence to controvert such explanations even if they were not accepted.
7          The payments of salaries, travelling expenses and bonuses were not denied. However, it was shown that the salaries and travelling expenses were substantially the same as for the years since the Company started business. The plaintiff’s witness had said that if it were less, he would not have objected. When pressed, he did not suggest what the lower figure might be. Mr Suppiah intervened to say that it was a point for submission but this was not pursued in closing submissions. Indeed, in closing, Mr Suppiah said:
There are many facts in this case which are not materially relevant and they have been set out in paras 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13(1), (3) and (4) of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim.
When I sought clarification on this, he said that the plaintiff would only be “targeting” the sale of $1,268,983 worth of goods by the Company to Axum. That is set out in para 13(3) of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim in the following terms:
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Defendants together with the 3
rd
 Defendant, incorporated on or about 4.6.2001 a company called Axum Marketing Pte Ltd (Axum) and caused the subject Company to transfer goods bought from the Plaintiff to the said Axum for the purported value of $1,268,983.02. No payments have been made by this Company to the said subject Company.
8          From the evidence, it is clear that the Company had a long course of dealings with David Chan Chon Tuck (“Chan”) and (from October 1994) Niklex, which was at all times represented by Chan. It is common ground that:
(a)        “There was a great deal of trust” between the first and second defendants and Chan;
(b)        During this period of ten years, the Company made regular periodic payments on a running account although invoices were given between three and 24 months after deliveries;
(d)        In all, the Company paid the plaintiff more than $5.2m during this ten-year period;
(d)        Chan/Niklex gave the Company generous credit terms. (Although Chan initially denied this, he did concede that the Company was given credit of $0.5m);
(e)        From 1994, Chan had access to the Company’s profit and loss account and balance sheet to determine his share of profits as a 
de facto
 shareholder as to 50% of the Company’s shares. (However, he said vouchers, invoices and bank statements for the period 1992 to 1998 had not been given to him.)
9          The first defendant’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief gave a fairly detailed account of the deterioration in the relationship between Chan and the first and second defendants from 1998 onwards. In brief:
(a)        Chan demanded an increase of his share in the Company to 60% to which the first and second defendants reluctantly agreed;
(b)        Chan regularly inspected the accounts books in the company’s office and took the Company’s payment vouchers and GST quarterly submissions for review;
(c)        He queried the Company’s expenses, what the Company purchased and the sources of supply;
(d)        The first and second defendants complained of uncompetitive prices and unreliable delivery of goods;
(e)        Chan, by deception, caused the Company to give up, in favour of the plaintiff, the distribution of Preciosa Crystal figurines to certain department stores;
(f)         The first and second defendants feared that Chan’s agenda was ultimately to take away their business by supplying directly to the department stores, the Preciosa Crystal incident being merely a precursor;
(g)        The first and second defendants realised that if they continued to buy from Chan they would not be able to compete in the market. (Since 1997, with major political changes in Czechoslovakia and the privatisation of the Czech factories, any large buyer could buy Bohemia crystalware from factories in the Czech and Slovak Republics at better prices than before. Bohemia crystalware prices fell steadily until 2002 at the earliest);
(h)        Chan insisted nevertheless that they should continue to buy from the plaintiff and that they could gradually pay him for the goods supplied earlier;
(i)         In 1999, when the Company owed the plaintiff about $1.5m, Chan demanded an increase of his stake in the Company to 70% and also asked for a salary. After much negotiation, the parties agreed to the increase to 70% but without a salary for Chan.
10        Then followed the meeting(s) around February 2000 between Chan and the first and second defendants. Chan recalled two meetings (one at McDonald’s at Kallang Place and the other at Cuppage Centre) whereas the first and second defendants recalled only the meeting at Cuppage Centre. Their recollection of what transpired at the meeting(s) also differed in one particular, 
viz
, how the outstandings owed to the plaintiff were to be repaid. Whereas the first and second defendants asserted that it was agreed with Chan that the Company would repay by instalments spread over three years, Chan insisted that he had not agreed. (In his letters of 31 January 2001 and 31 March 2001 to the Company, apart from denying that he had agreed to accept instalment payments, he called upon the Company to make payment of the amounts outstanding.) What is clear though is that the Company made 14 instalment payments aggregating $720,000 from April 2000 to July 2001. According to the first and second defendants, they stopped paying thereafter because (a) there was a dispute as to the amount outstanding; and (b) Chan insisted that he had not agreed to payment by instalments.
11        It is also not in dispute that:
(a)        During the discussion at Cuppage Centre, the first and second defendants proposed to Chan that they be allowed to cancel the December 1999 order and also to return all unsold stock previously bought from the plaintiff if the plaintiff wanted the Company to run down the outstanding debts; and
(b)        This was rejected by Chan.
This December 1999 order turned out to be the last purchase order that the Company made and the goods ordered were delivered sometime in February or March 2000 (or, as the second defendant recalled in his evidence, in March and April 2000).
Fraudulent trading
12        Section 340(1) of the Act provides as follows:
If, in the course of the winding up of a company or in any proceedings against a company, it appears that any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company, may, if it thinks proper to do so, declare that any person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in that manner shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the Court directs.
In order to succeed under this section, the plaintiff will need to prove two elements, 
viz
:
(a)        that the business of the Company has been carried on with intent to defraud the creditors of the Company or of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose; and
(b)        that the defendants were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business in that manner.
“Defraud” and “fraudulent purpose” connote “actual dishonesty involving, according to current notions of fair trading among commercial men, real moral blame”: see

13        In 
Welham v Director of Public Prosecutions
 (“
Welham
’s case”) 
[1961] AC 103
 at 123, Lord Radcliffe said:
Now, I think that there are one or two things that can be said with confidence about the meaning of this word “defraud”. It requires a person as its object: that is, defrauding involves doing something to someone. Although in the nature of things it is almost invariably associated with the obtaining of an advantage for the person who commits the fraud, it is the effect upon the person who is the object of the fraud that ultimately determines its meaning.
Elaborating on this, he approved that part of Buckley J’s 
dicta
 in 
In re London and Globe Finance Corporation, Limited
 
[1903] 1 Ch 728
 at 733 where the learned judge said “to deceive is by falsehood to induce a state of mind; to defraud is by deceit to induce a course of action”. In the same vein, Lord Denning in 
Welham
’s case at 133 said:
“To deceive” here conveys the element of deceit, which induces a state of mind, without the element of fraud, which induces a course of action or inaction.
Thus, in 
R v Grantham
 
[1984] QB 675
 at 683, Lord Lane CJ, in upholding a conviction for fraudulent trading, had this to say:
In the present case it was open to the jury to find, if not inevitable that they would find, that whoever was running this business was intending to deceive or was actually deceiving [the supplier] into believing that he would be paid in 28 days or shortly thereafter, when they knew perfectly well that there was no hope of that coming about. 
He was plainly induced thereby to deliver further potatoes on credit
. The potential or inevitable detriment to him is obvious. [emphasis added]
14        The mere preference of one creditor over another will not suffice. Thus in 
In re Sarflax Ltd
 
[1979] Ch 592
, the directors of a company who knew or had reason to suspect that the company would not be able to pay all creditors in full, did not have an “intention to defraud” merely by their preference of one creditor over another. The facts of the case are of some interest and I take the liberty of adopting the summary thereof in the headnotes:
In 1966 the company entered into a contract governed by the law of Italy, to supply to an Italian company, SAFE, a particular type of press. When delivered the press did not work satisfactorily, and a dispute arose between the parties. In October 1970 SAFE started proceedings in the Queen’s Bench Division claiming some £80,000 damages, but these proceedings were allowed to lapse after the company had entered an appearance under protest and the question of jurisdiction was not determined. In October 1971 SAFE commenced proceedings for damages in the Italian courts at Turin. The company took no part in these proceedings and judgment was entered against it in November 1973 in the sum of 120,465,690 lire, ie, about £86,000. In the meantime, the company, pursuant to a resolution passed in January 1971, had ceased to trade as from the close of business on April 30, 1971. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of F Ltd to which it had become substantially indebted. When the company ceased trading its fixed assets, stock-in-trade and work in progress were sold to F Ltd at book value, the price paid by F Ltd being set off against the company’s indebtedness to F Ltd. There was no suggestion that the price paid was other than a proper one or that the company’s indebtedness to the parent company was otherwise than bona fide incurred in the course of trade. Over the next two years the remaining assets of the company were got in and applied in discharging the company’s established debts, but without taking account of the pending claim by SAFE. On September 23, 1973, a resolution was passed for a voluntary winding up and the applicant was appointed liquidator. After receipt of the judgment of the Italian court, the liquidator admitted SAFE’s proof of debt in the liquidation.
By a summons, dated November 12, 1975, under section 332(1) of the Companies Act 1948 the liquidator sought a declaration that from January 13, 1971, to September 7, 1973, business had been carried on with intent to defraud creditors and in particular SAFE in that F Ltd, well knowing that the company was unable to pay its debts in full caused the assets of the company to be distributed amongst creditors other than SAFE to the intent that such creditors should be preferred to SAFE. Two persons who were formerly directors and principal shareholders both of the company and of F Ltd were made respondents to the summons.
It was held, 
inter alia
, that when the only allegation was the bare fact of preferring one creditor over another, it was impossible to hold that such preference 
per se
 constituted fraud within the meaning of s 332 of the UK Companies Act 1948 (c 38) (the progenitor of s 340(1) of our Companies Act). Counsel for the liquidator had argued that whatever might be the position regarding other creditors, the preference of the debt due to the parent was on a different footing. Oliver J, however, held that the preference of the parent was no different from the preference which occurred in 
In re Lloyd’s Furniture Palace, Limited
 
[1925] Ch 853
 where the preferred creditor was himself a director and shareholder and indeed the promoter of the company. (Nevertheless, Oliver J did leave open the question whether there might be circumstances of a very peculiar nature involving preferential payments from which the intention required by s 332 could be inferred.)
15        Coming now to the present case, what are the facts which could point to an intention to defraud? Over the years the Company had purchased goods from the plaintiff on a running account under which credit was given to the Company. The last purchase order was in December 1999. The first and second defendants had tried to cancel the purchase order but Chan had refused to allow it. Neither did he accept their offer to return goods so as to reduce the outstanding amount owed to the plaintiff. Up to the time of delivery of the goods purchased under the last purchase order, the Company had remained solvent if only because the plaintiff allowed the running account to continue.
16        Although Chan had alleged in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the Company had been insolvent since 1999, he conceded under cross-examination that the Company was not insolvent for the financial years ending 31 March 1998, 1999 and 2000 as there was an excess of assets over liabilities in respect of each of the years. He further agreed that Niklex was practically the sole creditor and that, if at anytime during the three years Niklex had demanded payment in full, the Company would not have been able to pay promptly. Nevertheless, until such time that the plaintiff made a demand for the moneys owing and the Company failed to pay, it could not be said that the Company was insolvent: 
Re Great Eastern Hotel (Pte) Ltd
 
[1988] SLR 841
.
17        There is no evidence to suggest that at the time they obtained goods from the plaintiff, the first and second defendants had any intention that the plaintiff should not be paid or that they had no reasonable expectation of eventually being able to pay for the goods. Any suggestion of dishonesty is immediately and effectively met with the riposte that the first and second defendants had offered to cancel their last purchase order and to return to the plaintiff goods as yet unsold which they had previously bought from the plaintiff. Besides, over the years, they had paid the plaintiff more than $5.2m for the goods they had purchased. Even after the parting of ways following the Cuppage Centre meeting in February 2000, they had paid $720,000 to the plaintiff by instalments stretching from April 2000 to July 2001. It also emerged that some of the money with which the Company paid the instalments came from loans made to the Company by the defendants. Whether or not one believes their reasons for discontinuing payment thereafter (and I should add that I did not find the reasons convincing), the fact remains that there is no evidence to justify a finding of intent to defraud when the Company obtained goods from the plaintiff.
18        I move on to events after the parting of ways following the Cuppage Centre meeting. The plaintiff alleged, though not in so many words, that:
(a)        with intent to defraud the plaintiff, the first and second defendants wrongfully transferred to Axum the Company’s assets in order to put them out of reach of the plaintiff; and
(b)        the third defendant conspired with and aided and abetted the first and second defendants in the wrongdoing.
19        Axum was bought as a shelf company by the defendants in June 2001 and started trading in July 2001. The first and second defendants explained that the setting up of Amrae International and Axum was a way of resolving differences that had arisen between the first and second defendants as to the running of the Company. The solution found was that although they (together with the third defendant) would be shareholders and directors in the two companies, the first defendant would be responsible for the running of Amrae International (which would concentrate on the export market) while the second defendant would run Axum (which would concentrate on the domestic market). Under cross-examination, the first defendant also offered this explanation when he was asked why it was necessary to form Axum:
We had a sort of “partnership” with David Chan and Niklex had asked for full payment from Amrae. So we felt that he would wind up Amrae. In order to survive and also to meet all our obligations, we would have to have another vehicle to trade.
20        Although the second defendant did not agree with the first defendant that they were afraid the plaintiff would wind up the Company, he confirmed that a new vehicle was needed to obtain goods from new suppliers at cheaper prices and thereby earn better profits from which they would be able to pay off all debts eventually.
21        Between July 2001 and June 2002, the Company sold Axum goods worth $1,268,983.02 on credit under a running account. Both the first and second defendants denied that the goods of the Company were moved out to Axum in order to defeat the plaintiff’s claims and insisted that Axum bought the goods at arm’s length prices. In para 20 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the second defendant stated that 99% of the goods that Axum bought from the Company were at prices at least 10% higher than what the Company paid for them. This was not challenged by the plaintiff. The Company gave Axum credit notes in the amount of $114,246.73 for goods returned to the Company. Axum paid a total of $713,831.38 to the Company.
22        Therefore the plaintiff’s allegation that the goods were sold by the Company to Axum for no payment was untrue. It is true though that none of the $712,831.38 received by the Company was paid over to the plaintiff. This, despite the second defendant’s evidence that in setting up Axum, the first and second defendants were intending to pay off the outstandings owed to the plaintiff. What happened to the money then? In answer to this question by Mr Suppiah, the first defendant answered:
There were a lot of moneys loaned to Amrae by Concept Gifts, second defendant, third defendant and myself. We took money out from Amrae to invest in Axum (actually loaned to Axum) so that we could trade profitably and thereby repay plaintiff.
23        The Company could have used the money to keep up instalment payments to the plaintiff but did not. I am not persuaded by the first and second defendants’ reasons for stopping the instalment payments. In my view, at the time these repayments of loans were made, the Company was already insolvent, the plaintiff’s demand of 31 January 2001 not having been met. A case could well be made out for saying that in making these and other payments (such as the payment of directors’ fees accrued from previous years) the company was unfairly preferring the defendants over the plaintiff. In many instances, as shown in the defendants’ document marked “DD-3”, moneys paid by the Company to the defendants were channelled (by way of loan or otherwise) into Axum which then paid the moneys the same day, or shortly thereafter, over to the Company to run down the outstandings owed by Axum to the Company. The moneys simply went one full circle. However strongly suggestive of unfair preference they may be, the facts are insufficient, in my view, to warrant a finding that the defendants are liable for fraudulent trading under s 340(1). Harking back to the judicial pronouncements in 
Welham’s
 case ([13] 
supra
) as to the meaning of “defraud”, it is difficult to see what course of action or inaction on the plaintiff’s part such preference was intended to induce.
24        There was nothing in the evidence to bring this case within the penumbral region alluded to by Oliver J in 
In re Sarflax Ltd
 ([14] 
supra
), where preference in very peculiar circumstances might permit an inference of an intention to defraud.
25        Similarly, Chan’s allegation that the first and second defendants conspired with the third defendant was not made out. No evidence of any conspiratorial agreement or arrangement was adduced. It was held in 
Seagate Technology Pte Ltd v Goh Han Kim
 
[1995] 1 SLR 17
 that the essence of a conspiracy is an agreement and that there has to be proof of the existence of an agreement or, at least, an arrangement between the alleged conspirators to defraud. It was further held that a high degree of proof is required. In the present case, there was nothing more than a bare allegation. This will not suffice.
26        At this juncture I should add a few remarks regarding the expert evidence of Lau Kau Chin. I regret to say that I found his evidence to be of no assistance to the court. His affidavit of evidence-in-chief of 17 May 2004 and supplementary affidavit of evidence-in-chief of 29 August 2004 did not comply with O 40A r 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed). No written report was furnished and, accordingly, there was no statement that he understood that in giving his report, his duty was to the court and that he complied with that duty. Indeed, it seemed clear to me that his affidavit of evidence-in-chief of 17 May 2004 was little more than a regurgitation of the plaintiff’s case. Paragraph after paragraph of the expert’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief merely repeated the averments of the plaintiff in the statement of claim. Although a “corrective affidavit” was later sworn on 30 August 2003 seeking to remedy the omission of the said statement prescribed by O 40A r 3(2)(h), this did nothing to allay the court’s fears. His evidence being so obviously partisan, no later affidavit could cure the defect.
27        Accordingly, 
albeit
 with some regret, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim. It is still open to the plaintiff to request the Official Receiver (or any other liquidator appointed in his stead) to consider instituting proceedings against any creditors who may have been unfairly preferred for the recovery of moneys paid by the Company. I am unable to say more as the question whether or not there had been unfair preference was not before me.

Tay Yong Kwang J:
1          The plaintiff, a lawyer, is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (“SIAS”). SIAS is a non-profit organisation that is actively involved in the promotion of investor education, corporate transparency and corporate governance. It also serves as a watchdog for investor rights in Singapore.
2          The defendant is a director with a shareholding interest in 98 Holdings Pte Ltd (“98 Holdings”), which owns or controls some 51.23% of the share capital of NatSteel Ltd (“NatSteel”). On 25 January 2003, he was appointed a director of NatSteel and has acted at all material times as the nominee of 98 Holdings on the board of directors of NatSteel.
3          NatSteel is a Singapore-incorporated company listed on the Singapore Exchange. The NatSteel group is principally in the steel and industrial business. During the latter half of 2002 and up to January 2003, NatSteel was the subject of one of the most highly publicised corporate take-over battles in Singapore.
The plaintiff’s case
4          The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for damages suffered as a result of the publication of certain words uttered by the defendant in both the print and on-line editions of 
The Business Times
 (“BT”) on 4 June 2003. The allegedly defamatory words were:
Mr Ban, however, feels that Mr Gerald is “playing to the gallery.”
The above words were part of an article entitled “No Resolution in Sight for NatSteel–Oei Stalemate” written by Catherine Ong. The full text of the article is repeated below:
No compromise between NatSteel and tycoon Oei Hong Leong appears in sight as shareholders gather today for a second time to approve payment of a cash dividend and the right to scrip dividends in the future.
David Ban, a NatSteel director representing hotelier Ong Beng Seng’s interests, told BT that attempts by the company’s legal counsel, Allen & Gledhill, to sound out Mr Oei’s intentions have come to naught.
“He’s playing his card close to his chest.  His lawyer said the client is away,” Mr Ban said of Mr Oei.
NatSteel wasn’t the only party who couldn’t contact Mr Oei.  David Gerald, president of the Securities Investors Association of Singapore (Sias), said yesterday he failed to arrange a meeting between Mr Oei and NatSteel’s board.
Mr Oei is out of town, an Sias statement said.  “Up to now, it appears that minority shareholders are inclined to vote against all resolutions currently on the table.”
Minority shareholders, Sias added, are “outraged” that despite an assurance by the NatSteel board at the last annual general meeting that shareholders could expect dividends of $1 a share, only 45 cents has been paid.
“NatSteel is now employing a new stance when paying the balance of the remaining one dollar … Sias calls on NatSteel board to severe [
sic
] the linkage (between the resolution to amend the M&A (memorandum and articles of association) and the resolution to pay the balance of 55 cents) and keep its promise to its shareholders,” the Sias statement added.
Mr Ban, however, feels that Mr Gerald is “playing to the gallery”.
“What you have here is the obstructive action of a minority shareholder that is disadvantaging the majority, including 98 Holdings.  It is not oppression by the majority but the minority.  Everyone including 98 wants the dividends.  If shareholders don’t get their dividends, they should be blaming him.”
Mr Oei owns 29.9 per cent of NatSteel – above the crucial 25 per cent veto power over special resolutions including the amendment of the company’s M&A to allow for future share buy-back and scrip dividend.
He is unhappy that the board has tied the passage of a resolution to pay some $200 million in cash dividends to the M&A resolution.  He is also opposed to giving the company a share buy-back mandate.
Observers believe that NatSteel board has made the payment of dividend conditional on the passage of the resolution to amend the M&A because it wants to be sure of securing Mr Oei’s vote on the latter. 
NatSteel has said the M&A changes are necessary to bring its M&A in line with recent changes to listing rules and, more importantly, to provide flexibility in future capital management.
To allay Mr Oei’s concerns that any future scrip dividend could dilute his interest in the company, 98 proposed at last week’s extraordinary general meeting an amendment to white-wash – that is, to waive shareholders’ right to a general offer from Mr Oei should the scrip dividend result in his stake hitting the 30 per cent mark that triggers a mandatory offer.
Mr Ban said Mr Oei’s opposition isn’t rational.  “He has made public the issue of dilution and we’ve addressed that with the white-wash, and we’ve asked him many, many times what are the other issues.”
Mr Oei wasn’t available for comment yesterday.
I have highlighted the alleged defamatory words in the above article.
5          The plaintiff alleged, in para 21 of his Statement of Claim:
that the said words …, in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and were understood to mean that the Plaintiff, in commenting on the continuing opposition by the minority shareholders of NatSteel to the proposed resolutions by NatSteel for the payment of a cash dividend and for the issue of scrip dividends in future:
(a)        was not discharging his duties as the CEO/President of SIAS in an unbiased, impartial and objective manner in supporting the opposition by the minority shareholders of NatSteel to the proposed resolutions;
(b)        had caused SIAS to support the said opposition by the minority shareholders of NatSteel for the dominant purpose of appeasing and gratifying the minority shareholders and/or the public;
(c)        had caused SIAS to support the said opposition by the minority shareholders of NatSteel for the dominant purpose of displaying showmanship, and/or of enhancing his personal popularity and reputation amongst the minority shareholders and/or the public;
(d)        had caused SIAS to take a position without impartially, seriously and diligently assessing the merits of that position; and
(e)        had not acted professionally, credibly and properly as the CEO/President of SIAS in causing SIAS to issue the said statement.
6          The plaintiff claimed that the words in issue caused him considerable distress and injured his dignity, character and reputation. By a letter of demand dated 25 August 2003 from his solicitors to the defendant, the plaintiff demanded that the defendant retract the allegedly defamatory statement made in the BT article, apologise and pay him damages and legal costs. The defendant’s solicitors replied, rejecting the plaintiff’s contentions and demands as baseless. The defendant’s failure to retract the statement and to apologise, the plaintiff claimed, increased the hurt to his feelings and aggravated the injury done to him.
7          I now highlight the matters raised by the plaintiff in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief and the events that led to the publication of the BT article of 4 June 2003.
8          In June 1999, the plaintiff founded SIAS in response to the freezing of the Central Limit Order Book (“CLOB”) shares by the Malaysian authorities in September 1998. Some 49,800 Singaporeans who held CLOB shares joined SIAS to support his cause to free the CLOB shares. After nine months of active negotiations, he believed his “initiative and leadership” facilitated the final settlement which led to the release of the shares.
9          After resolving the CLOB issue, SIAS continued to play an active role in standing up and speaking out for the rights and interests of minority shareholders. It was instrumental in resolving many high-profile corporate governance and transparency issues relating to listed companies. The plaintiff gave seven examples of such and produced the newspaper reports on those cases. SIAS’s membership has now increased to about 63,000.
10        The plaintiff said he was accorded widespread recognition and that he gained a strong reputation both in Singapore and in the region for being a champion of minority shareholders’ rights. He reproduced extracts from articles about him appearing over the last five years in the English newspapers in Singapore, 
Forbes Global Magazine
, 
Far Eastern Economic Review
, 
The Edge
 and the 
CFO Asia Magazine
. These described him as “a confident and fearless fighter” who “no longer minces his words”, “an activist who’s willing to ‘walk the talk’ ”, “a former lawyer with an unflappable demeanour” who “also has the aggressive cross-examining technique of a star prosecutor”, “the face of shareholder activism in Singapore” who “has been on the cover of international magazines like Forbes and CFO Asia and has appeared on CNN and BBC”, someone whom retail investors loved and who “vowed to become a permanent watchdog to keep corporate malfeasance in check”. The publications also referred to him as “a gadfly with an eagle eye for corporate hanky-panky”, someone who “is such a power in the stock market that he is often given the royal treatment companies normally reserved for major fund managers such as Templeton’s Mark Mobius” and who had proclaimed, “We will not be bullied. If a company doesn’t back down, we will sue” and “I got fire in my belly”.
11        In addition to those publications, the plaintiff said his work was also recognised by the broadcast media such as Channel News Asia, CNBC Asia Pacific and News Radio 93.8, which had requested him to appear on their programmes.
12        Being the President and Chief Executive Officer of SIAS, he followed the developments in the take-over battle in respect of NatSteel as reported in the media. In October 2002, 98 Holdings announced a voluntary conditional cash offer for NatSteel shares at $1.93 per share. That price was increased several times by 98 Holdings to finally reach $2.06 and the closing date of the offer was also extended several times to, ultimately, 24 January 2003.
13        During the period of the take-over battle, NatSteel issued circulars to its shareholders which contained the advice of its independent financial adviser and the recommendations of the independent directors. The principal recommendation was for the shareholders to accept the offer by 98 Holdings.
14        One of the largest minority shareholders was Sanion Pte Ltd (“Sanion”), a company controlled by Oei Hong Leong, a well-known businessman. Sanion progressively increased its shareholding in NatSteel during the take-over saga to just below 30%. Sanion did not accept any of the offers by 98 Holdings.
15        On 10 January 2003, 98 Holdings obtained enough acceptances to bring its shareholding in NatSteel to above 50%. Its offer thus became unconditional and it was extended for a final two weeks to 24 January 2003.
16        In the meantime, the plaintiff read an article by Lee Han Shih entitled “Latest NatSteel Results Crucial” in the BT of 1 January 2003 which pointed out that NatSteel’s results for the third quarter of 2002, which had not been disclosed at that stage, would be much better than many had expected. The article also noted that NatSteel had some $600m in its coffers and that the release of the results would enable the shareholders to make a better judgment on the value of their shares.
17        The plaintiff agreed with the views of the writer. On 7 January 2003, SIAS therefore wrote to the President of NatSteel, Ang Kong Hua, calling for the release of the results for the last two quarters of 2002 to help minority shareholders better decide on the appropriate action to take at that critical juncture of the take-over offer by 98 Holdings. SIAS also asked why NatSteel had failed to apply in time to the Ministry of Trade and Industry for an extension of certain anti-dumping orders of steel bars from Malaysia and Turkey with the consequence that the said Ministry turned down NatSteel’s application. According to NatSteel’s announcement of 23 December 2002, such failure to obtain an extension was expected to have an adverse impact on the prospects of the NatSteel group’s steel business in Singapore.
18        On 8 January 2003, NatSteel replied to SIAS stating that its board was not aware of any material developments which would have necessitated further revisions to a Revised Statement of Prospects on the projected financial results of the NatSteel group for the second half of 2002, which had been issued as part of its circular dated 6 November 2002. NatSteel’s reply was released to the public and was reported in the BT.
19        The plaintiff believed that he had caused embarrassment to the board of NatSteel by questioning whether proper disclosure was being made by the said board. This incident, he alleged, formed part of the series of events which led to the defendant’s malice and ill will towards him.
20        On 14 January 2003, the plaintiff assured Oei Hong Leong at a lunch meeting that SIAS was happy to champion issues relating to minority shareholders’ rights. Oei Hong Leong joined SIAS at that meeting. The next day, Sanion issued a press release stating that it was a “stayer” and did not intend to accept the offer by 98 Holdings notwithstanding that it had become unconditional. Sanion further stated that it was encouraged by the plaintiff’s assurance and that this contributed to its decision to reject the offer by 98 Holdings. These events were reported in the press.
21        The plaintiff believed that the extensive media coverage of the take-over battle and the keen rivalry between NatSteel and 98 Holdings on the one hand and Sanion on the other caused some of the unhappiness generated thereby to spill onto him. Although he took a neutral position in the saga, he believed that the defendant could have been under the impression that he was taking sides with Sanion in trying to thwart the bid by 98 Holdings and that this contributed to the malice and ill will that the defendant felt towards him.
22        On 16 March 2003, after 98 Holdings had become the controlling shareholder of NatSteel, NatSteel announced its full year results for 2002. The board decided to recommend a total dividend payment amounting to $1 per NatSteel share, comprising a final dividend of $0.55 for 2002 and an interim payment of $0.45 for 2003.
23        On 2 May 2003, the NatSteel board issued a circular to the shareholders to convene an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) on 28 May 2003 to pass resolutions to approve the following:
(a)        the payment of a special dividend of $0.55 per share (“the special dividend resolution”), contingent upon the passing of the resolution in (b) below and a resolution relating to the provision of financial assistance;
(b)        amendments to the memorandum and articles of association of NatSteel (“the M & A resolution”); and
(c)        a scrip dividend scheme under which shareholders could elect to receive future dividends in shares instead of cash (“the scrip dividend resolution”), contingent upon the passing of the M & A resolution.
24        The special dividend resolution and the scrip dividend resolution were ordinary resolutions which could be passed by a simple majority of shareholders. The M & A resolution was a special resolution which could only be passed if at least 75% of the votes were in favour. Sanion was therefore in a position to block the M & A resolution as it held almost 30% of the shares in NatSteel.
25        The plaintiff and SIAS were alerted to the proposed resolutions by several members of SIAS who were shareholders of NatSteel. The shareholders included retirees who depended on the dividends for their livelihood and who therefore regarded the dividends to be of paramount importance. Upon studying the proposed resolutions, the plaintiff noted that none of the proposed amendments under the M & A resolution was necessary for the purpose of the special dividend resolution. The scrip dividend scheme was not intended to apply to the special dividend to be paid but was meant for future dividends. There was therefore no good reason to link the special dividend resolution to the approval of the scrip dividend resolution and the M & A resolution. The plaintiff was concerned that the minority shareholders were being pressurised to vote for the other resolutions if they wanted the special dividend to be paid to them. Further, if Sanion voted against the M & A resolution, there would be no special dividend as a consequence.
26        Accordingly, the plaintiff wrote to the NatSteel board on 14 May 2003 to express SIAS’s concerns as to the implications of the “unnecessary linkage between the resolutions” on the minority shareholders of NatSteel. SIAS suggested that the linkage be removed.
27        On 19 May 2003, the NatSteel board released an announcement seeking to justify the linkage by citing the uncertain economic outlook and stating that it was important for NatSteel to ensure it had a healthy cash position and strong cashflow to fund the continuing growth of its businesses and investments and its working capital and capital expenditure requirements. The board also stated that it took into account the above considerations as well as the impact of the special dividend on NatSteel’s resources and that it was in the interests of the company to have the flexibility to raise capital efficiently and to retain cash. It therefore proposed the amendments via the M & A resolution to facilitate capital raising through the issue of convertible instruments and to retain cash by allowing shareholders to elect for scrip in lieu of cash dividends. It reiterated its view that the resolutions proposed were in the interests of the company and its shareholders and recommended that the shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions.
28        Not convinced by the board’s explanation, the plaintiff decided to make public SIAS’s opinion on the purported rationale for the linkage of the resolutions. That same day, he issued a press statement in his capacity as President and Chief Executive Officer of SIAS as he wanted the concerns of the minority shareholders to be adequately considered and addressed by the board.
29        The press statement claimed that the board had failed to justify the linkage of the resolutions and that its reasons were difficult to understand. SIAS reiterated its call to the board to de-link the resolutions as the exercise was doomed to failure, since it was clear by then that Sanion would not support the resolutions. SIAS stated that the linkage only gave rise to unnecessary controversy and prejudiced the minority shareholders’ expectation for the special dividend payment.
30        On 22 May 2003, Sanion issued a press release asking that the linkage of the resolutions be removed. It stated that it would vote against the scrip dividend resolution and the M & A resolution and would take steps to convene another EGM to seek approval for the payment of the special dividend without any condition.
31        On 26 May 2003, the plaintiff requested Ang Kong Hua, the President and Chief Executive Officer of NatSteel, by e-mail to allow three of SIAS’s committee members to attend the EGM as observers. Ang Kong Hua replied the same day granting the request and welcoming SIAS to attend the EGM.
32        On 28 May 2003, NatSteel held its EGM. The plaintiff attended as an observer in order to hear personally the development of events. If appropriate, he was prepared to make his opinion known and to persuade the NatSteel board to remove the linkage of the resolutions. He was shown to a seat in the front row on the right side of the meeting hall. The defendant also attended the EGM as a member of the board.
33        When the EGM began, the representative of 98 Holdings proposed amendments to the resolutions by introducing a “whitewash” solution to try to address Sanion’s concerns about the potential dilution of its shareholding. We need not be concerned about the detailed working of this proposed “whitewash” solution in this trial. Sanion’s representative objected to the amendments, contending that they were being proposed at the last minute and that Sanion needed to take legal advice on the amendments. The EGM became boisterous and the chairman did not appear to be able to control the proceedings. Shareholders were angry and were shouting at the board members. Several of the shareholders were shouting angrily that they were being cheated of their dividends. Some were calling for the de-linking of the resolutions.
34        The plaintiff then spoke to the chairman from where he was seated to offer some suggestions as to what to do as he felt that the chairman was losing control of the proceedings. When the chairman looked in the plaintiff’s direction, the latter pointed to the microphone and gestured to the former whether he wanted the plaintiff to speak. The chairman nodded. The plaintiff then went up to the microphone to speak as an observer.
35        He thanked the chairman for the opportunity to speak and advised the shareholders that they should not be questioning the board on why it was putting up the resolutions or blaming the board for having done so as it was merely carrying out the request of the majority shareholder. He stated that it did not matter to the small investors whether 98 Holdings or Sanion had their own agenda. What mattered to them was that they would get the dividend. He then suggested that one of the small investors propose that the link be removed and stated SIAS’s objection to the linkage of the resolutions. He further noted that the board had not accepted SIAS’s position and commented that “when elephants fight, the ants get trampled”. He asked the shareholders not to complicate the issue as the question was whether they should be voting for the resolutions. He then asked them whether they wanted the dividends and they responded with a resounding “yes”.
36        As the EGM was getting more disorderly, the plaintiff reminded the shareholders to conduct themselves with decorum. He then stated that the special dividend resolution should not be linked to the other resolutions as there was no legal requirement mandating such. He then asked the shareholders whether he was right in saying that that was what they were angry about and they responded with an emphatic “yes”.
37        The board then suggested that the EGM be adjourned so that the representative from Sanion could take instructions and seek legal advice. The representative agreed with the proposal to adjourn the EGM. There was then an exchange between him and the board on the length of the adjournment. At this juncture, the plaintiff stated that SIAS would be happy to invite both Sanion and 98 Holdings to SIAS’s office to discuss the matter. The shareholders applauded his proposal. The EGM was then adjourned for a week.
38        On 30 May 2003, the plaintiff sent an e-mail to Ang Kong Hua of NatSteel to ask if they could explore a solution together. He got a reply on 1 June 2003 saying that Ang Kong Hua was busy the next day but would contact him. On 2 June 2003, the plaintiff followed up with another e-mail to ask if the board was keen to meet him. Subsequently, he spoke to Ang Kong Hua over the telephone and was told that the board could not accommodate such a meeting as there were legal issues involved.
39        The plaintiff did not attend the adjourned EGM on 4 June 2003 as he had other commitments. One of the officials of SIAS attended as an observer. None of the resolutions proposed was approved at that EGM.
40        On 31 July 2003, another EGM was held by NatSteel. This EGM was requisitioned by 98 Holdings. This time, the special dividend resolution was not linked to the other proposed resolutions and it was passed.
41        Reverting to the BT article of 4 June 2003 which appeared on the day of the adjourned EGM, the plaintiff stated that the article quoted a SIAS statement which was communicated by him orally and spontaneously over the telephone to Catherine Ong, the writer of the article in issue. It was not a prepared statement. In response to the statement, the article quoted the defendant’s allegedly offending words uttered in respect of the statement.
42        The plaintiff claimed that the words in issue were “especially hurtful towards my reputation and character in view of my role as a public figure who receives widespread and constant coverage and exposure in the local and regional press and broadcast media”. He claimed that the words also had an adverse effect on the integrity of his office in SIAS, undermining his ability to negotiate with companies, in particular, his ability to champion minority shareholders’ rights with the boards of public listed companies. Some SIAS members felt so outraged by the words against him that they urged him to take legal action against the defendant.
43        The plaintiff claimed that the defendant knew his words would be published in the BT and would therefore reach a wide audience here and in the region. He alleged that the words were “published at a time calculated to cause the most damage to my reputation” as the BT article appeared in the very morning of the day on which the adjourned EGM was to be held. Some, if not most, of the NatSteel shareholders would read the BT before attending the adjourned EGM at 2.00pm. The defendant’s words were intended to attack the plaintiff’s integrity and character for the ulterior motive of influencing the minority shareholders to disregard the position taken by SIAS and the plaintiff. This, the plaintiff contended, was consistent with the personal malice and ill will that the defendant bore towards him. He claimed that the defendant disapproved strongly of his vocal opposition to the linkage of the resolutions and wanted to “mar my credibility on the day of the adjourned EGM before the NatSteel shareholders”.
44        The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had no basis or good reason to have uttered the words complained of. He noted that the defendant had initially denied having said those words in his Defence filed on 25 September 2003 and only changed his mind some seven months later in his Amended Defence. The plaintiff asserted that there was nothing in the SIAS statement reported in the BT article of 4 June 2003 that could have suggested that he was “playing to the gallery”.
45        His statements and conduct at the EGM of 28 May 2003 were consistent with the position that SIAS had maintained all along, which was to call on the NatSteel board to remove the linkage of the various resolutions in view of the prejudice such linkage would cause to minority shareholders. The plaintiff was also concerned that such linkage, if successful in NatSteel’s case, would set a bad precedent for other public companies. There was no issue of the plaintiff wanting to boost his own popularity and reputation or abusing the occasion to glorify himself by speaking at the said EGM and no such suggestion was made by the board at the EGM itself.
46        In addition to the reasons mentioned earlier, the plaintiff believed the defendant harboured malice and ill will towards him because he had spoken publicly against the linkage. This stand was contrary to and was likely to undermine 98 Holdings’ intentions and objectives. The plaintiff had also agreed with Sanion’s concern that the implementation of the scrip dividend scheme would dilute its shareholding in NatSteel. Since Sanion held marginally less than the trigger level of 30% of the shares, it could not take any scrip dividend without being at risk of having to make a mandatory take-over. On the other hand, if the other shareholders opted for scrip dividend, Sanion’s shareholding would be diminished.
47        The plaintiff’s comments and public support for Sanion’s position “would have caused considerable distress, embarrassment and annoyance within 98 Holdings and its shareholders and representatives, including the defendant”. The plaintiff therefore believed that the defendant said the words complained of maliciously as a personal attack on him.
48        In his Second Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, the plaintiff stated that although Oei Hong Leong had also commenced an action in defamation (Suit No 670 of 2004) against the same defendant together with others, the only similarity in both actions was that they arose out of the same BT article. The plaintiff knew Oei Hong Leong, a recent member of SIAS, personally but there was no collusion between the two of them in commencing these actions. The plaintiff also stated that the words complained of related to the statement he had given to the writer of the BT article of 4 June 2003 and to his conduct at the EGM of 28 May 2003: see para 5 of the said Second Affidavit set out in full at [72], 
infra
. However, his counsel’s submissions sought to explain that para 5 “was intended to set out the defendant’s pleaded case” and to emphasise the different contexts in which the alleged defamatory statements in the plaintiff’s suit and in Oei Hong Leong’s suit were made. It was argued that para 5 was not expressed or intended to be an admission or acknowledgement by the plaintiff.
49        The plaintiff accepted the contents of the transcript of the proceedings at the EGM of 28 May 2003 but he did not agree with the comment “(interrupting)” inserted by the transcriber in some instances where he rose to speak. There was applause from the shareholders at certain stages of his speech but that was because they appreciated the points he was making. Further, they also applauded another speaker from the floor. Any laughter that took place was not worked up by the plaintiff – the shareholders were simply amused although the plaintiff was speaking seriously and was not joking or laughing as he spoke. He acknowledged that there were instances where he was addressing the shareholders rather than the board of NatSteel. If he was indeed playing to the gallery, the board ought to have stopped him from speaking further. He did not need this incident to boost his popularity as he was already a popular man.
50        The plaintiff’s preferred style of going about his job was to communicate with the management of a company in a gentlemanly fashion behind closed doors and not to embarrass the management in public. If the management refused to meet SIAS’s officials, as in the case of NatSteel, SIAS would then campaign through the press. He did not deny that he used the media to reach out to SIAS’s members and to canvass corporate issues. However, he did not use the media to encourage others to join the association. He also did not use the media to embarrass any company publicly.
51        The plaintiff was aware that Sanion voted against the M & A resolution even after the resolutions had been de-linked but he saw no reason to criticise a shareholder exercising its right to vote.
52        Asked why he took almost three months to issue a letter of demand to the defendant in respect of the words complained of, the plaintiff replied that he was agonising over this matter with his wife as their faith did not encourage law suits. His wife advised him to leave the matter aside for a while and he did that for a couple of weeks. After that, he went to consult the law firm of M/s Rajah & Tann, which had been providing free legal services to SIAS and which was coincidentally also acting for Oei Hong Leong in his defamation claim then. The plaintiff denied that he had taken legal action in order to support Oei Hong Leong’s cause.
53        The plaintiff called Denis Walter Distant (“DWD”) as a witness to give a fair, accurate and independent view of the events which transpired at the EGM of 28 May 2003 and the circumstances under which the plaintiff addressed the EGM. DWD was not a shareholder of NatSteel at the material time but decided to go to the EGM to see the action. He managed to obtain a proxy from a shareholder.
54        DWD, who joined SIAS in early 2003, testified that the shareholders, other than Sanion and 98 Holdings, became increasingly upset and angry as the EGM progressed because of the way the resolutions were structured. There were many shouts of anger directed at the NatSteel board and the chairman of the EGM appeared to be losing control of the proceedings. About 45 minutes into the EGM, the plaintiff stepped to the front of the auditorium to speak. It seemed to DWD that the chairman was seeking the plaintiff’s assistance to calm the shareholders down.
55        The plaintiff reminded the shareholders what the real issues were and encouraged them to behave with proper decorum. He “was not playing up to any of the shareholders” and was not taking sides. He was speaking as the President and CEO of SIAS, protecting the interests of minority shareholders.
56        When the plaintiff was speaking, there were laughter and applause because he was “a very charismatic and humorous man but this did not mean that the plaintiff was deliberately boosting his own popularity”. He brought some semblance of order back to the EGM and showed his conciliatory and constructive approach by offering to be a peacemaker between Sanion, 98 Holdings and NatSteel. That was the usual manner in which he assisted in the resolution of minority shareholder disputes in other cases. DWD had much respect for the plaintiff.
57        DWD explained under cross-examination that he did not have any discussion with the plaintiff before going for the EGM. Indeed, he was surprised to see the plaintiff there. DWD accepted that the proposed scrip dividend scheme was a good thing for NatSteel, or any other company, to have. He also agreed that the plaintiff was addressing the small shareholders and not Sanion or the board when he asked the question whether they wanted the cash dividend. He did not address the so-called “whitewash” solution proposed by 98 Holdings as those small shareholders would not understand what that technical corporate matter was all about. Some thought it was about eyewash.
58        DWD concluded his testimony by saying that he had known the plaintiff for about two years and that the plaintiff was a “good chap”.
The defendant’s case – no case to answer
59        One week before this trial was scheduled to commence, the defendant took out an application to determine the meaning of the words in issue as a preliminary issue. As the application was so close to the trial dates, it was fixed for hearing on the first day of trial. As if in retaliation, a few days later, the plaintiff took out an application to strike out parts of the Amended Defence should I rule that the words in issue were defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning. That application was also fixed to be heard on the first day of trial. On that day, I informed both parties that it would be pointless to proceed with the applications at the stage we were in because my decision might not result in a final determination of the suit. Should I rule in the defendant’s favour and dismiss the action and should the plaintiff subsequently succeed on appeal, the parties would have to come back for trial again.
60        The defendant and his two intended witnesses filed affidavits of evidence-in-chief but these were not used because of the developments described below. At the start of the trial, the parties agreed that the whole of the evidence adduced in Suit No 670 of 2003, where Oei Hong Leong is the plaintiff and the present defendant is one of the defendants, be adopted for this trial so that the undisputed common facts would not need to be revisited. I was also the trial judge for Suit No 670 of 2003 which was heard shortly before the present trial.
61        At the close of the plaintiff’s case, the Defence decided to submit that there was no case to answer and undertook to call no evidence. As a result, the parties then agreed the present case would stand on only the evidence adduced here together with the six volumes of agreed bundles of documents and the defendant’s core bundle of documents. The affidavits of evidence-in-chief of the defendant and his intended witnesses were thus not adduced in evidence.
62        The defendant submitted that there was no case to answer because:
(a)        the words in issue are not in their natural and ordinary meaning defamatory of the plaintiff;
(b)        even if the words are in their natural and ordinary meaning defamatory of the plaintiff, the defamatory imputation therein is justified on the plaintiff’s own evidence;
(c)        the words are fair comment on a matter of public interest and the plaintiff has not proved malice on the defendant’s part; and/or
(d)        the words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege and the plaintiff has not proved malice on the defendant’s part.
The decision of the court
63        The first issue that the court has to decide is whether the words complained of bear the defamatory meaning pleaded by the plaintiff or some lesser defamatory meaning. I have already set out what the plaintiff said the words meant. The defendant pleaded that the words in issue, “in their natural and ordinary meaning and in their proper context, meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was attempting to gain the strong approval and/or support of NatSteel’s minority shareholders on the issue of the linkage”.
[1]
64        In 
Microsoft Corporation v SM Summit Holdings Ltd
 
[1999] 4 SLR 529
, the Court of Appeal set out the principles applicable in determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of in a defamation action. The Court there said, at [53]:
The court decides what meaning the words would have conveyed to an ordinary, reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense: 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong
 
[1984–1985] SLR 516
; 
[1985] 1 MLJ 334
 and 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew
, supra [
[1992] 2 SLR 310
]. The test is an objective one: it is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by an ordinary, reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. The meaning intended by the maker of the defamatory statement is irrelevant. Similarly, the sense in which the words were actually understood by the party alleged to have been defamed is also irrelevant. Nor is extrinsic evidence admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the context of the entire passage in which they are set out. The court is not confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words, but takes into account what the ordinary, reasonable person may reasonably infer from the words. The ordinary, reasonable person reads between the lines.

Longman Dictionary of Phrasal Verbs
 (Longman, 1983) states, in respect of the phrase “play to the gallery”:
derog
 
to perform or behave so as to win the favour of those with least judgment …
The Cambridge International Dictionary of Idioms
 
(Cambridge University Press, 1998) defines the phrase “play to the gallery” as:
to spend time doing or saying things that will make people admire or support you, instead of dealing with more important matters.
The phrase has also been equated to “try to gain popular favour, [especially] by crude appeals” (
Collins Concise Dictionary
 (HarperCollins Publishers, 21
st
 Century Ed, 2001)) or “to attempt to appeal to the popular taste, as opposed to a more refined or esoteric taste” (
Webster’s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language
 (Portland House, 1997)). 
Collins COBUILD Dictionary of Idioms
 (HarperCollins Publishers, 2
nd
 Ed, 2002) offers the following explanation:
If you say that someone such as a politician 
is playing to the gallery
, you are criticizing them for trying to impress the public and make themselves popular, instead of dealing seriously with important matters. [emphasis in original]
It adds a note to explain:
The gallery in a theatre is a raised area like a large balcony, that usually contains the cheapest seats. In the past, the poorest and least educated people sat there. Actors and other performers found it easier to get applause from them than from the other members of the audience.
66        It is clear that when one uses the words “playing to the gallery” to describe another person’s conduct or speech, one is usually not paying that person a compliment. The words imply that the person referred to enjoys attention and applause. The words in issue are not in the same genre as words such as “establishing rapport with the audience” or “connecting well with his listeners”, which would show admiration and appreciation for that person’s communication skills.
67        However, the common theme of the above definitions is the focus on the manner of doing or saying things. The words in issue do not impugn a person’s integrity or belief in doing or saying those things. In other words, they do not imply that the person does not believe in what he is doing or saying. The words convey the speaker’s opinion of that person as someone who concentrates more on form and flamboyance than substance and subtlety. Saying a person has rather more form than substance is no worse than saying a person has a lot of substance but little form. The former implies a dramatic, stylish showman while the latter conjures up an image of a dull, soporific speaker. However, it seems to me that the remarks in both instances, while not complimentary, are not defamatory. I do not think, therefore, that merely saying a person is playing to the gallery defames him.
68        Do the words in question convey the meanings pleaded by the plaintiff? They do not impugn his impartiality and objectivity or suggest in any way that he was biased or was not diligent. The words also do not mean that the plaintiff or SIAS did not believe the stand taken in the statement or that the plaintiff did not act professionally, credibly and properly. The meaning conveyed in the context of the BT article of 4 June 2003 is that the plaintiff was reiterating what was already known to be the stand of the minority shareholders so as to enhance his image of being the champion of minority shareholders. There was no new argument canvassed. There was no suggestion that SIAS did not believe in that statement which was made more for dramatic effect than to carry the debate further. As 
Gatley
 
on Libel and Slander
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 10
th
 Ed, 2004) puts it at para 2.9:
Words or matter which merely injure the feelings or cause annoyance but which in no way reflect on character or reputation or tend to cause one to be shunned or avoided or expose one to ridicule are not actionable as defamation.
Similarly, it has been said that insults which do not diminish a man’s standing among other people do not found an action for libel or slander, although the exact borderline may often be difficult to define: 
Berkoff v Burchill
 [1996] 4 All ER 1008. The words said of the plaintiff may not be complimentary but they do not injure his character or reputation or question his integrity. In the circumstances, I do not think the plaintiff was defamed in the way pleaded or at all.
69        Counsel for the plaintiff relied on 
Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin
 
[1998] 1 SLR 547
 in submitting that a similar phrase “directed at the gallery” was used to describe defence counsel’s objectionable conduct in cross-examination. In that case, Rajendran J said, at [199]:
It is clear, by the failure to call evidence to support the allegations, that the questions were directed not towards assisting the court in determining the issues before it but directed at the gallery and the press in order to denigrate the Prime Minister and the way he governs Singapore. For such conduct, aggravated damages is payable.
A counsel’s duty in court is not to ask irrelevant, sensational questions or to make popular, quoteworthy speeches but to address and assist the court on the issues. It was little wonder then that such conduct as described by the judge met with his disapproval. The passage cited does not suggest that playing to the gallery is objectionable conduct attracting legal sanctions in every situation.
70        I agree with defence counsel’s submissions that the worst that could be said of the words in issue is that they alleged that the plaintiff had engaged in theatrics. Assuming that calling a person a dramatic showman with more style than substance amounts to defamation, was the defendant justified in making that remark about the plaintiff?
71        In 
Sin Heak Hin Pte Ltd v Yuasa Battery Singapore Co Pte Ltd
 
[1995] 3 SLR 590
 at 598–599, [31], it was held:
In order to establish the defence of justification, a defendant must prove that the defamatory imputation is true and he must prove the truth of the very imputation complained of. He must also prove the truth of all the material statements in the libel, 
ie
 he must justify everything that the libel contains which is injurious to the plaintiff.
This does not mean the court should engage in a meticulous examination of every word in question or every detail of fact. It suffices that the substance or the gist of the libel has been justified: 
Aaron v Cheong Yip Seng
 
[1996] 1 SLR 623
.
72        The plaintiff alleged that the words in issue were only uttered in respect of the SIAS statement referred to in the BT article of 4 June 2003. The defendant disagreed. He pleaded that the words were not spoken as a comment on only the SIAS statement but related to the plaintiff’s conduct at the 28 May 2003 EGM as well. He relied on the plaintiff’s Second Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief as having acknowledged that fact. The plaintiff, in that Affidavit, said at para 5:
The contexts in which the statements complained of were made are also different. In brief, the defamatory statement in the Oei Suit was against Mr Oei and criticized him for being “irrational” and “obstructive” in opposing the resolutions tabled at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 28 May 2003 (“EGM”) of NatSteel Ltd (“NatSteel”). On the other hand, the defamatory statement made against me criticizes me for “playing to the gallery”, meaning that I was not being objective and impartial. This was in relation to the statement I had given to Catherine Ong, the Business Times journalist of the offending article, and my conduct at the EGM. As I was at the EGM not a shareholder of NatSteel but as an observer, my conduct at the EGM is obviously different from Mr Oei’s conduct as a minority shareholder at the EGM.
The plaintiff was responding to the defendant’s supplemental Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief which sought to incorporate the defendant’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief in Suit No 670 of 2004 where he was sued by Oei Hong Leong. In my opinion, the plaintiff has accepted that the words in issue related to the SIAS statement in the BT article of 4 June 2003 as well as his conduct at the EGM of 28 May 2003. He was not merely stating what the defendant had alleged. He was also stating his understanding of what the words referred to. Further, it could not be said, as the plaintiff has submitted, that there was no reference whatsoever to the EGM of 28 May 2003. The defendant’s words relating to Oei Hong Leong alluded to it and so did the first paragraph and the second and third last paragraphs of the BT article.
73        The transcript of the EGM of 28 May 2003 showed that the plaintiff, although permitted to speak by the chairman, addressed many of his remarks to the minority shareholders sitting behind him instead of the board of directors in front. He did not contribute to the debate on the proposed “whitewash” solution as he was not interested in it. To him, it was not really a solution to the linkage and, in any event, it was a matter for Sanion, not the other minority shareholders, to consider.
74        The plaintiff asked rhetorical questions such as whether the minority shareholders wanted cash. That, without a doubt, was calculated to elicit a resounding “yes!” from the audience. His speech was demagogic and roused the audience from its disunited cacophony to a united chorus of dissent. There was laughter and applause. It could be, as his witness DWD said, due to the fact that the plaintiff was a charismatic and humorous speaker but those are also qualities of speakers who know how to galvanise an audience. If the plaintiff had considered the laughter and applause out of place and distracting the message in his professed serious speech, he could have appealed to his audience to refrain from laughing and cheering as he spoke. Instead, his words continued to build the minority shareholders’ chorus into a crescendo. He added to the action, he enhanced the entertainment. In my view, such a public performance by the plaintiff could, without any distortion of language, be described as playing to the gallery.
75        On 3 June 2003, when the plaintiff spoke to the reporter and gave the SIAS statement that was subsequently quoted in the BT article of 4 June 2003, it was Sanion’s response that all concerned were interested to know. SIAS’s and the minority shareholders’ position was already public and nothing had changed where SIAS was concerned. The statement added nothing to the debate. It was clearly a reiteration made just for dramatic effect and to remind the minority shareholders who was championing their cause. The defendant was therefore also justified in saying that the plaintiff was playing to the gallery in issuing that statement.
76        The defence of qualified privilege accords a right to a person whose character or conduct has been attacked to answer such attack. Any defamatory statements he may make about the attacker will be privileged provided they are published 
bona fide
 and are fairly relevant to the accusation made. The law justifies a man in repelling a libellous charge by a denial or an explanation. He has a qualified privilege to answer the charge and if he does so in good faith, and what he published is fairly an answer and is published for the purpose of repelling the charge and not with malice, it is privileged, though it be false: see 
Gatley
 
on Libel and Slander
 ([68] 
supra
) at para 14.49.
77        The defence is also available where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it: see 
Adam v Ward
 
[1917] AC 309
.
78        The plaintiff submitted that the defence of qualified privilege could not succeed if the defendant knew that the SIAS’s criticism was valid and justified, as the privilege did not attach to a response to what the defendant knew to be a justifiable attack. The plaintiff said the evidence showed that SIAS was right to have objected to the linkage of the resolutions as the special dividend of 55 cents was a separate and independent issue from the other resolutions. The linkage, it alleged, was nothing more than a tactical move by 98 Holdings directed at Sanion and this was confirmed by 98 Holdings’ requisition for the 31 July 2003 EGM on the same day that the linked resolutions were defeated at the 4 June 2003 EGM. No linkage was proposed at the 31 July 2003 EGM.
79        However, the issue on 3 June 2003 was not so much the correctness of the linkage but whether Sanion accepted the proposed “whitewash” solution. The 28 May 2003 EGM was adjourned for Sanion to consider the proposal. Nevertheless, the plaintiff issued a statement rehashing the issues debated on at the last EGM. In the SIAS statement issued by the plaintiff and published in the BT article of 4 June 2003, he attacked the board of directors of NatSteel in public by stating that the minority shareholders were outraged by the board’s failure to keep its promise of paying the remaining 55 cents in dividend. The defendant was entitled to respond, as acknowledged by the plaintiff, and he did respond to the attack when the SIAS statement was read out to him by the reporter.
80        The response could not be said to be disproportionate to the attack and unreasonable in the circumstances. The defendant was a member of the board of directors of NatSteel. He merely criticised the plaintiff’s manner of making his points and nothing more. Further, it would be highly artificial to say that the defendant’s response was against the plaintiff personally when it was SIAS which made the statement to the press. The plaintiff referred to himself and SIAS interchangeably during the trial. One of the press articles (BT, 21 June 2003) cited by him in his evidence pronounced him as the face of shareholder activism in Singapore. He made the statement of 3 June 2003, he testified, spontaneously and not through a prepared text. That showed he was the alter ego of SIAS and the defendant was not wrong in directing his response at the maker of the statement.
81        The final point made by the plaintiff on this defence was that he viewed the defendant as “98 Holdings’ man” and he testified that the defendant was speaking in his capacity as a director of 98 Holdings. The defendant has offered no evidence to the contrary. Since the criticism was directed only at the board of NatSteel, it was argued that the defendant had no qualified privilege to respond as a director of 98 Holdings.
82        There is no reason to assume the defendant was responding in the BT article of 4 June 2003 as a 98 Holdings director only and not as a director of NatSteel. He does not assume a different personality simply because the plaintiff thought so. He was referred to as a NatSteel director in the opening paragraphs of the BT article.
83        As NatSteel is a listed company, the public has an interest in its corporate governance. The defendant had a duty to respond to the criticism levelled against the board (with him as director and Chairman of its Executive Committee) and the investing public had a corresponding interest in his response.  The defence of qualified privilege therefore succeeds.
84        I turn now to the defence of fair comment. In 
Chen Cheng v Central Christian Church
 
[1999] 1 SLR 94
 at [33], the Court of Appeal held that to succeed in a defence of fair comment, the defendant has to prove that:
(a)        the words complained of are comments, though they may consist of or include inferences of facts;
(b)        the comment is on a matter of public interest;
(c)        the comment is based on facts; and
(d)        the comment is one which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved.
The court also said, at [46]–[47], that it was not necessary to prove each of the facts pleaded in support of the defence of fair comment. All that was needed was to prove such of the facts as were sufficient to form the basis of a fair comment. The court reiterated at [49] and [51] what it said in 
Aaron v Cheong Yip Seng
 ([71] 
supra
), that:
The essential thing is the honest opinion of a fair-minded person and in this connection every allowance or latitude must be given for any prejudice and exaggeration entertained by such a fair-minded person. [Citing 
Silkin v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd
 
[1958] 1 WLR 743
 at 749.]
…
However, the word ‘honestly’ here is used in an objective sense. The fourth element requires the comment to be one that, objectively speaking, a fair-minded person can honestly make given the proven facts, unless in making such statement, the author is actuated by malice.
On the difficulty of distinguishing an assertion of fact from a comment, the court laid down these guiding principles, at [35]:
At the end of the day much depends on how the defamatory statement is expressed, the context in which it is set out and the content of the entire article or passage in question. One should adopt a common sense approach and consider how the statement would strike the ordinary reasonable reader, 
ie
 whether it would be recognizable by the ordinary reader as a comment or a statement of fact.
85        In para 20 of the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff averred that the BT article of 4 June 2003 “quoted the defendant as commenting on the SIAS statement …” When the defendant responded in para 24 of the Amended Defence that the plaintiff had thereby admitted that the words in issue were in the nature of a comment, the plaintiff then denied in para 19 of his Amended Reply that he had made such an admission. He averred that the words, in the context in which they were published, contained allegations of fact.
86        I note that the plaintiff has nevertheless left the pleadings as they stood without substituting the word “commenting”. That word means what it says. In any event, adopting the common-sense approach advocated by the Court of Appeal above, saying someone is playing to the gallery must be in the nature of a comment. The words in issue are a metaphor which is used to describe certain factual situations. They are, by their nature, an expression of opinion or an observation.
87        The matters concerning the NatSteel saga leading up to the comment in the BT article in question were constantly in the news and attracted a lot of public attention and debate. They were certainly matters of public interest.
88        The comment made by the defendant was based on the largely undisputed facts set out earlier in this judgment which were widely reported in the media. The BT article in question encapsulates the latest episodes of the eventful saga and assumes the reader has background knowledge of the issues. A reasonable reader who is reading about the NatSteel saga for the very first time in that article would know immediately that there are other matters that have occurred. The SIAS statement was not the first time the plaintiff spoke to the press. The BT article was not the first time that that reporter wrote about the saga. The defendant was speaking to someone who was obviously aware of all that had transpired and it would be ridiculous to require him to spell out to the reporter all the facts on which he based his description of the plaintiff as playing to the gallery. Further, the defendant and anyone interviewed by reporters cannot be constricted by the parameters of press articles as they do not wield the editorial powers of what goes into print. Articles in the press about a continuing issue do not recapitulate everything that has happened earlier.
89        On the fourth requirement of fair comment, I have always wondered how a man could be described as fair-minded if he harbours prejudices. In any event, bearing in mind the matters I have already discussed, there was no reason why the defendant or any other fair-minded person could not have felt honestly that the plaintiff was playing to the gallery, especially where his speech-making at the EGM of 28 May 2003 was concerned. There is no need to prove that everything the plaintiff had done throughout the NatSteel episode or that every word uttered by him was part of his playing to the gallery. It is enough if a fair-minded person looking at the situation as a whole may form the general impression that he was playing to the gallery.
90        On the question of malice, my attention was drawn to the decision of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong in 
Cheng Albert v Tse Wai Chun
 
Paul
 
[2000] 4 HKC 1
. In that case, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, with whom all the other judges agreed, said at 10:
The point of principle raised by this appeal, crucial to the outcome of the action, is whether, in contemplation of law, malice may exist in this context even when the defendant positively believed in the soundness of his comment. More specifically, the issue is whether the 
purpose
 for which a defendant stated an honestly held opinion may deprive him of the protection of the defence of fair comment; for instance, if his purpose was to inflict injury, as when a politician seeks to damage his political opponent, or if he was simply acting out of spite. [emphasis in original]
He distinguished the much-quoted passage in 
Horrocks v Lowe
 
[1975] AC 135
 at 150 where Lord Diplock said that even a positive belief in the truth of what is published on a privileged occasion may not suffice to negative express malice if it can be proved that the defendant misused the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is accorded by the law. After stating why the purposes for which the defences of qualified privilege and of fair comment exist are not the same, the learned judge debunked the notion that the cases on malice in the different contexts of the two defences were essentially interchangeable. He concluded, at 22:
To summarise, in my view a comment which falls within the objective limits of the defence of fair comment can lose its immunity only by proof that the defendant did not genuinely hold the view he expressed. Honesty of belief is the touchstone. Actuation by spite, animosity, intent to injure, intent to arouse controversy or other motivation, whatever it may be, even if it is the dominant or sole motive, does not 
of itself
 defeat the defence. However, proof of such motivation may be evidence, sometimes compelling evidence, from which lack of genuine belief in the view expressed may be inferred. Proof of motivation may also be relevant on other issues in the action, such as damages. [emphasis in original]
In responding to the difficulties that the different meanings of malice in the two defences may cause to juries, the judge advocated the shunning of the word “malice” altogether.
91        For the purposes of my judgment, I am content to follow the guidance given by our Court of Appeal in 
Chen Cheng v Central Christian Church
 ([84] 
supra
). As will become apparent, whichever approach I take, the outcome will still be the same in this case.
92        The burden of proving malice falls on the plaintiff. He has pleaded express malice here and relies on the same particulars in support of this averment in respect of both the defences of qualified privilege and of fair comment.
93        The matters enumerated by the plaintiff to make good his claim that the defendant bore him ill will and malice are all inferential ones. Put simply, the plaintiff’s contention is as follows. He and SIAS stood on one side with Sanion and the other minority shareholders while the defendant was on the opposing side with 98 Holdings. The great divide between the two groups was the linkage of the resolutions. The defendant’s group wanted the resolutions to be passed 
en bloc
. The plaintiff had made public statements criticising the linkage and calling for it to be dropped. The plaintiff’s stance supporting Sanion, which partly caused Sanion not to accept 98 Holdings’ offer for its shares, irritated and embittered the defendant because it hindered 98 Holdings’ plan for a quick exit from NatSteel by sale, winding up or capital distribution. The venom the defendant had for Sanion, the plaintiff reckoned, overflowed onto him. The plaintiff was the metaphorical grass feeling the thundering beat and heat of the offended behemoth that was 98 Holdings.
94        It is apparent from the plaintiff’s evidence that all he was saying was that the two Davids were in opposing camps and one must therefore hate the other. There was no incident cited where they had crossed verbal swords personally before the BT article of 4 June 2003. The only time when the two Davids came face to face was at the EGM of 28 May 2003. There, the plaintiff was accorded every respect. He was allowed to attend the EGM, shown to a front-row seat and permitted to address the board of directors without any restriction. At no time did the board, particularly the defendant who was sitting with the board, attempt to curb his demagogic flair. The plaintiff did not even say that the defendant was glaring angrily at him or making grunting sounds of disapproval or irritation when he was speaking. He would have been allowed to attend the adjourned EGM of 4 June 2003 as well if he had wanted to. Indeed, one of SIAS’s committee members did attend the adjourned EGM.
95        The fact that the defendant’s words appeared in a newspaper with wide coverage in the morning of the adjourned EGM was nothing remarkable. There was no evidence that the defendant set this up. He spoke to the reporter and so did the plaintiff. The sequence of the matters reported indicates that it was the plaintiff who spoke with the reporter before the defendant did. That occasion was certainly not the first and only time that the BT reported on the NatSteel saga. In the BT article in question, the defendant, in making only one statement about the plaintiff, might have appeared dismissive but should we read reticence or even silence as evidencing ill will and malice? After all, a lot of people do not go around swatting gadflies. They simply walk away from them.
96        To infer the presence of ill will and malice from such evidence is to say that he who has not shown me love hates me. That leaves no room for indifference. By that token, every majority shareholder and company director whom SIAS and the plaintiff have debated with must, 
prima facie
, bear ill will and malice towards SIAS and the plaintiff too. That can hardly be correct. The plaintiff has failed to show that the defendant was actuated by ill will or malice or that he had a predominant motive to injure the plaintiff.
97        Counsel for the plaintiff suggested that the amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, if he succeeds, should be close to the range awarded to senior political leaders here and should be $200,000 or more. He argued that the plaintiff’s role as head of a watchdog body like SIAS depended on his credibility. Counsel for the defendant thought that if there was defamation, it was a “very low-grade libel” as there was no attack on the plaintiff’s honesty or integrity and it was, at worst, a criticism of his style of doing things. It was argued that since the plaintiff was none the worse as a result of the words in issue, nothing more than nominal damages should be awarded.
98        In my opinion, if effectively calling a person a showman in these circumstances is actionable in defamation, an award of $10,000 should be more than adequate to soothe any hurt feelings and repair any damage done.
99        For the reasons set out above, on the plaintiff’s evidence and the agreed documents, there is no case for the defendant to answer and the plaintiff fails in his claim against the defendant. The plaintiff’s action is therefore dismissed with costs to be agreed or taxed by the registrar.
Claim dismissed.

5 October 2004
 
Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):
1          This was a motion filed by one Salwant Singh, the applicant, asking, pursuant to s 50 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”), for an extension of time to enable him to file a notice of appeal against the decision of Lai Siu Chiu J made on 28 May 2004 in Criminal Motion No 9 of 2004. The applicant was unrepresented before the judge as well as before us. We heard him on the present motion on 21 September 2004 and refused his application. We now set out our reasons.
The background
2          The applicant was a director and majority shareholder of Infoseek Communications (S) Pte Ltd (“Infoseek”). Infoseek had agreed with United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) to offer the latter’s customers international “call back” services. One mode of payment for the services was by post-payment credit card billing. This involved Infoseek keying the particulars of each transaction into an electronic draft capture terminal provided by UOB. UOB would then credit the billed amount into Infoseek’s bank account.
3          In April 1999, a glitch in Infoseek’s computerised billing system caused it to overcharge customers. Although the applicant managed to rectify the bug, he saw in it an opportunity, no doubt wrongfully, to generate excess funds for Infoseek. After correcting the glitch, he began charging UOB customers for call back services they never used.
4          The unusually high volume of business transacted by Infoseek around June 1999 aroused the suspicion of UOB. In the first week of July 1999, UOB froze $116,675.43 from Infoseek’s bank account. On 6 July 1999, the applicant left for India. About two years later, he was tracked down, arrested in India and extradited to Singapore. He was then charged for deceiving UOB Card Centre into believing that the fictitious IDD calls were made by its credit card customers, thereby dishonestly inducing UOB to credit various sums into Infoseek’s bank account. Infoseek was subsequently placed under liquidation, with the Official Receiver being appointed the liquidator.
5          Altogether, 765 charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) were preferred against the applicant. He pleaded guilty to five charges and consented to the remaining charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of punishment. The district judge sentenced him to 12 years’ preventive detention. Upon appeals by the applicant (against both conviction and sentence) and the Public Prosecutor (only against sentence), the Chief Justice on 14 August 2003 affirmed the conviction and enhanced the applicant’s sentence to the maximum of 20 years’ preventive detention.
6          About nine months later, on 11 May 2004, the applicant filed Criminal Motion No 9 of 2004 in the High Court seeking the following reliefs:
(a)        a review of the question whether the seizure of Infoseek’s property by the Commercial Affairs Department and the transfer of the possession of it to the Official Receiver were improper and illegal;
(b)        the return of all documents – in printed or electronic form – seized along with Infoseek’s property; and
(c)        the recovery of the documents suppressed by the Prosecution on the occasion of his trial.
7          At the hearing of the motion on 28 May 2004, the applicant told Lai J that he wanted the return of the documents and Infoseek’s property in order to appeal to the Court of Appeal to prove that he was innocent of the charges to which he had pleaded guilty. Lai J, in dismissing the motion, held that the application was misconceived as there was no further recourse available to him.
8          Being dissatisfied with Lai J’s ruling, the applicant wanted to appeal to this court. On 31 May 2004, he informed the prison authorities of his intention. On 8 June 2004, the applicant submitted to the prison authorities documents for the filing of another criminal motion. However, the Head of the Prisons Registry did not think that the applicant could appeal against the decision made in Criminal Motion No 9 of 2004. The Head of the Prisons Registry affirmed in her affidavit that she believed that the applicant wished to appeal against his conviction and sentence through the procedure of a criminal motion. However, subsequently, on 22 July 2004, the Prisons Registry filed on behalf of the applicant a notice of appeal with the Registrar of the Supreme Court, together with the set of documents furnished by the applicant on 8 June 2004.
9          According to s 45(1) of the SCJA, a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal has to be filed with the Registrar of the Supreme Court within 14 days after the date on which the decision appealed against was given. Therefore, a valid notice of appeal against the decision of 28 May 2004 had to be filed latest by 11 June 2004.
10        On 30 July 2004, a senior assistant registrar of the Supreme Court informed the applicant that the notice of appeal was filed out of time, and that he would have to file a criminal motion to seek the leave of court to file the notice of appeal out of time. Pursuant to this intimation, the applicant filed the present criminal motion on 24 August 2004 asking for an extension of time of ten days, from the date of grant of the motion, to file a notice of appeal against Lai J’s decision of 28 May 2004.
Extension of time
11        We will first address what on the face of it was a motion, pursuant to s 50 of the SCJA, to seek an extension of time to file a notice of appeal. Section 50 appears under Part V of the SCJA with the heading “Criminal Jurisdiction of Court of Appeal”. There is a dearth of authorities on the interpretation and application of s 50. This section provides that:
The Court of Appeal may, in its discretion, on the application of any person desirous of appealing who may be debarred from so doing by reason of his not having observed some formality or some requirement of this Act, permit an appeal upon such terms and with such directions as it may consider desirable in order that substantial justice may be done in the matter, and may, for that purpose, extend any period of time prescribed by section 45 [which deals with notices of appeal] or 47 [which deals with petitions of appeal].
12        However, it is clear that s 50 is strikingly similar to s 250 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) which provides that:
The High Court may, on the application of any person desirous of appealing who is debarred from so doing upon the ground of his not having observed some formality or some requirement of this Code, permit an appeal upon such terms and with such directions to the District Judge or to the Magistrate and to the parties as the Court considers desirable in order that substantial justice may be done in the matter.
13        In 
Zulkifli bin Puasa v PP
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 461
 (“
Zulkifli
”), the Brunei Court of Appeal had the occasion to consider a provision that is 
in
 
pari materia
 with our s 250 of the CPC. There, the court held at 462 that:
There are two factors to be considered upon an application for an extension of time, (1) the length of the delay and whether it can be satisfactorily explained, and (2) whether the out of time application is likely to succeed.
Where … the delay is of short duration the court may, if it thinks fit, disregard the delay, even in the absence of satisfactory reasons, but, where a substantial interval of time (a month or more) has elapsed, an extension of time will not be granted, as a matter of course, without a satisfactory explanation: see 
Rhodes
 [(1910) 5 Cr App R 35]. Where the delay is minimal the court will still not grant an extension of time if the application for which the extension is sought is bound to fail: there must be an arguable case. Moreover, even though the subsequent application may be likely to succeed – as where a fellow-prisoner’s conviction has been quashed – the court will not grant an extension of time as a matter of course: see 
Rigby
 [(1923) 17 Cr App R 111]. The entire circumstances will be considered.
14        This approach of the Brunei Court of Appeal was adopted by the Singapore High Court in 
Seah Hee Tect v PP
 
[1992] 2 SLR 210
 when considering our s 250 of the CPC. We would also respectfully endorse that approach. Turning to s 50 of the SCJA, we were unable to see why the same considerations should not also be applicable when applying this provision.
15        Interestingly, we observe that the considerations enunciated in 
Zulkifli
 are also very much the same considerations which apply where an extension of time is sought to file a notice of appeal out of time in a civil matter. They have been enumerated under four heads: (a) the length of the delay; (b) the reasons for the delay; (c) the chances of the appeal succeeding if an extension to file a notice of appeal is granted; and (d) the degree of prejudice which would be suffered by the respondent if the application is granted: see 
Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin
 
[1991] SLR 212
 and 
Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd v Fraser & Neave Ltd
 
[2001] 4 SLR 441
.
16        Reverting to the present case, as far as the period of the delay in filing the notice of appeal and the reason for the delay were concerned, it was clear to us that within three days of the decision given in Criminal Motion No 9 of 2004, the applicant had indicated his intention to appeal. It was well within the period prescribed by law. It was because the Prisons Registry thought that no further appeal was available to the applicant that timely action was not taken on his behalf. The delay was not brought about by the applicant. Therefore, if the only reason standing in the way of the applicant filing an appeal against the decision of Lai J was because of the delay, an extension of time should have been granted to the applicant to take the matter to this court.
The merits
17        However, the applicant’s real problem was in satisfying the second limb of the test pronounced in 
Zulkifli.
   It seemed clear to us that the applicant’s object in seeking the return of the documents was to show that he could not be guilty of the charges and to have his convictions, and consequently, the sentence, set aside. However, the obstacle in his way was the fact that his convictions did not arise from findings made by the court after a trial but from his own plea of guilt to the charges. Under s 244 of the CPC, there can be no appeal against a conviction to which an accused has pleaded guilty. Such an accused can only appeal against sentence.
18        In any case, under our system of criminal justice as provided in the CPC, an accused convicted before a subordinate court has only the right to appeal to the High Court whose decision thereon would, as a rule, be final: see 
PP v Bridges Christopher
 
[1997] 2 SLR 217
 at [4]. The exception to this rule is to be found in s 60(1) of the SCJA which provides:
When a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court in the exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction, the Judge may on the application of any party, and shall on the application of the Public Prosecutor, reserve for the decision of the Court of Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the matter and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the case.
19        The applicant had not asked the High Court at the conclusion of the hearing of his appeal, and the cross-appeal of the Public Prosecutor, to state a point of law of public interest for the consideration of the Court of Appeal. Neither did the Public Prosecutor think that there was any point of law of public interest in the case which required the consideration of the Court of Appeal. That being the position, there was no further avenue of appeal open to the applicant.
20        Having regard to his antecedents, the district court was clearly entitled to invoke s 12(2) of the CPC to impose a sentence of preventive detention. The High Court, in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, was also acting within its powers when it enhanced the duration of the preventive detention to a term of 20 years, upon allowing the cross-appeal of the Public Prosecutor. We were unable to see any points of law of public interest arising which required the determination of the Court of Appeal.
21        We should add that as far as the documents which the applicant had asked for were concerned, the Police had already handed them over to the Official Receiver, who is the liquidator of Infoseek. As the documents were seized from Infoseek, they ought to be returned to Infoseek and as the latter was under liquidation, the handing over of the documents to the liquidator was entirely in order. The documents had been returned to the proper party. We were given to understand at the time of the hearing before us that the Official Receiver was willing to let the applicant have the documents. That was a matter entirely within the discretion of the Official Receiver. It had nothing to do with the applicant’s convictions before the district court nor his unsuccessful appeal to the High Court. Neither had it anything to do with the successful cross-appeal of the Public Prosecutor against sentence.
22        As there was no further avenue of appeal available to the applicant in relation to his convictions and sentence, there was really no point in granting any extension of time to enable the applicant to file his notice of appeal against Lai J’s decision of 28 May 2004. His convictions and sentence had become final. Any lodgment of a notice of appeal would be a waste of his time and that of the court.
Question of quorum
23        At the hearing of the motion before us, the applicant raised the point that this court, consisting of three judges, was not the appropriate quorum to hear the motion. He relied upon rr 13(1) and 16 of the Supreme Court (Criminal Appeals) Rules (Cap 322, R 6, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Criminal Appeals Rules”), which read:
13(1)    All applications to the Court shall, unless otherwise provided, be made by motion and shall be heard in open Court.
16.        Every application, other than an application under rule 17, shall be heard by a single Judge of the Court.
The applicant submitted that his application for an extension of time should have been heard by a single Judge.
24        The Criminal Appeals Rules set out the procedures on how an appellant, who “has been convicted of a criminal offence in any court and who by any written law is entitled to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal” should file his appeal and on how an interlocutory application may be made to the appeal court. The Rules also deal with the disposal of such interlocutory applications as well as the appeal itself.
25        Rule 16 of the Criminal Appeals Rules relates to the hearing of an interlocutory application in an appeal. The present motion before us was not such an application. There was no appeal as yet. The applicant was asking for an extension of time to file an appeal against Lai J’s dismissal of his Criminal Motion No 9 of 2004. Thus, the present motion clearly fell outside the ambit of the Criminal Appeals Rules. The proper quorum for hearing such an application should consist of three judges and this is provided for in s 30(1) of the SCJA which reads:
The civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal shall be exercised by 3 or any greater uneven number of Judges of Appeal.
26        It may be of interest to note that there is a similar provision in the SCJA relating to the hearing of interlocutory applications in a pending civil appeal by a single judge. This is s 36(1) which reads:
In any proceeding pending before the Court of Appeal, any direction incidental thereto not involving the decision of the appeal, any interim order to prevent prejudice to the claims of parties pending the appeal, and any order for security for costs and for the dismissal of an appeal for default in furnishing security so ordered, may at any time be made by a Judge.
27        Accordingly, this was the proper quorum to hear the present criminal motion.
28        For the reasons set out above, we dismissed the application herein.",2004-10-05 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Lai Kew Chai J (delivering the judgment of the court):
1          The appellant, an Australian national of Vietnamese origin, aged 24, was convicted of the capital charge of importing into Singapore on 12 December 2002 396.2g of diamorphine without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). His appeal before us is against both the conviction and the sentence of death.
The facts
2          The evidence led by the Prosecution at the trial proved the following facts. At about 3.06pm on 12 December 2002, SilkAir Flight MI 622 from Phnom Penh, Cambodia, landed at Changi International Airport, Singapore. The appellant was a passenger on this flight. He was due to board Qantas Airways Flight QF 10 to Melbourne, which was to depart Singapore at 8.15pm the same day.
3          At about 7.45pm, the appellant reached Gate C22 at Terminal 1 and began the process of boarding the Qantas flight. When he walked through the metal detector, the alarm was triggered. An airport police officer searched him with a hand-held metal detector, but found nothing. When the officer tapped the appellant’s back with her hand, she felt something bulky. She alerted the other airport police officers on duty. Together, they brought the appellant to the search room within Gate 22 for a thorough search. His haversack and business bag were taken along.
4          Inside the search room, the appellant voluntarily took off his jacket and shirt. He turned around and showed one of the airport police officers his back. A plastic packet was strapped to the appellant’s lower back with yellow and white adhesive tapes. At this point, the airport police officer notified his superior, Sergeant Teh Kim Leng (“Sgt Teh”), of the find. The appellant became very distressed by this time. He cried and hit his head on the wall. When Sgt Teh arrived at the search room at about 7.55pm, he found the appellant sitting on the floor, holding his head in his hands.
5          Sgt Teh asked the appellant what was on his back. The appellant replied that it was heroin. Sgt Teh assisted the appellant in taking the packet off his back. The packet was placed on the table. When Sgt Teh asked the appellant to declare if there was anything in his luggage, he opened his haversack and took out a second packet, which he handed to Sgt Teh.
The oral statement
6          At about 8.11pm, two narcotics officer from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) Changi Airport Team arrived at the search room. At about 9.10pm, CNB officers from CNB Headquarters arrived to take charge of the case. The appellant was escorted to an interview room at the West Wing Arrival Hall. In the interview room, and in the presence of three CNB officers, the appellant gave the following oral statement (“the oral statement”):
Q: What this?
A: I know it heroin although different colour
Q: Number 3 or 4?
A: I don’t know.
Q: Who asked you to bring?
A: I know him by “Sun.”
Q: To bring where?
A: Melbourne and someone [will] take from me or maybe Sydney.
Q: Who will receive the drug at Australia?
A: Someone will recognized me and told me he likes basketball.
7          At about 11.40pm, the party of CNB officers escorted the appellant from Changi Airport to CNB Headquarters at Police Cantonment Complex, taking with them the two packets and other case exhibits. They arrived at the headquarters at about 12.05am on 13 December 2002. The investigation officer was one Assistant Superintendent Toh Soon Teck (“ASP Toh”). ASP Toh was briefed. He took custody of the accused and the two packets and other case exhibits. The appellant was taken for a routine urine test. Photographs were taken of the appellant and of the various exhibits recovered from his person.
Weight of drug exhibits
8
         
 At about 1.50am, ASP Toh weighed the two packets in the presence of the appellant. He marked the packet taken off the appellant’s back as “Exhibit A” and the packet taken from the haversack as “Exhibit B1”. Both packets were placed in separate plastic “Ziploc” bags for weighing. ASP Toh used an uncalibrated weighing machine and found the approximate weight of each packet to be as follows:
(a)            Exhibit A (recovered from the appellant’s back)            381.66g;
(b)            Exhibit B1 (recovered from the haversack)                   380.36g.
9          After weighing, ASP Toh locked up the two drug exhibits in his personal cabinet as the CNB store to keep exhibits was closed for the night. The steel cabinet was a four-drawer cabinet. It was double-locked by its own set of locks and by an iron bar which was placed in front of the drawers and locked from top to bottom to the frame of the cabinet. ASP Toh in cross-examination affirmed that there were no other drugs in the cabinet. He further testified that he had occasion to take out the two drug exhibits. He could not tell the court the reason for taking them out. According to him, it could be that he showed them to the accused before he took the cautioned statement from him. At about 5.30am, ASP Toh locked up the two drug exhibits in his personal cabinet, and left for home. He went back to sleep. In re-examination, ASP Toh said that from the moment he took over the drug exhibits, the two drug exhibits were in his custody until the moment he handed them to Dr Lee Tong Kooi of the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”). No one else had access to the two drug exhibits. Only he had the key to the cabinet and the key to the padlock which padlocked the iron bar to the cabinet. The trial judge accepted his evidence.
10        At about 11.00am the same day, ASP Toh took the drug exhibits out of his personal cabinet. He then sealed them in their plastic “Ziploc” bags. At about 11.40am, he personally handed the sealed drug exhibits over to Dr Lee Tong Kooi of the HSA for analysis. Dr Lee reported the following findings of his analysis in relation to the drug exhibits:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gross weight with packaging
 
 
 
Gross weight of powdery substance only
 
 
 
Pure diamorphine
 
 
 
 
 
Exh A
 
 
 
361.64 grams
 
 
 
340.8 grams
 
 
 
151.5 grams
 
 
 
 
 
Exh B1
 
 
 
370.94 grams
 
 
 
349.6 grams
 
 
 
244.7 grams
 
 
 
 
11
       
 The findings of Dr Lee were unchallenged. There was, however, a discrepancy between the gross weight of the drug exhibits as determined by Dr Lee, and as determined by ASP Toh. Comparing the gross weights of the drug exhibits (with their packaging), the discrepancy translated to a difference of about 20g in respect of Exhibit A and about 10g in respect of Exhibit B1. It should be noted that according to Dr Lee’s weighing, Exhibit B1 had a higher gross weight.
The cautioned statement
12
       
 At about 4.09am, ASP Toh recorded a cautioned statement from the appellant under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). The cautioned statement read:
I wish to say that I am sincerely sorry for the inconvenience to both your country and mine. What I intend to say would be the truth. However knowing the information would have been fabricated by the people who have organised this.
The investigation statements
13            ASP Toh recorded a series of four statements from the appellant over the following few days. These are hereafter referred to as “investigation statements”. They were recorded on 13, 15, 16 and 19 December 2002. The trial judge reproduced them in full in his Grounds of Decision (reported at 
[2004] 2 SLR 328
).
14        The investigation statements may be briefly summarised as follows. The appellant described in fairly comprehensive detail how he had been in serious financial difficulties in October 2002. He was contacted by one “Tan” and one “Sun” in Melbourne, who asked him to transport a “package” from Cambodia to Melbourne or Sydney via Singapore. It was clear that he wanted to earn money by transporting drugs. He flew to Phnom Penh, where members of a drug syndicate provided him with the heroin for transportation via Singapore. He described how he strapped the packets of heroin to his person and how he brought them into Singapore on SilkAir Flight MI 622. Midway through the flight from Phnom Penh to Singapore, he had difficulty in breathing and he removed one of the packets and placed it in his haversack. As recited earlier, he was arrested at the Changi International Airport and the two packets of heroin were seized from him.
The trial
15        At the trial in the High Court, several submissions were made. First, it was argued that none of the statements taken from the appellant were admissible. The submissions on their inadmissibility were based on arguments under the CPC and the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). It was further contended that the statements of the appellant were inadmissible because they were recorded in breach of Art 36(1) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 (“VCCR”). It should be noted that it was not asserted by the appellant that any of the statements was made by him involuntarily. Secondly, it was submitted that the integrity of the drug exhibits was compromised and that there was doubt if the two packets seized from the appellant were the same two packets delivered to and analysed by Dr Lee Tong Kooi. If there is any reasonable doubt, the conviction obviously cannot stand. The third major submission challenged the legality of the sentence of death. It was argued for the appellant that the sentence prescribed in the Act was not mandatory but a maximum sentence. Counsel for the appellant also sought to rely on Arts 9, 12 and 93 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Reprint) to support the argument that the death sentence was unconstitutional and therefore illegal.
16        The trial judge rejected these submissions and convicted the appellant. We will not summarise the reasons of the trial judge as these, so far as they are material, would be referred to later at the appropriate juncture.
The appeal
17        The same submissions on behalf of the appellant, which were advanced before the trial judge, were repeated before us.
18        Against the conviction, the following arguments were advanced. The appellant challenged the admissibility of the cautioned statement. Secondly, the appellant contended that it was inadmissible because of the breach of Art 36(1) of the VCCR. Thirdly, the appellant contended that the integrity of the drug exhibits had been undermined.
19        In attacking the legality of the death sentence, the appellant submitted that the sentence prescribed under s 7 of the MDA was a maximum and not a mandatory sentence. Secondly, if the death sentence was nevertheless mandatory, it was illegal and should not be administered because it violated Arts 9, 12 and/or 93 of the Constitution of Singapore.
20        We now address each of the submissions.
Admissibility of the appellant’s cautioned statement
21
       
 We refer to the cautioned statement recited in [12] of this judgment. The admissibility provision for cautioned statements recorded by non-police officers is s 24 of the Evidence Act. The question is whether the contents of the cautioned statement is a confession. In the case of 
Anandagoda v The Queen
 
[1962] 1 WLR 817
 at 823–824, Lord Guest set out the test in this way:
The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts. … The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context inferentially admit guilt?
22        We note that the appellant made the cautioned statement to ASP Toh in the usual way after the charge had been read to him. The appellant was therefore clearly referring to the discovery of the two packets of substance in his possession when he apologised for the “inconvenience”. He also alluded to the fact that he did not act alone and that there were people who organised “this”, referring to the transportation of heroin from Cambodia to Australia, which involved its unauthorised import into Singapore. He also impliedly referred to the dissembling disinformation those people must have fed him, so that the trail could not be traced to them. In our view, what the appellant had said in his cautioned statement connected him to the offence: see 
Abdul Rashid v PP
 
[1994] 1 SLR 119
. The cautioned statement is therefore admissible.
The VCCR issue
23            Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge had erred in law and in fact in ruling that Art 36(1) of the VCCR had not been breached and in admitting into evidence the oral statement of the appellant in which he admitted, 
inter alia
, knowledge that the two packets contained heroin and that he was carrying them to someone in Australia. In this connection, counsel for the appellant made three points. Firstly, Art 36(1) of the VCCR bound Singapore. Secondly, Art 36(1) was breached because the appellant only met with a member of the Australian High Commission 20 hours after he was detained and the appellant was questioned before that time. Thirdly, the breach of Art 36(1) prejudiced the appellant. It was submitted that the breach operated unfairly against the accused as he was not advised of his rights and did not have the opportunity to consult a consular officer until 3.30pm on 13 December 2002, after the cautioned statement was recorded. We are of the view that these submissions are without merit. In the light of the evidence, the trial judge was right in finding that there was no breach of Art 36(1).
24        The VCCR is a key instrument in the regulation and conduct of consular activities. There is an established practice for a State which has arrested a national of another State to notify the consular officers of the State of the accused person. Although Singapore is not a party to the Convention, Singapore does conform with the prevailing norms of the conduct between States such as those set out under Art 36(1), to which we now turn.
25            Article 36(1) has two aspects. Under Art 36(1)(b), the authorities of the receiving State “shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if … a national of that State is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner”. This will be done if the national “so requests”. The other aspect to note is that under Art 36(1)(c) when the consular post is aware of such a case, its officers “shall have the right to visit … [that national] to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation”.
26        Having found that Art 36(1) was not breached, the trial judge went further, as he acknowledged. He stated thus at [41]:
Assuming that there was a breach, it does not necessarily follow that the [appellant’s] statements are inadmissible in evidence. There must be some resultant prejudice that renders it wrong for the statements to be used, for example, that if he had timely consular advice, he would not have made the statements at all, or in the form or at the times he did.
We are of the view that the extension explicit in this 
obiter dicta
 is in principle and on authority unsustainable.
27        The trial judge did not have the benefit of considering the International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) case of 
Avena and other Mexican Nationals
 (
Mexico v United States of America
) (31 March 2004, ICJ General List No 128) (“the 
Avena
 case”). The judgment was delivered 11 days after the Grounds of Decision of the trial judge were released. The 
Avena
 case dealt with the content of Art 36(1) in customary international law, the meaning of “without delay” within the meaning of Art 36(1)(b) and, more materially, the consequence of a breach of Art 36 on the admissibility of statements taken when the Article is breached.
28        In the 
Avena
 case, Mexico brought a case against the United States concerning 52 Mexican nationals who were arrested, detained, tried, convicted and sentenced to death for various offences in the US between 1979 and 2003. Mexico complained that the US breached Art 36(1) by not informing the Mexican authorities of the detention of the Mexican nationals without delay. In some cases, the Mexican authorities were only informed after the sentence had been passed. In some others, this was done from 40 hours to several years after detention. In arguments, Mexico took the view that under Art 36(1), access should have been granted 
before
 interrogation or any action potentially detrimental to the person’s rights by the US.
29        The response of the US is noteworthy. The US argued that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction to hear the case for a number of reasons. Firstly, it would be an abuse of the ICJ’s jurisdiction to make a finding concerning the US criminal justice system: see [27] and [28] of the 
Avena
 case. Secondly, Art 36(1) only related to notification, and 
not
 the detention, trial, conviction and sentence of a foreigner: see [29] and [30]. Thirdly, the remedy sought by Mexico would intrude into the independence of US courts: see [31] to [34]. Fourthly, the ICJ did not have jurisdiction to determine whether notification was a “human right” as alleged by Mexico: see [35].
30        The ICJ ruled that it had jurisdiction. It accepted that Art 36(1) only related to notification, but ruled that whether the arrest, detention, trial and conviction of a foreigner might be unlawful would depend on the facts of the case.
31        More prominently material to this case was ICJ’s rejection of Mexico’s contention that Art 36(1) provided for consular access 
before
 interrogation or any action potentially detrimental to the foreigner’s rights was carried out: see [87]. This was not the object or purpose of Art 36, nor was this reflected anywhere in Art 36: see [85]. This was also not in the 
travaux preparatoires
 or pre-Convention discussions: see [86].
32        The ICJ also held that “without delay” did not necessarily mean “immediately upon arrest”. It concluded that the arresting authorities had a duty to give that information to the consular post of the country of which an arrested person was a national as soon as they realised that the person was a foreign national or once there were grounds to think that the person was probably a foreign national.
33        The ICJ also rejected the contention that there must be consular access before any statements were recorded. Accordingly, the appellant’s submission that the statements in question are inadmissible is without basis.
34        We now turn to the question of the admissibility of the statements in the event that Art 36 is breached. The trial judge observed that if there was a “resultant prejudice”, the court might exclude statements recorded from an accused person. This resembled Mexico’s argument that consular notification must occur immediately upon detention and prior to any interrogation. The ruling of the ICJ is apposite. It ruled at [127] that the question of admissibility of a statement “is one which has to be examined under the concrete circumstances of each case by the United States courts concerned in the process of their review and reconsideration”. We agree with the Prosecution that it bears reminding that Art 36(2) provides that the rights created under the Article are subject to domestic legislation, in the following terms:
The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State.
35        In our criminal justice system, the fundamental procedural principle is that the nature of any violation and possible prejudice must be considered under and in the light of our rules governing admissibility to be found in s 122(5) of the CPC or s 24 of the Evidence Act. These rules ensure the voluntariness with which statements are made and the reliability of confessions and admissions.
The drug exhibits
36        The principles relating to the chain of custody of exhibits in evidence are settled. The Prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the drug exhibits analysed by Dr Lee Tong Kooi of the HSA were the same as those seized from the appellant’s back and haversack. Where there is a break in the chain of custody, and a reasonable doubt arises as to the identity of the drug exhibits, then the Prosecution has not discharged its burden, and has failed to make out a 
prima facie
 case against the accused: 
Abdul Rashid v PP
 ([22] 
supra
) at 127, [17].
37
       
 The trial judge accepted the evidence of ASP Toh that he had sole possession of the drugs at all material times. ASP Toh testified that upon taking over the drug exhibits from one Senior Sergeant Christopher Chan, he immediately marked them “A” and “B1” respectively, which was a reliable method to ensure the integrity of the drug exhibits. It is noteworthy from the record of the trial that it was not put to any of the prosecution witnesses that the packets that were seized were not those which the appellant had brought into Singapore. There was also no suggestion whatever that there was any break in the chain of custody of the drugs from the time ASP Toh handed them over to Dr Lee Tong Kooi of the HSA up to the time they were weighed by Dr Lee. The appellant in his own statement
[1]
 
admitted that he had himself heat-sealed the two packets before bringing them into Singapore. On the evidence led, the contents of the two packets remained sealed until the analysis by Dr Lee.
38        In relation to the discrepancies in the weights of the two exhibits, the trial judge accepted that the discrepancies could be due to the purpose of the weighing by each officer and the different levels of their expertise. ASP Toh wanted the weight for inclusion in the holding charge. At that stage, scientifically acceptable accuracy was not required and evidence was not led that the weighing scale used by ASP Toh was calibrated to a high degree of accuracy. On the other hand, Dr Lee’s equipment was accurate. In our judgment, what is crucially important is to ensure that there has been no mixing of the drug exhibits or the tampering of the contents. There was no suggestion of any mixing or tampering. The evidence led established that the drug exhibits were properly handed over from one officer to another.
39            Admittedly, ASP Toh said he could not remember the reason why he brought out the two packets of heroin from the steel cabinet. In our view, this lapse of memory, which was restricted only to the occasion, was not of any significance. The crucial fact is that the two packets remained in the custody and control of ASP Toh at all material times.
40        We therefore agree with the findings of the trial judge that the integrity and identity of the drug exhibits had not been compromised at any stage.
Whether the death sentence is a mandatory or maximum penalty
41            Counsel for the appellant argued that the death penalty is the maximum rather than the mandatory penalty for the offence under s 7 of the MDA. In pressing for this interpretation of the statutory provision, counsel for the appellant relied on the Second Schedule of the MDA as well as ss 9A(1) and 41 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IA”). It was further submitted that there is no provision in the MDA stating that death is the only penalty which may be imposed.
42        It is convenient to set out s 9A(1) and s 41 of the IA, including the heading of each section.
Purposive interpretation of written law and use of extrinsic materials
9A¾(1) In the interpretation of a provision of a written law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.
Penalties prescribed to be deemed maximum penalties
41 Whenever in any written law a penalty is provided for an offence, such provision shall imply that such offence shall be punishable upon conviction by a penalty not exceeding (except as may be otherwise expressly mentioned in the written law) the penalty provided.
43        In addition, counsel for the appellant referred to s 53 of the MDA which provides that a district court or a magistrate court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all proceedings under the MDA. It also provides that notwithstanding the provisions of the CPC which limit the powers of sentencing of those lower courts, the District Court and not the Magistrate’s Court shall have the power to impose the full penalty or punishment in respect of any offence provided by the MDA except the punishment of death. It was argued that where the sentence of death was provided as the penalty it must be a maximum and not a mandatory penalty.
44        In the late 1960s and early 1970s the drug problem in Singapore assumed alarming proportions. The MDA, which was a consolidation of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1955 (Cap 151, 1970 Rev Ed) and the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1969 (Cap 154, 1970 Rev Ed), was passed in 1973. It did not provide for the death penalty. Less than three years later, the death penalty was introduced.
45        The punishments for offences are prescribed in s 33 and the Second Schedule of the MDA. The first column of the Schedule specifies the “Section creating offence”, the second column specifies the “General nature of offence;” and the third to seventh columns specify the “Punishment”. One looks across the Schedule for the specific offence and the type and quantity of the drug involved under the second column, and finally the punishment prescribed under columns three to seven. When the Schedule is read in that way, the punishment for the offence of unauthorised import of more than 15g of diamorphine is stated in one word, “Death”.
46        We reproduce below the relevant punishment prescribed for the unauthorised import of more than 15g of diamorphine in the Second Schedule of the MDA. As an aid to statutory interpretation and to provide the text by which lesser punishment is prescribed for the unauthorised import of controlled drugs containing a lesser quantity within a range of quantities of diamorphine, we also reproduce below the punishment prescribed for the import of not less than 10g and not more than 15g of diamorphine.

47        In the interpretation of the punishment for an offence falling under s 7(4)(b) of the first two columns of the MDA, a number of features of the Second Schedule of the MDA are immediately apparent and noteworthy. The punishment for the import of more than 15g of diamorphine is death, as provided for in the sixth column.
48        In relation to the import of diamorphine of lesser quantities within the range as mentioned above, the maximum and minimum punishments are prescribed. A sentencing court having convicted a person of this offence has no discretion to impose a sentence exceeding the maximum or falling short of the minimum. Both of them are expressly spelt out in the sixth column. The maximum is 30 years or imprisonment for life and 15 strokes. The minimum is 20 years and 15 strokes. If Parliament had intended to confer on the sentencing court a discretion to impose a range of punishments, it could have provided for it. Further, if a range of sentences is prescribed for the import of a range of diamorphine below 15g and not less than 10g, it is illogical to think that Parliament would in respect of any unauthorized import of diamorphine of more than 15g confer a discretion on the sentencing court to impose any sentence up to the maximum sentence of death.
49        We refer to the appellant’s reference to s 9A(1) and reliance upon s 41 of the IA. As the DPP has submitted, it is beyond doubt that Parliament legislated the offence as punishable with the sentence of death. That is patently clear from a reading of the Hansard. When the mandatory death penalty was introduced for the unauthorised import of more than 15g of diamorphine in 1975, the then Minister for Home Affairs and Education, who tabled the Bill, said (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (20 November 1975 at col 1382)):
The death penalty will … be imposed for the unauthorised import, export or trafficking of more than 30 grammes of morphine or more than 15 grammes of heroin.
… It is not intended to sentence petty morphine and heroin pedlars to death. It is, therefore, necessary to specify the quantity by weight, exceeding which the death penalty will be imposed. … For heroin any quantity in which the pure heroin [
ie
 diamorphine] content is above 15 grammes will attract the death penalty. … As a comparison, Iranian law provides for a mandatory death sentence where the trafficking only involves more than 10 grammes of heroin.
50        The object of the 1975 amendments to the MDA is therefore clear. An interpretation of the punishment for the offence under s 7(4)(b) and falling within the first and second columns of the Second Schedule of the MDA must promote that object, which is the imposition of the mandatory death penalty. In relation to the appellant’s reliance on s 41 of the IA, we are of the view that such reliance is misplaced. It was argued that the punishment prescribed for the unauthorised import of more than 15g of diamorphine implied that the death penalty was deemed to be the maximum penalty. In other words, the appellant’s counsel argued that the provision imposing the death penalty “shall imply that such offence shall be punishable upon conviction by a penalty not exceeding” the death penalty, “except as may be otherwise expressly mentioned in the written law”. It was further pointed out there was no express provision to the contrary. In our view, this submission ignores the ultimacy and finality of the death sentence. It is absurd to suggest that Parliament would contemplate any sentence beyond the death sentence. The death sentence is the final and terminal sentence which a convicted person can suffer. Any interpretation of the capital punishment prescribed, which asserts it is the maximum, implies that there is a more serious sentence beyond the death sentence and is manifestly untenable.
51        We finally refer to the arguments based on s 53 of the MDA where a lower court tries the offence of unauthorised import of diamorphine of more than 15g. This section, in our view, is solely applicable to the specific and particular situation where the Public Prosecutor, in his sole discretion, prefers such a charge before the lower court. In preferring the lower court as the trial court, it is then clear that the Public Prosecutor, in his sole discretion, has come to the view that the sentence of death is not appropriate. It is an exceptional situation. In fact, the Public Prosecutor has never invoked s 53 of the MDA. In the event, on any reasonable reading of the section, the District Court can lawfully impose a sentence on an offence under s 7(4)(a) of the MDA as set out in the Second Schedule. This approach would consistently promote the purpose and object of the MDA. Where the intent of Parliament is clear, s 9A(1) should apply to the exclusion of s 41 of the IA.
52        A similar interpretation was adopted in 
PP v Loo Kun Long
 
[2003] 1 SLR 28
, where the High Court had to interpret an ambiguous punishment provision in the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed). The question was whether the fine of $1,000 stipulated therein was the maximum or minimum fine. The statute was silent, but a ministerial speech given in Parliament made it clear that $1,000 was intended to be the minimum fine. The High Court accepted this. We are therefore of the view that s 41 of the IA does not assist the appellant in the face of the clear statement of Parliamentary intent set out above.
53        The punishment for the unauthorised import of more than 15g of diamorphine is, in our view, prescribed expressly and in clear terms. There is but one sentence for the High Court to impose and that is the sentence of death.
Whether the death sentence is unconstitutional
54
       
 The appellant based his arguments on the unconstitutionality of the mandatory death penalty on Arts 9(1), 12(1) and 93 of the Constitution of Singapore. These Articles deal, respectively, with fundamental liberty of the person, equal protection of the law and the vesting of judicial power in the courts.
55        The appellant further contended that the Constitution imported customary international law into Singapore and argued that the prohibition against torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment was a norm of customary international law. The mandatory death penalty violated this prohibition on two counts, namely (a) the imposition of the death penalty would be grossly disproportionate in relation to the offence; and (b) the act of hanging as a method of execution was a cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.
56        The challenge to the constitutionality of the mandatory death sentence is not a novel issue. This has been raised on several occasions in the Privy Council and in the Malaysian Federal Courts. The decision in 
Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 
[1980–1981] SLR 48
 (“
Ong Ah Chuan
”) was a Privy Council case on appeal from Singapore; the Malaysian Federal Courts in 
PP v Lau Kee Hoo
 
[1983] 1 MLJ 157
 and other cases followed the decision of 
Ong Ah Chuan
.
57        The court’s power to strike down any legislation for inconsistency with the Constitution stems from Art 4 which provides:
This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.
58        In 
Taw Cheng Kong v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 943
, the High Court struck down a provision of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed) in the exercise of its judicial review jurisdiction under Art 4 of the Constitution. On appeal, the decision was overturned on its facts (see 
PP v Taw Cheng Kong
 
[1998] 2 SLR 410
), but the Court of Appeal did not doubt the following statement of principle by the High Court at [14]:
This ‘supremacy clause’ (art 4), mated with the entrenchment provisions of art 5, guarantees and secures the prevalence of a person’s fundamental liberties over legislative and executive action which contravenes those rights. It is the duty of the court to uphold and preserve those rights, and to impugn any Act of Parliament or any course of executive action which injures, detracts from or infringes those rights. Thus, as Yong Pung How CJ noted in 
Chan Hiang Leng Colin & Ors v PP
 
[1994] 3 SLR 662
,
The court has the power and duty to ensure that the provisions of the Constitution are observed. The court also has a duty to declare invalid any exercise of power, legislative and executive, which exceeds the limits of the power conferred by the Constitution, or which contravenes any prohibition which the Constitution provides.
59        The appellant’s arguments on unconstitutionality made reference to several very recent Privy Council decisions on the mandatory death penalty. These decisions, in turn, made reference to international jurisprudence dealing with “the right to life and the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”: see 
Watson v The Queen
 
[2004] UKPC 34
 at [30].
60        We now turn to consider the arguments put forward by the appellant on the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty.
Article 12 (equal protection)
61            Article 12(1) provides as follows:
All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.
The argument that the mandatory death penalty in respect of the offence under s 7 of the MDA is a violation of Art 12(1) was considered and dismissed in 
Ong Ah Chuan
. The appellant readily admitted this, but said that the argument sought to be raised now is different from the argument considered in 
Ong Ah Chuan.
62        Firstly, the appellant submitted that 
Ong Ah Chuan
 was either wrongly decided at the time, or alternatively, that the Privy Council would have decided the case differently today. The appellant cited a good number of very recent Privy Council decisions in support of the latter contention. They are: (a) 
Watson v The Queen
 ([59] 
supra
); (b) 
Boyce v The Queen
 
[2004] UKPC 32
; (c) 
Matthew v The State
 
[2004] UKPC 33
; and (d) 
Reyes v The Queen
 
[2002] 2 AC 235
. The first three decisions were rendered on 7 July 2004 and only 
Reyes v The Queen
 was before the trial judge when he gave judgment in the High Court on 20 March 2004. Broadly, the significance of the first three decisions is in the Privy Council’s reconsideration of 
Ong Ah Chuan
, and its opinion that 
Ong Ah Chuan
 is now no longer good law.
63            Secondly, and in the alternative, the appellant submitted that the argument from Art 12(1) sought to be raised in this appeal was different from the argument that was considered and dismissed in 
Ong Ah Chuan
. It was said that the trial judge “misconstrued the basis on which the submissions made to him were put” and had “not dealt with” the precise argument put forward.
64        The appellant’s first argument dovetails with the Art 9(1) argument, since it requires consideration of what impact, if any, the new Privy Council decisions have on the authority of 
Ong Ah Chuan
. We shall therefore consider this together with Art 9(1) below.
65        For the second argument, the appellant contended that the specific question 
not
 considered by the Privy Council in 
Ong Ah Chuan
 was whether the mandatory death penalty offended the second limb of Art 9(1), 
ie
 whether it removed “the equal protection of the law” afforded to individual convicted persons by way of the judicial sentencing process.
66        
Ong Ah Chuan
 was an appeal from our Court of Appeal. One of the questions before the Privy Council was whether the mandatory sentence of death upon conviction for trafficking in more than 15g of diamorphine (heroin) was contrary to our Constitution. As evident from Lord Diplock’s speech at 63, [32], the argument presented to their Lordships was that “the mandatory nature of the sentence … rendered it arbitrary since it debarred the court in punishing offenders from discriminating between them according to their individual blameworthiness”. The appellant relied on both Arts 9(1) and 12(1) in making the argument. The Art 12(1) argument was drawn in these terms (
ibid
):
[I]t offends against the principle of equality … since it compels the court to condemn to the highest penalty of death an addict who has gratuitously supplied an addict friend with 15g of heroin from his own private store, and to inflict a lesser punishment upon a professional dealer caught selling for distribution to many addicts a total of 14.99g.
67        The Privy Council ruled that the mandatory death penalty for trafficking in 15g or more of diamorphine was not a violation of Art 12(1). Lord Diplock’s reasoning proceeded thus. First, Art 12(1) requires that like be compared with like. In other words, the individual is assured the right to equal treatment with other individuals in similar circumstances. Art 12(1) does not forbid discrimination in punitive treatment between classes of individuals in relation to which there is “some difference in the circumstances of the offence that has been committed” (at 64, [35]). Second, in 
Ong Ah Chuan
, this difference was in the quantity of the drug involved in the offence. The discrimination that was challenged was that between the imposition of the death penalty upon that class of individuals trafficking in 15g or more, and the imposition of a lesser penalty upon that class of individuals trafficking in less than 15g.
68            Lord Diplock at 64, [37] held that:
The questions whether this dissimilarity in circumstances justifies any differentiation in the punishments imposed upon individuals who fall within one class and those who fall within the other, and, if so, what are the appropriate punishments for each class, are questions of social policy. … Provided that the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is 
not purely arbitrary
 but bears a 
reasonable
 relation to the social object of the law, there is no inconsistency with art 12(1) of the Constitution. [emphasis added]
69        The social object of the MDA was defined at 64, [38] as being “to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade and, in particular, the trade in those most dangerously addictive drugs, heroin and morphine”. Lord Diplock then held, at 64–65, [38]:
The social evil caused by trafficking which the Drugs Act seeks to prevent is broadly proportional to the quantity of addictive drugs brought on to the illicit market. There is nothing unreasonable in the legislature’s holding the view that an illicit dealer on the wholesale scale who operates near the apex of the distributive pyramid requires a stronger deterrent to his transactions and deserves more condign punishment than do dealers on a smaller scale who operate nearer the base of the [p]yramid. It is for the legislature to determine in the light of the information that is available to it about the structure of the illicit drug trade in Singapore, and the way in which it is carried on, where the appropriate quantitative boundary lies between these two classes of dealers. No plausible reason has been advanced for suggesting that fixing a boundary at transactions which involve 15g of heroin or more is so low as to be purely arbitrary.
70        This is the two-step “reasonable classification” test for validity under Art 12(1). A “differentiating measure” such as the 15g differentia is valid if
(a)            the classification is founded on an 
intelligible
 differentia; and
(b)            the differentia bears a 
rational relation
 to the 
object
 sought to be achieved by the law in question.
The test has been applied locally numerous times: see, for example, 
Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v PP
 
[1997] 1 SLR 123
.
71        The appellant attacked the legislative judgment behind the 15g differentia. It was said that the equal protection guarantee under Art 12(1) was “afforded by the intervention of an independent judge,” and that the trial judge had incorrectly “presume[d] that the power of the legislature [had] been exercised properly”. It was further argued that he then “[used] that assumption as a basis for his conclusion”, and thus avoided the real issue, which was the constitutionality of s 7 read with the Second Schedule of the MDA.
72        The appellant cited 
Mithu v State of Punjab
 AIR 1983 SC 473 (“
Mithu
”) as a general example of the way in which he wished us to address the Art 12(1) issue. In 
Mithu
, the issue was whether s 303 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) infringed Art 21 of the Indian Constitution, which is substantially similar to our Art 9. Section 303 provided for a mandatory death sentence only in respect of murders committed by persons already serving a sentence of life imprisonment (“life convicts”). In ruling that s 303 did infringe Art 21, the Indian Supreme court gave extensive reasons as to why it thought that there was “no rational justification” for treating life convicts differently from other offenders. These reasons included, 
inter alia
, the lack of sociological data showing that life convicts had a greater propensity to commit murder.
73        It would have been wrong to decide the issue based on a blind acceptance of the legislative fiat. On the other hand, it is the court’s “duty to declare invalid any exercise of power, legislative and executive, which exceeds the limits of the power conferred by the Constitution, or which contravenes any prohibition which the Constitution provides”: 
Chan Hiang Leng Colin v PP
 
[1994] 3 SLR 662
 at 681, [60] 
per
 Yong Pung How CJ. As such, a fundamental question in every such case is the proper weight that ought to be ascribed to the views of Parliament encapsulated in the impugned legislation.
74        In the appeal before us, it is not as clear (as it was in 
Mithu
) that there is no “rational justification” for the 15g differentia at all. The appellant asserted that it was “axiomatic” that the gravity of the offence could not be gauged by the quantity of the drug alone. Yet the appellant had not provided any material on which we may base such a conclusion.
75        In this respect, it is instructive to refer to the judgment of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in 
Lau Cheong v HKSAR
 
[2002] 2 HKLRD 612
 (“
Lau Cheong
”). In 
Lau Cheong
, the issue before the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal was whether the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for murder infringed the constitutional guarantees against arbitrary punishment and unequal treatment. The court addressed the legislative history of the sentence for murder in Hong Kong at great length, including the 1993 amendment ordinance that promulgated mandatory life imprisonment in place of the mandatory death penalty, and the relevant speeches in the Hong Hong Hansard. They concluded at [102] that the context of this particular case made it appropriate for the court to “give particular weight to the views and policies adopted by the legislature”. In the court’s judgment (at [105]), the legislative history showed that “the question of the appropriate punishment for what society regards as the most serious crime is a controversial matter of policy involving differing views on the moral and social issues involved”.
76        In its approach to the constitutional issues, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal therefore gave due weight to the history of the 1993 ordinance. In particular, it was noted that the legislative debates showed that it had only been possible to abolish the mandatory death penalty by introducing a mandatory life sentence in its place. The court also gave due regard to the fact that the mandatory life sentence was enacted in conjunction with a comprehensive statutory regime for the individualised review of each sentence imposed.
77        The appellant had not placed comparable material before us to properly decide whether the legislative judgment made in s 7 read with the Second Schedule of the MDA is insupportable. In the absence of full arguments on the issue, the 15g differentia is upheld, and the Art 12(1) argument is therefore dismissed.
Article 9 (due process guarantee)
78            Article 9(1) provides as follows:
No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.
79
       
 The appellant’s argument was twofold. First, the mandatory death sentence amounted to arbitrary punishment, which was not deprivation of life “in accordance with law”. It was contended that the mandatory death sentence was arbitrary for two reasons, (a) it flouted the equal protection guarantee in Art 12(1); and (b) it precluded proportional and individualised sentencing, which was protected by the prohibition against cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment. We have considered the first reason in the preceding paragraphs. As for the second reason, the appellant relied on recent Privy Council decisions to support his contention. These are considered below.
80            Second, it was argued that even if the mandatory death sentence was not arbitrary, execution by hanging amounted to cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment.
81        We will consider each argument in turn.
Arbitrary punishment
82        It is well established that the phrase “in accordance with law” in Art 9(1) connotes more than just Parliament-sanctioned legislation. In 
Ong Ah Chuan
 at 62, [26], Lord Diplock held that the reference to “law” was to “a system of law which incorporates those fundamental rules of natural justice that had formed part and parcel of the common law of England that was in operation in Singapore at the commencement of the Constitution”.
83        We do not propose to examine each decision in detail. However, in both 
Watson v The Queen
 and 
Reyes v The Queen
, the mandatory death penalty in respect of certain classes of murder was ruled unconstitutional as a violation of the prohibition against cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment. In 
Matthew v The State
 and 
Boyce v The Queen
, the Privy Council would have ruled the same way but for certain “saving provisions” in the relevant national Constitutions which preserved pre-existing national laws.
84        
Reyes v The Queen
, an appeal from Belize, was considered and distinguished by the trial judge below. In this case, the Privy Council ruled that the mandatory death penalty for murder by shooting was unconstitutional, since “to deny the offender the opportunity, before sentence is passed, to seek to persuade the court that in all the circumstances to condemn him to death would be disproportionate and inappropriate is to treat him as no human being should be treated and thus to deny his basic humanity, the core of the right which s 7 [of the Constitution of Belize] exists to protect”. Section 7 of the Belize Constitution provides that “[n]o person shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment”. There is no equivalent in our Constitution nor in any local Act of Parliament. This was a ground for distinguishing 
Reyes v The Queen.
85        The case was decided in the light of the various international norms that had been “accepted by Belize as consistent with the fundamental standards of humanity”: at [27]. The Privy Council considered the content of a plethora of international arrangements for the protection of human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (“UDHR”), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, and the American Convention on Human Rights. These arrangements, together with a wealth of jurisprudence emanating from national, regional and international courts, showed that an integral part of the prohibition against cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment was proportionality and individualised sentencing. It was against this background that the Privy Council ruled s 102(3)(b) of the Belize Criminal Code, which referred to “any murder by shooting”, to be indiscriminate and therefore void.
86        The above observations equally apply to 
Watson v The Queen
, which is the Privy Council decision of 7 July 2004 in which 
Ong Ah Chuan
 was said to be of doubtful authority. The relevant passages at [29] and [30] read:
… It is no longer acceptable, nor is it any longer possible to say, as Lord Diplock did on behalf of the Board in 
Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor
 
[1981] AC 648
, 674, that there is nothing unusual in a death sentence being mandatory. As Lord Bingham pointed out in 
Reyes,
 p 244, para 17, the mandatory penalty of death on conviction of murder long pre-dated any international arrangements for the protection of human rights. The decision in that case was made at a time when international jurisprudence on human rights was rudimentary …
… The history of these developments is fully set out in 
Reyes
. It is as relevant to the position under the Constitution of Jamaica as it was in that case to Belize. There is a common heritage. In 
Minister of Home Affairs v Fisher
 
[1980] AC 319
, 328 Lord Wilberforce referred to the influence of the European Convention in the drafting of the constitutional instruments during the post-colonial period, including the Constitutions of most Caribbean territories. That influence is clearly seen in Chapter III of the Constitution of Jamaica.
87            However, we are of the view that the mandatory death sentence prescribed under the MDA is sufficiently discriminating to obviate any inhumanity in its operation. It is therefore constitutional.
88        The common law of Singapore has to be developed by our Judiciary for the common good. We should make it abundantly clear that under the Constitution of our legal system, Parliament as the duly elected Legislature enacts the laws in accordance and consistent with the Constitution of Singapore. If there is any repugnancy between any legislation and the Constitution, the legislation shall be declared by the Judiciary to be invalid to the extent of the repugnancy. Any customary international law rule must be clearly and firmly established before its adoption by the courts. The Judiciary has the responsibility and duty to consider and give effect to any rule necessarily concomitant with the civil and civilised society which every citizen of Singapore must endeavour to preserve and protect.
Cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment
89        We now turn to the appellant counsel’s argument that the specific mode of execution is contrary to the prohibition in customary international law against cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment, which is part of the “in accordance with law” requirement in Art 9(1). The appellant relied on Art 5 of the UDHR in support of this proposition. Art 5 provides:
No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
90        To succeed on this ground of appeal, the appellant must first show that the prohibition against cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment amounts to a customary international rule. Next, the appellant must show that a specific prohibition against hanging as a mode of execution is part of the content of that rule in customary international law.
91        There is no difficulty with the first part of the appellant’s argument. It is quite widely accepted that the prohibition against cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment does amount to a rule in customary international law. The prosecution also has not made any assertions to the contrary. The following is a useful summary of the position in customary international law; see 
Restatement of the Law: Third Restatement of US Foreign Relations Law
, Vol 2 (1987) at 165, § 702, reproduced in D J Harris, 
Cases and Materials on International Law
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 5th Ed, 1998) at 725 and 728:
Capital punishment, imposed pursuant to conviction in accordance with due process of law, has not been recognised as a violation of the customary law of human rights. It may, however, constitute cruel and inhuman punishment … if grossly disproportionate to the crime. …
Torture as well as other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, when practiced as state policy, are violations of customary international law.
92            However, there is simply not sufficient State practice to justify the next part of the appellant counsel’s argument as to the content of this customary international rule. The appellant was unable to show a specific customary international law prohibition against hanging as a mode of execution. Indeed, the passage quoted above shows that there is not enough evidence at this time to show a customary international law prohibition against the death penalty generally. According to a report from the UN Commission on Human Rights, 
Question of the Death Penalty: Report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 2002/77
 UN ESCOR, 59th Sess, UN Doc E/CN.4/2003/106 (2003), as at 1 December 2002, the status of the death penalty worldwide was as follows:
 
 
 
 
Number of retentionist countries
 
 
 
71
 
 
 
 
 
Number of completely abolitionist countries
 
 
 
77
 
 
 
 
 
Number of countries abolitionist for ordinary crimes only
 
 
 
15
 
 
 
 
 
Number of countries that can be considered 
de facto
 abolitionist
 
 
 
33
 
 
 
 
The number of States retaining the death penalty was almost equal to the number of States that had abolished it. In most States retaining the death penalty, the mode of execution is by hanging or shooting.
93        The appellant relied on the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in 
Campbell v Wood
 18 F 3d 662 (1994) for their information as to the risk of asphyxiation or decapitation inherent in the procedure of hanging. However, it is worth pointing out that the majority of the Court of Appeals convened 
en banc
 decided that hanging did not amount to cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment. The trial judge rightly observed this in his judgment.
94        We agree with the trial judge’s reasoning on the effect of a conflict between a customary international law rule and a domestic statute. The trial judge held that even if there was a customary international law rule prohibiting execution by hanging, the domestic statute providing for such punishment, 
viz
, the MDA, would prevail in the event of inconsistency. The trial judge cited 
Chung Chi Cheung v The King
 
[1939] AC 160
 and 
Collco Dealings Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners
 
[1962] AC 1
 in support of this proposition. The appellant’s submissions are therefore rejected.
Article 93 (separation of powers)
95        The appellant further asserted that a mandatory death penalty breaches the principle of the separation of powers on which our system of government is based. The principle is evidenced in part by Art 93 of the Constitution, which reads:
The judicial power of Singapore shall be vested in a Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided by any written law for the time being in force.
96        It was said that the mandatory death penalty breached the separation of powers principle because the Legislature did not have the discretionary power to determine the severity of the punishment to be inflicted on an individual member of a class of offenders. That power rightly fells within the province of the judicial branch.
97        The appellant abandoned his argument in respect of the unconstitutionality of the post-sentencing provisions of the CPC. Instead, the post-sentencing provisions were said to be a “statutory demonstration” of the breach of the separation of powers principle effected by the promulgation of a mandatory death penalty. Further, it was said that Art 22P (grant of pardon by the President) did not affect his argument, since it was inconsistent with Art 93.
98        These arguments overlap substantially with the grounds of appeal already considered above. As such, they will not be traversed again, save only to restate that the Privy Council in 
Reyes v The Queen
 did not pronounce mandatory death sentences absolutely unconstitutional, and to make the further point that their Lordships did allow that there might be circumstances in which the mandatory death sentence could be “sufficiently discriminating to obviate any inhumanity in its operation”.
Conclusion
99        For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.

Judith Prakash J:
Introduction
1          This action arises out of a road accident that took place in South Africa in which one passenger of the vehicle driven by the defendant was killed and another was seriously injured. The plaintiffs are first, Mdm Loh Luan Choo Betsy, the wife of the deceased, who is suing on behalf of his estate and also on her own account as a dependent of the deceased and a person who was injured in the accident, and second, her son, who also sustained physical injuries in the accident.
2          In December 2001, the deceased, Mr Lim Him Long, and his family (comprising his wife and three sons) and the defendant, Mr Foo Wah Jek, and his family (comprising his wife, daughter and two sons), were on holiday together in South Africa. The two men were both aircraft maintenance engineers and had worked together for some time. Their families were also on friendly terms.
3          In Cape Town, Mr Lim hired a Volkswagen Caravelle and a driver from a tour agency and they started their private tour in this vehicle on 8 December. The vehicle was classified as a car according to the South African road regulations but from the photographs in evidence, it appears to have been more of a passenger van than a saloon car. On 12 December, the group decided to return to Cape Town. They were then in Kynsna. They left Kynsna at about 10.00am and arrived at noon at a town named Outshoorn. After spending a few hours there, they proceeded to Calitzdorp. At that stage, the driver, Mr Zaid Ebrahim, told the group that he needed to rest as he was fasting and was very tired. Mr Foo then took over the wheel. He had been driving the vehicle for about two hours when the right rear tyre burst. As a result the vehicle veered and subsequently went off the road and rolled over. Both Mr Lim and Mr Foo were thrown out of the vehicle. Mr Lim died instantly. Mr Foo had only minor injuries. Mdm Loh and her son, Lim Yuan Wei, were also injured.
The evidence
4          In her affidavit Mdm Loh stated that on 12 December 2001 at about 3.00pm, Mr Ebrahim had complained of fatigue and had informed the party that he wanted a short rest. Mr Foo, however, wanted to press on with the journey and he unilaterally decided to take over the driving of the vehicle from Mr Ebrahim. She added that at that juncture, Mr Foo did not seek the consent of the other passengers as to whether he should or should not drive the vehicle. After Mr Foo had driven the vehicle for about 15 minutes, his daughter wanted to go to the toilet. Unfortunately, there was no town in the vicinity and Mr Foo then “proceeded to speed up his driving” so as to reach the next town quickly. At about 1745 hours, Mr Foo lost control of the vehicle. It was then travelling towards Barrydale along the R62 road that ran between the towns of Ladysmith and Barrydale. The vehicle then veered off the road.
5          Under cross-examination, Mdm Loh denied that the four adults had had a discussion about who should take over the driving from Mr Ebrahim. She maintained that it was Mr Foo who had persuaded Mr Ebrahim to let him drive but she agreed that the other three adults had not objected to Mr Foo’s proposal. It was put to her that the members of the party had used the toilet facilities at Calitzdorp. After that the vehicle had passed Ladysmith on its way to Barrydale but there had been no request by Mr Foo’s daughter to use the toilet. Mdm Loh disagreed. She maintained that she was awake from the time of the changeover in drivers up to the time of the accident but she could not remember how long Mr Foo had been driving for before the accident took place. She did not agree, however, that the journey took about one and a half to two hours. When asked about the speed of the vehicle, she said she did not know what the speed was. However, she conceded that she had not been concerned that he was speeding and had not felt unsafe. She also agreed that from the time Mr Foo took over the driving up till the time of the incident he had been able to manage the vehicle well.
6          Mdm Loh also stated that before the vehicle went off the road, she heard a loud sound. However, she did not remember what the sound was. She agreed that she was aware before the vehicle went off the road that one of its tyres had burst but she would not agree that she knew it was only after the tyre burst that the vehicle started to go out of control. When asked what had caused the vehicle to go off the road, her answer was “I don’t know”. When asked what Mr Foo had done wrongly that caused the accident, her reply was “negligence”. When she was asked what the act of negligence was, her reply was “I don’t know”. She was then asked whether it was her complaint that Mr Foo was speeding. She replied that it was. She also complained that he was not careful. Finally, she said her complaint against him was that he was speeding and he should not have taken over the driving.
7          Mdm Loh was shown a copy of the statement that she had allegedly given to the Barrydale police after the accident. In that statement, she had said that Mr Foo was not driving the vehicle fast but she could not see how slowly he was going. When shown that statement in court, Mdm Loh asserted that the signature appearing at the bottom of the statement was not her normal signature and said that she could not remember signing it. Subsequently she asserted that she had not given any statement to anyone. Mdm Loh was reminded that Inspector Andrew Mark Lagerwald of the South African Police Services attached to the Barrydale precinct had testified that according to witness statements he had taken, the vehicle was not travelling fast at the time of the accident. It was within the speed limit of 100km/h. In response, she said that Inspector Lagerwald had not taken a statement from her.
8          The evidence of Zaid Ebrahim was that the party had left Outshoorn between 3.00pm and 4.00pm and had subsequently reached the town of Calitzdorp where they stopped at a service station in order that the group could use the toilet facilities. He was very tired by then as it was the fasting month of Ramadan. He therefore informed the group that he would not be able to drive until he had had time to rest. The group felt that stopping would be a waste of time and they then discussed it among themselves. A short time thereafter, Mr Foo told him that he would take over the wheel. He then got into the front passenger seat next to Mr Foo. Mr Ebrahim guided Mr Foo out of the town and once they got onto the highway about five to ten minutes later, Mr Ebrahim went to sleep. He was satisfied at that stage that Mr Foo was a competent driver. He did not know what caused the vehicle to go off the road as he was still asleep at that time.
9          Under cross-examination, Mr Ebrahim said that when Mr Foo volunteered to take over the driving, he had mentioned that he had a driver’s licence. All four adults in the group had spoken to him about continuing the journey with one of them driving. Mr Ebrahim’s evidence was that it would take about 45 minutes to one hour to travel between Calitzdorp and Ladysmith because of the winding nature of the road which is between mountain cliffs on one side and a steep ravine on the other. It would take another 45 minutes to travel between Ladysmith and the place where the vehicle went off the road. Mr Ebrahim told me that he had driven the vehicle for two days prior to the incident and had not experienced any problems either with the brakes or the tyres during that period. He had checked these parts before the party had left on the tour and also while the tour continued. The condition of the tyres was satisfactory as far as he was concerned.
10        The defendant in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief said that he took over the driving of the vehicle because Mr Ebrahim was tired. He discussed the matter with Mr Lim and their respective spouses as all of them were qualified drivers. At that point no one knew that an international driver’s licence was required for foreigners to drive in South Africa.
11        When he took over the vehicle, Mr Foo maintained a speed of about 100km/h. This was the speed limit and, being in a foreign country he did not want to exceed it and be stopped by the traffic police. Besides, all of them were chatting and taking in the sights. There was no urgency for him to drive the vehicle beyond the speed limit or at excessive speed. The accident took place at about 5.30pm. By then he had been driving for about two hours. At that time, they were proceeding along a straight stretch of the road R62 between Ladysmith and Barrydale. There was no other vehicular traffic. The road surface was dry and visibility was very good.
12        All of a sudden, Mr Foo heard a flapping sound and he immediately shouted “[expletive] … tyre burst”. He stepped on the brakes, but the vehicle veered to the right. He released the brakes and turned the steering wheel to the left. The vehicle did turn towards the left and he then stepped on the brakes again with a view to bringing the vehicle to a halt. Instead it veered to the right and this time, Mr Foo could not do anything to prevent the vehicle from going off the road and going down the slope. Mr Foo momentarily lost consciousness. When he regained consciousness he found himself lying in front of the vehicle and on the ground. He realised he had gone through the windscreen. He then saw the deceased’s body lying on the ground. Mr Foo went to help Mr Lim and called his name several times but he did not respond. He then went to help the other passengers who were in the vehicle.
13        Mr Foo maintained that the cause of the accident was the bursting of the right rear tyre. When he took over the driving of the vehicle he did not know that that tyre was defective. It looked fine. On the day of the accident, they had been travelling in the vehicle from 10.00am up to 3.00pm without experiencing any problems. Mr Foo did not know what caused the right tyre to burst. He believed that the accident was inevitable and unavoidable despite the fact that he had used his best endeavours to bring the vehicle under control and prevent it from going off the road. The entire accident happened in a matter of seconds.
14        Under cross-examination, Mr Foo said that he now agreed that, at the time of the accident, he had not been qualified to drive the vehicle in South Africa as he did not have an international driving licence, but then he had thought that there was no such requirement. He also stated that that was not the first occasion on which he had driven in a foreign country. He had previously driven in Australia, France, New Zealand and the United States and had not needed an international driving licence to do so. As regards taking over the wheel when Mr Ebrahim was tired, Mr Foo’s position was that the final decision was made by himself and Mr Lim. He had volunteered to drive because he did not expect the ladies to drive in a foreign country and Mr Lim had poor eyesight.
15        Mr Foo said that from the time he took over the driving up to the time of the accident, he had used the brakes of the vehicle several times. When he applied the brakes normally, there had been no unusual reaction and the vehicle had not swung from one side to another. In his view, the brakes were effective. Under cross-examination, Mr Foo clarified the statement in his affidavit that “when I took over the vehicle, I was going at a speed of about 100kmph”. He explained that that sentence referred to the time when he hit the straight road which was some time after the vehicle had left Calitzdorp. When he started driving in Calitzdorp, his speed was slow as that was an urban area. He disagreed he had travelled at a speed of 100km/h from the beginning. As regards the sentence in his affidavit “besides we were all chatting and taking in the sights”, Mr Foo at first said that he was not chatting away nor enjoying the sights while he was driving. Subsequently, Mr Foo agreed that the sentence in his affidavit referred to his behaviour as well, but he qualified his agreement by stating that most of the time he was concentrating on his driving although the chatting probably involved him too. He also said that there had been very few cars travelling along the road R62 and the phrase “no other vehicular traffic” in his affidavit meant very low traffic but not that there were no other vehicles at all. He clarified that at the time that he heard the tyre-flapping sound, the vehicle he was driving was the only one on that stretch of the road as far as he could see.
16        Mr Foo described the flapping sound as being very loud and sounding like “plup, plup, plup”. It was a continuous sound. When he first heard it he was driving straight along a straight stretch of road. He was not chatting or taking in the sights at that moment though he was looking at the scenery in front of him. The flapping sound came from the rear right hand side of the vehicle. He was not shocked when he heard the loud sound though he had not encountered any situation of a tyre bursting prior to that occasion. Mr Foo was asked whether he had lost his composure after hearing the sound. He replied that he had not as he had taken corrective action after hearing it. He had taught himself the method of dealing with a burst tyre through his years of driving experience, from reading and from other drivers. As he knew it, the method of dealing with a burst tyre was for the motorist to hold on stiffly to the steering wheel and maintain a straight course. The motorist should not apply “hard brakes”. Mr Foo volunteered that he had once had a situation where a tyre had deflated while he was driving along a Malaysian highway. He had dealt with that situation successfully by applying his brakes and bringing the car to a halt. Mr Foo stated that the method of dealing with a deflated tyre while driving was very similar to the method of dealing with a burst tyre.
17        Mr Foo was asked how long he had taken to step on the brakes after hearing the loud sound. His first reply was “a few seconds later”. He was not able to estimate exactly how many seconds had passed but he said that he had definitely not stepped on the brakes immediately. He then explained that the loud sound he heard was the sound of a tyre flapping and that that sound had continued. There was no specific bursting sound followed by a flapping sound. He said it was possible there was a “pop” sound just before the flapping sound but he really could not remember. A few seconds later, he made the first brake application. This was a tap on the brakes made with the intention of slowing down the vehicle. The vehicle then moved to the right and when it did so he released the brakes. He was surprised when the vehicle moved to the right. He remembered turning the steering wheel to the left to bring the vehicle back to a straight travelling line but could not remember whether he had steered gently or violently. The vehicle returned to a straight travelling line and he then stepped on the brakes again with the intention of bringing the vehicle to a halt. This was a hard application of the brakes and the vehicle then veered sharply to the right.
18        Mr Foo was asked whether he had followed the prescribed method of dealing with a burst tyre as described by himself when he encountered that situation on the highway. His response was “I can’t remember. It happened in a split second.” He agreed that on the second occasion that he applied the brakes, he had applied them hard enough to leave tyre marks on the road. When asked to estimate how long it took for the vehicle to leave the road from the time it had first veered to the right, Mr Foo replied that it all happened very fast and might have taken one or two seconds. Later he said that everything happened so fast and he had probably panicked after the first time he had applied the brakes because he was so surprised by the way the vehicle veered to the right. At that stage, he could not tell whether it was necessary to apply the brakes. All that he was thinking of was to save the lives of everyone in the vehicle and bring it to a safe stop. It was pointed out to Mr Foo that in the statement he had made to the South African police, he had not mentioned applying the brakes. He explained that this statement was made immediately after the accident and in conditions that he described as “very traumatised”. The account of the accident in his affidavit was written after he had taken time to recollect everything that had happened and it was the more true reflection of what had happened that evening. It was put to Mr Foo that he did not apply the brakes repeatedly during the incident. He disagreed. With the benefit of hindsight, Mr Foo considered that he should not have applied the brakes at all and should only have tried to keep the vehicle moving straight forward.
19        The Defence called an expert witness, one Mr Johannes Jacobus Heese, who is a senior lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. Mr Heese did a reconstruction of the accident. He visited the accident site and took measurements there. He examined photographs of the damaged vehicle and was given access to the police photographs of the accident scene and the evidence of the South African officers. He was also given information on the course of events by Mr Foo. Mr Heese came to the following conclusions:
(a)        The speed of the vehicle was not in excess of the speed limit of 100km/h at the time when the tyre burst;
(b)        The most probable reconstruction was that the vehicle left the road, travelled through the air for a distance of about 10m and landed again on the left front side and immediately thereafter the left rear tyre made contact with the surface beside the road. The vehicle was in a rotational motion and this caused the blow-out of the left rear tyre;
(c)        The tyre burst due to one or more of the following factors:
(i)         defects in the tyre;
(ii)        road damage to the tyre;
(iii)       internal separation of the plies and breakdown of the air seal; and
(iv)       driving with an under-inflated tyre.
(d)        The sharp swing to the right experienced by Mr Foo on the application of the brakes was not consistent with an intact braking system.
20        Mr Heese elaborated the last point as follows. He noted that the vehicle swung to the right when Mr Foo first applied the brakes. He got the vehicle under control and repeated the attempt at braking. This time the instability swung the vehicle violently to the right. Mr Heese stated that that reaction was not expected since the vehicle had a rear wheel drive and balanced tyres. Initially, when the right rear tyre deflated, the radius of this wheel became less than that of the other driving wheel. Traction would be lost due to this deflated tyre and a gentle swing to the right might be expected. If the accelerator pedal were to be released, braking would be more effective on the undamaged tyre and the swing would usually be arrested. During braking the damaged wheel would not have the same amount of grip and a swing to the left might be expected. This would be dangerous since, to arrest this swing, the right rear side must be relied upon. In this instance, the driver experienced a pull to the right twice after he braked. This could have been the result of two front brakes which were not braking equally. A right front brake out-braking the left front brake would certainly swing the car violently to the right.
21        In court, Mr Heese was told that Mr Foo had testified that he had no complaint about the vehicle’s brakes. Mr Heese was asked to reconcile this statement with the suggestion in his report that the two front brakes might not have braked equally and that was why the vehicle veered to the right. Mr Heese said that normally with a braking system balanced between left and right, application of the brakes should have stabilised the initial swing towards the right. It did not happen in this case. The only explanation he could give was that either the front left brake was not working properly or the right front brake was locking. This fault was not picked up by either Mr Foo or Mr Ebrahim. Normally, when a person applied the brake under controlled circumstances, the person would not be bothered by a slight pull to the right or the left. However, in a situation of panic when the brakes were applied without control then the defect would show up. When I asked the witness whether he was speculating, he agreed that he was.
22        Other evidence adduced showed that the stretch of road where the accident took place was straight and well maintained with good road markings. The road was bordered by a gravelled shoulder and the area beyond the shoulder was about 1.3m lower than the road surface. The road surface was dry at the time of the accident and as it was still daylight and the weather conditions were clear, visibility was good. After the accident, unfortunately, no forensic examination of the right rear tyre was undertaken and thus the cause of the blow-out could not be established. The vehicle has since been scrapped. The owner of the vehicle, Mr Rithwaan Omer, testified that he had bought it, second-hand, shortly before hiring it to the deceased, and at that time the vehicle had passed a roadworthiness test. He also stated that the brakes of the vehicle had been well maintained by him and he had no complaints about the brakes before he hired it out to the deceased. Under cross-examination, Mr Omer confirmed that no repair or maintenance work had been done on the vehicle between the time he bought it and the time he rented it out as it had just gone through and passed its roadworthiness test.
The issues
23        In his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs defined the issues as being:
(a)        whether the defendant was allowed to drive in South Africa without an international driving licence;
(b)        whether the defendant was negligent in the way he drove the vehicle on 12 December 2001.
Breach of statutory duty
24        The first issue can be dealt with fairly briefly. Counsel for both parties had agreed that, at the time of the accident, a Singaporean driver had to hold an international driving licence if he wanted to drive in South Africa. It was against South African law then for a Singaporean who did not hold such a licence to drive in the country. The defendant did not dispute that he did not have an international driving licence at the time of the accident. He should not therefore have taken the wheel of the vehicle and he could, if the South African authorities wish to do so, be prosecuted for having driven it. That breach of South African law, however, does not automatically render the defendant liable to the plaintiffs. The accident was not caused by the defendant’s failure to obtain a valid international driving licence. The evidence before me was that in December 2001, the defendant had had about 25 years of driving experience and held a valid Singapore driving licence. Whilst not technically qualified to drive under South African law, he was a competent and experienced driver.
25        Counsel for the defendant submitted that the law is clear: a defendant who is in breach of a statutory provision such as driving licensing regulations cannot be found liable for damages in a civil action in the absence of negligence. This submission was based on 
Charlesworth & Percy on Negligence
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2001) which states at para 11-12 that the basic rule is that in the ordinary case, breach of a statutory duty does not in itself give rise to a private law cause of action for damages. It is only when construction of the statute in question establishes “that the statutory duty was imposed for the protection of a limited class of the public and that Parliament intended to confer on members of that class a private right of action for breach of the duty” (see 
X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council
 
[1995] 2 AC 633
 at 731) that such a cause of action will arise. The court therefore has to look at the provisions of the statute that has been breached to determine what private rights, if any, accrue from such breach.
26        In this case, there are two possible statutes that were breached: one in South Africa and the other in Singapore. The plaintiffs did not adduce evidence of the South African statute that required a foreigner to hold an international driving licence. Nor did they call any expert witness to testify that that statute was intended to confer a private right of action on persons who were injured by foreigners who drove without a proper licence. Without such evidence, I cannot hold that the defendant’s failure to obtain an international driving licence by itself conferred, under South African law, a right of action on the plaintiffs. As for the position in Singapore, as far as I can see, there was no breach of any statutory duty in here. The Road Traffic (International Circulation) Rules (Cap 276, R 7, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) made pursuant to the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1997 Rev Ed) give the Automobile Association of Singapore and the Deputy Commissioner of Police the power to issue international driving permits to qualified persons who apply for them (see r 4). The Rules do not provide that a person who is going abroad must apply for an international driving permit. Since it is not mandatory for someone to apply for such a permit, the defendant did not breach any Singapore statutory provision. On this issue, therefore, I must find against the plaintiffs.
Negligence or inevitable accident
27        The plaintiffs submitted that the accident was caused by the defendant’s negligence. They submitted that the evidence showed that he did not concentrate on his driving prior to the accident because while he was driving, all the people present in the vehicle, including the defendant, were chatting and taking in the sights. Secondly, he had been driving at an excessive speed and that was the reason why he had to apply the brakes repeatedly thus causing the vehicle to go out of control. Thirdly, the defendant had failed to establish that the vehicle was travelling below the speed limit of 100km/h when the accident occurred. Fourthly, he was negligent in that he failed to steer the vehicle properly and overreacted to the bursting of the tyre causing the vehicle to skid and to overturn.
28        The defence is that of inevitable accident. In the Canadian case of 
Bown v Rafuse
 (1969) 8 DLR (3d) 649, there was an extensive discussion of what a defendant needed to establish in order to successfully maintain a defence of inevitable accident. Dubinsky J considered the 
dictum
 of Cartwright J in 
Rintoul v X-Ray & Radium Industries Ltd
 
[1956] SCR 674
 to the effect that a person relying on inevitable accident had to show that “something happened over which he had no control, and the effect of which could not have been avoided by the greatest care and skill” and noted that in a succeeding paragraph, Cartwright J had referred to “reasonable care”. He also noted that in a 1957 Ontario Court of Appeal case, the view of the Privy Council in 
The Marpesia
 
(1872) LR 4 PC 212
 on inevitable accident had been preferred to that of Cartwright J. In 
The Marpesia
, it was said at 220, following Dr Lushington’s definition in 
The Virgil
 (1843) 2 W Rob 205; 166 ER 730:
[I]nevitable accident … is … that which the party charged with the offence could not possibly prevent by the exercise of ordinary care, caution, and maritime skill.
Dubinsky J followed the Ontario Court of Appeal in adopting this definition. The Privy Council decision has stood the test of time, as far as I am aware, and the plaintiffs have not submitted any authority that impugns that decision. Like Cartwright J therefore, I propose to adopt the definition laid down in 
The Marpesia
. In this case, therefore, to establish inevitable accident, the defendant would have to show that he could not, by exercising ordinary care, caution and skill, have prevented the accident.
29        Before I go on to discuss the facts here, it should be noted that in 
Bown v Rafuse
, what had happened was that while the defendant was driving he heard a gush of air from his left rear tyre and his car immediately began to swerve towards an on-coming truck driven by the plaintiff in the opposite direction. It hit both the plaintiff’s vehicle and the car following it. The defendant did not apply his foot brake or emergency brake before the accident. It was held that while proof of periodic checking of the tyres had indicated them to be in satisfactory condition and thus established that the blow-out of the tyre was unavoidable, such evidence did not establish that the collision was an inevitable result of the blow-out. The defendant had explained that he did not apply his brakes because he had once heard that one should never apply brakes if one has a blow-out or flat tyre. The judge (at 660) found that the road was completely dry and there was no evidence to suggest that either brake on the car was not functioning properly or that the defendant had been driving at an excessive rate of speed. Even if he had been unable to stop the car instantly, had he applied his brakes he would have slowed down considerably the careening vehicle as it moved towards not one, but two other vehicles, and the result might very well have been different. In those circumstances, Dubinsky J held that the defendant had not established that the accident could not have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care on his part. The judge considered that whilst the defendant had been placed in difficult circumstances, he had not shown that what he had done in those circumstances was what a reasonable man might well have done when faced with a similar situation.
30        In considering whether the defendant has made out his defence of inevitable accident, I have also to consider the particulars of negligence relied on by the plaintiffs as these two matters are opposite sides of the same coin. If the defendant was negligent, then the accident could not have been inevitable. If I find the accident was inevitable, then the defendant cannot be considered to have been negligent.
31        The first of the plaintiffs’ allegations was that the defendant had been driving without due attention to the road because he had been chatting and observing the sights while driving. The defendant admitted that he had been chatting and had looked at the sights through the front windshield. That admission in itself does not mean that he was not paying proper attention to his driving. Mdm Loh, who was awake throughout the time that the defendant was at the wheel, agreed that from the time he took over the driving up to the time of the incident, the defendant had been able to manage the vehicle well. She did not make any adverse remark about his driving nor did she adduce evidence from any of her children as to the manner in which the defendant had driven. In fact, she felt safe during the journey. Whilst Mdm Loh did not remember the route taken, the evidence was that there was a winding stretch of road between Calitzdorp and Ladysmith along the Huysriver pass and one had to drive relatively slowly there. At Ladysmith, there was a junction and a left turn had to be taken to get the vehicle onto the R62 road. Mdm Loh had no memory of any incident during this longish journey of one and a half to two hours over unfamiliar terrain and that must be some indication that the defendant’s driving was of a reasonable standard. In my view, there was insufficient evidence to justify a holding that the defendant had not paid proper attention to his driving.
32        The next allegation concerned the speed at which the vehicle was travelling. There were two allegations in this respect. The first was that the defendant was driving above the speed limit of 100km/h and the other was that his speed was excessive in the circumstances. As regards the first allegation, the defendant maintained that he had not been able to drive very fast at the beginning of the trip because of the nature of the road between Calitzdorp and Ladysmith. After Ladysmith and once he was on the R62 road, he had travelled within the speed limit but he did not know what his speed just before the accident was. According to Mr Heese’s reconstruction, based on the skid marks that the vehicle left on the road, at the time the defendant applied the brakes for the second time, the speed of the vehicle was between 84 and 91km/h. He estimated that the speed of the vehicle before the brakes were applied for the first time was probably about 10km/h faster, 
ie
, between 94 and 101km/h.
33        There was no other evidence of what the defendant’s speed was. Mdm Loh testified that she did not know what the speed of the vehicle was. She did maintain that the defendant speeded up 15 minutes after he took the wheel, because his daughter wanted to go to the toilet and he was trying to get to the next town as quickly as possible for her sake. That evidence was not, however, very credible as at the time the defendant took the wheel, the group was in Calitzdorp and 15 minutes later, they were on their way towards Ladysmith. If a toilet stop had been desired soon after the defendant started driving, it would have been made at Ladysmith before the vehicle got on to the R62 road. Yet, Mdm Loh agreed that no stops were made after the defendant started driving. The defendant’s daughter, Michelle Foo, testified that she had not made such a request of her father while he was driving. Significantly, her evidence on this point was not challenged by counsel for the plaintiffs. Additionally, in the statement she made shortly after the accident, Mdm Loh stated that the defendant had not been driving fast. Whilst she sought to disavow that statement before me, I found her disclaimer to be unbelievable. It is notable that shortly after the accident Mdm Loh did not assert that the defendant had been speeding.
34        Whilst counsel for the plaintiffs did challenge Mr Heese’s reconstruction, I found Mr Heese to be a competent and convincing witness. His calculations were based on measurements that were different from those of the traffic police. However, the measurements were made at the site and I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of his observations. He convinced me that any mistake in the measurements of the accident site was made by the police and not by him. The plaintiffs did not call any rebuttal evidence on this point from the South African police although they had been able to arrange for one of the police officers to give evidence through video link at the beginning of the trial. I therefore find that the defendant’s speed at the time of the accident did not exceed the speed limit for the R62 road.
35        That is not the end of the matter. Even if the defendant was travelling within the speed limit, admittedly his speed was very close to that limit of 100km/h. The question is whether he was travelling at a speed that was excessive in the circumstances. The speed limit for a particular road specifies the maximum speed at which one can legally travel along that road, but that does not mean that a driver who drives his vehicle at that speed can never be considered to be driving at an excessive speed. Whether a particular speed is excessive or not will depend not only on the speed limit but also on the road and weather conditions at any particular time. In this particular case, the road was straight, there was very little other vehicular traffic on the road (in fact when the accident happened there were no other vehicles nearby), weather conditions were good and visibility was clear. Mdm Loh did not feel unsafe by reason of the manner in which the defendant was driving. She also confirmed that none of the other passengers had objected to or commented on the way he was driving. Mr Ebrahim managed to sleep throughout the journey until the accident took place. In my view, the evidence establishes that the defendant was not driving at an excessive speed just before the accident even though his speed was probably at or close to the speed limit.
36        I now come to the nub of the case: the bursting of the tyre and the events that happened thereafter. The plaintiffs have not alleged that the defendant was responsible in any way for the fact that the tyre burst. In this they were wise as the defendant was not the owner of the vehicle or in any other way responsible for the maintenance and condition of the tyres. Further, the vehicle had carried the party for a few days and nothing had occurred to put the defendant on notice as to the condition of the tyres. Mr Ebrahim’s evidence was that he had checked all the tyres and they were in good condition. In relation to the tyre, the plaintiffs’ allegation in their final submission is that the defendant did not properly handle the urgent situation that arose when the tyre burst.
37        The plaintiffs pointed out that the defendant had applied the brakes twice after the tyre burst. The first application was a light tap while the second application was a hard braking action intended to stop the vehicle completely. These actions had been taken despite the defendant’s knowledge, as appeared from his testimony, that the correct method of dealing with a burst tyre was to “[h]old on stiff to the steering wheel. Maintain straight. Do not apply hard brakes.” The defendant had failed to do what he asserted was the right and prudent thing to do in reaction to a burst tyre situation. The plaintiffs further submitted that it was unreasonable for the defendant to apply the brakes a second time and/or to brake hard on the second occasion. The veering of the vehicle after the first application of brakes (when the defendant had merely tapped the brake pedal), ought to have been a warning to him against a second application of the brakes. Yet he exacerbated the situation by applying them again and more strongly.
38        The plaintiffs also submitted that the defendant had to brake repeatedly because the vehicle was travelling at an excessive speed and it was due to the speed of the vehicle that it veered right on the second occasion after it was brought back to a straight travelling line. Since the defendant had managed to regain control of the vehicle after it veered to the right when he applied the brakes for the first time and since, at that time, the vehicle was travelling along a straight road with no other vehicles in sight, there was no real urgency to compel the defendant to brake hard in order to halt the vehicle completely. The plaintiffs submitted that in all probability, the vehicle would have travelled in a straight path if the brakes had not been applied the second time. The prudent course for the defendant to follow in the circumstances would have been to release the accelerator completely and allow the vehicle to slow down until it came to a complete stop, or for him to allow the vehicle to slow down somewhat and then reapply the brakes gently in order to bring it to a complete stop. Their conclusion was that the defendant’s hard application of the brakes and his failure to maintain a firm grip on the steering wheel had caused the accident.
39        The defendant’s reply was that it was not the speed of the vehicle nor the application of the brakes in itself that had caused the vehicle to go off the road. He submitted that the reaction of the vehicle to the application of the brakes after the bursting of the right rear tyre was not normal. Mr Heese had stated that in such a situation, a gentle swing to the right might be expected before the brakes were applied. During braking, however, a swing to the left might be expected because the brakes would have a greater effect on the left front and rear wheels. In this case, the defendant instead twice experienced a pull to the right after braking. Mr Heese explained this unexpected reaction by theorising that the two front brakes had not been equally effective. If the right front brake was more effective than the left front brake, then the vehicle would definitely swing to the right. He might have been speculating but that is not by itself a reason to discard the explanation proferred by Mr Heese. This explanation was coherent and credible.
40        The defendant submitted that it was not his actions that had caused the vehicle to pull violently to its right when he braked after the bursting of the tyre. During the period before the incident, the brakes had worked well and thus the unexpected disparity in the braking efficiency between the left and right wheels could have been brought about by the bursting of the tyre. It was not his action but the unforeseeable reaction of the brakes that led to the accident.
41        The evidence before me was that if a tyre deflates or bursts while the vehicle is being driven, an unstable situation is created. The issue is how best to deal with that situation. Various cases cited to me by counsel for the defendant showed that different views had been taken by different judges depending on the circumstances. In some cases like that of 
Bown v Rafuse
 ([28] 
supra
), the driver of the vehicle with the burst tyre was found negligent for not applying his brakes. In 
Madyosi v SA Eagle Insurance Co Ltd
 1990 (3) SA 442 (“the 
Madyosi
 case”), on the other hand, the driver of a bus did not apply his brakes when a tyre burst and the bus subsequently left the road and overturned, yet the driver was held not to have been negligent. In this case, during the trial, counsel for the plaintiffs himself displayed some uncertainty as to what the proper method of approaching such a situation would be. His questions showed that the plaintiffs were trying to establish that the defendant had not applied the brakes at all and that was why the accident happened. It was only in the submissions that the plaintiffs accepted that the defendant had applied the brakes and then used that admission on the part of the defendant as evidence of negligence.
42        The defendant testified that his only previous experience of a similar situation had been when a tyre deflated as he was driving in Malaysia. In that case, he had applied his brakes and brought the vehicle to a stop. He had not then experienced any pull to either side. In this case, the reaction of the vehicle to the first application of the brakes had been completely unexpected and it was this that had unnerved him. The only expert evidence in the case was that of Mr Heese and he stated that the pull to the right was an unusual reaction. He also calculated that it took about 1.25 seconds for the vehicle to leave the road after the second application of the brakes. The usual time in which a driver would be able to react to a situation on the road was 1.5 seconds, according to Mr Heese. Therefore, he said, the defendant had no time in which to react to the second and violent swing of the vehicle to the right and there was nothing he could do from that point onwards to avoid the accident. The accident was inevitable. No one has been able to estimate the time lapse between the first and second applications of the brakes. The defendant himself said that everything happened in almost a split second and that he had no time to decide what to do but had to simply react and he did this by applying the brakes again in order to bring the vehicle to a complete halt. Unfortunately, this action had the wrong result. There is of course no way of knowing whether the accident would still have happened if he had not applied the brakes at all. In the 
Madyosi
 case after all, the driver was unable to prevent the vehicle from leaving the road and overturning despite his efforts to keep it on a straight course on the road.
43        As counsel for the defendant submitted, one has to scrutinise the defendant’s conduct within the context of the situation with which he was faced to determine whether a driver of ordinary skill and competence would have reacted in the same way. It is relevant that once an ordinary driver is faced with an unstable driving situation, his main aim would be to bring the vehicle in which he is travelling to a stop as soon as possible. It is also relevant that the ordinary driver is not trained in dealing with emergencies such as that created by the bursting of a tyre. In this case, the defendant had the theoretical knowledge that one should not apply the brakes hard in such a situation but should attempt to keep the vehicle on a straight course until it comes to a stop. However, he also had had a previous experience where the application of the brakes had resulted in a safe outcome. He was driving his family and his friends and was concerned for their safety above all bearing in mind the unfamiliar road and driving conditions. He therefore tried to slow down the vehicle in order to bring it to a stop and when his first application of the brakes caused the vehicle to veer, he overreacted by applying the brakes more strongly the second time. In hindsight he thought that he had done the wrong thing but at the time he was doing his best to control the situation for the safety of everyone in the vehicle.
44        In my view, the defendant was not negligent. He was faced with an agonising situation. He took the course of action that had worked in the past. There was some indication that this course of action was not suitable for this vehicle but he had to make a split second decision and was not afforded the luxury of the time needed to logically process the consequences of the first braking action. It would have been counter-intuitive in the circumstances for him to let the vehicle proceed at its own pace till it stopped. He was frightened for the safety of his family and friends and did what he thought was the right thing, on the basis of his previous experience, to keep them safe. It is easy in hindsight to criticise him and say that he should not have braked the second time but it must always be remembered that the dangerous situation the defendant was in was not created by any action on his part and all he could do was to react to it in the best way that he knew. There is no basis for holding that his reactions were any different from those of the ordinary and careful driver placed in the same situation. That he reacted in what turned out to be the wrong way has meant tragic consequences for the plaintiffs and the deceased and for the defendant himself. Having seen him in the witness box, I know that the defendant will be haunted for a long time to come, if not for the rest of his life, by the decisions he took on 12 December 2001. Nevertheless, no matter how much the defendant may privately castigate himself for his actions on that day, such regrets do not make him responsible in tort for the sad outcome of something that was done with the best of intentions for all concerned and with the exercise of ordinary care and skill.
Conclusion
45        In the circumstances, I find that the defendant was not negligent in his handling of the vehicle when the tyre burst and that the bursting of the tyre made the accident inevitable. This case must therefore be dismissed. I will hear the parties on costs.",2004-10-15 00:00:00,SG High Court

Kan Ting Chiu J:
1          This is an exceptional case arising out of rather unexceptional beginnings. A car was damaged in a road accident, after which it was towed to a workshop for repairs. Then matters became contentious. No repairs were done for five years while the car owner and the workshop argued over the conditions for the repairs. The workshop asked the owner to remove the car and even had the car towed back to the owner’s residence, but the owner refused to take it, and the car was brought back to the workshop. The workshop took action to compel the owner to remove the car from the workshop, and the owner filed a counterclaim for loss arising from the deterioration of the car and the loss of use of it.
2          The plaintiff, Stuttgart Auto Pte Ltd, the agent for Porsche cars, was the workshop in question. The car was a Porsche 964, registration number SBY8919S (“the car”). The defendant, Dr Ng Shwu Yong, was the registered owner of the car. However, she left her husband, Mr Dennis Chee Boon Keng (“Chee”), to deal with the repairs and the workshop.
3          On 24 August 1998, the defendant met with an accident while driving the car. She called the plaintiff’s hotline and it was arranged that the car be towed to the plaintiff’s workshop for repairs. On 28 August 1998, the plaintiff issued to the defendant an estimate of the cost of the repairs in the sum of $76,650.00. The plaintiff refused to carry out the repairs until the defendant had issued her written authorisation. The defendant refused to take the car away, and it remained at the workshop with no repairs done. The plaintiff tried to return the car on 15 May 2001, but was rebuffed. Although attempts were made to seek a resolution and revised estimates were issued, the impasse persisted. In the course of the hearing before me, I authorised the plaintiff to return the car to the defendant’s residence, and this was done on 27 September 2003. I agreed with counsel for the plaintiff that the car should go back to the defendant as the counterclaim was for damages and not for an order of specific performance for the plaintiff to repair the car – see [10] below.
The pleadings
4          The action was filed by the plaintiff in the District Court in April 2000. In the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had not given the necessary authorisation to carry out the repairs,
[1]
 
and had refused to remove the car. The plaintiff sought an order that it be allowed to tow the car to the defendant’s residence, and it sought to recover towing and storage charges from her.
5          The defendant filed her defence on 9 May 2000, and amended it two and a half years later on 28 September 2002 to make a counterclaim. The size of the counterclaim caused the action to be transferred to the High Court.
6          In the Amended Defence and Counterclaim, the defendant denied that she had not authorised the repairs and asserted that:
(a)        She had instructed the plaintiff verbally through Chee to proceed with the repairs;
(b)        She had confirmed those instructions in writing; and
(c)        When she deposited $60,000 with the plaintiff’s solicitors, that was confirmation that she wanted the car to be repaired by the plaintiff.
[2]
7          In the Counterclaim, the defendant alleged that:
(a)        The plaintiff was the sole authorised service agent in Singapore for Porsche cars;
[3]
(b)        The plaintiff had refused to send the car to Germany to be repaired by the manufacturers, and she was unable to send the car to Germany herself without the plaintiff’s clearance in writing.
[4]
 
(The defendant led no evidence to support these allegations);
(c)        On 28 August 1998, the plaintiff had issued a quotation for the repair of the car. The defendant had accepted it “subject to surveyors [
sic
] approval” and had instructed the plaintiff to proceed with the repairs, but the plaintiff did not do so;
[5]
(d)        On 11 May 2000, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff’s solicitors, M/s Colin Ng & Partners (“CNP”), to authorise the plaintiff to commence repairs and paid a deposit of $60,000,
[6]
 
and
(e)        On 11 July 2000, the plaintiff sent another estimate for the cost of repairs. The defendant instructed the plaintiff to commence repairs. When the plaintiff requested the estimate to be signed, she faxed that to the plaintiff’s solicitors on 29 November 2000, but the plaintiff still failed to carry out the repairs.
[7]
8          From the Amended Defence and Counterclaim, the contract to repair the car was alleged to be constituted by (a) the acceptance of the quotations of 28 August 1998; (b) the letter to CNP of 11 May 2000 and the payment of $60,000; or (c) the return of the estimate of 11 July 2000 or 29 November 2000.
9          The defendant pleaded in the alternative that:
[T]he Plaintiffs were negligent in that as the sole authorized service agent in Singapore for Porsches the Plaintiffs failed to repair or provide proper advice to the Defendant who had sent the Porsche to them for repair. The Plaintiffs owes [
sic
] a duty of care to the Defendant upon the receipt of the damage [
sic
] Porsche, or upon the receipt of the S$60,000.00 deposit for the repair of the Porsche.
[8]
10        In her counterclaim she claimed:
1.       Loss due to depreciation of the Porsche at
 (S$670,000.00 cost of car – S$80,000.00 scrap
 value of car) / 10 years life of car x 4 years
 repair time delay, or to the date of repair;
 total estimated at                                                S$236,000.00
2.       Loss of use based on S$300.00 per day x 365 days
 x 4 years, (This is based on market rental rate of
 about S$200.00 per day for a 2.5 litre capacity car.
 The Porsche is about 3.6 litre capacity)
 Total estimated at                                               S$438,000.00
11        The hearing of the action spread over eight days in three tranches on 7 and 8 April 2003, 15 September to 22 September 2003 and 16 April 2004.
12        On the first day of the hearing, the defendant applied to amend the Amended Defence and Counterclaim further, mainly to add a further cause of action of bailment to the counterclaim. I disallowed the application because it was plainly unjustified for the defendant to add a new cause of action a year and a half after she had filed her counterclaim, and leaving it to the commencement of the trial to do it when all the facts she was relying on were known to her from the time she made the counterclaim.
13        The hearing did not proceed smoothly. This was due partly to Chee being argumentative and evasive in the witness box. To compound that, he was unable to continue with his evidence after his first attendance on grounds of his health. This led to my direction after several delays in continuing with the hearing that the defence was to close if he continued to be unavailable, after which he returned and resumed his evidence with no apparent difficulty. Counsel also contributed by not confining themselves to the pleadings. As a consequence, the case lost focus on occasions, and matters not pleaded were brought into contention. I will, however, confine my decision to the issues pleaded.
Whether there was oral authorisation
14        The defendant had called the plaintiff’s hotline and arranged for the car to be towed to the plaintiff’s workshop on 24 August 1998. In her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she deposed that:
I had on 24 August 1998 authorized the Plaintiffs, Stuttgart Auto Pte Ltd to repair the Porsche to its mint original condition and I undertook to pay the invoice amount and all other costs which may be incurred in the course of the repair work, less any deposit. I told the Plaintiffs to repair the Porsche and the Plaintiffs accepted my offer to repair in that they arranged to tow the Porsche to their workshop for the repairs. Subsequently, they also accepted a deposit of S$60,000.00. I left the costs of repair to the Plaintiffs.
15        She was asked about the arrangements made on 24 August 1998:
Q:      Was there any agreement that the repairs and the costs of repairs [were] subject to an appraisal being done on the car?
A:      No, we didn’t have time to discuss that. It was at the accident and I was crying and I called and he [Andrew Ang, Sales Manager of the plaintiff] answered so he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll get it done, nicely repaired it properly back to you” and I said, “Sure, go ahead.”
Q:      Was there any agreement on the amount of deposit that you had to place before Stuttgart will proceed with the car’s [repairs]?
A       I don’t remember discussing that with him.
Q       Was there any indication given to Andrew whether you were paying for the repairs yourself or claiming from insurance?
A       No.
Q       So it is your evidence that without agreeing on those matters that I’ve just highlighted Andrew said he would repair your car?
A       Andrew said he would take care of everything. He would get the car towed back to the workshop and he would repair it, not to worry.
[9]
16        From the evidence, all that was agreed was that the car was to be brought to the workshop to be repaired. Nothing else was discussed as to the scope, time, costs and payment for the repairs. Clearly no contract was formed in this conversation. Furthermore, the oral instruction referred to in the Defence and Counterclaim was not entered into directly by her, but by Chee on her behalf.
Whether there was authorisation in writing
17        There is a significant difference in the parties’ approach and position on this issue which was reflected in the pleadings. The plaintiff’s case was that the defendant had not issued the 
authorisation
 it required for the repairs to be carried out. The defendant’s case was that she had issued 
instructions
 for the car to be repaired. An authorisation and an instruction may not be the same thing. For example, an instruction for the repairs would be “Get my car repaired and I will pay for it.” But a workshop receiving this instruction may require more from the owner before it agrees to take on the job. It may want the owner to authorise the scope of the repairs to be done, the costs for the repairs, the terms of payment, 
etc
. In this situation, no contract is formed until the authorisation is given by the owner to the workshop.
18        Thus, there is a question whether that defence truly addressed the plaintiff’s case on this point. The plaintiff’s case was that the defendant had not authorised the repairs and costs particularised in the estimate of 28 August 1998 and the subsequent estimates. It never disputed that the defendant had given and repeated her request that her car be repaired. The nub of the case is whether they had entered into a contract to repair the car.
19        The defendant accepted that the plaintiff had issued the quotation of 28 August 1998. In para 16 of her Amended Defence and Counterclaim, she claimed that she “accepted the quotation but subject to surveyors [
sic
] approval”. There was no documentary evidence of this alleged acceptance. When the defendant produced a copy of a letter of authorisation alleged to have been returned, it presented a very different picture (see [30] below).
20        On the contrary, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant more than a month later on 8 October 1998 that:
We note that your vehicle was towed in to our workshop on the 24 of Aug 98 evening.
While a quotation and survey had been carried out, we have yet to receive any further authorisations.
Kindly let us know your instructions and written authorisation early.
Please be informed that, as the quoted job is of a high value, we will require a 50% of the quoted amount as a deposit before we will proceed with repair.
Please also be informed that a storage fee will be levied from 16
th
 of Oct 1998 until the vehicle is started on the repair job. The fees will be $15.00 per day.
21        There was no record of any retort that the authorisation had been returned previously. It is to be noted that even if there was an acceptance as alleged in para 16 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim, it was a qualified or conditional acceptance as it was subject to the surveyor’s approval.
22        The defendant also relied on a $60,000 deposit for the repairs paid to CNP, evidenced by CNP’s official receipt therefor dated 12 May 2000. It was not contended that the payment 
per se
 was authorisation.
23        This payment was referred to in a letter from the defendant to CNP dated 11 May 2000, where she stated that she undertook to pay for the repairs and that “I shall deposit cash cheque $60,000 as security deposit or cash $20,000 and signed credit card” but without stating that she was giving the required authorisation for the repairs. The promised payment was made on 12 May 2000. However, it was not alleged in the Amended Defence and Counterclaim that the defendant also gave the required authorisation at the same time she made the payment. Indeed, if the authorisation were given to the plaintiff and the required payment were made, there would have been no reason for the repairs to be held back, or for the subsequent estimates to be issued.
24        On 11 July 2000 the plaintiff prepared two copies of a further estimate for the repairs in the sum of $53,379.20. This estimate was sent to the defendant by CNP on 13 July 2000 with the specific request: “Please sign and return the original copy of the estimate cost of repair.”
25        Chee acknowledged receipt of this estimate and deposed that he had replied to CNP on 7 August 2000, 
inter alia
, as follows:
Please instruct Stuggart to commence repairs urgently – immediately ASAP to SBY 8919 S, I agree to meet all relevant costs which you can deduct from the deposited $60,000 progressively.
and alleged that “the Plaintiffs were trying to be difficult and demanded the Estimate Cost of Repair dated 11 July 2000 to be returned”.
[10]
26        He was referring to a letter from CNP dated 16 November 2000, which informed him that the plaintiff wanted the estimate of 11 July 2000 signed and returned by 30 November 2000. He claimed that he wrote to CNP on 30 November 2000 and gave further instructions for repairing the car, and forwarded the signed authorisation. Mr Anthony Chey, the solicitor with CNP then in charge of the matter, denied receiving any authorisation from the defendant at any time.
27        The defendant’s case on this point kept changing. It was pleaded in para 20 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim that “the Defendant faxed the estimate of cost of repair that was signed by the Defendant, to Colin Ng & Partner [
sic
] on 29 November 2000”, with no reference to any subsequent posting of it. However, Chee deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the fax did not go through, and he posted the authorisation to CNP on 30 November 2000. If that was the simple truth, why was this not pleaded? I find it difficult to understand or believe the defendant’s position, and I accept Mr Chey’s evidence that he never received the authorisation from Chee.
28        The defendant’s attitude to the authorisation was clearly shown when Chee was re-examined by defence counsel on the last day of the trial. At that stage, a letter of authorisation
[11]
 
signed by the defendant was produced for the first time. According to Chee, the letter was similar in form to the one that came with the estimate of 28 August 1998.
[12]
29        Chee claimed that he returned the signed letter to the plaintiff’s workshop manager Mr Chow Siew Kai (“Chow”) in October 1999,
[13]
 
but that was not shown to him when he gave evidence. Indeed, this was never produced by the defendant before that day.
30        Nevertheless, this letter of authorisation (with handwritten words added thereto denoted in italics and portion cancelled shown) was significant:
LETTER OF AUTHORISATION
I, 
Dr Ng Shwu Yong
, I/C number 
4685818M
, owner of vehicle SBY 8919 S (Porsche 964 Cabriolet) hereby authorise Stuttgart Auto Pte Ltd to proceed with repairs quoted on estimate reference “WSQ/0502/99”
I will make a deposit of 50% of the estimated value on the quotation to Stuttgart Auto Pte Ltd upon this authorisation. (
Quantification of 50% to be discussed
)
I also undertake to pay the invoice amount less the deposit amount and all other cost which may be incurred in the course of the repair work.
I understand that I am giving this authorisation out of my own initiative and will not hold Stuttgart Auto Pte Ltd liable or responsible for any and all cost to me.
 
Not proper as duress techniques.
--- sgd ---
 ____________________________                ______________
Signature of owner of SBY 8919 S                     Date
31        If this letter had been returned to the plaintiff, why was that not pleaded or put to Chow? That aside, the significance of the form was immediately obvious and brought on the following exchange with Mr Mohan Singh, counsel for the defendant:
His Honour:    I think that is the crux of the thing, Mr Mohan. If it hasn’t occurred to you now and this is demonstrated in D1 [the letter of authorisation]. He doesn’t mind paying but he doesn’t like the terms. The form of the authorisation is not acceptable. If nothing is clearer, it’s in D1.
Mr Mohan:     I’m obliged, your Honour.
His Honour:    You see, that is the crux of the whole, that is one of the clearest example. He didn’t want the last paragraph. He wasn’t comfortable signing the thing because its contents were not acceptable to him. The sum was eventually acceptable to him. That is crystal clear but the terms were not and that’s why I am telling. Very soon you are going to do your written submissions. You have to come back and address this because no amount of evidence, agitation, altercation is going to change. The fact of the matter is we all with the benefit of our experience know what makes a contract. If I am willing to contract with you on a certain basis, you either accept it or you walk.
Mr Mohan:     Very well, I’m obliged.
[14]
32        It was very clear that the defendant was only prepared to sign the letter of authorisation that the plaintiff needed with the amendments. That being the case, she had not accepted the plaintiff’s terms, and there was no contract between them.
33        Mr Mohan Singh addressed this point in his written submissions
[15]
 
thus:
As the learned Judge has rightly pointed out at NE719, the issue is primarily: Are the Plaintiffs right to withhold repairs on the car simply because the Plaintiffs wanted a disclaimer from liability? The Defendant contend that the Plaintiffs do not have such a right as the Plaintiffs did not bring up such a term at the time of contract, namely for the contracts entered into on 24 August 1998, on or around 28 August 1998, 12 May 2000, and on or around 29 November 2000. The Plaintiffs are therefore precluded from using a term they subsequently introduce [
sic
] into the contract to disclaim liability under the contract. If the term is so important to the Plaintiffs such as to be regarded as a condition of the contract, which upon failure to comply would entitle the Plaintiffs to repudiate the contract for repairs, the Plaintiffs should have brought the issue up during negotiations; and not after the contract for repairs had been concluded.
34        The submission is sustainable only if there was a prior concluded contract, but I have found no prior or later contract. The references to contracts of 2000 were out of place because Chee alleged that he returned the authorisation to Chow in October 1999. If that event took place, it must have happened before 2000 as Chow left the plaintiff’s employ in November 1999. Apparently even counsel had difficulty following the defendant’s case. As there was no prior concluded contract, there was nothing to prevent the plaintiff from adding to or modifying its terms when dealing with a difficult customer. The latter had two options: accept the terms offered, or find another repairer.
Conclusion
35        There being no contract for the plaintiff to repair the car, the counterclaim fails.
36        As the car had already been returned to the defendant, there is no necessity for any order therefor now. Instead, I will give judgment to the plaintiff for the cost of delivering the car to the defendant on 27 September 2003. I also order that the defendant pay the plaintiff damages for not removing the car from 16 October 1998 (as the plaintiff had stated in its letter of 8 October 1998 that storage charges were payable from that day) to 27 September 2003. As no rate of storage charges had been agreed between the parties, this shall be assessed by the Registrar.
37        The counterclaim fails where it was based on any contract for the repair of the car. It also fails on the alternative basis of negligence in that there was no duty of care on the plaintiff, as the car remained in the workshop against the plaintiff’s wishes.
38        The defendant is to pay the plaintiff the costs of the action to be taxed on the High Court scale. I order that the $60,000 the defendant had paid to the plaintiff be applied towards the damages and costs payable to the plaintiff.

1  The three accused persons faced two charges. Ng Beng Siang was charged that he
on or about the 27
th
 day of March 2002, at Sembawang, Singapore, did engage with one Rosdi Bin Pungot (NRIC No.: S1675308D) and one Roseley Bin Sidin (NRIC No.: S1360725G) in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, to wit, to traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class ‘A’ of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, namely, 20 bundles of substance containing not less than 48.21 grams of diamorphine, and in pursuance of the said conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on the 27
th
 day of March 2002, to wit, (he) drove (his) motor car JFY 5311 from Malaysia into Singapore for the purpose of transporting and delivering the said controlled drugs to the said Rosdi Bin Pungot and the said Roseley Bin Sidin, and on the same day, between 1.00 pm and 1.25 pm, at Blk 406A, Sembawang Drive, Singapore, the said Rosdi Bin Pungot, on behalf of himself and the said Roseley Bin Sidin, took possession of the said controlled drugs for the purpose of trafficking from (his) motor car JFY 5311, and (he) has thereby abetted the commission of the offence of trafficking in the said controlled drugs by the said Rosdi Bin Pungot and the said Roseley Bin Sidin, and (he) has thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, read with section 12 of the said Act, and punishable under section 33 of the said Act.
and Rosdi Bin Pungot and Roseley Bin Sidin were charged that they
on the 27
th
 day of March 2002, between 1.00 pm and 1.25 pm, in the vicinity of Blocks 406A, 410 and 417, Sembawang Drive, Singapore, and in furtherance of the common intention of (them) both, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class ‘A’ to the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in (their) possession for the purpose of trafficking 20 bundles of substances containing not less than 48.21 grams of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and (they) have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.
The three of them are referred to as the first, second and third accused respectively.
The arrests
2  All of them were arrested on 27 March 2002 by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (""CNB""). CNB officers were first deployed by ASP Ang Choe Seng to search for the second accused in the car parks around Block 313 Sembawang Drive, who was believed to be driving a motor car SCG 5421M. Subsequently ASP Ang also instructed the officers to search for another car SBP 6331Y. ASP Ang believed that the third accused was driving this car, although he did not disclose this in his instructions.
3  The officers eventually spotted SBP 6331Y at about 12.55 pm as it went along Sembawang Drive from the direction of Admiralty Drive, in the direction of Admiralty Link. It turned right from Sembawang Drive into the driveway in front of the multi-storey car park at Block 406A, then made its way to the side road between Blocks 412 and 415 where it came to a loading bay. The third accused parked the car there, and walked to the void deck of Block 411. He was joined by the second accused, and they went on to the void deck of Block 410 where they sat on a bench at about 1.05 pm.
4  At about 1.15 pm another car JFY 5311 driven by the first accused entered the multi-storey car park at Block 406A and parked at one of the parking lots. The first accused came out of the car and walked away from the car park.
5  Soon after he left, the second accused entered the car park. He went to the car and took a haversack from the front passenger seat. He then left the car park and walked towards the direction of Block 410.
6  The second and third accused were seen leaving the void deck of Block 410 together and were walking towards Block 418 Canberra Road when instructions were given to arrest them. As the officers approached them, they ran, and the second accused dropped or threw the haversack in the process. The officers caught up with them and placed them under arrest. The haversack was recovered and was found to contain 20 wrapped bundles. The contents of these bundles form the subject matter of the two charges.
7  At about the same time the first accused returned to the car park to his car JFY 5311. He entered the car, drove out of the car park. He was trailed by other CNB officers. When he came to the junction of Sembawang Drive and Sembawang Crescent, he stopped at the traffic lights, and he was arrested.
8  After that the car was searched, and a plastic bag was found in the boot. Inside the plastic bag were five bundles of similar appearance to the 20 bundles in the haversack.
9  In the course of investigations, statements were recorded from the three accused persons. There was no challenge over the admissibility of the statements made by the second accused and the third accused. When the prosecution sought to admit in evidence the statements of the first accused, this was resisted (except for his cautioned statement), on the ground that the statements were not voluntary statements. Consequently a 
voir dire
 was conducted in respect of the disputed statements, the first recorded by Station Inspector Ronnie See Su Khoon on the day of arrest, and three statements recorded by the investigation officer Inspector Abdul Halim bin Abdul Rahim on 1 and 5 April.
The voir dire
10  The first accused claimed that he did not make the statements voluntarily. His complaints start from the moment of his arrest. When his car stopped behind another vehicle at the junction of Sembawang Drive and Sembawang Crescent Staff Sergeant M Subramaniam came to the car. SSgt Subramaniam was unable to open the car door. When he saw the first accused reaching for the gear shift, SSgt Subramaniam drew his revolver and pointed it at the first accused’s head. The first accused then unlocked the door. He was taken out of the car, handcuffed, and was taken to the back seat of the car. No statements were taken from him throughout this time.
11  Subsequently, when Station Inspector See Su Khoon arrived at the scene, the first accused was taken from the back seat and brought to the boot of the car. The boot was opened and a plastic bag was discovered and was opened. According to the first accused, SI See asked him twice what the bag contained, and he said he did not know on each occasion. Then SSgt Subramaniam intervened. He took out his revolver again, pointed it at the back of his head, told him not to feign ignorance and asked him whether it was heroin. He was frightened and said ""If you say it is heroin, then it is heroin"". After that, he was brought back to the back seat of the car. No statement was recorded from him on this exchange.
12  SI See started to question him after he was brought back into the car. At that stage he did not admit that the bag contained heroin although he was still frightened by SSgt Subramaniam’s actions.
13  SSgt Subramaniam admitted that he had drawn his revolver and pointed it at the first accused when he was inside the car. His explanation was that he was concerned that the first accused may attempt to drive away and endanger the safety of other persons, although the car was in a stationary position at that time.
14  A CNB officer pointed a firearm at a suspect when there was no resistance or aggression. Counsel submitted that SSgt Subramaniam had abused or exceeded his powers. I will not pass judgment on this, and trust that the CNB look into it. The incident appeared to have a limited effect on the events that followed. Firstly, SSgt Subramaniam did not say anything to him about any offence or anything that he was carrying. Secondly, when SI See asked him about the contents of the plastic bag in the boot, he was not cowed into submission, but denied knowledge of it.
15  According to the first accused he yielded after the second incident of gun-toting when he agreed with SSgt Subramaniam that there was heroin in the plastic bag.
16  This incident was disputed by the officers. SI See and SSgt Subramaniam denied that the latter was with the first accused when he was taken to the car boot, and both of them denied that SSgt Subramaniam spoke to the first accused or pointed his revolver at him at the boot.
17  The other three statements were statements recorded by Insp Halim with the assistance of Hokkien interpreter Bennet Tan Chee Leong. Two statements were recorded on 1 April, separated by a lunch break, and the third statement was recorded on 5 April.
18  The first accused alleged that when he was first brought to Insp Halim’s room on the morning of 1 April, the inspector introduced the interpreter to him. He told them that SSgt Subramaniam had pointed a gun at him, but there was no reaction from them. He then asked for a drink of water and the interpreter left the room with a mug to get it.
19  While the interpreter was away, the inspector told him that he had wanted to arrest the other two accused persons for a long time (the first accused knew that the second and third accused were also arrested), but had no evidence against them. The inspector told him in a mixture of Hokkien and Malay that he was facing a capital charge and told him that he would give him a chance to avoid the death penalty if he testified that the heroin 
belonged
 to those two persons. (This part of his evidence was at variance with the case put to the inspector that he was told to say that the two persons 
took
 the heroin.)
20  He thought over the offer and decided to accept it. He did not seem to know if he conveyed his decision to the inspector. His evidence was (i) that he did not, (ii) that he said ""OK, I would go ahead with the exchange"", then (iii) that he could not remember. He then proceeded to give his first statement with the help of the interpreter who had returned to the room by then.
21  Insp Halim was unable to remember if he had arranged for the first accused to have a drink on that morning before recording his statement. However he remembered that he did not tell the first accused of his interest in the second and third accused and the lack of evidence against them, and he denied making the offer to the first accused in exchange for his co-operation.
22  The interpreter’s evidence was that the first accused did not mention that a gun had been pointed at his head. He also did not recall leaving the inspector’s office to fetch a glass of water for the accused. He went on to say that it was not his duty to fetch drinks for accused persons, and he had never done that.
23  At the end of the 
voir dire
, I reviewed the evidence. The first accused agreed that when he was at the car boot, there were pedestrians looking at him, and there were cars behind his car. I found it difficult to believe that SSgt Subramaniam would have pointed his gun at the accused who was already under arrest and handcuffed in front of those members of the public who were present.
24  In addition to that, I also took into consideration the officers’ roles at that time. SSgt Subramaniam was instructed to assist in the arrest, and he had done that. After the arrest, the first accused was taken to the back seat of the car. By his own account nothing happened till SI See arrived at the scene later. When he came, SI See took over custody of the first accused, took him to the boot of the car, and questioned him about the contents of the plastic bag.
25  The evidence pointed to SSgt Subramaniam’s dealings with the first accused terminating with the arrest. He did not have custody of the first accused and he did not search the car or ask him any questions. That was left to SI See who took over custody of the accused and had the car boot opened and took steps to ascertain the ownership of the plastic bag.
26  It is hard to imagine that SSgt Subramaniam would have interrupted SI See when he questioned the first accused at the boot of the car, and then pulled a gun on him in full view of the public. At that time things were in the control of SI See who was senior to him in rank and did not seek his help.
27  With regard to the inducement alleged against the inspector, it was supposed to be given during the few minutes that the interpreter left the room to fetch the drink for the first accused. However, the interpreter was specific that he never fetched drinks for accused persons because that is not his job.
28  The inspector denied that he offered to help the first accused avoid capital punishment if he co-operated in the investigations against the second and third accused. The nature of the co-operation sought was unclear – was the first accused was to say that the heroin belonged to them (as the first accused claimed) or that they took the heroin (as was put to the inspector)?
29  Looking at all the evidence, I did not believe the first accused’s evidence of SSgt Subramaniam’s threat at the car boot, or the inspector’s inducement at the office. I found that the statements recorded by SI See and the inspector were voluntary statements.
The first accused’s statements
30  The first recorded statement was the statement recorded by SI See in the car on 27 March. The statement was recorded in SI See’s pocket book in Romanised Hokkien. The prosecution agreed to leave out portions of that, and the statement admitted read. Translated into English it reads –
 
Q Before you are arrested, did you give anything to anyone?
 
A Yes, earlier at Block 406 Sembawang, I gave a bag to two Malay.
 
 
Q What is inside the Bag?
 
A Inside contains heroin.
 
 
Q How much heroin?
 
A Twenty balls of heroin.
 
 
Q You say you gave a bag containing twenty balls of heroin to two Malays at Blk 406 where?
 
A In the Car Park. When I arrived at the car park, I park the car and walk away. A short while, two Malay went inside my car, took the bag and left. I then return to the car and drive.
 
 
Q How you contact the two Malay?
 
A They call my phone. I do not have their phone number.
 
 
Q Do you smoke heroin?
 
A No. I did not smoke heroin.
 
 
Q Do you have anything else to say?
 
A No.
 
31  As I had indicated earlier, there was a cautioned statement that was admitted in evidence without dispute over its admissibility. This was made on the morning of 1 April in response to a charge of trafficking in the 20 bundles in the haversack by giving them to the second and third accused. The statement reads
I do not admit to the charge. The 20 bundles of heroin were not seized from my car. It was taken away by the 2 male Malays.
32  The salient parts of the statement recorded on the morning of 1 April are
2 I am shown photographs of two male personnels. (Recorders note: I showed the accused the photographs labelled P2 of Rosdi Bin Pungot IC: S1675308D and photograph labelled P3 of Roseley Bin Sidin, IC: S1360725G). I identified them as the two male Malays I mentioned in my cautioned statement recorded on 27 Mar 2002 at about 9.40 pm. They are also the two male persons, which I have mentioned to one of the officer who recorded my statement at the scene of the arrest.
3 However, I do not know the names of the two male persons. At the first sight, it looks as if both were Malays to me. But now one of them look like an Indian to me after I was shown the photograph labelled P3.
… …
5 On 27 March 2002 at about 7.00 plus in the morning, I drove JFY 5311 to ""Bai Wan Zhen"" at Johore Bahru. ""Bai Wan Zhen"" is also known as Taman Jaya. … … As arranged, I parked my car near at the big, open area and left it unlocked. I was told by a supplier of the heroin to leave the car door opened so that they can place the heroin in the car.
6 I left the car for a cup of coffee. … About half an hour later, I received a call from the same supplier that everything was ready. I take it to mean that the heroin has already been placed in the car.
7 I was not told where the heroin was kept. I was further informed by the supplier to proceed to a 4 storey carpark at Blk 406A, Sembawang for transaction upon reaching Singapore. The supplier told me to park my car at the first level and then to go for a drink. He told me not to lock the car and that someone would come to the car and pick up the heroin. He further told me that he would contact me once the heroin was taken away.
8 After the call, I returned to pick up my car. I did not check to see where the heroin was kept. As directed, I drove my car to Singapore and headed for Woodlands Checkpoint.
9 I arrived at Woodlands Checkpoint at about 12.15 pm. After clearing the Checkpoint, I drove my car and parked it at a public carpark in Woodlands. The reason why I went to the carpark in Woodlands was because the supplier called me to say that he wanted to take out the heroin from the car. He also asked me to buy a bag. The supplier further informed me to place 20 bundles of heroin in the haversack and gave the remaining 5 bundles to ""uncle"". The call was made to me after I have crossed Woodlands Checkpoint. The supplier did not make such an arrangement with me when he spoke to me at Taman Jaya.
10 I did as directed. After parking the car at a public carpark in Woodlands, I went to buy a black color haversack from a shop nearby. I paid $16 for the haversack. I deliberately left the car door unlocked so that the supplier could get his man to take out the heroin from where it was hidden in the car.
11 About half an hour later, I received a call from the supplier who informed me that everything was ready. I take it to mean that the heroin has been taken out from the hidden spot in the car and placed it in the area where I could see it.
12 I then returned to my car with the black haversack. The car was still unlocked. I saw 25 bundles which I knew to contain heroin lying on the floor of the front passenger and the back seat in the car. I did not know who was the one who had taken out the heroin from the hidden spot in the car. I counted the bundles of heroin and there were 25 altogether.
13 The bundles of heroin were wrapped with some plastic layers and newspaper. I placed 20 bundles of the heroin inside the black haversack; 17 inside the main compartment of the haversack and 3 on the front pocket. I placed the 5 remaining bundles of heroin inside an empty red plastic bag, which I took from the back seat of the car. This red plastic bag was in the car all the time before I went to Taman Jaya.
14 I placed the haversack containing 20 bundles of heroin on the front passenger seat of my car and placed the red plastic bag inside the car boot. I then drove to the carpark at Blk 406A, Sembawang.
33  When the recording resumed in the afternoon after lunch, the first accused stated
15 I knew where the location of the 4 storey carpark was because this was my second trip to the place. Prior to this occasion, I have been to this 4 storey carpark before to deliver heroin. Hence I had no problem finding the carpark.
… …
17 As I was about to turn my car into the carpark at Blk 406A, Sembawang, I saw two male Malays waiting at the void deck of a housing block opposite the carpark. These two male Malays looked familiar to me because I have seen them before when I delivered heroin to this place on my first trip about 2 weeks before my arrest. These are the same male Malays whom I had mentioned in paragraph 2 of this statement.
18 When I saw the two male Malays, it immediately impressed on me that they must be the ones who would pick up the heroin from my car. At this juncture, I saw the two male Malays looking at my direction. We had a glance at each other. I saw them sitting together on a wooden chair at the edge of the void deck.
19 I continued to drive into the 4 storey carpark. After I parked my car at the first level of the carpark. I made no attempt to find out whether there were other cars parked beside my car. I left the haversack on the front passenger seat and left the car unlocked before I walked away. I noticed that the digital clock in the car showed that it was about 1.15 pm. After I stepped out of the car, I made a total of 3 calls.
… …
26 When I approached a T traffic light junction near a primary school, I stopped my car as the traffic light was red. Those cars that were trailing behind me moved forward to block my path. The people in those cars alighted and rushed to my car. One of them flashed a warrant card at me from outside the car. At this point, I realized that this group of people were government people.
27 I unlocked my car door and stepped out. I was handcuffed and put under arrest. My car was searched on the spot. Five bundles in a red plastic bag were recovered in my car boot by one of the officers. The officer showed me the bundles and asked me what it was. I told him that it was heroin.
34. In the statement of 5 April he described his relationship and dealings with his supplier Ah Ken –
31 My supplier is known to me as Ah Ken. I got to know him during the Chinese New Year in February this year through introduction from friends at night entertainment spots behind City Plaza shopping centre in Johore Bahru. My friends told me that Ah Ken is dealing with drugs. During my conversation with Ah Ken, I asked him whether he has any job to offer me. The jobs I mentioned about refer to drug despatch. Ah Ken told me that there were indeed jobs for me and asked me whether I was interested.
32 Ah Ken also told me that I have to find my own way of getting a car to do the delivery. He told me that he would only provide a car for me if I work with him for a longer period of time. Ah Ken also told me that the payment for courier service would be credited to my bank account. I told Ah Ken that I would consider about it. … …
33 About 2 weeks later, Ah Ken phoned me up and asked me whether I had made up my mind. I told him that I accepted the job offer. Ah Ken then told me to wait for further calls from him when the stuffs arrived. When I mentioned about stuffs, I actually refers to heroin.
34 Ah Ken told me that when the heroin arrived, he would call me to drive my car to an arranged spot. At the arranged spot, I would park my car there and left it unlocked. Ah Ken told me that he would ask his own men to load the heroin into my car. After the loading of the heroin into the car, Ah Ken would then contact me again to inform me as to where to send the heroin. Ah Ken told me that I have to send the heroin to Singapore. He would let me know the location of delivery in Singapore when I crossed the Woodlands Checkpoint. Ah Ken told me that I just need to play the role of a courier for him and need not ask too much about the drug deal.
35 Ah Ken told me he would pay me $300 Malaysian ringgit for each bundle of heroin that was successfully delivered. Ah Ken did not provide me with any information on the number of bundles to deliver each time. He would only let me know after I had crossed Woodlands Checkpoint. Ah Ken had told me that the leader of the Singapore Customers would come in personally to make payment to Ah Ken’s boss in Malaysia. He told me not to bother about collecting payment from customers.
36 Ah Ken told me that all I have to do was to park the car at an arranged spot, left it unlocked and walked away. Ah Ken told me that the customers themselves knew what to do. Ah Ken told me that he would inform the customers about the estimated time of my arrival at the scene of transaction and my car number. After the customers have collected the heroin, they would in turn call Ah Ken to inform him about it. Ah Ken would then tell me to let me know the status. Ah Ken is stationed in Johore Bahru.
37 I have no means of contacting Ah Ken. Whenever I received calls from Ah Ken, the screen of my handphone would show that the call comes from a private number.
38 On 27 March 2002, the day of my arrest, Ah Ken has been in regular contact with me right from the time I left Taman Jaya in Johore to the time I delivered the heroin to the two male Malays at Blk 406A, Sembawang. I was taking instruction from him to bring the 25 bundles of heroin into Singapore for delivery to the two male Malays and Uncle.
39 Ah Ken is a close associate of his boss. He has a number of helpers assisting him. Ah Ken’s boss is known as Ah Lai. He is a male Chinese from Penang. Ah Ken is a lone person who moves about very often. I do not know his whereabouts or his place of abode.
40 The delivery that I made on 27 March 2002 was the second trip. Prior to this trip I had made an earlier trip to deliver ten over bundles to the same two male Malays which I had mentioned in this statement. That was my first trip.
41 The first trip was made two weeks before my arrest. The arrangement was also made by Ah Ken. Ah Ken told me that someone would be waiting for me at the arranged location. During this trip, I was told to drive my car to the same four storey carpark located at Blk 406A, Sembawang and parked my car at the first level. Before I turned in to the carpark, I slowed down the car as I expected the customer to be nearby. I saw the shorter male Malay whom I had mentioned in my statement, walking alone at the void deck of a Block opposite the carpark. I believed the shorter male Malay must be the one waiting to collect the heroin from my car.
The statements of the second accused
35 After he was arrested, the second accused was questioned by Insp Xavier Lek Lai Ann. This took place at the void deck of Block 418, Sembawang Drive after the haversack was retrieved and was opened to show the 20 bundles inside.
36  The questions and answers which were recorded in Insp Lek’s pocket book were admitted in evidence without objection -
 
Q What are all these?
 
(Point to the 20 bundles)
 
A I don’t know.
 
 
Q All these stuff belong to who?
 
A Sent to someone.
 
 
Q Who is the someone?
 
A A friend (Boy).
 
 
Q How to contact him?
 
A He will call me.
 
 
Q Who is the person arrested together with you?
 
A Friend (Roseley).
 
 
Q What is he doing with you?
 
A Accompany me here to meet a friend.
 
 
Q Meet the friend for what purpose?
 
A Sent the stuff inside the bag.
 
 
Q Where you get the stuff in the bag from?
 
A At the carpark there.
 
 
Q Who you get it from?
 
A From Rahman.
 
 
Q Where is this Rahman?
 
A Maybe in his house.
 
 
Q Where is Rahman’s house?
 
A Near Vista Point.
 
 
Q Have you been to Rahman’s house?
 
A No.
 
 
Q Do you have Rahman’s contact number?
 
A No.
 
37  The second accused also made three other statements, which were admitted in evidence on his counsel’s initiative. The first of these was the cautioned statement recorded on 27 March in reply to a charge of trafficking in the 20 bundles in the haversack. He said in his cautioned statement
 
My intention of going there was not to traffic. I do not know the haversack contained drug. Roseley also does not know anything about this matter. I hope the judge would consider my explanation.
 
38  On 5 April, Insp Halim recorded an investigation statement from him, where he said
 
I am also known as Adi among my friends and family members.
 
2 On 27 March at about 11.00 plus in the morning, a friend of mine named Rahman telephoned me on my handphone. He told me that he wanted to see me to talk. He told me that he wanted to talk to me about work. He told me to meet him at AZ restaurant at along Sembawang Road immediately.
 
3 I left home immediately and drove my car SCG 5421M to Sembawang Road. I arrived there before twelve in the afternoon. After fifteen minutes of wait, Rahman arrived at the AZ restaurant.
 
4 Rahman told me that there is work for me as usual. I understood this to mean to collect bag and deliver it to someone. He told me that he would tell me the place and the time I would be going to take the bag later. He also disclosed that Malaysian car from Johore would be coming to a carpark at Sembawang. He also told me that he would telephone me when the Johore car arrives at the carpark and that I was supposed to collect a ""thing"" which would be in a bag from the car. Rahman told me that I was to deliver the ""thing"" to someone known as ""Boy"" who would be meeting along the main road near Blk 416, Sembawang Road. Rahman told me that ""Boy"" would be coming in a taxi. I agree.
 
5 I did not know what I was to collect from the Malaysian car. Nor do I know whom this person known as ""Boy"" is.
 
6 After this conversation with Rahman, I left in my car together with him and I drove the car to a multi storey carpark at Blk 424, Sembawang Road. Along the way, Rahman suggested to me that I pass my car key to him so that he could pick me up at along Sembawang Road near Blk 416 after I had delivered the ""thing"" to ""Boy"". I agreed to his suggestion.
 
7 A while later we arrived at a multi storey carpark at Blk 424 Sembawang Road. I parked my car on the second storey. We got out of the car. I locked the car and gave my car key to Rahman. We walked together towards Blk 417. Along the way Rahman told me that the multi storey carpark where I was supposed to collect the ""thing"" is located about 2 Apartment blocks behind the carpark which I had parked my car.
 
8 When nearing Apartment Blk 417, Rahman walked straight across the road where I later lost sight of him. I proceed to Blk 416, walked under some void decks apartment Blocks. When I was nearing the Apartment block that is opposite the multi storey carpark, I bumped into a friend of mine known as Roseley who was walking at the void deck.
 
9 I invited Roseley to accompany me to the void deck opposite the multi carpark I was supposed to go. Facing the road to the multi storey carpark, Roseley and I sat on a wooden bench at the void deck. We sat there chatting. I asked him what he was doing there. He told me that he wanted to check out a food stall. I told him that I was waiting for a friend to collect something and deliver it to ""Boy"". I told him this because he asked me what I was doing there.
 
10 As we were talking, I saw a light grey or brown Malaysian plate car passing the road to the multi storey car park. The make of the car is Proton Wira. I saw the car was driven by a male Chinese. The car entered the multi storey carpark. I could not remember the car registration number. Shortly after, Rahman telephoned me. He told me that the car had arrived. I told him that I saw the Malaysian car. I hanged up the telephone.
 
11 I asked Roseley to wait for me and I walked towards the multi storey carpark. I proceeded to the first level of the carpark and looked for the car. I saw a male Chinese walking away at the other end of the carpark. In one of the parking lot, I saw a light grey car bearing a Malaysian plate parked next to a staircase. There was no other Malaysian plate car there, so I decided that was the car I was supposed to take the ""thing"" from.
 
12 The car was unlocked. I opened the rear door and found no bag there. I went to the front door passenger door and saw a black bag on the seat. Believing it to be the bag I was supposed to collect, I took it and walked away from the carpark. I slinged the bag on my shoulder. When I carried the bag, I found it to be heavy. I did not open to see what was inside.
 
13 I walked back to the void deck. As I was walking, I saw Roseley was still sitting at the void deck. He was talking on the handphone. I walked towards him. I expected him to be waiting for me because our chat had not ended. I asked him to accompany me to the main road near Blk 416 Sembawang Road. He agreed and told me that he parked his car at the vicinity of Blk 416. We walked together side by side.
 
14 He asked me what I was carrying as it appeared heavy. I told him that it was indeed heavy but that I did not know the content. As I was nearing Apartment Block 417, Sembawang, I turned behind and saw about 5 or 6 people chasing me. They were about 5 metres behind me. I got shocked and ran away. As I was running, the bag slipped off from my shoulder and fell down to the ground. I did not know what happened to Roseley.
 
15 I slipped and fell down. Two people pinned me and handcuffed me. One of the male Chinese picked up the black bag that fell off my shoulder. I was brought to a void deck nearby together with the bag. As I was walking there I saw Roseley sitting at the void deck with his hand handcuffed behind him.
 
16 The male Chinese opened the black bag. I saw there were many plastic bundles inside. He asked me for the amount of plastic bundles inside. I told him that I do not know.
 
39  On 9 April a further investigation statement was recorded, where he added that
 
… …
 
29 I do not know the occupation of Rahman. He told me that he stays in Woodlands area. Rahman is an Indian Muslim. He is the late thirties. He is medium in built and height. He spots short hair. He is sometimes in jeans or casually dressed. I am able to recognise him if I were to see him again.
 
30 After my meeting with Rahman at Sembawang coffeeshop on the first occasion I worked for him, I did meet him again at the Turf Club over the weekend. The second occasion I met Rahman outside the Turf Club was on the 27 March 2002 at AZ restaurant.
 
31 I did not make any arrangement with Roseley to meet him on 27 March 2002 at the vicinity near where I was arrested. I did not make any telephone calls or phone message to Roseley on 27 March 2002. The last time I telephoned Roseley was one day before I was arrested. I contacted him on his handphone to ask him whether he would be going to the Turf Club at Kallang Stadium to watch the HongKong horse racing on Wednesday night, that is on 27 March 2002. He told me he has not decided.
 
32 Roseley did not telephone me on 27 March 2002. Nor did he phone message me on 27 March 2002. The last time Roseley telephoned me on Tuesday night that is on 26 March 2002. He asked me to follow him to meet a horse jockey named Asslam at a Japanese karaoke joint at Daimaru on that night. Roseley brought 2 other friends. Assalam brought another friend working as a stable boy at the Turf Club.
 
33 I did not use my handphone on 27 March 2002 to telephone anyone. Except for Rahman, I did not received any phone call on my handphone on 27 March 2002.
 
… …
 
42 I wish to add here that when I collected the haversack from the car on 27 March 2002, I was under the impression that the haversack contained gold bars and white gold nuggets. I thought it was heavy because it was laden with gold and silver. I did not know that it contained drugs.
 
 
The statements of the third accused
40  The third accused also made several statements. Some were admitted at the initiative of the prosecution, and others at the request of his counsel.
41  Chronologically, the first statement was recorded by Insp Lek at the void deck of Block 418 after his arrest. This statement which was admitted at the request of the third accused reads
 
Q What are you doing here?
 
A Want to see shop.
 
 
Q Where is the shop?
 
A At the coffeeshop Blk 400+ near the main road.
 
 
Q Who is the person arrested together with you?
 
A My friend, Adi. [The second accused is also known as Adi.]
 
 
Q What is inside Adi’s bag.
 
A I don’t know.
 
 
Q What are you and Adi doing here?
 
A I bumped into him at a carpark near a coffeeshop. I was walking towards my car with him when I was arrested.
 
42  On 28 March a cautioned statement was recorded from him on the charge of trafficking in the 20 bundles in the haversack and he said
 
I am innocent. I do not know anything about this matter. I met Rosdi by chance and we walked together towards my car. It was then that I was arrested. I hope the court will consider my case.
 
43  On 8 April Insp Halim recorded an investigation statement from him where he said
 
2 On 27 March 2002 at about 12.30 in the afternoon, I proceeded to a coffeeshop located at Sembawang Drive from my Canteen at Marsiling Lane. My intention of going to the said coffeeshop was to check one of the stall there as I wanted to rent it. I intended to open another rice stall there at Sembawang area. I arrived at the said coffeeshop at about 1.00 pm.
 
3 This coffeeshop is located near a main Road near Sembawang Drive. One of my friend named Azman told me that there were some vacant stall at the said coffeeshop that are for rental. He told me that the coffeeshop is infront of the multi storey carpark of Blk 406A, Sembawang Drive. I do not have the telephone number of Azman.
 
4 I left my food stall at Marsiling lane when the workers at Seiko factory had finished their lunch break. There were 2 helpers and my wife at the stall when I left. I told my wife that I wanted to check a stall at Sembawang. I did not tell her the time I would be back.
 
5 I drove my car to Sembawang Drive and parked my car at the main road in front of the coffeeshop. I believed there is one coffeeshop near that area. I got out of my car and proceeded to the coffeeshop. I sat inside the coffeeshop for about 30 minutes to check the crowd. I noticed that the coffeeshop was patronised by more Chinese than Malay people.
 
6 I did not noticed the Block number of this coffeeshop. To my recollection there were about 7 stalls in the coffeeshop. This coffeeshop has a Chinese name. There was one Malay and Indian stall while the rest are Chinese stalls. There were 2 vacant stalls which were not taken as there were no stall signs indicating occupancy.
 
7 A while later, I realised that I have parked my car at the double yellow line along the main road. I noticed that there were many vehicles parking along the main road. Afraid that my car would be summoned, I drove it to near a loading and unloading of at a rubbish dump area nearby. This place is near Blk 416 or 418. I did not park my car at a nearby carpark because I noticed there were too many cars going in and out of the carpark. I was of the opinion that the carpark was full. From where I parked my car, I could see the multi storey carpark.
 
8 I got out of my car and walked towards the direction of the said coffeeshop. I walked pass a few void decks and towards a multi storey carpark to get to the coffeeshop. I intend to continue to check the crowd at the coffeeshop as I believed that the lunch hour was not over yet.
 
9 As I was approaching the multi storey carpark, I saw Rosdi standing alone near a staircase of the carpark as if he wanted to cross away from the carpark. I noticed that he was carrying a dark coloured haversack over his shoulder. I noticed that the haversack was full and heavy. I stopped by and chit chatted with him. I asked Rosdi what he was doing there. He told me that he wanted to see a friend and offered me a stick of cigarette. Rosdi then invited me to smoke cigarette at the void deck opposite the multi storey carpark. Rosdi and I crossed the small road leading to the carpark and we walked towards the void deck.
 
10 At the void deck, I asked him where he was heading after meeting his friend. He pointed to me direction where he wanted to go. I noticed that he was pointing at the direction where my car was parked. I told him my car was parked at that area and told him that I would walked with him. I changed my mind about wanting to check the coffeeshop for crowd. I thought that it was sufficient I had earlier spent about 30 minutes at the coffeeshop and that I thought the lunch hour was almost over.
 
11 About 5 minutes later, Rosdi told me that he wanted to move off. I walked together with him. We walked together side by side under the void decks of the HDB flats. As we were walking, I noticed that there was a police car and a small crowd near the entrance of the multi storey carpark. I pointed to Rosdi the police car and the small crowd. Rosdi turned his head towards the police car and kept silence. From where he stood, I could see my car. We were then about to cross the road leading to the carpark. I noticed that Rosdi took a further route, which in my opinion is the longer route to get to the direction of my car. I noticed that he could have walked more towards the right to the area near my car. In stead he took the longer route by walking more to the left across a few void decks. I followed him though. As Rosdi and I was approaching Blk 417, a group of civilian came from my back and arrested me.
 
12 From the time I met Rosdi near the staircase of the multi carpark to the time we walked together until we were arrested at Blk 417, I did not asked him anything about the haversack he was carrying. Nor did I ask Rosdi what he was carrying over his shoulder or what was in the haversack. Neither did I tell or suggested to Rosdi that the haversack appeared heavy.
 
and his statement was continued on 15 April –
 
13 My meeting with Rosdi near the staircase of the multi storey carpark was not pre-arranged. I met him there by chance.
 
14 I have never been to the area near the carpark of Blk 406A, Sembawang Drive. My going there on 27 March 2002 was my first time.
 
… …
 
21 … I did not telephone Rosdi on 27 March 2002, the day I was arrested. Nor did I message him. Neither did Rosdi telephone me or message me on 27 March 2002. I could not remember if anyone had paged for me on 27 March 2002.
 
44  Two other statements recorded on 15 April and 17 April were also admitted in evidence at the request of the third accused which contents were not so relevant to the trial, and it is not necessary to refer to them here.
45  All the statements were admitted in evidence in the course of the prosecution’s case. There were other statements of the accused which the prosecution did not tender in evidence. Defence counsel informed me that they did not have them. The prosecutor confirmed that they were not supplied. Several reasons were given, (i) that there was no obligation to do so, (ii) that the statements were retained so that they could be used to impeach an accused’s credit if he were to depart from them, (iii) that they are not furnished because an accused may tailor his defence according to his statements, and (iv) that the statements may be supplied if an accused disclosed his defence first.
46  In the end, counsel for the prosecution and the defence resolved the matter between themselves and the statements were supplied. The circumstances of the resolution were not disclosed to me.
47  An accused person’s access to his statements is a matter of some importance. When the issue is raised the same authorities are usually cited in argument 
– Kulwant v PP
 
[1986] SLR 239
 which dealt with an application for pre-trial discovery of statements rather than disclosure in the course of a trial, and 
Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 185
 where it was held that such statements should be furnished to an accused person after he has given his evidence. Having dealt with this issue on several occasions I believe that there is room for further consideration in this matter.
48  The statements requested for were the accused’s own statements, not statements of the prosecution witnesses or of his co-accused. An accused person is obliged under s 32 of the Misuse of Drugs Act and s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code to make them. These statements are often referred to as ""investigation statements"", ""s 121 statements"" or ""long statements"". If an accused person has a good memory and if he is aware of the importance of such statements, there is nothing to prevent him from making a note from memory of the statements taken from him. He can recount at his trial what he remembers of his statements.
49  An accused has a legitimate interest to know and be reminded of what he has told in his statements, so that he can obtain proper advice thereon as to the course of action he should take, or he may wish to refer to them in his evidence.
50  Should he be refused the statements so that they can be used to impeach his credit? In many cases where an accused who is refused his statements makes his defence no action is taken to impeach his credit. In my experience, impeachment applications are made in a small minority of such cases. Thus in the majority of cases, this reason for refusing the statements eventually does not stand.
51  That reason is also not applied consistently. In practice, the prosecution would furnish an accused person with cautioned statements recorded from him. Cautioned statements may be used for impeachment in the same way as investigation statements. If the former is furnished, there is no reason why the latter should not.
52  Likewise, an accused may tailor his defence to his cautioned statements as he would his investigation statements, and if that is not a ground for refusing to furnish cautioned statements, it should not be a ground for refusing to furnish the investigation statements.
53  There is another point to be considered. This is that when a reasonable request is made, it should be considered with an open mind. Unless there are reasons to believe that granting of a request will lead to abuse, it would be unreasonable to deny it on the ground that it may lead to abuse.
54  I am also uncomfortable about the requirement that the accused discloses his defence to the prosecution first if he wants to have his investigation statements. There is no obligation for an accused to disclose his defence to the prosecution. That position was abridged slightly by s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code whereby an accused is warned and advised to state his defence after he has been charged, lest his defence be less likely to be believed if he withheld it till his trial. This was a limited change as the accused is not compelled to make a statement, and he is not liable to punishment if he elects not to give one.
55  Against this background, the request that an accused discloses his defence is a radical step which must be given serious consideration. Where is the authority for it? How is the defence to be disclosed – by counsel or a signed statement by the accused? How detailed must it be? What is the evidential nature of such a disclosure? If such requests are to become part of the prosecution practice, they should be clearly provided for by law, in the way that s 122 was enacted to enable cautioned statements to be recorded. It should not be left to be dealt with on an 
ad hoc
 basis.
56  Another issue was raised, whether statements should be admitted in evidence when they are supplied. Such statements would be admitted if the accused or the prosecution wants them to be admitted. If no one wants them, there is no necessity for such statements to be admitted in evidence for no purpose. This is how cautioned statements are dealt with, and the same practice should apply to investigation statements. If an accused who had received his statements decides not to introduce them in evidence, there is no reason to make him do it.
The first accused’s defence
57  The first accused is 35 years old. He had completed up to Primary 6 education in the Chinese medium. He was working as a part-time painter and tow truck driver.
58  He admitted driving into Singapore with the 20 bundles and left them in the car to be collected, but he did not know they were heroin. He repeated his evidence on the circumstances on the inspector’s offer and his decision to co-operate.
59  Counsel then went through the statements of 1 April with him. When he knew Ah Ken through a friend, he was told that Ah Ken was engaged in smuggling jewellery and gold bars. In his dealings with Ah Ken, he thought that they were connected to jewellery and gold bars, and all references in his statements to drugs or heroin should be read as jewellery and gold bars.
60  Counsel sought clarification on the narration of the first delivery made, as described in paras 17 and 40 of his statements. He clarified that on that occasion he only saw the second accused. He had talked of the second and third accused because the investigation officer had told him that he wanted to deal with the both of them, then he had contradicted himself and said that he had not said that he had seen them before.
61  Similarly, when his attention was drawn to the statement made to SI See on 27 March he denied having said that these 20 bundles in the bag were heroin and said that he was not paying attention when the statement was read back to him.
62  Under cross-examination by the prosecution he agreed that when he saw the 25 bundles in the car, he had the opportunity to examine them.
The second accused’s defence
63  The second accused is 37 years old and was working as a printer. He knew the third accused and his wife and was a partner in a food stall with them for a while. He did not know the first accused.
64  His counsel went through his statement of 5 April with him. He confirmed that he had worked for Rahman on a previous occasion before 27 March. He did not know very much about Rahman. Rahman’s full name, address and telephone number were not known to him. On the first occasion he delivered a paper bag from a car, and he was under the impression that he was delivering gold bars and silver nuggets and that he thought he was doing the same thing on 27 March.
65 He did not check the contents of the bag on the first occasion or the second occasion because he did not have the opportunity to check the contents of the haversack.
66  He reiterated that there were no telephone calls between him and the first accused on 27 March but when his counsel referred him to the call tracing records of his mobile phone he admitted however that he received four calls from the third accused that day between 12.32 pm and 1.13 pm. In the first two calls they talked about horse betting and made arrangements for him to pick up a friend. The third call was disrupted. The last call of 1.13 pm was received when he was at the car. The third accused told him to hurry up as he was leaving. His reason for not referring to these calls was that he was in a state of confusion when he made the statement.
67  Counsel for the third accused referred him to his statement to Insp Xavier Lek made soon after his arrest where it was recorded that the third accused was with him to accompany him to meet a friend. He agreed with counsel that it is not true. He explanation for this was that ""The situation is in a state of frenzy, so I just gave the answer.""
The third accused’s defence
68  He is 42 years old, and was operating a food stall in a factory at Marsiling Lane with his wife. He has known the second accused for about a year, and had operated the food stall with him for a time.
69  He did not know about the first transaction between the first and second accused.
70  On 27 March he left his food stall at 12.15 pm and drove to Sembawang Drive. He went there to inspect a food stall that was available to be taken over. He drove to the coffeeshop , parked his car along Sembawang Drive on the side nearer to Block 406A. He went to the coffeeshop and observe the activities there. It was his first visit to that coffeeshop. After a while he realised that his car was parked against double yellow lines, and decided to move it to avoid receiving a summons for illegal parking.
71  He did not drive directly to the nearest proper parking place. Instead he went on a long drive from Sembawang Drive to Admiralty Drive, then to Canberra Road, made a U-turn and went back to Sembawang Drive in the opposite direction from where he started before parking at the loading bay between Blocks 412 and 415 with the intention of resuming his observation of the coffeeshop.
72  He took this drive because it was his practice to have a look at the general area of any location he was considering. He did not drive around the area earlier because he only decided to do that when he drove away from the double yellow lines.
73  Like the second accused, the third accused also had to correct his investigation statement in respect of his communications with the second accused on 27 March. Para 27 of his statement where he said that they had not communicated with one another was incorrect. They had talked over the telephone about horse gambling and picking up a friend. He gave two explanations for these corrections. First he did not say that there was no communication when the statement was recorded and had said that he could not remember if there had been calls. The second explanation was that he could not remember if there were communications on 27 March, and made the statements nevertheless.
74  There was another major correction. Para 9 of his statement where he said the second accused was carrying a haversack when they met was wrong. He did not tell Insp Halim that when the statement was recorded. He told the inspector that he could not remember that, and the inspector suggested that to him, and he agreed. (This was not put to the inspector and no reason had been put forward why the inspector would make such a suggestion.)
75  In fact the haversack was only collected by the second accused after they met up, when the second accused went off by himself. During that time he had telephoned the second accused to tell him that he was leaving because he wanted to go to the market.
76  His counsel referred him to his statement to Insp Lek made following his arrest. He confirmed that when the inspector asked him where he was going, he said that he wanted to see a shop.
77  Counsel for the second accused cross-examined him about the gold bars the second accused handed to him. It transpired that he was not told the selling price or the grade of the gold.
Evaluation of the defences
78  The first accused admitted that he drove the car to the carpark with the 20 bundles in the haversack so that it could be collected. His defence was that he did not know that the bundles contained heroin, and he disputed the admissions of knowledge in his statements.
79  He said that the admissions were untrue because he was threatened by SSgt Subramaniam and Insp Halim promised that he could avoid the death penalty if he co-operated. SSgt Subramaniam had not told him what he was to say, and he did not make any admissions to SSgt Subramaniam. When he admitted to SI See that the bundles were heroin, SSgt Subramaniam was not present.
80  He alleged that Insp Halim wanted him to say that the heroin belonged to the second and third accused, then he said he was to say that they took the heroin away. In his statements, he went well beyond incriminating the second and third accused. He incriminated himself in his detailed account of his dealings with the supplier of the heroin and of his previous delivery for him. He did not allege that these disclosures were inserted or suggested by the inspector.
81  I found that the first accused had admitted that he knew he was delivering heroin to Singapore. Even if there were no admissions, he was presumed under s 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act by possession of the bundles to know their content, and he had not rebutted the presumption.
82  The second accused’s defence was that he was instructed by Rahman to collect the bundles from the car and deliver it to Boy. He claimed that he did not know that the bundles were heroin, and had thought they were gold bars and silver nuggets.
83  He admitted that he had undertaken a similar transaction about two weeks prior to 27 March, and on that occasion too, he was under the impression he was dealing with gold bars and silver nuggets.
84  The second accused did not know Rahman well at all. Rahman was a recent acquaintance and he did not know his full name, address or telephone number. He carried out Rahman’s instructions without being told and without enquiring what he was to collect and deliver.
85  He thought that they were gold bars and silver nuggets because Rahman had given him samples for him to look for buyers and he in turn asked the third accused to look for buyers for the gold bars without informing him the selling price or the quality.
86  He must have realised that he was not engaged in a normal transaction. On the previous occasion, he was paid $3,000 for his services. From the exceptional manner of taking a bag from an unlocked car to the delivery to someone in a taxi, he must have known or suspected something surreptitious was going on. Yet he did not ask Rahman what was being collected and delivered and did not examine the bundles when he had them in his possession. There was nothing to prevent him from checking the contents of the bundles in the haversack in the car or at the carpark if he wanted to, but he did not do that. In the circumstances, he had failed to rebut the presumption arising from his possession of the bundles that he was aware of their contents.
87  The third accused had denied knowledge of the heroin or the delivery. The evidence against him was that he was with the second accused before the first accused’s car arrived at the carpark. He waited while the second accused collected the haversack from the car, and he was with the second accused after it was collected and was being taken to be delivered.
88  His explanation was that he was at that area to look at a stall at a coffeeshop in Block 406A with a view to expanding his business there. He left the coffeeshop to re-park his car, and went on to recce the area before returning to the area of the carpark to continue his observation. After parking his car, he met up with the second accused and they were together. He waited when the second accused went to collect the haversack and they left the area together after that.
89  That was the account of the events he narrated in court. However it was not consistent with his own statements and it did not stand up to examination.
90  In his statements he said that he had not been to the coffeeshop before 27 March, and that he only knew of the stall’s availability that day. His wife Masrina binte Awi, contradicted his account. Her unchallenged evidence was that she and the third accused had been to the coffeeshop on 24 March to ascertain whether it was suitable for their business and on 26 March he told her that a stall there was available. In cross-examination he admitted that he had been to the coffeeshop with his wife.
91  Next there was his evidence of going to the coffeeshop on 27 March before his arrest. In his statement he moved his car from the roadside and drove it to the loading bay. There was no mention of going on a drive around the area so that he drove to the loading bay from the opposite direction of the coffeeshop. It was not explained why he would interrupt his observation with this long drive, or why he failed to mention that in his statement when he gave a detailed account of his movements.
92  His evidence was that he had returned to take a further look at the coffeeshop, but he did not do that. He said that he met with the second accused, spent time with him in casual conversation and did not go back to the coffeeshop. Apparently the intent and interest that led him to go to the coffeeshop and to drive around the area were forgotten after he met the second accused.
93  The next part of the retelling of the events is important. By the time he made the statement, the third accused knew that the charge he faced related to the contents of the haversack. In his statement he said that when they met the second accused was carrying a dark haversack over his shoulder, and he observed that the haversack was full and heavy. This was manifestly wrong. The truth was that it was only after they met that the second accused left to collect the haversack while he waited.
94  Another untruth was the assertion that he and the second accused did not telephone one another on 27 March. He made four calls to the second accused between 12.32 pm and 1.13 pm. The second accused’s evidence was that the last call was made while he was at the first accused’s car, and the third accused had called to ask him to hurry. This was not disputed by the third accused.
95  Soon after he was arrested, Insp Lek asked him what he was doing there, and he said he wanted to see a shop. He clarified in his evidence he understood the question to be where he was going and his response was that he wanted to see a shop. This contradicted his evidence that he had already been to the coffeeshop and was leaving the area when he was arrested.
96  Why were these untruths in his statements? I did not accept that the recording officers were responsible for them. I also did not accept that they were mistakes made through confusion or fear. The statements were not made when he was feeling the shock of his arrest, but were made days and weeks later. The length and detail in which he narrated the events showed that he was able to give a full account of the events. There were no expressions or suggestions of uncertainty or confusion.
97  The untruths were deliberate lies. They ran through virtually every phase of the events. They started with the reason for him being in the area, i.e. the lie that he was just told of the availability of the stall and went there to have a look at it for the first time and his statement to Insp Lek that he was going to the coffeeshop when he was arrested. There was the meeting with the second accused who was carrying the haversack and their being in one another’s company till they were arrested. Then there was the assertion that he and the third accused had not called one another that day.
98  What effect and weight can lies have on a case? This has received active consideration in our courts. Reference is always made, directly or indirectly, to Lord Lane’s judgment in 
R v Lucas (Ruth)
 
[1981] QB 720
. In that case the court was considering whether a false statement made out of court can provide corroboration to an accomplice’s evidence. The judge held at p 724 –
 
To be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie told out of court must first of all be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. The jury should in appropriate cases be reminded that people sometimes lie, for example, in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or out of a wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from their family. Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of the accomplice who is to be corroborated, that is to say by admission or by evidence from an independent witness.
 
99 This four-fold test was cited with approval by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
. Since then it had been said that lies that meet with the test can be treated as corroborative evidence of guilt (see 
Tan Hung Yeoh v PP
 
[1999] 3 SLR 93
 at para 52) and as evidence of guilt (see 
Heng Aik Peng v PP
 
[2002] 3 SLR 469
).
100  However a distinction must always be drawn between lies in general and lies which come under the 
Lucas
 test. In 
Heng Aik Peng
 Yong Pung How CJ made the point (at para 27) that
 
The distinction between relying on an accused’s lies as evidence of guilt and forming a view that his evidence is not creditworthy because of certain lies is an extremely important one. As pointed out by the court in 
R v Lucas
, an accused person may lie for a variety of reasons not connected with guilt of the offences. As such, it is dangerous to convict an accused person based on the fact that he lied, unless the criteria in 
Er Joo Nguang v PP
 
[2000] 2 SLR 645
 are satisfied.
 
The criteria in 
Er Joo Nguang v PP
 are that enunciated in 
Lucas
.
101  The position is therefore that 
Lucas
 lies may support a finding of guilt. Nevertheless a court must take into account all the evidence before it, before deciding whether guilt is established.
102  The third accused offered explanations for the lies. The statement about not having been to the coffeeshop previously was a mistake. The lie about the second accused being with the haversack when they met was made because he was confused and surprised by the events and worried about his wife who was also arrested. He lied about not having telephone calls with the second accused on 27 March because he was in fear. His counsel attributed the lies to the fear of being implicated by association.
103  I found that the third accused told these lies because he was fearful that the truth about his visit to Sembawang Drive and his involvement with the second accused would incriminate him.
104  The truth was that he did not go to Sembawang Drive because Azman told him that morning about a stall that was available. I did not believe that he had been to the coffeeshop on 27 March at all. His car was seen going along Sembawang Drive towards the loading bay from the opposite direction of the coffeeshop. The drive along the long route to recce the area was not mentioned in his statements. When he arrived at the loading bay and parked his car he did not go to the coffeeshop as he said he had intended to do.
105  The second and third accused’s claim that they met by chance was incapable of belief. If it was a chance meeting, the natural thing for them to do would be to exchange greetings then get on with what each had set out to do. For the third accused it was to go to check the coffeeshop as a business prospect. The second accused’s assignment was to collect a bag from an unlocked car in a car park and to deliver it to someone coming in a taxi. He would not want any one not involved in the arrangements to witness his activities and to accompany him for the delivery. The telephone calls between them shortly before they met also suggested that there was an arrangement. The fact that the third accused waited while the haversack was collected was further indication that it was not a chance meeting, and there was more that they were to do.
106  The irresistible inference drawn from all the circumstances was that they had arranged to do what they did; to meet, to take possession of the haversack from the car and deliver it. These acts were done pursuant to their common intention.
107  Against this backdrop, I found the first accused had driven the car with the drugs to the car park with the knowledge and intention that they will be collected from the car, and the second and third accused had gone together to collect the drugs with the view of delivering them to another person. In the circumstances, they were guilty on the charges they faced, were convicted thereon, and the mandatory death sentence was imposed on them.",2003-01-24 00:00:00,SG High Court

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant was convicted and sentenced on four charges in relation to the importation of cigarettes from Malaysia into Singapore without paying customs duty and goods and services tax (“GST”). In addition to appealing against conviction and sentence before this court, he filed a criminal motion seeking leave to adduce additional evidence on appeal. After hearing counsel for the appellant address the court at great length and with much effort, I dismissed the motion and the appeal against conviction, but allowed the appeal on sentence. I now set out my reasons.
The facts
2          At about 4.30am on 23 October 2003, officers from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority based at the Tuas Checkpoint inspected a Malaysian-registered refrigerated lorry bearing licence plate no JFT 8795 (“the lorry”). The officers found, hidden amongst consignments of frozen fish, 250 cartons of 200 sticks (
ie
 50,000 sticks) of Marlboro brand cigarettes bearing Singapore Health Warnings (“the cigarettes”). The cigarettes weighed 48.47kg and were valued at $17,259.85. The unpaid customs duty on the cigarettes was assessed at $12,359.85, while the unpaid GST was assessed at $690.39.
3          The driver of the lorry, Khairu Nazri bin Husain (“Khairu”), was arrested, and he admitted to importing the cigarettes. He worked as a driver for Bintang Hikmat Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company (“the company”). The appellant was a director of the company. Khairu’s job was to deliver the fish loaded on the lorry to two Singapore businesses, M/s Sin Lian Live Fish Supplier and M/s Gim Ser Live Supplier. The Singapore businesses shared the same address. Khairu was to hand over the fish to the appellant upon arrival. However, he did not have to load or unload the fish.
4          At about 2.00pm on the same day, customs officers searched the appellant’s home in the presence of his wife. They found one unopened packet containing 20 sticks of duty-unpaid Marlboro cigarettes bearing Singapore Health Warnings, similar to those found on the lorry. The appellant was arrested later that day.
5          The appellant faced two charges each in respect of the cigarettes on the lorry and the packet of cigarettes at his home. The charges were as follows:
 
 
 
 
Charge
 
 
 
Provisions
 
 
 
 
 
DAC 52858/2003 (“the first charge”)
 
 
 
Section 130(1)(c), punishable under s 130(1)(i) of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 2001 Rev Ed).
 
 
 
 
 
DAC 52859/2003 (“the second charge”)
 
 
 
Section 130(1)(c), punishable under s 130(1)(i) of the Customs Act, read with ss 26 and 77 of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap 117A, 2001 Rev Ed), para 3 of the Goods and Services Tax (Application of Legislation relating to Customs and Excise Duties) Order (Cap 117A, O 4, 2001 Rev Ed) and para 2 of the Goods and Services Tax (Application of Customs Act) (Provisions on Trials, Proceedings, Offences and Penalties) Order (Cap 117A, O 5, 2001 Rev Ed).
 
 
 
 
 
DAC 52860/2003 (“the third charge”)
 
 
 
Section 130(1)(a), punishable under s 130(1)(iii) of the Customs Act.
 
 
 
 
 
DAC 52861/2003 (“the fourth charge”)
 
 
 
Section 130(1)(a), punishable under s 130(1)(iii) of the Customs Act, read with ss 26 and 77 of the Goods and Services Tax Act, para 3 of the Goods and Services Tax (Application of Legislation relating to Customs and Excise Duties) Order and para 2 of the Goods and Services Tax (Application of Customs Act) (Provisions on Trials, Proceedings, Offences and Penalties) Order.
 
 
 
 
6          The first and second charges concerned the cigarettes found in the appellant’s home, while the third and fourth were in respect of the cigarettes in the lorry. The appellant pleaded guilty to the first and second charges but claimed trial to the third and fourth charges. Prior to the appellant’s trial, Khairu had been sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment on one charge of being concerned in the importation of the cigarettes without paying customs duty, which was also the basis for the third charge. Another charge concerning unpaid GST was taken into consideration.
The Prosecution’s case
7          Khairu, the sole prosecution witness, testified that the company employed two drivers, him and one Muniandy s/o T M Rajoo (“Muniandy”), also known as Raja. The two of them would usually enter Singapore together, taking turns to drive from Johor Baru. On 23 October 2003, the appellant’s elder brother, Chew Gim Hock (“Gim Hock”), assigned Khairu to drive the lorry to Singapore. Muniandy was then under a one-month prohibition from entering Singapore beginning from 25 September 2003. Gim Hock instructed Khairu to deliver the goods in some red containers on the lorry to the appellant. Khairu peeped into the lorry and saw, underneath the fish, boxes wrapped in black plastic inside the red containers, but he did not check the boxes. Muniandy told him that the boxes contained uncustomed cigarettes. Khairu then spoke to Gim Hock, who told him that he would get a commission for making the delivery. However, Gim Hock did not tell him the amount of commission that would be paid, as the commission was payable only upon successful delivery and Gim Hock had not calculated the amount yet. Gim Hock also informed him that the appellant kept records of the goods.
8          Khairu admitted that he did not know who the owner of the cigarettes was. He also testified that the appellant was not present when Gim Hock gave him the instructions to deliver the cigarettes to the appellant, and that he did not meet with the appellant on 23 October 2003.
The defence
9          At the close of the Prosecution’s case, defence counsel submitted that there was no case to answer, as the appellant was in Singapore and did not know what had transpired in Johor Baru. However, the learned District Judge Mrs Emily Wilfred decided that the Prosecution had established a 
prima facie
 case.
10        The appellant initially testified that Gim Hock, who was not a director or manager of the company, was in charge of the company’s employees in Johor Baru who were engaged in the “killing” of fish. However, he later said that Gim Hock was responsible for the company’s operations in Johor Baru, while he was responsible for the operations in Singapore. He had spoken to Gim Hock over the telephone on 22 October 2003, but only to inform Gim Hock of the quantity of fish he wanted delivered the next day. On 23 October 2003, he did not speak to Gim Hock. His younger brother, Chew Cheng Huay (“Cheng Huay”), informed him that the fish had not yet arrived at the Singapore factory. He went to the Tuas Customs Checkpoint at about 6.00am to make enquiries, and found out that the lorry had been detained because it had been used for transporting contraband. He then proceeded to the Jurong Fishing Port to purchase alternative supplies of fish and distributed the fish to his customers. He found customs officers waiting for him when he returned to his office at around 2.00pm, who questioned him about the cigarettes.
11        As for the packet of Marlboro cigarettes found at his home, the appellant explained that he had found the packet in his small lorry, and had decided to take it home with him. However, he did not explain how the packet came to be in the small lorry.
The decision below
12        The learned district judge found Khairu to be a truthful and candid witness who did not embellish his testimony to make his story more convincing. Although defence counsel suggested that Khairu had wrongfully implicated the appellant because he begrudged the appellant for not helping him out after his arrest, the judge was satisfied that Khairu had been forthright and did not have a vendetta against the appellant.
13        On the other hand, the appellant was not a truthful witness. He had chopped and changed his evidence in the course of his testimony. He was evasive when asked about Gim Hock’s role in the company and the company’s operations in Johor Baru. He did not produce any witness to corroborate his testimony on the company’s organisation. In contrast, Khairu had testified that he received instructions from both Gim Hock and the appellant, and was unable to confirm that Gim Hock was indeed the company’s manager in Johor Baru. The judge concluded that the shifts in the appellant’s evidence were because he wanted to distance himself from the Johor Baru operations and avoid incriminating himself, and found that he was overall in charge of the company’s operations in Singapore and Johor Baru.
14        The judge also found that the appellant was concerned in the importation of the cigarettes. The appellant had testified that he was in charge of the company’s operations in Singapore. Khairu and the appellant had both testified that the drivers were not involved in the loading and unloading of the fish. The cigarettes were found on the company’s lorry. The appellant had called Gim Hock the day before the lorry was seized. He went to Tuas Checkpoint to make enquiries about the lorry, but did not subsequently check with Gim Hock what had been loaded onto the lorry.
15        Further, the learned judge drew an adverse inference against the appellant under Illus (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) that the evidence of his brothers and employees, who were not called as witnesses, would have been unfavourable. His defence was a bare denial riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions on material aspects relating to the management of the company. He remained silent about material facts, failing to explain how the packet of Marlboro cigarettes came to be found in his small lorry. He did not furnish any information on the two Singapore businesses, one of which bore his name. No witnesses were called who could substantiate his evidence, and the appellant did not explain why this was the case.
16        The appellant was convicted on the third and fourth charges and pleaded guilty to the first and second charges. On the issue of sentencing, defence counsel asked the court to impose a custodial sentence instead of a fine, and urged the imposition of the same sentence as Khairu of nine months’ imprisonment. The judge sentenced the appellant to:
(a)       
 12 months’ imprisonment on the third charge;
(b)       
 three months’ imprisonment on the fourth charge; and
(c)       
 one month’s imprisonment each on the first and second charges.
The sentences for the third and fourth charges were ordered to run consecutively for a total of 15 months’ imprisonment.
The proceedings before this court
17        I will first deal with Criminal Motion No 19 of 2004, in which the appellant sought leave to adduce additional evidence on appeal, before dealing with the appeals proper.
Motion to adduce additional evidence
18        The appellant sought to adduce a statutory declaration made by Muniandy in June 2004, after the appellant’s trial had concluded in April 2004.
19        In his supporting affidavit, the appellant asserted that Khairu only referred briefly to Muniandy in the course of his examination at trial. The Prosecution did not call Muniandy to testify, and Muniandy was not said to have any knowledge of material facts. The appellant alleged that consequently it did not occur to him then that Muniandy was a potentially important witness.
20        Prior to the appellant’s trial, his younger brother, Cheng Huay, had been charged in November 2003 under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) with offering, together with Muniandy, RM50,000 to Khairu through Khairu’s wife, Faizah binti Kadir (“Faizah”). The money was allegedly offered to persuade Khairu to accept full criminal liability for smuggling the cigarettes. In connection with this charge, Cheng Huay’s counsel, who was also the appellant’s counsel before me, interviewed the company’s employees at its premises in Kota Tinggi in May 2004. It was allegedly discovered at this time that Muniandy possessed intimate knowledge of the circumstances that led to the arrests and convictions of Khairu and the appellant.
21        In his statutory declaration, Muniandy stated that he had noticed Khairu stopping along the way to deliver boxes to various persons after entering Singapore. When questioned, Khairu admitted to smuggling cigarettes, and offered Muniandy an equal partnership in the operation, which Muniandy accepted. The smuggling took place without the knowledge of their employers. After the fish had been loaded onto the lorry, they would stop at Khairu’s home first and load up cigarettes before heading for Singapore. He had left for his home in Batu Pahat in the evening of 22 October 2003, and found out about Khairu’s arrest later by telephone from Faizah. Muniandy declared that he was willing to attend court and give evidence, even though he was aware that he would almost certainly be charged and punished for his part in smuggling the cigarettes. Nevertheless, he felt bad about wrongly implicating the appellant and Cheng Huay, as well as causing the company to incur additional expense in hiring another driver and refrigerated lorry.
The applicable principles
22        The conditions that have to be satisfied before leave is granted to adduce additional evidence on appeal are set out in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 1 WLR 1489
, namely:
(a)        non-availability – it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at trial;
(b)        relevance – the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case; and
(c)        reliability – it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
23        This framework has been adopted and applied in numerous criminal cases such as 
Juma’at bin Samad v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
, 
Chan Chun Yee v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 638
 and 
Annis bin Abdullah
 
v PP
 
[2004] 2 SLR 93
.
Application of the principles to the present case
24        I was of the opinion that the appellant in this case had failed to satisfy any of the three conditions set out above for the statutory declaration to be adduced as additional evidence on appeal.
Non-availability
25        The circumstances of this case did not support the appellant’s argument that Muniandy’s evidence, as embodied in the statutory declaration, could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at his trial. There was nothing to suggest that Muniandy had left the employment of the company or otherwise could not be located after the appellant’s arrest or before his trial. The wording of the appellant’s affidavit suggested that Muniandy was still an employee of the company as at May 2004, since the appellant’s counsel discovered Muniandy’s evidence when interviewing the company’s employees. Similarly, the wording of Muniandy’s statutory declaration suggested that Muniandy was still an employee as at June 2004. It was therefore open to the appellant to locate Muniandy before his trial and persuade him to give exonerating evidence, as Cheng Huay had done. That the appellant’s counsel “coincidentally” found out about Muniandy while enquiring into Cheng Huay’s charge did not change the fact that Muniandy’s evidence had been available for use at the appellant’s trial.
26        It must have occurred to the appellant before his trial, in light of the circumstances, that Muniandy was potentially an important witness. Khairu usually entered Singapore together with Muniandy, but Khairu was arrested alone. The company employed no other drivers. It was pertinent to note also that Muniandy’s one-month prohibition from entering Singapore would have ended shortly after the incident had taken place. This should have raised questions in the appellant’s mind, even if he did not know the details of Muniandy’s prohibition. There was no cause or need for the appellant to wait for the Prosecution to indicate at the trial that Muniandy might have useful evidence.
27        Contrary to the appellant’s assertion that Muniandy was only mentioned in passing at trial, defence counsel had actually conducted a full and detailed cross-examination of Khairu on the subject. By that point, if not earlier, the importance of Muniandy as a witness should have been patently obvious to the appellant. But he did not pursue the matter further, and did not attempt to call Muniandy as a witness. No effort, let alone reasonable diligence, had been exerted by the appellant to obtain Muniandy’s evidence.
28        Before me, counsel for the appellant used the colourful analogy that if a person did not know that there was treasure buried underneath his house, it could not be said that the treasure was available to him. However, it was more apt to describe the appellant in this case as a person who, aware or at least suspecting that there was treasure buried under his house, chose to do nothing until it was too late. That Muniandy’s evidence was not available to him at trial could only be attributed to his decision not to pursue the matter.
Relevance
29        Muniandy’s evidence would not have had an important influence on the outcome of the appellant’s case. What was most striking about the statutory declaration was that while it described in some detail the surrounding circumstances, it was silent on the events of 23 October 2003. In Muniandy’s own words, he had left for Batu Pahat the evening before, and heard about Khairu’s arrest later on. He could therefore shed no light on what had transpired before Khairu left for Singapore. The statutory declaration also did not address or dispute Khairu’s testimony that Muniandy was the one who told him that there were uncustomed cigarettes on the lorry. This cast some doubt on the version of events narrated in the statutory declaration. There was no explanation of how he and Khairu managed to make consistently timely deliveries to Singapore, despite having to detour to Khairu’s house to load up cigarettes.
30        The Prosecution also pointed out that at trial, the court, on the application of defence counsel, had ruled that Khairu’s evidence in respect of previous acts of smuggling involving Muniandy was inadmissible. It was inconsistent for the appellant to now seek to adduce the statutory declaration, which also contained evidence of past acts of smuggling involving Muniandy and Khairu.
Reliability
31        It was stated in 
Loh Khoon Hai v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 321
 at 326, [17] that the standard to be met under the condition of reliability in 
Ladd v Marshall
 was a very high one. The appellant in this case did not meet the requisite standard. The statutory declaration was made in the context of enquiries made regarding Cheng Huay’s corruption charge, in which Muniandy himself was implicated. Muniandy’s expression of contrition at wrongly getting two persons, both of whom were his bosses, into trouble with the law, as well as harming the company financially, thus took on a different cast. It also came at an odd time. By the time he made the statutory declaration, some eight months had passed from the arrest of Khairu and the appellant, and both their trials were already concluded.
32        Muniandy in the statutory declaration fully exonerated the appellant, while effectively accusing Khairu of committing perjury when testifying at the appellant’s trial. The grave implications of these one-sided allegations made it essential for Muniandy to be examined and, if necessary, challenged in court. But Muniandy could not be compelled to attend court in Singapore, since he was a Malaysian resident. His accusations and claims were being made from a distance in safety. Despite his declaration that he was prepared to come to court in Singapore and face the consequences, and the appellant’s counsel stating that he would be called as a witness if the motion was allowed, it could not be assumed that he would in fact do so when the time comes. Not only would it be unsafe to accept Muniandy’s evidence as it appears in the statutory declaration, the evidence would be inadmissible hearsay if he did not appear before the Singapore courts.
Whether the additional evidence is necessary in the interests of justice
33        In support of this ground, the appellant cited the case of 
Chia Kah Boon v PP
 
[1999] 4 SLR 72
. In that case, I said that where any of the three conditions for adducing additional evidence on appeal was not met, the additional evidence might be allowed in the most extraordinary circumstances, where such additional evidence was necessary in the interests of justice.
34        However, it must be emphasised, as I had stated in 
Chan Chun Yee v PP
 ([23] 
supra
) at [10], that:
This [exception] is a narrow exception and is warranted only by the most extenuating circumstances, which may include the fact that the offence is a serious one attracting grave consequences and the fact that the additional evidence sought to be adduced is highly cogent and pertinent and the strength of which renders the conviction unsafe.
This passage was also cited in 
Chia Kah Boon v PP
.
35        Counsel for the appellant failed to show the existence of any extenuating circumstances in this case that would justify invoking this exception in the interests of justice. The evidence found in the statutory declaration was not sufficiently cogent and pertinent, and was not so strong as to render the appellant’s conviction unsafe. In 
Chia Kah Boon v PP
, only the condition of non-availability was not satisfied. Here, the statutory declaration did not satisfy any of the three conditions. To invoke the exception here would broaden the exception by such an extent as to engulf the general principle in 
Ladd v Marshall
. Counsel’s repeated assertions without more that the statutory declaration totally absolved the appellant, and that the appellant would go to jail unless the statutory declaration was admitted, could not overcome the deficiencies in the evidence. That counsel admitted that this was his strongest point in favour of admitting the statutory declaration only demonstrated the weakness of his case.
36        Another argument raised by counsel for the appellant was that Muniandy recognised that he had given evidence that was detrimental to himself. It is relevant here to consider the case of 
Tan Choon Chuar v PP
 
[1950] MLJ 200
. The Court of Appeal of the Federation of Malaya there refused an application to call further evidence on appeal, where the further evidence comprised of statements taken after the appellants had been tried and convicted. If the statements were true, the appellants would have been wrongly convicted. However, the court reasoned that allowing the evidence would have required it to form some conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the makers of the statements, in which event its finding would be prejudicial to the chances that the makers would have a fair trial. In the present instance, it must be considered also that Muniandy ultimately might not appear before the Singapore courts. As long as he did not come before the Singapore courts, he remained at liberty and could hardly be regarded as having acted to his detriment in making the statutory declaration.
37        For the reasons set out above, the criminal motion to adduce Muniandy’s statutory declaration as additional evidence on appeal was dismissed.
Appeal against conviction and sentence
38        In his appeal against conviction on the third and fourth charges, the appellant recited a litany of complaints against Khairu, the Prosecution and the court below. He submitted that the Defence should not have been called because the Prosecution failed to make out a 
prima facie
 case against the appellant and adverse inferences were not drawn against the Prosecution. The court below erred in not applying the same level of scrutiny to the Prosecution as was applied to the appellant and in not requiring the Prosecution to produce necessary witnesses. The judge was wrong in drawing adverse inferences against the appellant for his failure to call witnesses. The appellant was convicted against the weight of the evidence, and the case against him was not made out.
No case to answer
39        The role of the trial court at the close of the Prosecution’s case is clear. Following 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
[1980–1981] SLR 73
, the trial court has to consider whether there is some evidence before it that is not inherently incredible which, if accepted as accurate, would establish each element of the offence the accused is charged with. Only if such evidence is lacking is the court justified in finding that no case has been made out against the accused that, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction.
40        The appellant feebly submitted that the learned judge was wrong to apply the test in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 at the close of the Prosecution’s case. However, as the Prosecution pointed out, this was an attempt to revisit settled law in Singapore. The Court of Appeal in 
Ng Theng Shuang v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 36
 had made it clear that, even at that time, the test in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 had become too well-entrenched to bear re-examination. The appellant did not come close to forming a coherent argument why 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 should no longer be followed.
41        The Prosecution’s case relied primarily on Khairu’s testimony. The judge expressly accepted Khairu’s testimony after observing Khairu in court. Not having had the same opportunity to observe the witness, it is established law that the appellate court should be slow to disturb the judge’s finding in this respect: 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
, 
Ameer Akbar v Abdul Hamid
 
[1997] 1 SLR 113
. This is especially the case where the findings are based on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witness: 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
.
42        There were no grounds for disturbing the judge’s conclusion in this case. Khairu did not embellish or exaggerate his evidence, and did not concoct evidence about matters beyond his knowledge. He did not try to minimise his own culpability in that he was motivated by the commission Gim Hock had promised to pay him. He was forthright in agreeing with the suggestion by defence counsel that he was angry that the appellant and his family did not bail him out, but also made it clear that he did not consequently bear a grudge against and frame the appellant. Khairu’s evidence was not so incredible and unreliable that the judge was wrong to have accepted it.
43        The judge had to consider whether the appellant was concerned in importing the cigarettes found on the lorry for the purposes of s 130(1)(a) of the Customs Act, which was the statutory basis of the third and fourth charges. Section 3 of the Customs Act defines “import” to mean “to bring or 
cause to be brought
 into the customs territory by any means from any place” [emphasis added]. It was clearly not necessary for the appellant to have personally brought the cigarettes into Singapore for him to be held criminally liable, so long as it could be shown that he had caused Khairu to bring the cigarettes into Singapore. In this respect, it must be emphasised that Khairu was instructed by Gim Hock to deliver the cigarettes to the appellant specifically. The company was a family concern, and the appellant was in charge of the Singapore factory. The company’s resources were used in bringing the cigarettes into Singapore. It was clear that the appellant was involved in the importation of the cigarettes.
44        There is also the Malaysian case of 
PP v Chua Yew Eng
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 108
, where it was held that, in interpreting the phrase “concerned in” in relation to customs legislation prohibiting the importation of certain goods, a person who arranges for the import of such prohibited goods could be regarded as a person concerned in the offence. Ironically, the appellant had cited this case to support his argument that there was no case for him to answer at trial. With all due respect, it is difficult to see how this case supports his position. Indeed, I found it difficult generally to understand counsel’s submissions on this issue. The Prosecution had made out its case at trial, and the judge was perfectly entitled to call on the appellant to enter his defence.
Adverse inferences against the Prosecution
45        The principles governing the drawing of adverse inferences against the Prosecution pursuant to Illus (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act are summarised in 
Khua Kian Keong v PP
 
[2003] 4 SLR 526
. The trial court has the discretion whether or not to draw such inferences, and the appellate court has to evaluate if the trial judge had correctly exercised his discretion. It will be appropriate to draw adverse inferences against the Prosecution if the witness not offered is a material one, the Prosecution withheld evidence that it possessed and which was available, and where this was done with an ulterior motive to hinder or hamper the Defence.
46        The witnesses the Prosecution allegedly failed to call were obviously Muniandy and Gim Hock. However, both persons were resident in Malaysia and were not compellable as witnesses before the Singapore courts. In 
PP v Tan Lay Heong
 
[1996] 2 SLR 150
, I said that no adverse inferences could be drawn against the Prosecution where a witness was a foreign witness and not compellable to be called. The mere fact that the foreign witness was not before the court to give evidence was not sufficient basis to presume that his evidence would be unfavourable to the Prosecution.
47        In 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
, the Defence had argued that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution for its failure to call a particular witness. There, I said at [73]:
Such arguments are commonly made. Commonly too, such arguments are without merit. 
The court must hesitate to draw any such presumption unless the witness not produced is essential to the prosecution’s case.
 Any criminal transaction may be observed by a number of witnesses. It is not necessary for the prosecution to produce every single one of those witnesses. 
All the prosecution need do is to produce witnesses whose evidence can be believed so as to establish the case beyond a reasonable doubt.
 Out of a number of witnesses, it may then only be necessary to bring in one or two; as long as those witnesses actually produced are able to give evidence of the transaction, there is no reason why all of the rest should be called, nor why any presumption should be drawn that the evidence of those witnesses not produced would have been against the prosecution. 
Where the witnesses not produced are not material, no presumption operates against the prosecution
 … [emphasis added]
Further, I said at [77]:
The discretion conferred upon the prosecution cannot be fettered by any obligation to call a particular witness. What the prosecution has to do is to prove its case. It is not obliged to go out of its way to allow the defence any opportunity to test its evidence. It is not obliged to act for the defence. Only if there is an intention to hinder or hamper the defence would the possibility of a miscarriage of justice arise, requiring interference by the courts.
48        In this case, the Prosecution adduced and relied on Khairu’s testimony to make its case. Khairu’s involvement in the transaction made him a relevant and important witness to the Prosecution. The learned judge accepted Khairu’s testimony after much scrutiny. In contrast, Muniandy and Gim Hock were not relevant witnesses to the Prosecution’s case. There was no reason for the judge to draw adverse inferences against the Prosecution for not calling Muniandy and Gim Hock as prosecution witnesses. Further, there was no suggestion that the Prosecution had withheld any evidence from either person that was in its possession, and had done so to prevent the appellant from mounting an effective defence.
Conviction of the appellant
49        Contrary to his claims, the appellant failed to rebut the evidence led against him by the Prosecution. As noted by the judge, the appellant’s evidence was a bare denial of involvement in the smuggling of the cigarettes. A bare denial hardly constituted a rebuttal.
50        The appellant’s evidence at trial regarding the respective roles in the company of Gim Hock and himself was inconsistent. The evidence was clear that Gim Hock was not a director of the company. In his examination-in-chief, the appellant said Gim Hock was in charge of the workers who “kill” (
ie
 process) the fish. But in cross-examination, he played up Gim Hock’s role while simultaneously downplaying his own, dividing the overall responsibility for the company between Gim Hock in Johor Baru and himself in Singapore. This assertion was not supported by any evidence. He even impliedly shifted the blame to Gim Hock by suggesting that he did not really know about Gim Hock’s activities in Johor Baru. The judge was therefore justified in finding that the appellant had chopped and changed his evidence, and the appellant did not show why this finding was wrong.
51        Gim Hock was a potentially helpful witness to the appellant. Yet, the appellant did not call Gim Hock as a witness, even though he described their relationship as cordial. The appellant’s other brothers who were also involved in the company’s business were similarly not called as witnesses. Only in his submissions to this court did the appellant finally disclose some details about the division of the company’s operations between his brothers and himself. This contrasted with his reticence and prevarication at trial. Even so, there was still a marked absence of detail and supporting evidence. Khairu’s evidence that he was not sure about the actual role played by Gim Hock in Johor Baru was not addressed. The appellant also repeatedly referred to the company and its customers in a proprietary manner in his testimony, but withheld further information in this respect.
52        For the reasons above, the judge’s finding that the appellant was in charge of the company’s operations in both Singapore and Johor Baru could not be faulted, not when the appellant failed to adduce any evidence supporting his defence. The judge correctly drew an adverse inference against the appellant for failing to call his brothers and employees as witnesses to corroborate his evidence. The appellant offered no reasons at trial to explain why he did not call any witnesses when it was up to him to prove his defence, and none had been canvassed before me.
53        The appellant had made a telephone call to Gim Hock on 22 October 2003 to arrange for a delivery to be made to Singapore the next day. When Khairu was asked by Gim Hock to drive the lorry into Singapore, the lorry had already been loaded. This was to be expected, since the consistent evidence of Khairu and the appellant was that Khairu was not responsible for loading or unloading the lorry. In light of these circumstances, it was telling that the appellant did not attempt to contact Gim Hock to investigate why contraband was found on the lorry after being informed of the reason for the lorry’s detention. Even if it were accepted that the appellant spent much of the time between 6.00am and 2.00pm on 23 October 2003 trying to secure alternative supplies to meet his customers’ orders, the detention of the lorry was no small matter. The company stood to lose money on the perishable fish carried on the lorry. Worse still, the loss of the lorry would have seriously disrupted the company’s operations and resulted in significant financial loss. Worst of all, there was the prospect of criminal liability. There was ample reason and opportunity for the appellant to call Gim Hock. That he did not do so spoke volumes. The judge therefore was justified in finding that the appellant was concerned in the importation of the cigarettes on the lorry.
54        The packet of Marlboro cigarettes found at the appellant’s home, which was the subject matter of the first and second charges, connected the appellant to the cigarettes on the lorry. Indeed, it suggested that the appellant might have engaged in smuggling activities in the past. The packet was found at his home on 23 October 2003 even though he did not meet Khairu that day, so it had to have been brought there beforehand. He did not dispute that the packet was similar to those found on the lorry. The explanation he offered for how the packet came to be found at his home was incredible and contradictory. He testified that he smoked only Salem brand cigarettes, and had no intention of smoking the packet of Marlboro cigarettes. If so, why would he pick up the packet, which he supposedly found lying around in his small lorry, and take it home with him? He offered no explanation for this at all. The appellant’s other story, that Gim Hock would leave behind one packet of Marlboro cigarettes on his occasional visits to Singapore, was equally difficult to accept.
55        The appeal against conviction was dismissed. The appellant failed to show why the judge’s decision was unsound, and had done little to show why his version of events should be believed instead.
Sentencing
56        The appellant submitted that the imposition of terms of imprisonment on all four charges was not warranted in light of the authorities. Also, the terms imposed by the learned judge were manifestly excessive.
57        In 
Moey Keng Kong v PP
 
[2001] 4 SLR 211
, I set out the factors that were important in determining the appropriate sentence in cases involving the importation of uncustomed goods, namely:
(a)        the amount of duty evaded;
(b)        the quantity of goods involved;
(c)        repetition of the offence;
(d)        whether the offender was acting on his own or was involved in a syndicated operation; and
(e)        the role of the offender.
58        The appellant’s defence counsel had asked the court below to impose a term of imprisonment similar to that imposed on Khairu. No mitigating factors were presented before the judge by defence counsel, and none were presented before me by the appellant’s present counsel. The appellant had one previous conviction for reckless and dangerous driving in 1985.
59        The learned judge was correct in so far as the appellant was a bigger player in the scheme of things compared to Khairu, and so ought not to receive the same sentence as Khairu. Khairu was merely the deliveryman, and stood to gain, at most, the commission promised to him by Gim Hock. The appellant, on the other hand, stood to profit from the sale of the substantial quantity of smuggled cigarettes, on which he would have avoided paying a significant amount in customs duty and GST. He was specifically identified as the recipient of the cigarettes. He was in charge of the company’s operations in Singapore and Johor Baru. The company’s driver and lorry were used to transport the cigarettes.
60        Since Khairu received nine months’ imprisonment for his part in the smuggling of the cigarettes, the appellant could not expect to escape a term of imprisonment of at least the same length. Nevertheless, I was of the view that imposing a substantial fine in addition to an appropriate term of imprisonment would have been adequate to reflect the appellant’s greater culpability in this case. The appellant, being a reasonably successful businessman, certainly had the financial means to pay a substantial fine. I therefore allowed the appellant’s appeal against sentence on the third charge, and substituted a term of nine months’ imprisonment and a fine of $204,000 in default four months’ imprisonment. Similarly, on the fourth charge, I allowed the appeal against sentence, and substituted a fine of $12,000 in default one month’s imprisonment.
61        In respect of the first and second charges, the appellant submitted that the imposition of jail terms was excessive because he claimed that the customs authorities would not have bothered to collect customs duty and GST on one packet of cigarettes had he offered to pay, and that even if he were charged, the court would not have taken cognisance of such a minor offence. I must register my strong disapproval of these unfounded assertions, and I fail to see how this argument aids his case. However, I found that the sentences imposed in respect of these two charges were excessive, and substituted a fine of $3,000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment for each charge.
62        Overall, I reduced the appellant’s sentence from 15 months’ imprisonment to nine months’ imprisonment and added a fine of $222,000 in default six months’ imprisonment.
Conclusion
63        As an aside, counsel for the appellant informed me prior to the hearing that this was his first appearance before me in his many years in practice. I allowed his many requests for the court’s indulgence of his inexperience and inadequacies. Notwithstanding this, I noted that some of the language used in his submissions was excessive. A number of strongly worded and extravagant accusations had been directed at various parties connected with this case with little by way of supporting facts or coherent argument. That the appellant succeeded to some degree in his appeal should not be taken as the court condoning this manner of conducting court proceedings. With his long experience at the Bar, if not before this court, counsel should surely be familiar with the proper conduct of cases.
64        The appellant at the close of the trial asked for time to make the necessary arrangements for his family and business. I noted that six months had passed between the conclusion of the trial and the hearing before me, during which time the appellant had been out on bail. Nevertheless, I ordered that the commencement of the appellant’s term of imprisonment be deferred by two weeks from the date of the hearing, and that bail be extended in the meantime.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The respondent pleaded guilty in the Magistrate’s Court to one charge of employing a foreign worker without a valid work permit under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EFWA”) and one charge of failing to comply with the conditions of a work permit under s 22(1) of the EFWA. The respondent was convicted and sentenced to pay 35 months of levy at the rate of $345 per month for the first charge and a fine of $3,000 for the second charge. On an application by the Public Prosecutor for an order of compensation for the foreign worker’s unpaid salaries under s 401(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), the trial judge declined to make such an order. The Prosecution appealed.
2          At the start of the hearing, the Prosecution informed me that the respondent had agreed to make full payment of the maid’s unpaid salaries amounting to $3,580. Nevertheless, the Prosecution wished to continue with the appeal for a definitive decision on the order of compensation. After hearing the Prosecution’s arguments, I allowed the appeal and granted an order of compensation. I now give my reasons.
The facts
3          The charges against the respondent are set out below:
(a)        MOM Summons No 677 of 2004:
You      Enilia Donohue (F) (03/01/1975)
            (NRIC S7540756D)
of         521 WOODLANDS DR 14 #06-329 Singapore 730521
are charged that you, from on or about 01 December 2001 to 9 Aug 2003 at 521 Woodlands Drive 14 #06-329 Singapore 730521 did employ a foreigner, namely, Achdaniah (PPT No. AD008097) when a work permit in respect of the said foreigner allowing the said foreigner to work for you had not been obtained and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, Chapter 91A and punishable under section 5(6) of the same.
(b)        MOM Summons No 678 of 2004:
You      Enilia Donohue (F) (03/01/1975)
            (NRIC S7540756D)
of         521 WOODLANDS DR 14 #06-329 Singapore 730521
are charged that you, from on or about 01 December 2001 to 9 Aug 2003 at 521 Woodlands Drive 14 #06-329 Singapore 730521 did fail to comply with the condition of the Work Permit No. 0 0356021 – which was issued to Achdaniah (PPT No. AD008097) to work as a Domestic Worker for you, to wit, you had failed to pay the said foreigner the salary you declared in the Work Permit Application Form dated 5 Sep 2001 and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, Chapter 91A and punishable under section 22(1) of the same.
4          On 7 September 2001, a work permit was granted for an Indonesian female to work for the respondent as a domestic maid. The respondent subsequently defaulted on the payment of the maid levy to the Ministry of Manpower (“the Ministry”), resulting in the Ministry revoking the maid’s work permit on 1 December 2001. Instead of repatriating the maid and paying her all moneys and salaries due to her before the repatriation as required by conditions 3 and 5 of the work permit, the respondent continued to employ the maid for a further one year and eight months despite knowing that the work permit had been revoked.
5          During her employment with the respondent from 7 September 2001 to 9 August 2003, the maid was never paid her salaries which totalled $4,630. After the maid ceased to work for the respondent and shortly before her plea of guilt, the respondent ultimately made good a sum of $1,050 to the maid. There was a balance of $3,580 still outstanding.
6          The maid eventually reported the respondent to the police on 9 August 2003, leading to the discovery of the respondent’s contravention of the EFWA. The respondent subsequently pleaded guilty to a charge under s 5(1) of the EFWA for employing a foreign worker without a valid work permit and to a charge under s 22(1)(a) of the EFWA for failing to comply with the condition of the work permit to pay the foreign worker a salary.
7          The trial judge held that aggravating factors in the case merited sentences above the benchmarks for both offences. He convicted the respondent on both charges and sentenced her to pay 35 months of levy at the rate of $345 per month for the first charge, and a fine of $3,000 for the second charge.
The Prosecution’s case
8          The Prosecution cited several aggravating factors for the trial judge’s consideration in deciding whether to grant an order of compensation. The respondent had retained the maid in employment despite knowing that the work permit had been revoked. Further, according to the Prosecution, the respondent had kept the maid in the dark about the revocation. If the maid had not reported the respondent to the police for the unpaid salaries on 9 August 2003, the respondent would have simply continued to flout the law. Finally, the respondent’s irresponsible behaviour also resulted in the maid being classified as an overstayer. The Prosecution thus sought a compensation order on the basis of these aggravating factors.  
The decision below
9          The trial judge rejected the Prosecution’s arguments. First, he held that it was wrong of the Prosecution to cite the aggravating factors in support of the application for a compensation order as they were more appropriate for decisions as to sentencing. Second, he found that there was a high likelihood that the maid knew about the illegal employment and thus did not deserve to be compensated. Third, he held that the Prosecution had failed to give a satisfactory explanation of how the sum of $3,580 sought in the application for a compensation order was derived. Consequently, he refused the Prosecution’s application to make a compensation order under s 401(1)(b) of the CPC for the unpaid salaries owed by the respondent.
Preliminary issue of jurisdiction
10        Before dealing with the appeal proper, a preliminary issue raised by the Prosecution must first be dealt with. This was whether the High Court could, under s 256 of the CPC, hear an appeal relating to the granting of a compensation order and vary the order accordingly. In particular, could the High Court hear an appeal against the refusal by the trial judge to grant a compensation order?
11        Section 256 of the CPC provides that:
At the hearing of the appeal the court may, if it considers there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal or may —
(a)        in an appeal from an order of acquittal, reverse the order and direct that further inquiry shall be made or that the accused shall be retried or committed for trial, as the case may be, or find him guilty and pass sentence on him according to law;
(b)        in an appeal from a conviction —
(i)         reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be retried by a court of competent jurisdiction or committed for trial;
(ii)        alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the sentence; or
(iii)       with or without the reduction or enhancement and with or without altering the finding, alter the nature of the sentence;
(c)        in an appeal as to sentence, reduce or 
enhance the sentence
, or alter the nature of the sentence; or
(d)       
 
in an appeal from 
any other order
, alter or reverse the order.
[emphasis added]
12        The authorities seem to suggest that no appeal can lie against a compensation order as it does not form part of the sentence under s 256(c) of the CPC. In 
PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny
 
[1993] 3 SLR 885
, Karthigesu JA held at 893, [28] that:
[A] compensation order under [s 401(1)(b) of the CPC] is not part of the ‘sentence’ and consequently the High Court would not have the power under s 256 to make such an order. In our opinion, a compensation order is not ‘punishment’ for an offence under the Penal Code.
13        In 
Lim Poh Eng v PP
 
[1999] 2 SLR 116
, after referring to the above passage in 
PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny
, I stated at [45] that:
Since a compensation order is not regarded as part of the ‘sentence’, the High Court does not have the power under s 256(b) or (c) to vary a compensation order. A compensation order could conceivably be varied under s 256(d) in ‘an appeal from any other order’. That section was however unavailable since the appeal was only with regards to conviction and sentence.
14        A common thread running through these two authorities is that the appeals involved had been against sentence or both conviction and sentence, to which ss 256(b) and 256(c) of the CPC applied. Framed this way, the appellate court, strictly speaking, could not “enhance the sentence” by making or varying a compensation order, simply because such an order did not form part of the sentence. However, I made the observation in 
Lim Poh Eng v PP
 that a compensation order could conceivably be varied under s 256(d) “in an appeal from any other order”. I only stopped short of varying the compensation order because the appeal in 
Lim Poh Eng v PP
 had only been with regards to conviction and sentence and s 256(d) therefore did not apply. Therefore, it is clear that where an appeal lies against a compensation order made by the lower court, such an appeal can be heard by the High Court and the order accordingly maintained or varied.
15        The only problem in this appeal was that the trial judge had made no compensation order at all. Strictly speaking, there was no existing compensation order from which the Prosecution could appeal. In other words, it was technically not “an appeal from any other order” under s 256(d) of the CPC. Nevertheless, I was of the view that there could be an appeal against the court’s refusal to grant a compensation order. The opposite conclusion would be absurd, for it would mean that an appeal would be possible if the court awarded a manifestly inadequate amount of compensation, but no appeal would be possible if the court refused to grant any compensation. It cannot be Parliament’s intention for the High Court’s appellate powers to be so circumscribed.
The appeal
16        The Prosecution appealed against the trial judge’s refusal to grant the compensation order under s 401(1)(b) of the CPC on the following grounds:
(i)         that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in failing to grant a compensation order for the period from 7 September 2001 to 1 December 2001, during which the victim received no salary, notwithstanding the existence of a valid work permit;
(ii)        that the trial judge erred in law and fact in failing to grant a compensation order for the period from 1 December 2001 to 9 August 2003, during which the victim received no salary after the revocation of her valid work permit;
(iii)       that the trial judge erred in law by holding that the aggravating circumstances in this case cited by the Prosecution only applied to sentencing and were not relevant in support of an application under s 401(1)(b) of the CPC;
(iv)       that the trial judge erred in law and fact in finding that this was not a case where the amount of compensation could be readily and easily ascertained; and
(v)        that the trial judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the strong public policy arguments that would favour the making of a compensation order in cases such as this.
17        I will first examine the nature of a compensation order and the principles relating to the award of compensation before addressing the above arguments.
Nature of a compensation order
18        Section 401(1)(b) of the CPC gives the court wide powers to order a convicted person to pay compensation to “any person or to the representatives of any person injured in respect of his person, character or property by the crime or offence for which the sentence is passed”.
19        A compensation order allows compensation to be recovered where a civil suit is an inadequate remedy due to the impecuniosity of the person injured. The Court of Criminal Appeal in 
PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny
 cited the following proposition from 
R v Inwood
 (1974) 60 Cr App R 70 at 73:
Compensation orders were not introduced into our law to enable the convicted to buy themselves out of the penalties for crime. Compensation orders were introduced into our law as a convenient and rapid means of avoiding the expense of resort to civil litigation when the criminal clearly has means which would enable the compensation to be paid.
Principles relating to the award of compensation
20        There are several principles relevant for the purposes of deciding whether a compensation order should be granted.
21       
 
Firstly, a compensation order does not form part of the sentence (
PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny; Lim Poh Eng v PP
), nor is it an alternative to a sentence (
R v Miller
 [1976] Crim LR 694). Therefore, it should not be used as further punishment of a convicted person, and the amount of compensation ordered should not exceed the amount of damage caused: 
Emperor v Maung Thin
 (1909) 10 Cr LJ 78.
22        Secondly, there must be a causal connection between the offence of which the accused is convicted and the personal injury, loss or damage in respect of which the compensation order is made: 
R v Deary
 (1993) 14 Cr App R (S) 648. In other words, the court may make a compensation order only in respect of the injury or loss which results from the offence for which the accused is convicted. The court should adopt a broad common-sense approach in assessing whether compensation should be awarded. It should not allow itself to be enmeshed in refined questions of causation which may arise in claims for damages under contract law or tort law: 
per
 McCullough J in 
Bond v Chief Constable of Kent
 [1983] 1 All ER 456. In the present appeal, the requisite nexus was made out. The maid’s financial loss was occasioned by the failure of the respondent to pay all salaries due to her, thereby breaching condition 5 of the employer’s conditions (where employer undertakes to “pay [his/her] foreign worker all salaries due to him”) in the work permit application form and s 22(1)(a) of the EFWA.
23        Thirdly, compensation will be ordered only in clear cases where the damage is either proved or agreed: 
R v Vivian
 [1979] 1 All ER 48. The assessment of loss or damage must be based on evidence and not simply on representations by the Prosecution: 
R v Horsham Justices, ex parte Richards
 [1985] 2 All ER 1114.
24       
 
Fourthly, it was established in 
R v Daly
 (1973) 58 Cr App R 333 that the power to make compensation orders should only be used for dealing with claims in straightforward cases. Compensation orders are designed for cases where the amount of compensation can be readily and easily ascertained, and are not for cases where the amount of damages or loss is notoriously disputed: 
R v Donovan
 (1981) 3 Cr App R (S) 192. Although the court can hear evidence in order to determine questions as to the fact or quantum of loss, the court should not embark on any complicated investigation: 
R v Briscoe
 (1994) 15 Cr App R (S) 699. Indeed, an order should only be made where the legal position is quite clear: 
R v Miller
. The court should decline to make a compensation order unless it is based on very simply stated propositions which have been agreed on or which are simple to resolve: 
Hyde v Emery
 (1984) 6 Cr App R (S) 206.
25        The present case was one in which the quantum of compensation could be readily computed. Since the compensation was for unpaid salaries due to the maid, the computation should be the number of months of employment multiplied by the monthly salary, less salaries already paid. The Prosecution stated in the skeletal arguments that the maid was to have been paid $10 for the first three months and $230 for the next twenty months. Shortly before her plea, the respondent made two quick payments amounting to $1,050 in the hope of mitigating her guilt. This left the net salaries due and payable to the maid to be $3,580. The computations are as follows:
 
 
 
 
Monthly salary
 
 
 
Number of months (relevant period)
 
 
 
$
 
 
 
 
 
$10
 
 
 
3 (7 September 2001 – 30 November 2001)
 
 
 
30
 
 
 
 
 
$230
 
 
 
20 (1 December 2001 – 9 August 2003)
 
 
 
4,600
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4,630
 
 
 
 
 
Less: Salaries already paid so far
 
 
 
(1,050)
 
 
 
 
 
Net salaries due
 
 
 
3,580
 
 
 
 
26
       
 Fifthly, the order must not be oppressive, but must be realistic in that the court must be satisfied that the accused either has the means available, or will have the means, to pay the compensation within a reasonable time (
R v Parker
 (1981) 3 Cr App R (S) 278). In the present appeal, judging by the fact that the respondent was able to make full payment of her fines totalling $15,075, she was likely to be a person with the means to pay the compensation sought.
27        It is now appropriate to examine whether the trial judge’s exercise of discretion to refuse a compensation order was justified.
Whether a compensation order should have been granted
28        The Prosecution submitted that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in failing to grant a compensation order for the entire period of employment. In submitting that a compensation order should also be granted for the period from 7 September 2001 to 30 November 2001 where there had been a valid work permit, the Prosecution also applied to amend the charge in which this period of employment had been omitted. For this issue, I had to first examine the question whether the
 
High Court is empowered to amend a charge in an appeal against a refusal by the Magistrate’s Court to grant a compensation order. Secondly, I had to consider if there are any principles governing the exercise of discretion in granting compensation orders, and to bear the principles in mind when deciding whether a compensation order should have been granted for the whole period of employment of the maid in the circumstances.
Amendment 
of
 
charge
29        The Prosecution pointed out that the charge MOM 678 of 2004 pertaining to s 22(1) of the EFWA had mistakenly omitted the maid’s first period of employment between 7 September 2001 to 30 November 2001, where there had been a valid work permit. The Prosecution thus applied to this court to amend the charge under s 256 of the CPC to include the said period so that the relevant period for this charge would read from 7 September 2001 to 9 August 2003.
30        Section 256 of the CPC sets out the powers of an appellate court in hearing appeals against acquittal, conviction, sentence or any other order. It is established law that with regards to appeals from conviction, the High Court has the power under s 256(b) to amend a charge and consequently convict an accused person on the amended charge: 
Annis bin Abdullah v PP
 
[2004] 2 SLR 93
; 
Er Joo Nguang v PP
 
[2000] 2 SLR 645
; 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
 (“
Garmaz
”). However, it has been laid down in 
Ng Ee v PP
 
[1941] 1 MLJ 180
 and 
PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
[1996] 1 SLR 573
 that several safeguards must be rigorously observed: First, the power to amend a charge under s 256(b) is not unlimited and has to be exercised with great caution and not to the prejudice of the accused person; second, the amendment must also not affect the substance of the evidence from both the Prosecution and the Defence.
31        The issue to be examined in the present case is whether the High Court can exercise its powers under s 256 to amend a charge in an appeal against “any other order” in s 256(d). In particular, can the High Court exercise its powers to amend a charge in an appeal against a refusal by the Magistrate’s Court to grant an order of compensation?
32        Although 
Garmaz
 related to an appeal against conviction, the following passage is instructive in showing that our courts have adopted a liberal construction of s 256. The Court of Appeal in 
Garmaz
 held at 412, [28] that:
If a literal and strict construction is adopted, it is clear that the High Court has no such power. However, such a construction would lead to incongruous results: on the one hand the court by that section is given extensive powers in respect of conviction, sentence and findings, and yet on the other it has no power to amend the charge, and the consequence of this is that it has no power even to correct any errors appearing in the charge. Such a position is untenable. Further, the High Court has the revisionary powers under ss 266–268 of the CPC. In view of these extensive express powers, 
it is inconceivable that it was the intention of the legislature that the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, should not have the power to amend the charge preferred against the accused and set the record straight. A more purposive construction should in our view be adopted.
 [emphasis added]
33        In 
PP v Annamalai Pillai Jayanthi
 
[1998] 2 SLR 165
, the High Court held that it had the power under s 256(a) to amend a charge on an appeal against an acquittal, so long as no prejudice was suffered by the accused person as a result. There would not be any prejudice if the Prosecution would have led substantially the same evidence on the amended charge. In that case, I observed at [18] that:
In 
Garmaz
 … the Court of Appeal held that the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, possessed the implied power to amend a charge when exercising its powers on an appeal from a conviction pursuant to s 256(b) of the [CPC]. 
A fortiori, the High Court is empowered to amend a charge while exercising its powers under s 256(a) of the same Code, on appeals from orders of acquittal
. The only limiting factor in each case is the prejudice, if any, suffered by a defendant. In the present case, there was none. 
The prosecution would have led substantially the same evidence
 on a charge of abetment in the commission of an offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA.
 
[emphasis added]
34        In 
PP v R Sekhar s/o R G Van
 
[2003] 2 SLR 456
, relying on the authority of the Court of Appeal’s decision in 
Garmaz
, I also exercised powers under s 256 to amend a charge on appeal against an acquittal as opposed to an appeal against conviction. The accused person was then convicted on the amended charge and sentenced accordingly.
35        In my view, this court also has the power under s 256(d) of the CPC to amend a charge relating to an appeal against a refusal to grant a compensation order. However, such an amendment should only be made where the safeguards set out in 
PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 and 
Ng Ee v PP
 are observed. In the present case, the amendment sought did not bring in any new charges and was only a correction of the period of employment of the maid during which she received no salary. Such an amendment did not affect the substance of the evidence led by Prosecution and did not prejudice the respondent in any way. I therefore allowed the amendment.
36        I shall now deal with the principles governing the exercise of discretion in the granting of compensation orders.
The exercise of discretion
37
       
 Section 401(1)(b) of the CPC provides that “[t]he court … may, in its discretion, make ... an order for … compensation”. It is evident that this provision confers a discretion on the trial judge to grant compensation orders.
38
       
 There is, however, a dearth of authorities providing guidance as to the exercise of the discretion by the trial judge to order compensation and the role of the appellate court in handling appeals concerning the exercise of such discretion. Apart from a recent judicial pronouncement in 
Ho Yean Theng Jill v PP
 
[2004] 1 SLR 254
, there is very little jurisprudence developed in this area. In 
Ho Yean Theng Jill v PP
, I stated at [37] that:
A trial judge is always entitled to consider whether the discretion should be exercised to make a compensation order under s 401(1)(b) of the CPC. … [I]f persons in the position of the appellant are truly remorseful and genuinely sincere about their offers to compensate their domestic maids for the injuries, there is nothing to prevent a trial judge from ordering a compensation order under s 401(1)(b) of the CPC if the facts of the case warrant it. … If the accused person is subsequently found guilty of the offence, the compensation order may be made in addition to the punishment to be meted out. 
I reiterate that the trial judge should make a compensation order in addition to the punishment to be meted out only in appropriate cases where the facts and circumstances of the case warrant it.
 [emphasis added]
39        As regards general principles relating to when the appellate court will interfere with an exercise of discretion by a trial judge, I have also made pronouncements elsewhere on this issue. Although these are culled from authorities that do not deal with compensation orders, they are nevertheless highly relevant for the purposes of this appeal. As to the discretion of a judge to grant or withhold consent to composition, I expressed the view in 
PP v Norzian bin Bintat
 
[1995] 3 SLR 462
 at 474, [52] that:
[T]hat discretion is a judicial discretion and therefore one which must be exercised not only in accordance with the rules of reason and justice but also in accordance with the provisions of the law.
40        In 
Kee Leong Bee v PP
 
[1999] 3 SLR 190
 at [21], which was cited in 
Ho Yean Theng Jill v PP
 at [40] and 
Chua Tian Bok Timothy v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 208
 at [8], I also held, in relation to the judge’s discretion to refuse or allow composition, that:
Where an order involves a discretion of the court, the appellate court will not interfere with the exercise of the discretion unless it was exercised on demonstrably wrong principles or without any grounds, or if the judge had ignored some relevant provision of law; see 
Lim Seng Gin v R
 
[1956] MLJ 76
 and 
R v Lim Kian Soo
 
[1950] MLJ 181
.
41        In summary, it is indisputable that where the matter involves the trial judge exercising his discretion, this discretion must be judicially exercised and there must be grounds for its exercise, for a discretion exercised on no grounds cannot be judicial: 
per
 Lord Sterndale MR in 
Ritter v Godfrey
 
[1920] 2 KB 47
 (which I had cited in 
Ho Yean Theng Jill v PP
 at [41]).
Whether a compensation order should have been granted for the period when the maid had worked with a valid work permit
42       
 
From 7 September 2001 to 30 November 2001, there had been granted a valid work permit which allowed the maid to work for the respondent. However, the maid was paid no salary at all during this period.
43        The Prosecution had, in the proceedings below, applied to the trial judge for a compensation order covering the whole period of employment from 7 September 2001 to 9 August 2003. The trial judge had refused to grant the order entirely as he took objection to the later stage of employment (1 December 2001 to 9 August 2003) when the work permit had been revoked. In any event, the trial judge could not have granted the order for the period from 7 September 2001 to 30 November 2001 as this period had been omitted from the charge. As mentioned earlier, I have allowed the amendment of the charge to include the said period.
44        There seems to be no reason why the maid should not be given compensation for her services during the period of 7 September 2001 to 30 November 2001. She had worked for the respondent under a valid work permit and ought to be remunerated for her services. I note that the trial judge had said in his grounds of decision (
[2004] SGMC 9
) at [8] that:
Had this case been a straightforward one solely under section 22(1)(a) for failing to pay the maid her salary and in breach of the conditions of a 
valid
 work permit, I would have been more forthcoming in making a compensation order for the unpaid salaries. [emphasis in original]
45        The victim was clearly entitled to compensation at least for her first period of employment from 7 September 2001 to 30 November 2001 during which she had worked under a valid work permit. I would accordingly grant an order of compensation for this period.
Whether the trial judge should have ordered compensation for the period when the maid had worked without a valid work permit
46        This was the more problematic issue on appeal. During the period between 1 December 2001 and 9 August 2003 where the maid had been in the respondent’s employment without a valid work permit, the trial judge had refused to grant a compensation order on the basis that the maid was an “accomplice” in the illegal employment. He held that by granting the order he would then be seen to be “condoning her action in the whole illegal venture”. Indeed, the trial judge had said in his grounds of decision at [8] that:
[T]he compensation order that I was asked to make pertained to unpaid salaries that included the period when the maid’s work permit was revoked. In other words, the unpaid salaries included the period when the maid was classified as a illegal immigrant or overstayer …
47
       
 In order to determine whether a compensation order should have been granted for the period during which the maid had worked without a valid work permit, it is important to first ascertain the purpose such an order aims to achieve. It is already well-established law that a compensation order is not part of the sentence, nor is it a form of punishment for an offence (
PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny
). The objective of granting a compensation order is to recompense victims of crime for their injuries or losses suffered. It may act as a token of remorse on the accused’s behalf, but it is not targeted at punishing the accused, nor is it an enhancement of the sentence imposed upon him. The focus is on redressing the victim’s loss in a justifiable manner.
48        The next question then is whether an order should be made to recompense the maid for her unpaid salaries, given the fact that these salaries had stemmed, for the period between 1 December 2001 to 9 August 2003, from an illegal employment due to her work permit having been revoked. In the few cases where compensation orders have been granted, the facts leading up to the grant of a compensation order have been straightforward. For instance, in 
Lim Poh Eng v PP
, the district judge had granted a compensation order upon the conviction of the accused for causing grievous hurt by an act which endangered the life or personal safety of others under s 338 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). There was no question of whether the victim’s right to the compensation had been tainted by any fault of her own. The court did not have to engage in a balancing exercise to decide if the victim was deserving of compensation.
49        The trial judge laid great emphasis on the issue of illegality when deciding whether or not to grant the order. The trial judge said that as the maid had been fully aware of the revocation of her work permit, and yet colluded with her employer to continue working without a valid permit, her involvement in the illegal employment tainted her right to compensation under s 401(1)(b) of the CPC.
50        The trial judge had, in particular, expressed the following concerns at [8]:
Strictly speaking, in light of the facts of the case, the maid may not be a “person … injured in respect of his person, character or property by the crime or offence” but a 
potential accomplice
 of the accused, as far as the section 5(1) offence is concerned. 
Although the prosecution sought to downplay the maid’s role by making a bare statement in the submission that the maid was kept in the dark about her work permit being revoked, I was not prepared to accept this fact conclusively in the absence of other supporting facts. This was telling from the Statements of Facts, both of which were conspicuously silent on the point that the maid was kept in the dark
. [emphasis added]
He further added, at [10]:
There is a strong and lingering possibility that the maid may also be an accomplice to the entire venture. If I were to grant her the unpaid salaries for the period that she was not on a valid work permit, I could be seen as condoning her action in the whole illegal venture.
 
In addition, there was indication from the accused that she had paid some money privately to the maid. In fact, the prosecution conceded that some payment was made to the maid, in the sum of $1,050. 
This part payment to the maid does lend support to the lingering possibility that the maid may be in the know all along and decided to go along with her employer.
 It was true that she went to the police subsequently but this did not detract from any possible initial collusion with the accused. [emphasis added]
51        With respect, I found that the trial judge had exercised his discretion improperly. His reason for refusing to grant an order of compensation was the alleged participation of the maid in the illegal employment. On closer examination of the record of proceedings, it was evident that no evidence was adduced at trial to show that the maid had continued to work for the respondent despite knowing that her work permit had been revoked. The Statement of Facts displayed nothing to suggest that the maid was an accomplice of the respondent to her illegal employment. The Notes of Evidence also indicated that the trial judge did not clarify with the Prosecution at the hearing whether the maid was aware of the revocation of her work permit at any point in time during her employment with the respondent.
52        The trial judge had opined that the fact that the respondent had paid some money ($1,050) privately to the maid “lent support to the possibility that the maid may be in the know all along and decided to go along with the employer”. In the absence of supporting facts, all this was mere speculation. There was no basis for the trial judge not to grant the order since there was no evidence to support his suspicion that the maid had been complicit in the illegal employment.
53        In the light of the above circumstances, I allowed the appeal and granted an order for compensation for the period in which the maid had worked without a valid work permit.
Public policy considerations
54        In reaching the above decision, I took into account the existence of strong public policy considerations in this area.
55        Our courts have taken an uncompromising stance against errant employers who exploit and abuse their foreign domestic maids. Emphasis has consistently been placed on the strong element of public interest involved when a foreign domestic maid is hurt or abused: 
PP v Chong Siew Chin
 
[2002] 1 SLR 117
. There have been various pronouncements in case law reiterating that foreign domestic maids have to be protected and cared for during their employment in Singapore in order that our nation evolves to become a more gracious society: 
Ho Yean Theng Jill v PP
; 
Ong Ting Ting v PP
 
[2004] 4 SLR 53
. Sufficient weight must therefore be given to the public policy arguments that would favour the making of a compensation order for the victim’s unpaid salaries.
56        In 
Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP
 
[2001] 4 SLR 610
 (“
Farida
”), I elaborated on why added protection must be afforded to foreign maids in view of their special circumstances, at [26] to [27]:
During the parliamentary debate on the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill on 20 April 1998, the Minister for Home Affairs listed the reasons for the enhanced penalties:
(1)        Maids are especially vulnerable to abuse by their employers because they ‘work within the confines of their employers’ home for 24 hours of the day … are isolated from the rest of society … and depend on their employer for food and lodging’.
(2)        Maid abuse should not be tolerated in a gracious society, which is what Singapore aspires to be.
(3)        Maid abuse is also detrimental to Singapore’s international reputation and bilateral relations.
Section 73 was passed in response to an alarming increase in maid abuse cases from 1994 to 1997. Maid abusers have certain misconceptions which must be corrected. A maid sells her services; she does not sell her person. An employer should not exploit his maid’s dependence on him for food and lodging, for these are basic rights. A maid’s abased social status does not mean that she is any less of a human being and any less protected by the law.
57        Although 
Farida
 was a maid abuse case, the vulnerability of maids is not limited to physical abuse, but extends to financial exploitation by errant employers who default on the payment of their salaries. Maids stand in a position of vulnerability 
vis-à-vis
 their employers. Because of their often impecunious status, even if maids are owed salaries by their employers, it is understandable if most would be cowed into continuing to work for the employer for fear of being repatriated and in view of the prospect of being paid at some point in the future.
58        The maid in the present appeal earned $230 per month. Yet she was not paid at all for her services rendered. In such circumstances, she would not be likely to have the financial capability to pursue a civil claim against the respondent for her unpaid salaries. Further, the case was not one where the maid had from the outset entered into a conspiracy with the respondent to work for her in the absence of a valid work permit. There was a valid permit granted on 7 September 2001, which was revoked on 1 December 2001 through the irresponsible act of the respondent in defaulting on the maid levy. There was no evidence that the respondent and the maid had deliberately entered into an agreement to continue with the maid’s employment despite being aware of the revocation of the work permit.
59        I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that there was a need to send a strong signal that non-payment of salaries in breach of work permit conditions would be viewed upon seriously by the courts and that a stern sentence awaits employers who persist in circumventing the regulations of the Ministry.
Whether aggravating factors are relevant in deciding on a compensation order
60        The Prosecution had cited several aggravating circumstances of the case in support of its application for a compensation order under s 401(1)(b) of the CPC. The trial judge felt that the Prosecution seemed to conflate the principles relating to sentencing and those of the making of compensation orders. He held that the aggravating factors only applied to sentencing.
61        I agreed with the trial judge that it was inappropriate for the Prosecution to cite these aggravating factors in support of an application for a compensation order. As mentioned earlier, a compensation order is not punishment for an offence nor part of the sentence imposed for the offence (
PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny
). The aggravating factors cited by the Prosecution in support of the application for a compensation order were more appropriately addressed in sentencing. As a compensation order was not aimed at castigating the accused but at providing redress to the victim of crime, such aggravating factors were not relevant in determining the quantum of the compensation. In deciding whether to make or refuse the order, one should apply the principles relating to the grant of a compensation order listed above in [20] to [26]. In particular, one should look to the victim to see if the injury or loss suffered did flow from the offence of which the accused was convicted.
Conclusion
62        For the foregoing reasons, I allowed the appeal and made an order of compensation for the sum of $3,580 for the whole period of employment from 7 September 2001 to 9 August 2003.
