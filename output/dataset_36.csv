: The appellant was charged in the district court below for six immigration related offences under ss 57(1)(d) and (e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (`the Act`). Three counts were for employing three Indian national immigration offenders and the other three were for harbouring these offenders between the month of March 1998 and 21 April 1998. At the end of the trial below, he was convicted on all counts and sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each charge, two of which were to run consecutively. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. I dismissed his appeal on 29 June 1999 and these are my reasons.
 The prosecution case 
 
 
 
Scanlink Woodcraft (Scanlink) was a carpentry business operating in a factory building at 362, Paya Lebar Road, [num ]07-01 Singapore (the premises). It was registered as a sole proprietorship in the name of Madam Sim Sai Mui, the appellant`s mother. She testified that she left the management of the business entirely to her son, who is also known as Sunny Ong.
On 21 April 1998 at about 9.15pm police raided the premises and found four Indian nationals there. One of them asked Sergeant Tan Beng Wee, who was part of the raiding party, what they wanted to buy. The three Indian nationals to whom the charges related produced photocopied work permit cards which bore other persons` names and employers other than Scanlink. They could not produce any valid travel documents. The fourth Indian national was only visiting the premises. The other three were subsequently charged and convicted for entering Singapore without a valid pass or permit under s 6(1)(c) of the Act.
 The evidence of the immigration offenders 
 
 
 
The prosecution called all three immigration offenders, Pandiduray (PW3), Vellaisamy (PW4) and Manickam (PW8), as witnesses. PW3 had been unemployed and was looking for a job. Sometime in March 1998, he was walking along Paya Lebar Road and came to the factory building. He went from door to door looking for work. He met the appellant on the seventh floor and asked him for work. The appellant asked to see his travel documents but PW3 had only a photocopied work permit (P7) bearing the name `Alagan Ganesan` to show him. The appellant looked at it but did not follow up by asking to see PW3`s passport. As instructed, PW3 came back the next morning and the appellant gave him work, which included fixing, painting, and moving furniture. PW3 only worked two or three days a week after either of the other two Indian nationals (PW4 and PW8) informed him that there was work to be done. The appellant instructed PW3 on what work to do and paid him his wages every Saturday at a rate of between $18 to $20 per day.
On about six occasions, PW3 stayed on the premises whenever he had to work overtime. PW3 said that he did not ask for permission to do so but the appellant knew about this because, on one occasion, the appellant woke him up in the morning to start work. PW4 and PW8 also worked for the appellant and slept in the premises, the latter having been given the keys to the premises.
With respect to the other two Indian nationals, PW3 said that they worked at the appellant`s factory together with him, though they had started earlier. PW3 testified that the appellant brought them to other places to work, such as the Serangoon Gardens Country Club (SGCC) and some blocks of flats. At the former location, they painted furniture and doors and carried out parquet tiling with the appellant in supervision most of the time. K Radakrishnan (PW9) was not with them when they worked at the blocks of flats. However, PW3 saw PW9 at SGCC once laying pipes. Finally, PW3 testified that he told the police that the appellant was his employer on arrest and identified him later at the police station.
PW4 came to Singapore sometime in January 1998 and started working for the appellant soon afterwards. He met a foreign Indian man in `Teka` and asked for work, not having eaten for days. The Indian man took him to see the appellant, who told him to report for work the following day. He was asked by the appellant if he had a work permit card. PW4 handed him a photocopied work permit card which bore the name `Adaikappan`. PW4 had also bought the work permit card from `Teka`. The appellant went to his office with the card and returned it to him a little later.
PW4 saw the other two Indian nationals, PW3 and PW8, working there. He was asked to do the same work as the other two and was paid $50 a week every Saturday by the appellant. They were at other worksites such as flats and the SGCC. Day to day instructions for work at the premises or the other worksites were given to them by the appellant, who brought them to the other worksites as well.
The appellant gave PW4 permission to sleep at the premises every night. PW3 and PW8 also slept at the premises. The appellant gave him the key to the premises and would wake them up for work every morning when he came there at about 8 am. Finally, PW4 testified that the appellant had come to the police station where they were detained and showed the police a photocopy of their work permits, identifying them as his employees.
In a similar fashion, Manickam (PW8) was roaming around Geylang sometime in February 1998 when he was approached by one `Ah Goon` who asked if he wanted work. PW8 was brought to the appellant`s factory and waited outside while `Ah Goon` went in to speak to someone. PW8 was then able to start work the next day at the premises. One or two days after he started, a man named `Ah Seng` asked to see PW8`s work permit. PW8 showed him a forged work permit. The appellant also asked to be shown one. PW8 promised to do so but eventually did not as `Ah Seng` had already seen it.
The appellant generally gave him instructions on work and paid him his wages. PW3 and PW4 also worked there with him. The latter was already there when he arrived and PW3 appeared a few days later. He stayed at the premises overnight for around a week whenever he had overtime work and asked the appellant for permission. He could not understand the appellant`s response but stayed nonetheless. The appellant likewise woke him up in the morning whenever he stayed over and had seen him sleep over on about two occasions. PW8 said that PW3 also stayed over whenever he had overtime work to do.
 K Radakrishnan (PW9) 
 
 
 
PW9 said he had known the appellant for about ten years as a friend. He was also engaged to carry out plumbing and general works at the appellant`s worksites as a sub-contractor. In December 1997, PW9 did some plumbing work for the appellant at SGCC, but was there for only a day. He remembered PW3 being there assisting him. There was another assignment in Sengkang in April 1998. The appellant instructed PW4 and PW8 to assist him in order to complete the work on time and paid them. On a separate note, PW9 also stated that he paid the appellant $500 a month since November 1997 to store his tools in the premises.
At a coffeeshop sometime between April and June 1998, the appellant informed PW9 of the arrest of the three Indian nationals and asked for his help. PW9 agreed and the appellant said he would give him some typewritten documents to sign. The appellant subsequently gave him several documents to sign on three or four different occasions and he did so around the time the appellant was charged in court for the present offences. These documents comprised: 
(a) a sub-tenancy agreement dated 22 November 1997 between the appellant and PW9, which allowed him to store his tools and equipment in the premises and required him to be responsible for the movements of his own workers (P10); 
(b) a letter of request dated 28 November 1997 from PW9 to the appellant seeking the latter`s assistance in paying PW9`s workers directly and granting them cash advances up to a limit of $80 per week for food (P11); 
(c) a note dated 30 November 1997 signed by PW9 indicating his acceptance of a SGCC sub-contract providing labour for `general works` for a consideration of $12,500 payable by instalments and beginning 2 December 1997 (P12); 
(d) eight payment vouchers for payments made to PW9 as a sub-contractor of the appellant, six of which were stated to be for the SGCC project (P13 to P20); and 
(e) a statutory declaration signed by PW9 dated 22 June 1998, to the effect that PW3, PW4 and PW8 were his foreign workers and that he had rented part of Scanlink Woodcraft`s premises for the storage of tools and materials at a rental of $500 per month (P21).
PW9 explained that he was an alcoholic. His drinking bouts would begin in the morning and they would affect his memory. He was drunk at the time he signed the documents, did not read their contents nor knew why he signed them. He asked the appellant what they were for and the latter replied that they were just a formality. He denied that he had ever made a request as indicated in P11, that he was ever awarded the sub-contract as acknowledged in P12 or that he had ever received the amounts as indicated in the payment vouchers.
He wrote the contents of P21 on the instructions of the appellant, though he was not forced to do so. The contents were false. He explained that he did so because the appellant assured him that it only involved a fine which he need not worry about. He thus made the statutory declaration because he wanted to help the appellant as a friend and did not expect any adverse consequences.
 SSgt Lim Chong Hoe 
 
 
 
SSgt Lim Chong Hoe (`SSgt Lim`), the investigating officer, arrested the appellant in the early hours of the morning of 22 May 1998. The appellant was kept in the lock-up and statements were taken from him the next day. He was released on bail between 7pm and 8pm. The appellant telephoned him later that evening at about 11.15pm and told him that he wanted to make additions to the long statement which he had given to SSgt Abdul Razak that morning. SSgt Lim told him to write to the Head of Investigations at Geylang Police Station.
The next morning, SSgt Lim received two letters from the appellant in which, for the first time, the appellant disclosed that the employer of at least two of the three immigration offenders was PW9. He provided PW9`s contact number but SSgt Lim on follow up discovered that the line had been terminated and had originally belonged to a Chinese family. The appellant did not provide any other details on PW9.
Documents P10 and P11 were received by the police on 15 June 1998 together with a letter of representation from his counsel. On 19 June 1998, SSgt Lim called the appellant and asked him to provide a further statement to clarify the issues raised by these documents and to bring PW9 along for questioning. The appellant told SSgt Lim that PW9 had admitted to employing the three Indian workers but would not come down to the station. The appellant would ask PW9 to make a statutory declaration to that effect. An appointment was then made to see SSgt Lim on 22 June 1998.
On that day, the appellant brought along a self prepared statement, a copy of P10 and six photocopied receipts for rentals paid by PW9. On 24 June 1998, at a pre-trial conference on the case, the appellant provided the officer representing the Public Prosecutor PW9`s correct pager number. SSgt Lim was also faxed a bundle of documents including P12 to P21, which were received for the first time.
Despite many attempts to contact him, SSgt Lim was only able to speak to PW9 on 13 July 1998. It was then that SSgt Lim learnt that the appellant had abetted PW9 in making a false statutory declaration. Consequently, SSgt Lim called the appellant to make a further statement on 20 July 1998, at which time the appellant also produced most of the originals of the documents he had faxed earlier.
 The voir dire 
 
 
 
On 22 May 1998, between 11.25am and about 1pm, Staff Sergeant Abdul Razak (`SSgt Razak`) recorded a long statement from the appellant. The material portions of the statement read as follows: 
 
 
... 
 
4 On 22 April 1998 in the morning, I went to my factory and found two of my Indian workers missing. The security guard also told me that the night before, police officers came and had arrested some Indian workers. I then photostated the work permits of my two Indian workers and brought it to Geylang Police to take my Indian workers out. In the police station S/Sgt Abdul Razak brought me to the lock-up and introduced me to four male Indians. I was only able to recognise two of them as my workers and pointed them out to S/Sgt Abdul Razak. They are Manickam and Chamy. I told S/Sgt Abdul Razak that I got the two workers from labour agent called Kumar. I was then asked to leave and that the police will called [sic] me later. I have known Kumar for three to four years. He has been supplying me labour to my factory regularly. 
 
5 I wish to say that both Manikan [sic] and Chamy had come to my factory to work for me at the same time. This was sometime in November 1997. Kumar had paged me and I had requested workers from him and he asked the workers to report to me. I cannot remember the exact date the two Indian workers commence work for me. But this was in November 1997. I deploy the workers to do general work in the factory like cleaning rubbish and breaking floor tiles in my clients homes. These two workers do not work for me everyday. If there is work I will pay them and if there is no work and I will give them some money [for] food. As such, they have been working for me off and on until they were arrested ... 
 
Q5: What measures do you take in ensuring that the workers supplied to you by Kumar have valid documents and are not overstayers or illegal immigrants? 
 
A5: When the workers come to my factory, I will ask the workers for their work permits. I will check the work permits to see if it is valid and will also photostat it... 
 
Q11: Who had allowed them to live in your factory premises? 
 
A11: They beg me to allow them to live in the factory premises. They asked me permission and I allowed them to live in the factory premises based on humanitarian grounds. I did tell them that they should find their own lodging if they can ... 
 
Q15: On the average, how much can each of the two Indian workers earn from you every month? 
 
A15: On the average, each of the Indian workers [earn] about $350 a month from me. 
 
Q16: Do they work for you every day and if they have no work do they standby in your company? 
 
A16: No. They will go and find other work ...
  
 
 
The appellant challenged the admissibility of this statement on the basis that it was made involuntarily. A voir dire was then conducted, during which his principal assertions, repeated on appeal, were: 
(a) He was told by the recorder SSgt Razak that he was bound to truthfully state the facts and circumstances with which he was acquainted but was not told that he was entitled to refrain from stating anything that might expose him to a criminal charge. 
(b) SSgt Razak threatened the appellant and told him to co-operate by telling the truth. Otherwise, more charges would be preferred against him. 
(c) SSgt Lim was also present during the recording of the statement. Both of them threatened the appellant that, if he did not co-operate, they would call the appellant`s mother and other family members for interrogation. SSgt Lim also promised to put the appellant on `light` charges and that he would be released after his statement was taken. 
(d) The appellant was not served breakfast and lunch and only had a cup of tea prior to the recording. He was also sick with flu and under medication which caused him to be drowsy.
SSgt Razak testified that the statement was recorded in a question and answer format, save for the paragraphs which were a transcription of the appellant`s own narration of events with the questions omitted. He recalled telling the appellant the charges he faced and that the appellant could say whatever he liked without admitting to anything he did not wish to. SSgt Lim did not intervene during the recording of the statement. SSgt Razak denied having threatened the appellant with more charges if the latter did not co-operate or that the appellant appeared sick and tired. Neither did the appellant inform him that he needed food or drink. At the end of the recording, the statement was read over to the appellant line by line and the appellant signed it in his presence. He handed the statement to SSgt Lim, who took over the matter from there.
SSgt Lim recounted that the appellant resisted arrest and put up a violent struggle on 22 May 1998. The appellant demanded that SSgt Lim produce an arrest warrant and dared him to shoot. Uniformed officers from the Tanglin Police Station were called in as the appellant refused to open the door. He sustained minor injuries to his wrists in the process of resisting being handcuffed.
At the station, SSgt Lim asked a colleague to send the appellant for a medical check up as he had claimed to be sick at his home during the arrest. The appellant refused to go for a check up and was placed in the station lock-up. According to the station lock-up diary, breakfast was served to all persons in the lock-up on 22 May 1998 at around 6.26am. The appellant was also allowed to take his medication at 7.50am. After SSgt Lim took over the matter from SSgt Razak, the appellant was offered lunch but he refused it.
SSgt Lim denied being present during the recording of the long statement, threatening the appellant in the manner alleged or promising him light charges and a speedy release in exchange for his co-operation. At about 11pm that day, after his release on bail, the appellant contacted SSgt Lim, stating that he wanted to make further statements. No mention was made of the substance of these further statements or that the appellant had been framed and was innocent of the charges.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The appellant elected to give evidence in his defence. He was the project co-ordinator for Scanlink. Its business was renovation contracting but it subcontracted out all work. However, Scanlink would supply materials to its subcontractors and carpentry work would be done on the premises.
The appellant had known PW9, who was one of his subcontractors, for about ten years. PW9 did general work, mainly plumbing, hacking, cleaning and painting. He had his own workers, some Singaporean and the rest foreigners, including Indians. He rented storage space in the premises and sometimes borrowed the appellant`s lorry for his own use. On two occasions, the appellant helped him transport his workers and tools to or from the premises.
Since November 1997, PW9 had done four projects for the appellant, including the SGCC, Lorong Limau, People`s Park office and Sengkang projects. General duty works under the first project included cleaning, staining of timber, parquet flooring and removal. He performed these projects using his team of Indian workers including PW3, PW4 and PW8. In fact, these three workers helped him in all the projects.
For the SGCC project, the appellant said that PW9 was drunk on some occasions during its currency. Usually, he would be instructed by the appellant every morning on the details or work to be done. He would then instruct his own workers. When he did not turn up because he was drunk, the appellant would be asked for assistance to instruct his workers directly.
In respect of the documents P10-P20, the appellant asserted that they were genuine. He had asked Rada to see his lawyer or SSgt Lim after his arrest to admit that PW9 was their employer. PW9 refused to see the lawyer, so the appellant asked him for a statutory declaration to the same effect. PW9 agreed and went to the High Court and voluntarily made the declaration (P21), passing the original to the appellant.
The appellant denied that he engaged the Indian workers when they either approached him personally for work or were brought to him by someone. He had not seen them spending the night in his factory nor had he given permission to do so. They were there on only one occasion doing some work for a subcontractor.
The day after the arrest, a security guard at the factory building told him that the Indian workers had been arrested. He then photocopied their work permits and brought them to the police station, in order to check if the workers who were caught were PW9`s. He was shown the workers by SSgt Razak but denied admitting that the workers were his. After having tried several times, he managed to speak to PW9 about the matter but PW9 did not come to see him as promised.
Finally, the appellant stated that he did not know how PW9 paid his workers, save that there was an arrangement as reflected in P11 for him to pay them on PW9`s behalf, especially PW4 (also known as Chummy) and PW8. The appellant did so. Further, he only instructed the workers when PW9 was not around.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The district judge rejected the appellant`s contentions concerning the recording of the long statement and admitted it after the voir dire. He accepted the testimonies of the immigration offenders and PW9 after weighing them against the evidence of the defence witnesses and considering their inherent probabilities. In particular, he also found that the appellant had fabricated certain documents to support his defence and abetted PW9 in making a false statutory declaration in furtherance of this. Accordingly, taking the contents of the long statement into consideration, he convicted the appellant on all the charges.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant challenged the findings made below on numerous grounds. The three main issues before me were whether the district judge erred in (a) admitting the long statement, (b) finding that the appellant had employed the immigration offenders and (c) finding that he had also harboured them.
 Admissibility of the long statement 
 
 
 
The appellant sought to revisit the question of the voluntariness of his long statement for the same reasons raised at trial. These encompassed the threats, inducements or promises allegedly made by SSgts Razak and Lim and the fact that he was tired, hungry and sick at the time he made the statement. I shall deal with his specific allegations seriatim.
As a preliminary, it must be noted that the district judge was apparently in error at [para ] 34 of his grounds when he considered that the appellant had not succeeded in proving that the statement had been made involuntarily. It is trite that the burden is always on the prosecution to prove the converse beyond a reasonable doubt: 
Panya Martmontree v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
 . The question before me was thus whether the prosecution had nevertheless discharged its burden based on the evidence adduced in the voir dire.
First, what was in substance an allegation of oppression. The relevant inquiry here was whether the circumstances prevailing at the time of the recording of the statement were such that the appellant`s free will was sapped and he could not resist making the statement: 
R v Priestly
 
[1967] 51 Cr App R 1
, 
PP v Tan Boon Tat
 
 
[1990] SLR 375
 
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 466
 . I noted that the length of questioning was only two hours. The appellant alleged that he only had a cup of tea during the whole morning, but the station lock-up diary contradicted this. He was offered medical attention but refused this and was allowed to take his medication. The note from his doctor only suggested that this medication caused drowsiness. His conduct prior to and after the recording of the statement, however, did not suggest that he was seriously ill at all. He violently struggled with the arresting officers. On his return from the station, he set about immediately to draft the two letters to SSgt Lim and delivered them that same night at about midnight. The evidence as a whole suggested that the appellant was perfectly alert and lucid, albeit tired. The circumstances here hardly came close to establishing the requisite weakening of the appellant`s free will that would render the statement involuntary.
Second, the allegation concerning SSgt Razak`s incomplete recitation of the provisions of s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). The alleged result of this was the impression that he was bound to state truthfully the facts and circumstances of the case with which he was acquainted without being aware of his entitlement to refrain from stating anything that might expose him to a criminal charge. The district judge first held that he accepted SSgt Razak`s testimony that the caution administered in substance reflected the terms of s 121(2). The notes of evidence reflect ample evidence to support this finding. For the reasons which follow, he was entitled to prefer this testimony over that of the appellant`s.
In the alternative, the district judge found that the appellant was not induced thereby to make the statement even if only the first portion of s 121(2) was narrated without informing him of his right to remain silent. It was not necessary to decide if the form of the caution administered here amounted to an inducement of the nature contemplated in 
PP v Mazlan bin Maidun & Anor
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 512
 . The first stage in determining if a statement is admissible under s 122(5) of the CPC is simply whether the statement is made as a consequence of any inducement, threat or promise: 
Seow Choon Meng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
 . Section 122(5) itself uses the phrase `caused by any inducement, threat or promise`.
I was satisfied that, even if the caution administered amounted to an inducement, it did not operate in the appellant`s mind nor cause him to make the statement. Rather, he disregarded it. After SSgt Razak told the appellant that he was bound to tell the truth, the appellant testified that he denied for half an hour that he had employed or harboured the immigration offenders. He decided to co-operate only when the threat concerning his mother was made. In fact, the appellant was quite explicit about this in his re-examination: 
 
 
Q: What was in your mind when you decided to co-operate with the police? 
 
A: I was afraid they might call up my family members up and lock them up. Also afraid they might lock me up until I confess. Because Sgt Lim told me he could detain me for more than 48 hours, he would apply through the court. And therefore my mind was thinking of getting out quickly and also I had in mind the incomplete works for my clients.
  
 
 
Third, the other threats concerning his family members and promises of an earlier release and lighter charges. I found the appellant`s entire account of the threats, inducements or promises made and his subjective motivations inherently improbable. His evidence was that he did not wish to implicate PW9 as he did not wish to betray a friend. In this respect, he did not know what the outcome of the charges was going to be or their gravity. It was only after the charges were read did he realise that he faced imprisonment. Yet, at the same time, he testified that he only signed his long statement together with the cautioned statement, and even then did not bother to read the contents of the statement but signed it blindly on SSgt Lim`s instructions. Even after he was made aware of the consequences, the appellant still chose not to betray PW9. This contradicted his earlier explanation why he chose to implicate himself in order to protect him.
There were several portions of his testimony relating to his attitude towards SSgt Lim that were equally implausible. In spite of the serious allegations of impropriety made against SSgt Lim, the appellant was only partially angry with him and even `understood` that it was his duty as a policeman and a part of police tactics or interrogation. In fact, the appellant said he was not angry that SSgt Lim used an unfair tactic to make him confess. This again went totally against the grain of his overall testimony on SSgt Lim`s conduct throughout the earlier evening and the recording.
Further, the appellant made no complaint that SSgt Lim or SSgt Razak had ill-treated him in the two letters he wrote immediately after his release. He explained that his main objective was to inform SSgt Lim that PW9 was the real employer so that the latter would make a fair investigation. This expectation was placed on a police officer whom the appellant alleged had coerced him to confess and abused his authority. About a week later, the appellant went to see SSgt Lim for a further statement just after he had sent out a letter complaining of SSgt Razak and SSgt Lim`s earlier conduct. At this point, he had not received any reply from the Head of Investigations but explained that he agreed to see SSgt Lim as he had no grudge against him.
The appellant also admitted that it was his view that it was unfair to charge an employer who merely checked work permits but not passports and that SSgt Razak had incorporated his complaints against immigration officials in Singapore into the statement. If the statement were indeed the fabrication of the police officers foisted on the appellant, it is difficult to understand why they would incorporate comments that were completely irrelevant to the charge.
On the whole, the notes of evidence of the voir dire revealed the appellant to be a shifty and evasive witness whose answers seemed tailored to suit the particular occasion. In contrast, the evidence of SSgt Lim, SSgt Razak and Sgt Kenneth Lee (the accompanying arresting officer) was substantially consistent. For these and the other reasons considered by the district judge, which were also amply justified on the evidence, I found that the statement was proven beyond a reasonable doubt to be voluntary and accordingly correctly admitted.
 Employment 
 
 
 
The arguments under this rubric were as follows. First, the district judge`s acceptance of the immigration offenders` evidence was against the weight of evidence. They contradicted each other on the dates of commencement of their employment. Their accounts of how this employment came about were also incredible. Finally, Chin Han Seng`s (DW3) and Jenny Peh`s (DW4) evidence contradicted their denial that PW9 was their employer. Secondly, the district judge also erred in accepting PW9`s evidence and, in particular, that P21 was false.
There were discrepancies in the evidence on the date of commencement of the immigration offenders` employment with the appellant. PW4 said that he started sometime in January 1998. PW3 said he commenced sometime in March 1998 while PW8 said it was around February 1998. However, in cross-examination, PW8 admitted that he was wrong as to his date of commencement of employment which was contradicted by the dates on the photographs of him and PW4 at work on 12 or 15 December 1997. It should be noted that PW4 admitted that he just estimated that he was employed two weeks after entering Singapore in January 1998. He is illiterate and therefore it would not surprising that he could have been mistaken as to the dates. PW3 could not be sure as well when he commenced work and could only make an estimate, and his evidence was not contradicted by any photographs.
Related to this was the inconsistency about who started employment first. PW4 said that the other two were already working for the appellant when he came, as did PW3. In this respect, PW8`s testimony was consistent with PW3`s but contrary to PW4`s. He was the second to be employed after PW4 and PW3 arrived after him. None of them however seemed to have really asked each other about this and their evidence seems to have been based on seeing the others around when they started work. Since they were sent to external work sites separately on occasion, it was entirely possible that they could have been mistaken as to the respective dates of their commencement of employment.
On the whole, and as the district judge pointed out, I found these to be minor discrepancies as they did not directly impact on the appellant`s culpability. Their testimony was on the whole coherent as to their appointment, work instructions, supervision, the payment of wages and their identification of the appellant as their employer at the station lock-up on 22 April 1998. There was also nothing inherently improbable in their accounts of how they were employed. These were illegal immigrants or overstayers who had not eaten for days and were desperate for any employment. They were also asked to do simple tasks that needed little training.
Finally, their evidence was also not materially contradicted by either DW3 or DW4`s evidence. DW3 said he saw PW9 and two of the immigration offenders together in the premises only once, but had seen the immigration offenders doing general work there. The appellant told him they were PW9`s workers, but he was in no position to independently verify this. He never actually saw PW9 instruct or pay them. Further, in cross-examination, he readily agreed that the appellant did not supervise them at the SGCC project, but, when questioned, further admitted that he did really notice as he was concentrating on his own work.
DW4`s evidence was also equivocal insofar as the three Indian nationals were concerned. Only one was identified as PW3, although she admitted that she could be mistaken. Her recollection of their appearance, using their size, reasonably left in doubt whether she accurately recollected who they were. Further, she admitted that she had no direct knowledge of their employment status, save for what the appellant himself told her. The district judge was thus entitled to attribute little weight to both their testimonies.
PW9`s testimony on the other hand remained intact, even after cross- examination, and the appellant confined his arguments to the fact that PW9 filled the contents of the statutory declaration himself and was not forced to make it. The appellant did not dispute that PW9 was a friend of 10 years and an alcoholic. More importantly, PW9`s evidence was reinforced by the appellant`s own conduct after the investigations had begun and the surrounding circumstances. The appellant failed to produce all the documents signed by PW9 until almost a month after his arrest. If they were genuinely executed in November 1997, there would have been no difficulty in producing them at the very start of the investigations. His explanation that he did not think of it at the time was rightly rejected. The appellant also failed to mention PW9 at all until after his long statement was recorded, and was unhelpful in assisting the police locate him even though he had known PW9 for ten years and admitted that he had his particulars.
The nature of the documents themselves also raised suspicion. In particular, it was strange that an agreement for the rental of mere storage space (P10) in the premises should also mention the movement of PW9`s workers in the premises. The two matters appeared unconnected, yet conveniently supportive of the appellant`s defence. Further, the request that the appellant pay PW9`s workers was signed on 28 November 1997, but PW9 only accepted the SGCC sub-contract on 30 November 1997. It was improbable that the former preceded the latter. All matters considered, the district judge was also entirely justified in accepting PW9 as a witness of truth and that the relevant documents signed by him were bogus.
There was also nothing significant about the fact that PW9 rented storage space in the premises. The majority of the witnesses (the offenders and DW3) hardly saw him at the SGCC work site throughout its five month duration. PW9 confirmed the PW3`s evidence that he was only at the site on one occasion to lay pipes. There was no concrete evidence that he was anything other than an independent contractor working by himself.
When the foregoing testimony was coupled with the appellant`s long statement, the acceptance of all three of the offenders` testimonies was clearly consistent with the overall weight of the evidence. Further, although the appellant challenged the accuracy of its recording, SSgt Razak testified that the statement was read back to the appellant line by line, and he signed on every page acknowledging this. The district judge was fully entitled in the light of the evidence to accept this.
Following from this, the appellant did not dispute that the evidence of the immigration offenders established an employment relationship (and thus the actus reus of the offence) between the immigration offenders and himself based on the instructions given on work and the payment of wages: see 
Lee Boon Leong Joseph v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 445
 .
 The presumption under s 57(8) 
 
 
 
Although not raised by the appellant, I should also mention in passing that the evidence of the appellant`s mother, his long statement, the immigration offenders and DW3 established that the appellant had substantial control of and access to the premises. He was thus an occupier within the meaning of s 57(8) read with s 2 of the Act: see 
 Lee Boon Leong Joseph v PP 
 (supra) at p 452. The arrest of the immigration offenders in the premises thus also raised the presumption that he knew they were immigration offenders. It was not at all suggested that the appellant satisfied the requirements of s 57(10)(b) of the Act by checking both the passport and original work permits of the Indian nationals, thus rebutting the presumption on a balance of probabilities. His own evidence in cross-examination was that he left the checking of the passports to PW9 and merely photocopied their work permits. The permits produced by the immigration offenders were clearly incomplete laminated photocopies and would have raised the suspicions of any reasonable person. He did not thus exercise the reasonable diligence required by the Act. All the elements of the offence under s 57(1)(e) were accordingly established.
 Harbouring 
 
 
 
In 
 Lee Boon Leong Joseph v PP 
 (supra) at p 457, it was held that the offence of harbouring consisted of the actus reus of harbouring as defined in s 2 of the Act. This is to provide food or shelter and includes the act of assisting a person in any way to evade apprehension. The mens rea is knowledge that the person so treated is an immigration offender. Proof of the mental element is assisted by the presumption in s 57(7), which is triggered on proof that the accused provided a place of habitation to an immigration offender with the intention or knowledge that they would inhabit that place and in fact did so.
The evidence supporting the remaining three charges rested principally on the immigration offenders` evidence and the admissions in the appellant`s long statement. PW9 was not in a position to offer any direct evidence on this and his evidence of the appellant`s fabrication of the documents did not lead to the necessary inference that the appellant also harboured all three immigration offenders in his factory. The evidence of Sgt Tan Beng Wee was simply that four Indian nationals were found in a corner of the premises. No mention was made whether the persons were working there at that hour or seeking shelter.
Accordingly, the evidence of the immigration offenders was vital in this context. The appellant argued that there was a serious discrepancy between the evidence of PW4 and the other two offenders. PW4 said that PW3 and PW8 stayed with him on the premises every night. This was clearly inconsistent with the testimony of the other two, which however corroborated each other. One would expect that PW4 would be clear on a material fact such as this. However, PW4 in re-examination admitted that he did not keep track of the number of days PW3 worked a week and that it was possible that he only worked three or four days per week. PW3 also took days off to visit his friends.
Nonetheless, PW4 and PW8`s evidence of the circumstances under which they stayed overnight in the premises was corroborated by the appellant`s answer in his long statement that he allowed them to live in the premises until they could find their own lodging. However, the long statement only referred to PW4 and PW8. On the question of providing shelter, PW3`s evidence was this: 
 
 
Q: Who gave you permission to spend the nights at the accused`s factory? 
 
A: No one gave me permission to stay there. I stayed there along with Manickam and Vellaisamy. 
 
Q: Was the accused aware you were spending nights at the accused`s premises? 
 
A: The accused was not aware. But on one occasion the accused work me up whilst I was sleeping.
  
 
 
PW4 also testified that the appellant woke all of them up in the morning for work when he arrived. PW8`s evidence was to a similar effect in respect of himself. The overall reliability of their testimony on this question was noted above. The likely inference from the foregoing evidence is that the appellant must have known that all three, including PW3, were using the premises for shelter at night and consented to this. I concluded therefore that there was more than adequate evidential basis to support the district judge`s acceptance of their testimony that the appellant provided them shelter although he did not specifically address the highlighted discrepancy in his judgment. There was no reason to disturb this finding.
 The presumption under s 57(7) 
 
 
 
Knowing that the immigration offenders used the premises for shelter at night, the appellant did nothing to stop them. In fact, PW4 continued to hold the key to the premises. The appellant admitted that he provided shelter for PW4 and PW8. He therefore provided habitation to them with knowledge that they in fact inhabited the premises. It was not disputed that the Indian nationals were in contravention of s 6(1) of the Act. The presumption under s 57(7) that he knew they were immigration offenders was thus triggered and for the same reasons in [para ] 59 above, the appellant failed to rebut this. Consequently, the offences under s 57(1)(d) were likewise also made out.
 Sentence 
 
 
 
The mandatory minimum sentence required by s 57(ii) of the Act is six months` imprisonment. The appellant was also found to have subverted the course of justice by fabricating evidence and abetting a false statutory declaration. The additional three months imposed per charge could hardly be said to be manifestly excessive as a deterrent to the aggravating behaviour exhibited.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the foregoing reasons, based principally on the unimpeachable or concurrent findings of fact, I dismissed the appeal against conviction and sentence.

On 30 July 1996, the respondent pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to one charge of throwing a cigarette butt into a roadside drain at Portchester Avenue. This was an offence contrary to s 18(2) and punishable under s 21(1) of the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95, 1988 Ed) (EPHA).
The statement of facts tendered by the prosecution was admitted by the respondent without qualification. It disclosed that on 18 May 1996 at about 10.22am, Environmental Health Officer M Supramaniam, who was performing his anti-littering rounds at Portchester Avenue, had seen the respondent throw the cigarette butt into the drain. He waited for about one minute to see whether the respondent would pick up the cigarette butt. When the respondent did not do so, M Supramaniam approached him, identified himself and explained the nature of the offence. He then issued the respondent a notice to attend court.
Upon the respondent`s conviction on his plea of guilt in Court 13N of the subordinate courts, the prosecution applied to the court pursuant to s 21A(1) of the EPHA to impose a corrective work order on him. Section 21A(1) provides: 
 
Where a person who is 16 years of age or above is convicted of an offence under section 18 or 20, and if the Court by or before which he is convicted is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to his reformation and the protection of the environment and environmental public health that he should be required to perform unpaid work in relation to the cleaning of any premises, the Court shall, in lieu of any other order, punishment or sentence and unless it has special reasons for not so doing, make a corrective work order requiring him to perform such work under the supervision of a supervision officer and in accordance with the provisions of this section and section 21B.
 
 
 
The prosecution pointed out that the respondent had compounded a similar offence, committed on 6 October 1992, on 20 January 1993. The respondent admitted that this was so. Consequently, according to the prosecuting officer, the respondent was a `repeat offender`. It followed that a corrective work order was expedient with a view to his reformation and the protection of the environment and environmental public health.
Counsel for the respondent argued, however, that the compounded offence had taken place some four years before the present one. While conceding that the compounded offence could constitute an antecedent for the purposes of sentencing, counsel nonetheless submitted that the respondent`s clean record for the intervening duration of four years demonstrated that he was not a person who required `reformation`. Thus, it would not be `expedient` to impose a corrective work order on him. At any rate, he was not a recalcitrant offender, against whom corrective work orders were targeted.
 The decision below
The magistrate took the view that the prosecution had failed to discharge its burden to show that a corrective work order should be imposed in the present case. He noted that the sole ground which was raised in support of the prosecution`s application was the fact that the respondent had previously compounded a similar offence in 1992. The magistrate opined that `there must be special circumstances about the case which differentiate it from other cases of littering, thereby necessitating the exercise of this sentencing option`. These special circumstances had to be such as to convince the court that a corrective work order should be made with a view to reform the accused and to protect the environment and environmental public health.
The magistrate referred to the Parliamentary Debates to ascertain the intention of the legislature in introducing the corrective work order in 1992. He noted the following statements made by Dr Ahmad Mattar, then Minister for the Environment, during the second reading of the amendment bill on 14 September 1992 (Parliamentary Debates, Vol 60 Cols 203-204): 
 
With the enactment of the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill 1992, recalcitrant littering offenders and those who commit serious littering offences which directly cause pollution or give rise to cleansing problems will be liable to be issued with a Corrective Work Order by the courts ... This Bill, presented before Parliament, seeks to introduce a greater deterrent against those who litter.
 
 
 
In the magistrate`s opinion, the respondent could neither be characterised as a `recalcitrant` nor a `repeat` offender. This was because there was only evidence of one previous compounded offence. In this regard, the magistrate found guidance from the decision in 
 Re Lim Chor Pee 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 154
; 
[1990] SLR 809
. In that case, the respondent had compounded various offences under the Income Tax Act (Cap 141, 1970 Ed). A disciplinary committee appointed under the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1985 Ed) recommended that disciplinary action be taken against him. Correspondingly, he was ordered to show cause why he should not be dealt with under s 80 of the Legal Profession Act. The judgment of the High Court was delivered by LP Thean J (as he then was) who observed at p 166 (MLJ) and p 831 (SLR): 
 
... composition of an offence by an alleged offender cannot constitute an admission of guilt against him. The effect of a composition is that no further action can be taken by the prosecuting authority against the accused on the offence compounded or indeed any other offence in respect of which he could plead autrefois acquit or autrefois convict in respect of the offence compounded.
 
 
 
There are multiple reasons why a person may wish to compound an offence, whether it be an income tax offence or an offence compoundable under the [Penal] Code, without any admission of guilt.
 
 
 
Adopting the above reasoning, the magistrate opined that since a compounded offence would not constitute an admission of guilt, it would strain logic to characterise an offender with merely a record of previous compositions as a `recalcitrant`. He also considered it relevant that the respondent had maintained a blemish-free record for four years since the compounded offence in 1992. This lapse of time showed that the respondent had not been recalcitrant in the ordinarily-understood sense of `wilfully disobedient`.
Additionally, it was noted that the nature of littering committed by the respondent was not `serious`. He had merely dropped a cigarette butt into a drain. This type of offence was in fact specifically referred to by the Minister for the Environment in the Parliamentary Debates of 14 September 1996 (at Col 211): 
 
A serious littering offence is one which will directly cause pollution or give rise to cleansing problems ... What the Environment Ministry may consider as minor littering offences would be littering with cigarette butts, or car park coupon tabs, and things like that.
 
 
 
In the result, the magistrate declined to impose a corrective work order. He sentenced the respondent to pay a fine of $300, which was the usual tariff imposed for first offenders. The prosecution appealed.
 The appeal
On appeal, the DPP contended that the magistrate had misdirected himself in requiring proof of `special circumstances` before he would impose a corrective work order. The DPP quite rightly pointed out that s 21A(1) of the EPHA did not say that special reasons had to be shown before a corrective work order could be issued. Rather, it was for the magistrate to decide, in the exercise of his judicial discretion and having regard to the evidence presented before him, whether the circumstances were such that the imposition of a corrective work order would be the appropriate course.
On my reading of s 21A(1) of the EPHA, I concurred entirely with the DPP that whether a corrective work order should be imposed was a matter for the court to determine in the exercise of its discretion. It would be erroneous to suggest that the prosecution had to discharge a burden of satisfying the court beyond reasonable doubt that a corrective work order would be expedient for the reformation of the respondent and the protection of the environment and the environmental public health. These are merely the broad considerations laid down by the legislature to guide the court in deciding whether a corrective work order would be appropriate in a particular case.
Section 21A(1) stipulates that `the Court shall, in lieu of any other order, punishment or sentence and unless it has special reasons for not so doing, make a corrective work order`. The phraseology adopted is `quasi-mandatory`. In effect, the imposition of a corrective work order is mandated, unless the court can cite `special reasons` why it should not do so. Even so, the concept of `special reasons` allows for some residuary discretion to be exercised, according to the justice of each individual case. For instance, a corrective work order may not be appropriate where the offender is physically or mentally unsuitable for carrying out the order. In this connection, s 21A(4) of the EPHA provides: 
 
In making a corrective work order, the Court shall consider the physical and mental condition of the offender and his suitability for carrying out the requirements of such order.
 
 
 
In the present case, no `special reasons` were mentioned by the respondent, nor was I able to discern any such reasons. The EPHA itself does not specify with clarity when a corrective work order would be deemed appropriate or expedient. In the premises, the Parliamentary Debates were useful sources of reference. In the words of the Minister for the Environment, `the corrective work order is intended for recalcitrant littering offenders and also for those who commit serious littering offences`. These are the key criteria according to which the court determines whether to impose a corrective work order.
In my opinion, the essential point for consideration on appeal was whether the respondent could have been properly characterised as a recalcitrant offender. There was no real argument that if this had been the case, a corrective work order could have been imposed with a view to his reformation, and in the interests of protecting the environment and the environmental public health.
Can a person who has compounded a previous similar offence then come within the purview of a `recalcitrant offender`? The magistrate reasoned that he could not, since a composition does not amount per se to an admission of guilt. The magistrate also considered that the respondent could not be correctly termed `recalcitrant` since his previous compounded offence, even if taken to be an admission of guilt, was committed some four years ago. These reasons were repeated by counsel for the respondent in his submissions before me, in support of the magistrate`s decision not to impose a corrective work order.
Composition of certain compoundable Penal Code offences amounts to an acquittal under s 199(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). It is also accepted that composition of an offence does not generally amount per se to an admission of guilt. As Thean J noted in 
 Re Lim Chor Pee 
`s case, there may be `multiple reasons why a person may wish to compound an offence ... without any admission of guilt`. Certainly, the principle of autrefois acquit should be scrupulously observed, to ensure that an offender who has compounded an offence is not tried again for the same offence. What I shall proceed to discuss does not purport to interfere with the operation of these established principles of law.
Clearly, evidence of previous convictions is not a pre-condition for the imposition of a corrective work order. In practical terms, the implementation of s 21A(1) of the EPHA depends either on evidence of commission of previous similar offences, or on evidence that a serious littering offence has been committed. The former type of evidence will demonstrate whether a person is a recalcitrant offender.
The ordinary dictionary meaning of the adjective `recalcitrant` is `obstinately disobedient` or `refractory` (
 The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary 
 (1993 Ed)). Counsel for the respondent agreed that an offender could be considered `recalcitrant` if, for example, he had chalked up twenty similar compounded offences over a given span of time. He conceded that in such a case, a corrective work order could have been justifiable and expedient. In my opinion, it would serve little purpose for the court to undertake the invidious task of assessing the varying degrees to which any particular offender could be said to be `recalcitrant`. Would this require a certain minimum number of prior compositions or convictions to have been accumulated before a corrective work order can be imposed? The EPHA certainly does not stipulate any minimum threshold figure. Where would the line be drawn then in determining whether an offender is `recalcitrant`? With respect, if I had accepted counsel`s submission, this would have created serious problems in implementing s 21A(1) of the EPHA. In effect, it would become unworkable and exposed to the vagaries of arbitrary assessment.
In my opinion, in the context of s 21A(1) of the EPHA and for the purpose of showing that an offender is `recalcitrant`, it would suffice to rely on evidence that he has previously committed the same offence on at least one occasion. He need not have been convicted of the offence. In the circumstances, I did not see why evidence of a compounded offence could not be relied upon for the specific purpose of imposing a corrective work order under the EPHA. It may be pertinent to note that at the point of introducing the EPHA amendment bill in 1992, the Minister for the Environment did allude to the Ministry`s policy of applying for a corrective work order even after an offence has been compounded. In the Parliamentary Debates (at Col 211) he stated: 
 
For minor offences, Sir, the offender will be offered a composition fine of $150. He is also expected to undergo a counselling session conducted by the Ministry. However, Sir, 
 if an offender who has committed a minor littering offence is a recalcitrant offender, then I am afraid he will not be offered a composition fine. Instead, he will be asked to appear in Court and may be liable for a CWO.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It can be seen that the practice of the Ministry was to offer composition for first-time offenders who commit `minor` or less serious littering offences. However, composition would not be an option available to `recalcitrant offenders`, even if they have only committed `minor` littering offences. It must follow that what Parliament had in mind was that even offenders who have compounded their previous littering offences, whether `minor` or `serious` in nature, would be potentially liable to be issued corrective work orders. This is clearly reflected in the statements of the minister cited above.
It would also be pertinent to consider that, in the vast majority of cases, enforcement of the anti-littering provisions in the EPHA is dependent on the direct observation of an enforcement officer, who witnesses the commission of the offence while he is performing his anti-littering rounds. As the DPP rightly pointed out, it would not be inconceivable that composition of such offences, in view of the straightforward nature of the offence itself, amounts to an admission of guilt. The offender having been caught red-handed would probably decide to pay the composition fine, if permitted, rather than to go to court. After all, an offence under s 18(1) of the EPHA is what one could consider to be a `strict liability` offence, where no blameworthy mental element need be shown. Hence, the prosecution would only have to show that the offender had littered and that he had done so voluntarily and not out of accident or automatism: see the recent decision of this court in 
 PP v Yong Heng Yew 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 566
 at pp 568-569.
In my view, undue weight was accorded by the magistrate to the point that the compounded offence was committed four years ago. Four years is by no means a long lapse of time. Four years on, the respondent has been caught committing exactly the same offence. Evidently, he has not seen the error of his ways. Despite having been permitted once to compound a similar offence, he has obstinately chosen to defy or ignore widespread calls for a heightened sense of graciousness and civic-consciousness in our society. I had no doubt in my mind that he could be properly termed a `recalcitrant offender` and that a corrective work order would be an appropriate form of punishment.
Apart from contending that the respondent was recalcitrant, the DPP went further to submit that throwing a cigarette butt into a drain could be considered a serious littering offence. According to the DPP, it would be relevant to consider where the cigarette butt was thrown. On his own admission, however, a cigarette butt was a small item which could be easily cleared or swept away. Although not strictly necessary for present purposes, I should state that I found no merit in this particular aspect of the DPP`s submission. Clear guidance as to what the minister meant by `serious` littering offences was given in the minister`s speech itself. He stated thus: 
 
A serious littering offence is one which would directly cause pollution or give rise to cleansing problems. Dropping or throwing out or leaving behind bags of refuse, styrofoam boxes, packets of food, old furniture, are some of the good examples that I can think of. What the Environment Ministry may consider as minor littering offences would be littering with cigarette butts, or car park coupon tabs and things like that.
 
 
 
Thus, the crucial consideration for determining what constitutes `serious` or `minor` littering appears to be the size of the littering problem. Littering which involves the likelihood of serious hygiene, sanitary or disposal problems is therefore apt to be considered `serious` littering. It must be beyond doubt that throwing a cigarette butt into a drain could not be considered `serious` littering. The minister himself stated in no uncertain terms that this would be an example of `minor` littering. Of course, where a cigarette butt is thrown may well have serious consequences, but these are not likely to be related to `direct pollution` or `cleansing problems`. For instance, the offender may choose to throw his unextinguished cigarette butt into a cannister of combustible material located in a public place, engendering foreseeably disastrous consequences. However, in such a case, it would be somewhat surprising if a charge of littering under s 18(1) of the EPHA (or, for that matter, a corrective work order) would be all that he could be liable for.
For the above reasons, I allowed the prosecution`s appeal. As a general rule, it may be said that the more callous or cavalier the offender in his act of littering, the more culpable he is. Together with factors such as the number of previous offences and the seriousness of the littering offence, this would be relevant in determining the length of time to which he will be ordered to perform a corrective work order.
I was of the view that a corrective work order for a duration of two hours would be appropriate in the respondent`s case. In the premises, I made the following pronouncement under the provisions of s 21A (5) of the EPHA: 
 
I am satisfied that it is expedient with a view to your reformation and the protection of the environment and environmental public health that you should be ordered to perform a corrective work order in relation to the cleaning of premises. You are to report to the supervision officer when directed and carry out the work at the specified premises within the next twelve months. The officer will tell you where and when to report, and the kind of work that you will have to do. You must inform him of any change of address.
 
 
 
If you breach the terms of the corrective work order or fail to perform the work satisfactorily, you can be fined up to $5,000 or imprisoned for up to two months, in addition to the corrective work which you have to perform.
 
 
 
The court can review this order upon your application or that of the Commissioner of Public Health.
 
 
 
I now sentence you to perform two hours of corrective work under a corrective work order.
 
 
 
The respondent had already paid the fine of $300 imposed by the court below. As the corrective work order was imposed in lieu of any other punishment, I ordered that the $300 be refunded to him.

: The first defendants applied to strike out the plaintiffs` claim for conversion against them on the grounds (a) that it was not supported by the plaintiffs` own evidence, and (b) that the claim was frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process. I allowed the application. The plaintiffs appealed. [The appeal was withdrawn - Ed.] I now give my reasons.
 Background 
 
 
 
The plaintiffs were the sole and exclusive licensees at the material time from the Television Broadcast International Limited of Hong Kong (`TVB`) to grant sub-licences, distribute and reproduce Mandarin and Cantonese video materials and programmes (`licensed programmes`) produced by TVB in Singapore.
In the plaintiffs` statement of claim, it was alleged that the first defendants had unlawfully and without the plaintiffs` consent submitted to the Board of Film Censors (`the Board`) video cassette tapes bearing `B` certificates for a change of ownership from the plaintiffs to the first defendants. Thus, the first defendants converted the video tapes and/or the materials recorded therein for their own use. The plaintiffs averred that the first defendants affixed `B` certificates in their name on the video tapes over or alongside the `B` certificates originally issued to the plaintiffs by the Board.
The first defendants were also alleged to have wrongfully, unlawfully and without the consent or knowledge from the plaintiffs, submitted to the Board video cassette tapes for a change of ownership of the `A` certificates. After obtaining `A` certificates in their name, the first defendants would affix them on the video tapes alongside or over the `B` certificates originally issued to the plaintiffs. With these `A` certificates on the tapes serving as the master copies, the first defendants apparently could apply for as many `B` certificates as they wanted for the video tapes produced from these `master` copies.
The plaintiffs` demanded delivery up by the first defendants of all the aforesaid tapes. As the first defendants refused to do so, the plaintiffs averred that they had converted or continued to convert the tapes and the material recorded therein for the first defendants` own use.
 Defence of first defendants 
 
 
 
The first defendants alleged that they had lawfully purchased the video tapes from the second defendants for valuable consideration. The plaintiffs did not have any proprietary interest in the physical video cassette tapes.
Counsel for the first defendants submitted that the plaintiffs` conversion claim was based on their alleged wrongful acts of dealing with the plaintiffs` goods inconsistent with their right as the owner.
 What is the subject matter of the conversion and who is the owner of the goods? 
 
 
 
It was not very clear to me whether the subject matter of the conversion was the physical video cassette tapes or the licensed programmes recorded on the tapes or the certificates obtained by the plaintiffs from the Board, which were affixed on the tapes.
 Conversion of the physical video tapes? 
 
 
 
From the evidence, it did not appear that the physical video tapes belonged to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs were merely the licensees of the programmes recorded on the tapes. Since the first defendants purchased the tapes from the second defendants, I did not think that any case could be made out that the first defendants had converted the physical goods of the plaintiffs in the form of the tapes themselves.
The first defendants had pleaded that they had no knowledge of the contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and second defendants restricting the sale of tapes recorded with the licensed programmes. The first defendants were not privy to that contract, where the plaintiffs had granted a sub-licence to the second defendants allowing them to distribute and rent the licensed programmes recorded on the physical video tapes belonging to the second defendants.
Being the purchasers for value without notice, the first defendants had title to the physical video tapes.
 Conversion of material recorded on the tapes? 
 
 
 
The pre-recorded programmes on the tapes are not real property or chattels but intellectual property. I accepted the submission of the counsel for the first defendants that there is no precedent for conversion based on intellectual property. The proprietary right over intellectual property is copyright but the plaintiffs had not alleged any infringement of copyright. Plaintiffs` counsel confirmed to me that the claim against the first defendants was based on conversion.
In any case, the plaintiffs were not the copyright owners of the programmes but were mere licensees. The copyright owners were TVB and only they have the locus standi to maintain an action for such infringement.
 Conversion of the certificates? 
 
 
 
Since conversion of the certificates was not pleaded, I need not consider this point. In any event, I did not think that the certificate issued by the Board conferred ownership either of the physical tape or the copyright of the material recorded on the tape to the person named in the certificate as the `owner`.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
Clearly, the plaintiffs` claim against the first defendants in conversion was misconceived. Accordingly, I struck out the plaintiffs` claim with costs to the first defendants.
It was not necessary for me to address the point raised by the first defendants that the plaintiffs had abused the process of court by commencing an action and obtaining an Anton Piller order against the first defendants solely to find out which of the plaintiffs` dealers had sold the tapes to the first defendants in breach of their dealers` sub-licence agreement.

J U D G M E N T
1. This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court acquitting the respondent, Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah ('the respondent'), of the charge of murder of one Fujii Isae ('the deceased') on 6 June 1994 in Room 910 of The Oriental Singapore and convicting him of the charge of robbery with hurt, an offence punishable under s 394 of the Penal Code. Against the acquittal of the respondent of the murder charge, the prosecution has now appealed.
2. The events that led to the killing of the deceased, the trial of the respondent before the High Court and the evidence adduced at the trial have been fully set out in the judgment of Karthigesu JA and Goh J, which I respectfully adopt. I shall therefore not rehearse them, save and except where they are essential for the purpose of my decision.
3. At the conclusion of the hearing below, the trial judge found as follows:
I have considered the evidence and the submissions of both counsel. I am satisfied that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that you caused the injuries to Fujii Isae. I am also satisfied that the injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
On the evidence adduced, these findings are undoubtedly correct and before us there is no issue on such findings. The only question is whether the fatal injuries sustained by the deceased were caused by the respondent intentionally or accidentally. On this issue the trial judge said:
There is also no doubt that some of the injuries to the deceased were inflicted by you wilfully.
However, I accept your evidence that some of the injuries were caused without intention when you lost your balance and stepped on the fallen Fujii Isae.
4. Subsequently in his grounds of decision the trial judge elaborated on this finding as follows:
40. In the circumstances, it remained for me to consider if I accept the accused's evidence that he stepped on the deceased accidentally. The learned DPP submitted that the evidence of the accused was replete with inconsistencies but referred only to three instances (at paragraph 109 of his submission) which, in my judgment, were minor and not material at all. I accept the evidence of the accused that he lost his balance and stepped on the deceased. In any event, I find that the evidence to be less than satisfactory and upon which it is not safe to convict on a charge of murder.
Finally he said: 46. I am doubtful that all the injuries were caused intentionally and I find that some of the fractures could have been caused by the accused accidentally. I, therefore, gave him the benefit of the doubt. .....
Injuries 5. The deceased sustained multiple external facial injuries which were mainly bruises on various parts of the face. The internal injuries which were caused and which resulted in her death, according to the autopsy report, were the following:
SKELETAL SYSTEM 
 1. comminuted fractures of the nasal bones at the base of the nose. 
 2. fracture across the attachment of the nasal cartilage septurn to the upper jaw. 
 3. Le Fort II fracture of right maxilla. 
 4. Le Fort III fracture of left maxilla. 
 5. fracture of mandible at left parasymphysis. 
 6. fracture of mandible at left subcondylar region. 
 7. fracture at junction of left frontal and zygomatic processes. < Fracture No.7 is a re-statement of fracture No.4 > 
A dental examination was carried out and revealed: 
 1. labial porcelain dislodged in upper central incisors. 
 2. dislodged crown of upper canine (left).
The autopsy report stated also that the face of the deceased was subjected to severe blunt force trauma that fractured the facial skeleton at the several places.
6. There is no dispute that all these injuries were caused by the respondent. But his defence was that some of the fractures were caused by him accidentally. I turn first to the evidence of the respondent as to how he caused or could have caused these injuries accidentally. His evidence, in so far as material, was this. After he and Abdul Rahman had entered the room, i.e. Room 910, he saw the deceased standing in front of him. Abdul Rahman shouted to him to punch the deceased quickly. So he punched the deceased and she fell. After she fell he stood with his legs striding over the lower part of her body. He then bent down and searched her handbag. As to what happened subsequently, it is best to set out his evidence verbatim:
A I searched her handbag. While searching her handbag, I used one of my hands to cover her mouth. I took a brown pouch and a grey bag from that handbag. ... After that, I stood up. After I had taken the two items from her handbag, I straightened my body and wanted to leave the scene. At that time, I was in a state of panic. While trying to leave, Sir, I lost my balance and my body was turned to one side. When I lost my balance, my body went forward and accidentally stepped on her face.
His Honour: When I lost my balance--- Witness: My body went forward and I accidentally stepped on her face. A To break my fall, Sir, I used both my hands to hold against the wall.
His further evidence as elicited by his counsel in the examination- in-chief was as follows:
Q Now, you say you tried to break your fall; you used the wall. But, do you know whether your foot landed on the Japanese female's face first or whether you managed to break your fall by holding on to the wall? A I think both happened at the same time, Sir. Q So, you can't say? A I can't say which came first. Q When your foot landed on the deceased's face, did it land hard or was it a soft landing? A Sir, bearing in mind my weight at that time, I think it was a hard one. Q Did you have any intention of stepping on the face of the lady? A No, Sir, I did not have the intention.
There was hardly any material cross-examination on this part of the evidence.
7. It was urged on us by the prosecution that as the respondent has raised the defence that he inflicted the fatal injuries on the deceased accidentally the burden is on him to establish it on a balance of probabilities, and reliance was placed on s 108 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 ed). I respectfully agree entirely with the opinion of Karthigesu JA and Goh J that s 108 has no application and I also reject this argument. Notwithstanding this defence raised by the respondent, the burden remains with the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent inflicted intentionally those fatal injuries on the deceased.
8. It is necessary to test the evidence of the respondent against the whole of the evidence adduced before the trial judge.
9. From the nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the deceased the irresistible inference is that the respondent had punched the deceased more than once. There are two questions which need to be addressed: first, whether the internal fractures which were the fatal injuries were caused by the respondent punching her and/or the respondent stepping on her, and secondly, if it is the latter, whether the injuries could have been caused by an accidental step in the manner as alleged by the respondent. On these questions, the forensic evidence adduced played an important role, to which I now turn.
Forensic evidence 
 10. Dr Paul Chui, the forensic pathologist from the Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine, performed an autopsy on the deceased and gave evidence. Unavoidably I have to refer to his evidence in some detail and, where necessary, the material parts of his evidence verbatim.
11. Dr Chui's evidence was that the significant injuries were located on the head and that they were above the internal fractures and were related to the internal fractures. The facial injuries reflected a pattern of rows, roughly parallel rows longitudinally over the face: the forehead, the eyes and the chin. The pattern on the upper part could be matched with that on the lower part of the face. He was of the opinion that the pattern of the fractures could match with the pattern of the surface injuries. The impact across the upper face would have cracked the nasal fractures, i.e. injuries Nos. 1, 3 and 4 and possibly 2. The injuries across the lower face could match with the fractures on the left side of the jaw in two places, i.e. injuries Nos. 5 and 6 and possibly 2. Dr Chui said that the jaw fractures, i.e. injuries Nos. 5 and 6, could not have been caused by a fist if they were correlated with the surface injuries. His answer was the same in relation to the maxillary injuries, i.e. injuries Nos. 3 and 4. He opined that the fractures to the nose could be caused by a blow from the fist, but given the pattern of the fractures of the nasal bones, a severe or moderately severe degree of force would have been applied directly head on to the nose.
12. Thus the opinion of Dr Chui was that injuries Nos. 3 to 6 were not caused by a blow or blows from the fist because of the pattern on the facial injuries which were related to the internal fractures. On the question whether there were more than one impact on the face by the object - whatever that object might be - that caused the fractures, Dr Chui's opinion was that because the pattern of the rows on the upper face could match with that on the lower face, the object that hit the face hit it twice at least. He said:
Witness: So, what it means, that it's the same object had crossed the face twice in roughly a similar direction. The lower face pattern is consistent with the upper face injury. There is a very short laceration, a cut across the face across the left cheek, and that actually falls into place with the edge of the squarish bruise if you replicate it downwards. 
 His Honour: The squarish bruise ends just below the eyebrow, is that right? 
 Witness: Yes, just above the eyebrows. 
 His Honour: Just above the eyebrows. 
 Witness: Just above the eyebrows. So, if I move that bruise downwards from here down here, you see that the edge actually matches quite well to the...this laceration cut on the face actually matches quite well to a black ....
Later he said:
Witness: There is a consistency in the arrangement of the rows. That cut on the face is consistent, if I match the row, is consistent with an edge of a bruise, the shape of the bruise, on one edge of it, the bruise. 
 His Honour: Yes. 
 Witness: It suggests to me that the object that impacted on her face crossed the face at least twice, impacted at least twice. 
 His Honour: Yes. Just a minute. What you mean is that whatever hit the deceased struck her twice at least? 
 Witness: It was a patterned object; the object has a pattern. The surface that hit her has a pattern, okay, and that object hit her twice at least. 
 His Honour: When you say has a pattern , are you saying that it's the same object that hit the face at least twice? Witness: It's an object with the same pattern, Sir. 
 His Honour: Either the same object or a similar object with the same pattern? 
 Witness: Yes, Sir.
13. The doctor was then questioned whether in his experience all the fractures could be caused by one blow, and his reply was as follows:
A Sir, it depends on the width of the object. Actually, the wider the object, I mean if the steel girdle hits the face and it is that wide, it would have caused fairly...it can come from both sets at the same time. ....... 
 Witness: If the object had a pattern that had both upper and lower set together, then it could just impact like that; cause a block front. 
 His Honour: So, earlier on when you say that it appears to you that the object crossed the face at least twice, it is subject to the qualification that there could be an object which is wide enough and with a similar pattern throughout? 
 Witness: Sir, I think the questioning was whether both sets of fractures could have been caused simultaneously by one impact. What I was trying to say was that, yes, possibly, provided the object is so big and it has this double pattern. I mean these two sets of patterns side by side and then the whole thing just comes across the face--- 
 His Honour: Yes. 
 Witness: ---you imprint it once. So, that's on the assumption, if I say two sets, I say two sets because it appeared two discrete bands, one band above and one band below, there appeared to be a band across the lower nose here that is fairly free of bruising, okay. 
 His Honour: Yes. 
 Witness: That suggests two discrete bands rather than one.
14. I next turn to the question as to the extent of force that was required to cause the fractures. Dr Chui's evidence was this:
Witness: Most fist blows would crack the nose sideways and much less force would be required. ........ 
 Q What do you mean by required ? 
 A That means that's the usual sort of blow to the nose, it could break your nose but most of the breakages are on the side. This one shattering it is a front on blow right head on sort of direction. 
 Q Would you associate the force required to cause these injuries - the maxillar injuries - with a blow from the fist? 
 A Sir, typically I would see this type of fractures in road traffic accidents and fall from heights. ....... 
 Q Would you say therefore that the force required would be much greater than what is normally associated with a blow from the fist, very much greater than that? 
 A I would be in agreement.
Of the maxillary fractures, he said that the Le Fort III was the most serious type of maxillary injuries in terms of classification of severity. He said:
A Sorry, I think let me come back to the maxillary fractures which I have not covered. So the maxillary fractures, Le Fort III, is the most serious type of maxillary injuries in terms of classification of severity. ...... 
 Witness Serious type, serious class if you classify maxillary fractures in terms of severity. So one is the least, two is the greater, three is the max. Again you need severe force in causing a Le Fort III fracture.
15. The prosecution then posed to him the following scenario: the assailant of the deceased searched the deceased and accidentally lost his balance and fell, and in so doing he put his hands to the wall and his foot accidentally stepped on the face of the deceased. The doctor was then asked whether there would be sufficient force in the impact to cause the maxillary injuries. His answer was as follows:
A Sir, I've already mentioned that there would have been at least two blows, two impacts to the face. Number two, I would not expect the amount of force to be--- ....... 
 Witness: I would not expect the amount of force delivered by one accidental stepping to result in this degree of severity of fractures. 
 His Honour: Yes. 
 Witness: Secondly, if we go back to the scene and look at the splatter pattern on the wall- --
He then drew attention to pattern of blood splattered on the wall just above the head of the deceased. His opinion was that the splattered pattern on the wall did not suggest a low impact on the face or body and that the injuries were consistent with a high impact injury.
16. In cross-examination, Dr Chui said that of the 6 injuries the most severe injuries were the Le Fort II fracture of the right maxilla and Le Fort III fracture of the left maxilla. He was then questioned on the possibility of these injuries having been caused at the same time by the same blunt object in a single blow. Here again, unavoidably, it is best to set out his evidence verbatim:
Q Now, these two injuries, could they have been caused at the same time by the same blunt object? 
 His Honour: By the same impact? 
 Mr Anandan:Yes, the same impact, Sir. 
 A The external injuries as well as the location of the fractures suggest a single impact across that region. 
 His Honour: The answer is Yes ? 
 Witness: Yes 
 Q Now, according to your experience, these injuries, the skeletal injuries that are caused, could they be caused by one blow? ........ 
 A Yes. 
 Q It could be? 
 A You have not defined the object. I will take your term object generically. I'd say yes, can.
He was later questioned on the injuries being caused by a shoe:
Q If a person of the Accused's size and build landed on the deceased wearing shoes, heavy shoes for that matter, and one of his legs landed on the face of the deceased, could any of these injuries be caused? 
 A Could you elaborate on how the shoe was aligned to the face? 
 Q He does not know how the shoe was aligned. He was wearing shoes and his foot landed on the face of the deceased, on that basis. He lost his balance and he landed on the face, his foot landed on the face of the deceased. Could any of these injuries be caused by that? 
 A In my opinion it is unlikely. 
 Q Why? 
 A I had asked counsel regarding the alignment of the shoe to the face. If the shoe had been perpendicular to the long axis of the face, then that would have required two different impacts and so-called accidental stepping would be a low impact type of injuries. It would not be consistent with the spatter high up on the wall because if you lose your balance, you step down, you won't be flicking the blood back up. So, you have got two different impacts. 
 Q Doctor, if the whole body, the weight of the body is on the foot that landed on the deceased's face, could these injuries be caused? 
 A One has to take into account the surface injuries as well as the scene that was present at that time. It would not be consistent in my opinion with that.
17. On further questioning by the trial judge whether the weight of a 76kg person if landed on the deceased through impact of a foot would have sufficient force to break any of the bones in the face, the doctor's reply was as follows:
Witness: It is possible to break the nasal bones. However, I would not expect the force to cause this degree of damage.
 His Honour: It would break the nasal bones but? 
 Witness: I would not expect this severity of damage.
18. On re-examination, Dr Chui was asked again on the impact of a shoe on the face. His verbatim evidence was as follows:
Q Yes, he < counsel for the defence > asked you whether it could come from a shoe and you said it was possible . Let us for the time being, assume that they came from a shoe. How many times had the shoe to be applied to the face of the deceased in order to cause the patterns as shown by the external injuries? 
 His Honour: The six injuries? 
 DPP(Mr Tseng): The external injuries. 
 A In my opinion, at least two. 
 Q You would say that there would be a minimum of two times? 
 A Yes, I think at least. 
 Q Would both these applications have to be of substantial force? 
 A They would have to be of the degree of force that I mentioned yesterday, required to cause those fractures.
19. To my mind Dr Chui was of the clear opinion that by reason of the pattern of rows on the face of the deceased whatever the object that was that struck her struck her at least twice. In my judgment, his opinion was not in any way qualified by his admission that it was possible that the injuries could be caused by a single blow provided that that object had a wide surface. Secondly, in view of the facial injuries which matched with the internal fractures, a blow from the fist could not have caused the fractures except, perhaps, the fracture on the nose if it was a direct frontal attack with great force. Thirdly, the force required for the maxillary injuries would be much greater than that associated with a blow from the fist; he would usually see these types of cases in road traffic accidents and fall from heights. Injury No.4, Le Fort III, was the most serious type of maxillary injuries and severe force would have been used to cause that fracture. Fourthly, the splatter of blood on the wall did not suggest a low impact on the face and that the injuries were consistent with a high impact injury.
20. I now come to the trial judge's review of Dr Chui's evidence. The trial judge noted Dr Chui's opinion that the fractures were caused by two distinct impacts and that whatever object that was used it crossed 'the face twice in roughly similar direction'. However, he found that Dr Chui could not specify what the object might be and that the doctor conceded that the pattern of injury marks on the face could have come from a shoe. The trial judge took into account a sketch of the shoes that the respondent wore on that day, i.e. 6 June 1994. The sketch, marked D6, consisted of a drawing of a shoe and the sole of the shoe and was drawn by the respondent at the trial. The trial judge having compared the ridge pattern of the sole of that shoe and the photographs of the deceased's face came to the view that the pattern row on the deceased's face could reasonably have been caused by a single impact of the respondent's shoe made longitudinally. He said:
33. I reviewed D6 which was a sketch by the accused of the shoe that he wore on 6 June 1994 showing the ridged pattern on the sole, and compared it with photographs P35, P36 and P37. It appears to me that the pattern of rows on the deceased's face could reasonable be caused by a single impact of the deceased's shoe made longitudinally. The prosecution assumed that the shoe sideways because of Dr Chui's comment that there could be two impacts. Comparing D6 and the photographs it seems to me that the pattern on the forehead matched the ridges on the top of the sole. The pattern on the chin matched the pattern on the heel. The band across the nose which, according to Dr Chui was relatively free of injury, appears to be the groove in the sole between the top of the sole and the heel. It is the evidence of this band which led the prosecution to conclude that the object impacted on the deceased's face twice. This injury-free band seems to be incongruent to Dr Chui's evidence that, The impact across the upper face would have resulted in fractures 1, 3, 4 and possibly 2. The injuries across the lower face can be matched to the fracture of jaw in two places namely 5, 6 and possibly 2 (my emphasis). Fracture 2 appears above the injury-free band.
21. I have two observations. First, D6 was a sketch of the shoes which the respondent said he wore at the time of the robbery, and that took place about two years ago. The sketch was drawn by the respondent in the course of his trial. It can hardly be accepted as an accurate drawing or an authentic representation of the sole of the shoes he wore that day. Secondly, looking at the pattern of the sole as shown in D6 (assuming that D6 can be accepted as authentic) I am not convinced or persuaded that patterns on the sole matched the pattern of rows as shown on the photographs. Assuming that they matched, as the trial judge said they did, one accidental step on the face of the deceased cannot account for the Le Fort II fracture of the right maxilla, the Le Fort III fracture of the left maxilla, the two fractures of the mandible on the left and the big squarish bruise on the forehead just above the left eye of the deceased which according to Dr Chui could not be caused by a fist. To cause these fractures there must have been more than one impact of the shoe on the face.
22. The trial judge considered it important that Dr Chui could not say what object it was that caused the injuries to the deceased and was troubled by the fact that it was never suggested to Dr Chui that the object was a shoe with the sole patterned with the ridges as shown in D6 and further the doctor was not asked to give his opinion whether it would be reasonably possible that a shoe with a sole of that design could cause the injuries by a single impact made longitudinally.
23. With respect, it does not matter what the object was that was used to inflict injuries on the deceased - whether it was a shoe or other object. The injuries were caused by the respondent whether he used a shoe or other object. In any event, the respondent admitted he stepped on the deceased's face, albeit accidentally; so the object was a shoe and the question, so far as Dr Chui was concerned, was whether one accidental step with the shoe would be likely to cause those multiple fractures sustained by the deceased. Dr Chui's testimony was that in his opinion there would be at least two steps.
24. The trial judge also said:
38. Dr Chui thought that the injury could not be caused accidentally because the splatter of blood on the wall was quite high. He said that if one accidentally stepped on a puddle one would expect a splatter of low height. With due respect, this was premised on a low impact accidental stepping. I see no reason why a high impact accidental stepping would not cause the splatter found on the wall. Dr Chui was not asked whether a heavy landing, albeit by accident, could create a similar splatter. Dr Chui's evidence was clearly premised on a low impact stepping.
25. I think it is important to consider this evidence of Dr Chui in its proper context. Dr Chui was specifically referred to the following scenario: the assailant of the deceased in searching the deceased lost his balance and in so doing put his hands on the wall to support himself and accidentally stepped on the deceased's face. He was asked whether such a step would have sufficient force to cause the maxillary injuries. His answers were two-fold: first there would have been at least two blows or impacts on the face, and secondly, he would not expect the amount of force delivered by an accidental step to result in the degree of severity of fractures. Then, further he referred to the scene and pointed to the pattern of blood splattered on the walls and said that the splatters were quite high up on the walls and the splatter marks all centred towards the face. He concluded that the injuries were 'consistent with that of a high impact injury'.
26. The trial judge found that Dr Chui was conversant with facial trauma caused in road accidents and was familiar with the degree of force capable of causing such fractures in those circumstances. He was apprehensive that Dr Chui, who had never come across 'a shod foot injury' causing such fractures, such as the present case, might not be so familiar with the minimum force required to cause such fractures. I accept that this was the first case of a 'shod foot injury' of Dr Chui as he admitted. However, in referring to the injuries caused in road traffic accidents, Dr Chui was associating the force required for the Le Fort II and Le Fort III fractures here with that caused to similar type of injuries in a road traffic accident. In other words, severe force was required to cause these injuries.
27. The trial judge having reviewed and considered Dr Chui's evidence opined:
I think that the prosecution has not proven beyond reasonable doubt that the one impact blow must be excluded, and more specifically, whether the imprint by a shoe as described in D6 can be ruled out. It is entirely possible that the accused could have intended a single kick to the face, but considering the evidence, I cannot be sure. In any event it is the prosecution's case that the accused struck twice with his foot.
Later the trial judge said:
The deceased was a mere 1.5m tall woman weighing 51kg. The accused stands at 1.8m and weighed 76kg. I accept that even in an accident, the full weight of the accused landing on the fallen deceased might have broken some bones.
28. True it is that there is that possibility referred to by the trial judge. But, on the basis of the forensic evidence, is such a possibility sufficient in the circumstances to create or give rise to a doubt in the prosecution's case that an accidental step of the respondent as alleged, assuming it did happen, could not have caused the Le Fort II and Le Fort III fractures? I think not. In my judgment, the Le Fort II and Le Fort III injuries - which were the most serious fractures - could not have been caused by the respondent accidentally stepping on the face of the deceased in the manner as alleged, assuming that he did accidentally stepped on her once.
29. In my opinion, at any rate, there was sufficient evidence to show that the respondent did not accidentally fall and step on the deceased in the manner as he alleged. I now turn to this evidence.
Respondent's previous statements 
 30. The respondent made two previous statements to the effect that he 'stepped' on the deceased. To see these statements in their proper perspective, it is necessary to set out the chronology of events leading to the making of these statements. The respondent was arrested on 25 January 1996 in connection with some other offence and through his fingerprints it was found that he was one of the persons who were involved in the killing of the deceased on 6 June 1994. On 28 January 1996 at about 7.55 pm Insp Richard Lim Beng Gee recorded a statement from the respondent under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code ('CPC'). In that statement he gave a detailed account of how he punched and robbed the deceased at the hotel room and what he did with the loot. No mention was made by him as to whether he stepped on the deceased while the latter was lying on the floor.
31. The next occasion when he made a statement was on the following day. That was a statement recorded under s 122(6) of the CPC. This was given in answer to the charge preferred against him. Here again, no mention was made by him that he stepped on the deceased.
32. On 30 January 1996, he made the following statement in English to Insp Lim. He said:
Here I wish to correct my previous statement that after I had punched her she fell. I then stamped the face of the Japanese woman with my right foot once. After I had stamped the face of the woman, I noticed she was having difficulty in breathing. She did not scream.
This statement must have been elicited by Insp Lim in his interrogation of the respondent. According to Insp Lim, he wrote this statement in his investigation diary and read it to the respondent and the latter signed it. Insp Lim also asked him to demonstrate how he 'stamped' on the face of the deceased and he demonstrated it by lifting his right foot and stamping it on the floor. This evidence of Insp Lim was corroborated by D/Sgt Choy Ah Kiong who was present when the respondent made the statement.
33. The next occasion when the respondent made a statement to the investigating officer was 1 February 1996 at about 11.30 am when he was brought to Room 910 at The Oriental Singapore. There he was asked to reconstruct the events which took place on that day and the respondent made the following statement in Malay which was interpreted by Ms Masdiana Ramli, the Malay interpreter, and his statement was this:
As I was leaving, I stamped my right foot on the face of the woman whom I attacked earlier.
The respondent was said to have demonstrated his stamping action. Ms Masdiana Ramli, in her testimony, explained that the word the respondent used was 'pijak' which means 'step' in Malay. However, because the respondent had demonstrated the action of stamping, she interpreted the word in English as 'stamp'.
34. About three weeks later, on 23 February 1996 at about 11.35 am, Insp Lim recorded a further statement from the respondent when he was at Tanah Merah Prison. He spoke in Malay and his statement was interpreted by Ms Masdiana Ramli. In para 22 of his statement, he said:
22. After my previous statement consisting of 8 pages was interpreted back to me in Malay by the interpreter, I wish to correct certain parts of it in paragraphs Nos. 9 and 10. In paragraph 9 I had said that when the said female Japanese collapsed onto the floor after I had punched her, I bend down and slapped her cheek once. This is not true. I now remember what actually happened was when the said female Japanese collapsed, I straight away bend down and searched her belonging. While searching her, I lost my balance and I had to support myself by pressing one hand against the wall and in so doing, I accidentally stepped on the said female Japanese's face once. I remember I had used my left hand to press against the wall. After I had accidentally stepped on the face of the said female Japanese along the small passage way as one enters the room, I walked into the room proper.
That was the first time the respondent said that he accidentally stepped on the face of the deceased, which was consistent with his defence at the trial.
35. Admittedly the statement recorded on 30 January 1996 was not satisfactory in the sense that no interpreter was around and the respondent who is not fully conversant in English, spoke to the inspector in English. He said that on that occasion he used the word 'step'. He might well have intended to use the word 'step' instead of 'stamp'. At any rate, on the basis of what he said he admitted that he 'stepped' on the deceased; but he did not say that he stepped on her accidentally. Indeed, in the context in which the statement was made, the meaning clearly was that he stepped on the deceased intentionally.
36. As for the statement he was said to have made in Room 910 at The Oriental Singapore, he denied that he made such statement and that he gave the demonstration as alleged. The trial judge proceeded on the basis that the respondent did make such a statement but that the word he said was 'pijak' meaning 'step' and not 'henyak' meaning 'stamp'. I think that the respondent did make the statement and I accept that he used the word 'pijak' meaning 'step'. I also think that he did give a demonstration of how he 'stepped' on the face of the deceased, otherwise there was no cause for Ms Masdiana Ramli translating 'pijak' as 'stamp'. In the context in which the statement was made, the respondent meant that he 'stepped' on the deceased intentionally.
37. In my view, whether the respondent used the word 'step' or 'stamp' is immaterial. He admitted that he 'stepped' on the face of the deceased. What is material is whether he 'stepped' on the face of the deceased intentionally or he did it accidentally. Now, on both occasions, i.e. 30 January and 1 February, he said that he 'stepped' on the deceased. But he did not say he stepped on her accidentally. That is extremely odd. Since he remembered that he 'stepped' on the deceased he could not possibly have forgotten the reason for 'stepping' on her. If his 'stepping' on the deceased was accidental, it would have occurred to him there and then, and he would have said so on both occasions. But he did not.
Position of the body 38. There is a vital piece of evidence in relation to the defence the respondent has raised, and that is the position of the deceased's body. The deceased was found lying facing upwards with her head pointing towards the corner of the room. The corner is formed by a wall on her right, which is the side wall of a cupboard, and a wall on her left, which is the wall of the room. Her head was almost touching the corner. Some blood stains were found near her head on both walls, beside and above her head, and above the bloodstains, on her left, fairly high up, were two smudged bloodstains. It was the evidence of Dr Chui that the deceased was unconscious and did not move after she had been attacked.
39. The evidence of the respondent was that after he punched the deceased, she fell and lay on the floor. He then stood with legs 'striding over the lower part of her body'. He then stooped down to search her handbag. Now, assuming that whilst getting up he lost his balance and fell forward (as he said he did), it seems to me that the natural thing for him to do would be to put his foot forward and step on the upper body of the deceased, say the chest or neck, rather than the face, because the head was far in the corner formed by the two walls. It would involve some unnatural bodily movement for him to have thrust so much forward as to land his foot squarely on her face in the corner. The inference, which I draw, is that the respondent did not fall and step on the deceased in the manner as he alleged, and he could not have done so.
40. I am reinforced in my view by the following evidence of Dr Chui given in the re-examination:
A Sir, I believe it's a very natural response that if you accidentally fall over, you would try and balance yourself or grope for some support or lean against any object so that you don't fall all the way. So if the person responds by trying to prevent himself from falling, then the walls would take some of the force, the impact off. The awkward position of the head would tend to exclude a situation whereby you sort of accidentally step and walk over because of the corner wall. The walls are perpendicular to each other. 
 His Honour: Awkward position of the head would? 
 Witness: At the corner would tend to exclude a sort of accidental step-on and walk across, a cross-over to the other side--- injury, that sort of scenario.
41. Like Karthigesu JA and Goh J, I find it inconceivable that if the respondent did what he said he did to break his fall he would have thrust forward into a corner. I also agree with the criticism of Karthigesu JA and Goh J that the prosecution had failed to cross-examine the respondent on this aspect of his evidence. Clearly the prosecution could, by adroitly questioning the respondent, have demonstrated to the trial judge how highly improbable, if not impossible, it was for the respondent to have thrust forward and stepped on the deceased's face, thus showing that his evidence could not possibly be true. Nonetheless, notwithstanding the absence of the cross-examination, the respondent's evidence of how he stepped on the deceased's face was to my mind quite incredible.
42. Assuming that he did step on her face, as he said he did, he would have lessened the impact of his foot on her face by his two hands which were placed against the wall to break his fall. In this connection, the evidence of Dr Chui is again of some assistance. He said that if someone lost his balance and accidentally stepped on the deceased, he would not expect the amount of force delivered by such accidental step to result in the degree of severity of the fractures.
Conclusion 
 43. On the evidence adduced, it has been established beyond reasonable doubt, and the trial judge has so found, first, that the deceased sustained serious injuries and these injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause and did cause her death, and second, that it was the respondent who inflicted these injuries. The respondent admitted that he punched the deceased and following that she fell. The respondent also admitted that he stepped on the deceased but he said he stepped on her accidentally. On this point, there were clear admissions by him twice that he stepped on her intentionally. Further, the position of the deceased gave rise to a strong inference that the respondent did not fall and step on her in the manner as he alleged, and he could not have done so. Lastly, the forensic evidence showed that the fatal injuries could not have been caused by a single accidental step in the manner as alleged by the respondent. On the totality of the evidence, the finding of the trial judge that the respondent accidentally stepped on the deceased and caused some of the injuries was, with respect, against the weight of evidence. With great respect to the trial judge, this finding on the evidence was plainly wrong and unsupportable. In my judgment, the prosecution has proved the charge of murder of the deceased beyond reasonable doubt. I would allow the appeal and convict the respondent.

                   The accused was
charged with sexual assault.  Two weeks before the incident, the complainant
and the accused had dated for the first time.  The accused testified that
later, at her apartment, they became quite intimate, fondling one another's
private parts and talking of sex and birth control, and that she masturbated
him to ejaculation.  She maintains that they only kissed and talked of birth
control and about the fact that, as a born again Christian, she did not believe
in premarital sex.  On the day of the incident, the accused called the
complainant early in the morning and she agreed that he could come over.  He
arrived shortly thereafter and she greeted him at the door with a kiss on the
cheek, wearing only her bathrobe.  The complainant claims that, a few minutes
later, he drew her to him and pushed her onto the bed.  She resisted actively
but he was stronger.  Feeling his weight atop her, she had a flashback to a
previous traumatic experience and went into ""shock"".  The next thing
she remembered, he was pulling his penis out of her and ejaculating on her
stomach.  By contrast, the accused testified that she actively participated in
the sexual activity and, when things began to get ""hot"", he
prematurely ejaculated on her stomach.  No intercourse took place.  A medical
report from the examination of the complainant indicated the presence of
redness on the inner labia which could be consistent with either consensual or
non‑consensual intercourse.  At trial, the accused's defence was that the
complainant consented to the sexual activity or, in the alternative, that he
had an honest but mistaken belief that she was consenting.  The trial judge
refused to put the mistaken belief defence to the jury, finding there to be no
air of reality to it, and concluding that the issue was simply one of
""consent or no consent"".  The accused  was convicted.  On appeal, the
majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and ordered a new
trial, holding that the trial judge erred in not putting the mistaken belief defence
to the jury.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed and the conviction restored.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Gonthier, Cory and McLachlin JJ.:  Subject to the following reservation,
L'Heureux‑Dubé J.'s reasons were agreed with.  No comment should be
made on the interaction of consent and mistake of fact in a sexual assault
situation since it is not necessary to deal with these matters in deciding this
appeal.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.:  Before
any defence can be left with a jury, it must have an ""air of
reality"".  The ""air of reality"" test is a legal threshold, not a
factual one. The trial judge must determine if the evidence put forward is such
that, if believed, a reasonable jury properly charged could have acquitted.  He
is not concerned with the weight of evidence or with assessments of
credibility.

 

                   In sexual assault
cases, where the accused asserts that the complainant actually consented, it is
artificial to inquire further into whether he also expressed a belief that she
was consenting.  The absence or presence of an actual statement indicating a
belief in consent is of no consequence in all but the most unusual of cases. 
Presuming that the accused is de facto asserting such a belief, the more
fundamental question is whether that belief is an honest one, capable of
supporting the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.

 

                   Essentially, for
there to be an ""air of reality"" to the defence of honest but mistaken
belief in consent, the totality of the evidence for the accused must be
reasonably and realistically capable of supporting that defence.  Although
there is not, strictly speaking, a requirement that the evidence be
corroborated, that evidence must amount to something more than a bare
assertion.  There must be some support for it in the circumstances.  The
presence of ""independent"" evidence supporting the accused's testimony
will only have the effect of improving the chances of the defence.  The judge's
role is limited to ascertaining whether the accused has discharged the evidentiary
burden imposed by s. 265(4)  of the Criminal Code .

 

                   What is relevant to
a possible defence of honest but mistaken belief is the account of the events
that took place at the time of the sexual assault, as well as any additional
relevant and admissible information explaining why the accused might have
honestly interpreted those events at that time to be consistent with consent. 
In certain cases, evidence of prior sexual activity between the two parties may
be relevant in this respect.  An honest belief that the complainant would
consent is, by itself, not a defence to sexual assault where the accused is
aware of, or wilfully blind or reckless as to, lack of consent at the time of
the sexual activity.  Only where an accused entertains an honest belief that the
complainant actually does consent does this mistake render the sexual assault
non‑culpable.  When the complainant and the accused give similar versions
of the facts, and the only material contradiction is in their interpretation of
what happened, then the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent should
generally be put to the jury, except in cases where the accused's conduct
demonstrates recklessness or wilful blindness to the absence of consent.  When
the complainant's and the accused's versions conflict materially or are
diametrically opposed on this point, then the defence can be left with the jury
if it is realistically possible for a properly instructed jury, acting
judiciously, to splice some of each person's evidence with respect to the encounter,
and settle upon a reasonably coherent set of facts, supported by the evidence,
that is capable of sustaining the defence of mistaken belief in consent.  If
the versions cannot realistically be spliced in such a manner, then the issue
really is purely one of credibility ‑‑ of consent or no consent ‑‑
and the defence should not be put to the jury.

 

                   There is no air of
reality to a particular defence, and therefore no need to put it to the jury,
where: (1) the totality of the evidence for the accused is incapable of
amounting to the defence being sought; or (2) the totality of the evidence
for the accused is clearly logically inconsistent with the totality of evidence
which is not materially in dispute.  These standards should be viewed
realistically, and not evaluated according to purely speculative or
hypothetical extremes.  What is truly important to the ""air of
reality"" test in respect of a particular defence is that the evidence said
to provide some basis for the defence must actually relate to, and support,
that particular defence.  Evidence going to an ancillary issue or failing to
address a clear and undisputed logical inconsistency in an accused's claim to
the honest mistake defence will not, itself, be sufficient to lend that defence
an air of reality.

 

                   The actus reus
of sexual assault requires that the Crown demonstrate a touching of a sexual
nature, combined with a lack of actual consent to that touching, while the mens
rea is established by showing that the accused intended to touch the
complainant in a manner that is sexual, and knew of, or was reckless or
wilfully blind to, the fact that the complainant was not consenting to that
touching.  However, in reinforcing the view that sexual activity is consensual
in the absence of communicated non‑consent, the current common law
approach to the mens rea of sexual assault may perpetuate social
stereotypes that have historically victimized women and undermined their equal
right to bodily integrity and human dignity.  The primary concern animating and
underlying the present offence of sexual assault is the belief that women have
an inherent right to exercise full control over their own bodies, and to engage
only in sexual activity that they wish to engage in.  The criminal law must be
responsive to women's realities, rather than a vehicle for the perpetuation of
historic repression and disadvantage.  The common law governing the mens rea
of sexual assault should be approached having regard to s. 15  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and it should be accepted that the mens
rea for sexual assault is also established by showing that the accused was
aware of, or reckless or wilfully blind to, the fact that consent was not
communicated.  As a practical matter, therefore, the principal considerations
that are relevant to this defence are (1) the complainant's actual
communicative behaviour, and (2) the totality of the admissible and
relevant evidence explaining how the accused perceived that behaviour to
communicate consent.  Everything else is ancillary.  Although consent may exist
in the mind of the woman without being communicated in any form, it cannot be
accepted by a reasonable finder of fact as having been honestly perceived by
the accused without first identifying the behaviour that led the accused
ostensibly to believe that the complainant was consenting.  If the accused is
unable to point to evidence tending to show that the complainant's consent was
communicated, then he risks a jury concluding that he was aware of, or reckless
or wilfully blind to, the complainant's absence of consent.

 

                   The trial judge was
correct in not putting the defence of mistake of fact to the jury.  There was
nothing in the totality of this evidence, coming from either the complainant or
the accused, to lend any air of reality to the possibility that the accused may
have held a mistaken belief as to her consent.  Nor would it have been possible
for a reasonable jury to splice together some of her evidence and some of his
with respect to the encounter, and to settle upon a reasonably coherent set of
facts that could support the defence of mistaken belief in consent.  The
dissimilarities between the alleged assault and the sexual activities that took
place in the encounter two weeks earlier can only lead to the conclusion that
the evidence of that encounter was neither relevant to, nor capable of
supporting, an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant
was consenting at the time of the assault.  The factors listed by the Court of
Appeal as lending an air of reality to that defence were all only capable, if
anything, of supporting a belief on the part of the accused that the
complainant would consent, not a belief that she did in fact consent.  None of
the factors relate in any realistic way to the events that actually took place
at the time of the alleged sexual assault.

 

                   Per Sopinka J.:  While many of
L'Heureux-Dubé J.'s comments with respect to the defence of honest but mistaken
belief in consent were agreed with, it is unnecessary and undesirable to
attempt to define exhaustively the constituents of the defence in this case. 
It is a simpler task to delimit the absence of an air of reality than to define
in law its constituent components.  In this appeal, the appropriate question is
whether there was some evidence that the accused honestly believed that the
complainant consented to intercourse.  The complainant's evidence was of no
assistance to the accused as he testified that no intercourse took place.  This
is inconsistent with a belief in consent to intercourse.

 

                   Per Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:
The trial judge did not err in withholding from the jury the defence of honest
but mistaken belief in consent because he was entitled to conclude that there
was, in all the circumstances of the case, no air of reality to the defence. 
In effect, the accused denied that any intercourse occurred but, alternately,
argues that if it did occur, he thought there was consent.  In these circumstances,
it makes no sense to apply the air of reality defence to such an inconsistent
position.  As well, the trial judge committed no error in ruling that evidence
of previous sexual activity was inadmissible.

1                 Lamer
C.J. -- I have read the reasons for judgment written by my colleague
Justice L'Heureux‑Dubé and, for the reasons given by her, I agree that
the Crown's appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.  I would
like, however, to express one reservation.

 

2                 My reservation concerns the
""Mistake of Fact and Consent"" section of the analysis by L'Heureux‑Dubé J.,
which deals with the interaction of consent and mistake of fact in a sexual
assault situation.  I prefer to make no comment on this subject since it is not
necessary to deal with these matters in deciding this appeal.  As this Court
did not have the benefit of any argument on the aspects discussed by my
colleague in this section, I would prefer to reserve these matters for another
time.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

3                 L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- The respondent was charged with sexual assault as a result of
events that took place at the complainant's home early in the morning of
November 25, 1991.  At trial, his defence was that the complainant consented to
the sexual activities engaged in or that, in the alternative, he held an honest
but mistaken belief that she consented to those activities.  The trial judge
concluded that the facts of the case did not lend the mistaken belief defence
any ""air of reality"", and therefore declined to put it to the jury. 
The respondent was convicted.  On appeal, his conviction was overturned and a
new trial ordered.  The Crown appeals to this Court as of right on the question
of both the nature and the proper application of the ""air of reality""
test to the mistake of fact defence in the context of a sexual assault.

 

I.  Relevant Statutory Provisions

 

4                 At the time of the offence, the
following were the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 :

 

                   265. (1) A person commits an assault
when

 

(a)
without the consent of another person, he applies force intentionally to
that other person, directly or indirectly;

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (2)
This section applies to all forms of assault, including sexual assault,
sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm
and aggravated sexual assault.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (4)
Where an accused alleges that he believed that the complainant consented to the
conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that
there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the
evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing
all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused's
belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that
belief. [Emphasis added.]

 

II.  Facts and Judgments

 

5                 In early November 1991, the
complainant and the respondent met in a parking lot when the respondent helped her
remove her car from an icy spot.  He asked for her phone number.  She agreed. 
Approximately one week later, on November 12, they went out on a date and
subsequently returned to her place.  He says that they became quite intimate,
removed substantially all of their clothing, fondled one another's private
parts, talked of sex and birth control, and that she masturbated him to
ejaculation.  She maintains that they only kissed, talked of birth control, and
talked about the fact that, as a born again Christian, she did not believe in
premarital sex.  Nothing else happened and he left at around 9:45 p.m.  

 

6                 Thirteen days later, on November
25, the respondent, having driven all night from Winnipeg, called the
complainant up at six in the morning from his cellular phone and asked if he
could stop by.  Although she had just gotten up for work, she assented since
she thought he needed to talk.  He arrived ten minutes later, having stopped to
buy a condom at a nearby store.  She greeted him at the door with a kiss on the
cheek, clad only in her bathrobe.  He entered and beckoned her to the couch and
tried to kiss her.  At this point, their stories diverge considerably.

 

7                 According to her, she pulled
away and, seeing the condom in his hand, asked if that was ""why [he] came
over here"".  Distraught, she went to her room to take her sleeping
2-year-old child off her bed and took her to another room to change the child's
diapers.  The respondent followed her.  After she had finished, he beckoned the
complainant into the bedroom.  She followed, thinking that he wanted to
""crash"", since he had driven all night before arriving at her door. 
She began to look in her closet for clothes to wear to work when she turned
around and saw that the respondent had taken his shirt off.  She claims that he
drew her to him and kissed her and then pushed her onto the bed.  She resisted
actively, both verbally and physically, but he was stronger.  She described in
considerable detail the assault.  Feeling his weight atop her, she had a
flashback to a previous traumatic experience and went into ""shock"". 
The next thing she remembered, he was pulling his penis out of her and
ejaculating on her stomach.  She fled to the bathroom, needing to vomit.  He
dressed and kissed her goodbye on the cheek as he left.  The complainant did
not go to work that day, but instead went directly to see her counsellor, who
testified to the fact of her emotionally agitated state on that particular day.

 

8                 By contrast, the respondent
claims that they sat on her couch and kissed, and that he then asked to use the
washroom.  The complainant then took her sleeping child back to the child's
bedroom, and the two of them entered the complainant's bedroom where they lay
on the bed and began to kiss.  She actively participated in the sexual
activity.  Her only resistance was that, when he pulled out the condom, she
said ""no, not yet"".  He therefore put the condom aside on the
pillow.  In his words, things then began to get ""hot"" and he
prematurely ejaculated on her stomach.  No intercourse took place.  They talked
for a short period of time.  She got up and went to the bathroom.  He dressed,
kissed her goodbye and left.

 

9                 At trial, the respondent
asserted that the complainant consented to the sexual activity or, in the
alternative, that he had an honest but mistaken belief that she was
consenting.  Both the complainant and the respondent testified.  A report from
the medical examination of the complainant was admitted into evidence in an
agreed-upon statement of facts.  That report indicated no physical injury, but noted
the presence of redness on the inner labia which could be consistent with
either consensual or non-consensual intercourse.  The trial judge refused to
put the mistaken belief defence to the jury, finding there to be no air of
reality to the defence, and concluding that the issue was simply one of
""consent or no consent"".  Because of his ruling on the mistaken
belief defence, he also instructed the jury to disregard all evidence of any
sexual activity between the complainant and the respondent prior to the alleged
incident, since it was not relevant to any other issue in the trial.  The
respondent was convicted.

 

10               McClung J.A., for the majority of
the Alberta Court of Appeal (1993), 145 A.R. 207, 55 W.A.C. 207, held the trial
judge's failure to put the mistaken belief defence to the jury to be in error. 
He enumerated certain independent facts that, in his view, lent an air of
reality to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent: the
complainant's telephone overture to the respondent, the discussions of her use
of birth control, and the fact that she met him with a kiss at 6:10 a.m. on
November 25 wearing only her bathrobe. He also held the trial judge's
instruction that the jury disregard the prior sexual activity to be in error,
since it was relevant to the question of mistaken belief.  McFadyen J.A.
dissented on the basis that none of the factors pointed to by the majority lent
any air of reality to the defence.

 

III.  Analysis

 

11               The common law has long recognized
that a trial judge need not put to the jury defences for which there is no real
factual basis or evidentiary foundation.  Courts must filter out irrelevant or
specious defences, since their primary effect would not be to advance the quest
for truth in the trial, but rather to confuse finders of fact and divert their
attention from factual determinations that are pertinent to the issue of
innocence or guilt.  Since this Court's judgment in Pappajohn v. The Queen,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, the requirement that such a foundation exist for a defence
before it is put to the jury has generally come to be known as the ""air of
reality"" test.  

 

12               In R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4
S.C.R. 595, Cory J. noted that this test applies uniformly to all defences, and
that its application to the defence of mistaken belief in consent was only a
subset of this broad principle.  In Osolin, moreover, this Court
concluded that the requirement in s. 265(4)  of the Criminal Code  that
there be ""sufficient evidence"" in order for a judge to put the
defence of mistake to the jury was essentially a codification of the common law
""air of reality"" test as it relates to the mistake of fact defence. 
Although, or perhaps because, several separate judgments were written in Osolin
on the air of reality test, certain questions regarding that test appear to
persist.  In an effort to dispel any remaining confusion, it is appropriate to
examine briefly the purpose of the ""air of reality"" threshold before
turning to several aspects of its application: the significance of the absence
or presence of an actual allegation by the accused of mistaken belief; the
extent to which the accused's version must be corroborated; and the effect on
the trial if the accused and the complainant tell diametrically opposed
stories.  This discussion will be followed by observations that may assist
trial judges in identifying circumstances in which there clearly is no air of
reality to the honest mistake defence.

 

A.  The Nature and Purpose of the
""Air of Reality"" Threshold

 

13               In Pappajohn, supra,
at pp. 126-27, McIntyre J. explained the air of reality test in the following
manner:

 

Before
any obligation arises to put defences, there must be in the evidence some basis
upon which the defence can rest and it is only where such an evidentiary basis
is present that a trial judge must put a defence.

 

In R. v. Bulmer, [1987] 1
S.C.R. 782, he further elaborated upon this standard (at p. 790):

 

There
will not be an air of reality about a mere statement that ""I thought she
was consenting"" not supported to some degree by other evidence or
circumstances arising in the case.  If that mere assertion were sufficient to
require a trial judge to put the ""mistake of fact"" defence, it would
be a simple matter in any rape case to make such an assertion and, regardless
of all other circumstances, require the defence to be put.  It must be
remembered that at this stage of the proceedings the trial judge is not in any
way concerned with the question of guilt or innocence.  He is not concerned
with the weight of evidence or with the credibility of evidence.  The
question he must answer is this.  In all the circumstances of the case, is
there any reality in the defence?  To answer this question he must consider all
the evidence, all the circumstances.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The requirement that the trial judge
not enter into assessments of credibility or weighing of evidence is an
important factor in the application of this test.  The test is the means by
which a judge demarcates the limits of the jury's fact-finding
responsibilities.  A jury must not be invited to speculate on issues that are
not realistically before it:

 

The
term ""air of reality"" simply means that the trial judge must
determine if the evidence put forward is such that, if believed, a reasonable
jury properly charged could have acquitted.  If the evidence meets that test
then the defence must be put to the jury.  This is no more than an example
of the basic division of tasks between judge and jury. [Emphasis added.]

 

(Osolin,
supra, at p. 682, per Cory J.)

 

This underlying rationale must be kept
first and foremost in the minds of trial judges as they seek to apply the
""air of reality"" test.  It is a legal threshold, not a factual one. 
It is an error of law for a judge not to put a defence to the jury where an air
of reality to that defence exists and it is an error of law to put a defence to
a jury where no such air of reality exists.  This line can sometimes be a fine
one, however, for although we urge trial judges not to descend into the arena
of facts, we nonetheless require that they consider nothing less than the
""totality of the circumstances"" in deciding whether an air of reality
exists to found a particular defence.  These seemingly conflicting requirements
can invite analysis that is at best imprecise and at worst reflective of little
more than a judicial ""gut feeling"".  Although this matter will be
revisited shortly, it is first important to clear up several misconceptions
about the application of the ""air of reality"" test. 

 

B.  Application of the ""Air of
Reality"" Threshold

 

                   1. Assertion of
an Honest Belief in Consent

 

14               Some have interpreted this Court's
past jurisprudence as suggesting that an accused must actually allege a
""belief"" in consent, as opposed to asserting the presence of consent
itself, in order for there to be a basis for the honest but mistaken belief
defence.  Both parties to the present appeal, in fact, devote significant
argument to the question of whether the accused actually asserted such a belief
or whether his failure to assert it precludes him from claiming that defence. 
Frankly, they are chasing a red herring.

 

15               The defence of mistake of fact was
described in Pappajohn, supra, at p. 148, by Dickson J.
(dissenting in the result):

 

Mistake
is a defence... where it prevents an accused from having the mens rea
which the law requires for the very crime with which he is charged.  Mistake of
fact is more accurately seen as a negation of guilty intention than as the
affirmation of a positive defence.  It avails an accused who acts
innocently, pursuant to a flawed perception of the facts, and nonetheless
commits the actus reus of the offence.  Mistake is a defence though,
in the sense that it is raised as an issue by an accused.  The Crown is rarely
possessed of knowledge of the subjective factors which may have caused an
accused to entertain a belief in a fallacious set of facts. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

Thus, for instance, if a hunter shoots
what he believes to be a deer and subsequently discovers that he has shot a
man, then he will likely rely on the defence of mistake of fact to claim that
he has acted innocently as a result of a mistaken perception.  In the vast
majority of cases, one might seriously doubt that there is an air of reality to
the defence of mistake of fact if the accused fails even to assert any belief that
the man was a deer.  In such circumstances, the mistake of fact defence, for
all intents and purposes, generally requires the accused to assert a belief or
misperception relating to an essential element of the actus reus, the
existence of which is generally not otherwise in dispute, in order to imbue
that defence with an air of reality.  

 

16               Transferring this practical
consequence to the context of sexual assault is more problematic, however.  In
the context of sexual assault, proof of the actus reus includes proof of
the fact that the complainant was not, in fact, consenting.  By the very nature
of sexual assault, however, the issue of actual consent is almost always
materially in dispute.  For the accused to assert a belief which he
acknowledges to be mistaken (i.e., a misperception), he would
essentially have to assert a belief that implicitly concedes the actus reus
of the offence -- i.e., the non-consent.  It is inappropriate to suggest that
an accused should have to assist the Crown in proving the actus reus of
the offence, by admitting that ""perhaps he was mistaken about her
consent"", in order to rely on the mistaken belief defence.  Given that
consent is, itself, a mental state experienced only by the complainant, an accused's
assertion that the complainant consented must mean that he in fact believed
she was consenting (see Lamer J., concurring, in Bulmer, supra,
at p. 799).  The distinction between asserting a belief in consent and
asserting consent, itself, is therefore both artificial and potentially
misleading.  Assault differs importantly from most other Code offences
in its interaction with the mistake of fact defence.  Under most other
offences, mistake of fact will primarily arise in contexts in which the actus
reus of the offence is beyond dispute.  Assaults raise a unique problem in
that the mental state of another person (i.e.,  consent or lack thereof) is an
essential element that is relevant to both the actus reus and the
mens rea of the offence -- an element which almost invariably is
materially in dispute. 

 

17               McIntyre J. made it clear in Bulmer,
supra, at pp. 790-91, that the absence or presence of an actual
statement by the accused alleging mistaken belief is of limited significance to
the determination of whether or not there exists any air of reality to that
defence:

 

The
question he must answer is this.  In all the circumstances of this case, is
there any reality in the defence?  To answer this question, he must consider
all the evidence, all the circumstances.  The statement of the accused
alleging a mistaken belief will be a factor but will not by itself be decisive,
and even in its total absence, other circumstances might dictate the putting of
the defence. [Emphasis added.]

 

I must respectfully go even further. 
Where the accused asserts that the complainant actually consented, then it is
artificial to inquire further into whether he also expressed a belief that she
was consenting.  The absence or presence of an actual statement indicating a
belief in consent is of no consequence in all but the most unusual of cases. 
Presuming that the accused is de facto asserting such a belief, the more
fundamental question is whether that belief is an honest belief, capable
of supporting the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent (see Osolin,
supra, at p. 649, per McLachlin J.).  It is to this question that
we must now turn.

 

                   2. The
""Corroboration"" Requirement

 

18               Independent corroboration implies
objectivity and reliability.  Where there is ""independent"" evidence,
particularly real evidence, corroborating an accused's testimony with respect
to a particular defence, then a court can generally conclude that, as a matter
of law, there is an ""air of reality"" to that defence.  As a purely
practical matter, courts have a more difficult time in deciding what to do in
circumstances where there is an absence of ""independent""
corroborative evidence.  Sexual assault, by virtue of the fact that it is often
not witnessed by anyone other than the complainant and the accused and by
virtue of the fact that it does not require proof of visible physical injury to
the complainant, raises special problems in this respect.

 

19               In Pappajohn, supra,
at p. 133, McIntyre J. made the following observation about the circumstances
in which an ""air of reality"" would exist for the defence of mistaken
belief of consent:

 

To
require the putting of the alternative defence of mistaken belief in consent,
there must be, in my opinion, some evidence beyond the mere assertion of belief
in consent by counsel for the appellant.  This evidence must appear from or
be supported by sources other than the appellant in order to give it any air of
reality. [Emphasis added.]

 

He subsequently explained what he had
meant by this statement, in Bulmer, supra, at p. 790:

 

These
words appear, on occasion, to have been misunderstood, but I do not withdraw
them.  There will not be an air of reality about a mere statement that ""I
thought she was consenting"" not supported to some degree by other evidence
or circumstances arising in the case.... The question [the trial judge] must
answer is this.  In all the circumstances of this case, is there any reality in
the defence?  To answer this question, he must consider all the evidence, all
the circumstances. 

 

More recently in Osolin, supra,
at pp. 686-87, Cory J. reiterated this point:

 

There
is no requirement that there be evidence independent of the accused in order to
have the defence put to the jury.  However, the mere assertion by the accused
that ""I believed she was consenting"" will not be sufficient.  What is required is that the
defence of mistaken belief be supported by evidence beyond the mere assertion
of a mistaken belief....

 

...
The requisite evidence may come from the detailed testimony of the accused
alone, on this issue or from the testimony of the accused coupled with evidence
from other sources.  For example, the complainant's testimony may supply the
requisite evidence. [Emphasis added.]

 

McLachlin J.'s remarks in Osolin
on this issue (at pp. 649-50) are equally apposite:

 

. .
. the accused's mere assertion of his belief is not evidence of its honesty. 
The requirement that the belief be honestly held is not equivalent to an
objective test of what the reasonable person would have believed.  But
nevertheless it does require some support arising from the circumstances.  A
belief which is totally unsupported is not an honestly held belief.  A person
who honestly believes something is a person who has looked at the circumstances
and has drawn an honest inference from them.  Therefore, for a belief to be
honest, there must be some support for it in the circumstances.... A person
who commits a sexual assault without some support in the circumstances for
inferring the consent of the complainant has, at very least, been wilfully
blind as to consent. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

Sopinka J. preferred, at pp. 654-55,
to characterize the ""air of reality"" test more simply, as an ordinary
evidentiary burden on an accused to adduce sufficient evidence to justify a
defence being put to a jury.  In many ways, he is correct.  I think, however,
that the unique social and legal context of sexual assault, including the
uncommon frequency with which the mistake of fact defence is raised, make it
necessary for this Court to elaborate somewhat on that standard.

 

20               Essentially, for there to be an
""air of reality"" to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in
consent, the totality of the evidence for the accused must be reasonably and
realistically capable of supporting that defence.  Although there is not,
strictly speaking, a requirement that the evidence be corroborated, that
evidence must amount to something more than a bare assertion.  There must be
some support for it in the circumstances.  The search for support in the whole
body of evidence or circumstances can complement any insufficiency in legal
terms of the accused's testimony.  The presence of ""independent""
evidence supporting the accused's testimony will only have the effect of
improving the chances of the defence.  The judge's role is limited to
ascertaining whether the accused has discharged the evidentiary burden imposed
by s. 265(4) of the Code.

 

21               As a corollary, in the absence of
some other evidence supporting such a defence, it is difficult to imagine
situations in which there will be sufficient evidence to put the defence of
mistaken belief to the jury where an accused does not testify (see R. v.
Reddick, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 1086).  Finally, for practical and policy reasons
which shall be discussed below, courts must be wary of being too ready to put
the mistaken belief defence to the jury.  We must recall that it is the rare
exception rather than the general rule that a sexual assault will have been
committed by accident.  As McLachlin J. observed in Osolin, supra,
at p. 648, the defence of mistake of fact has only really received special
attention in the context of sexual assault trials because of the frequency with
which that defence is asserted without evidentiary foundation.

 

                   3. Diametrically
Opposed Stories

 

22               It is true that in cases where the
defence of honest but mistaken belief is not put to the jury, there is often a
considerable divergence between the evidence of the accused and that of the
complainant (Pappajohn, supra; R. v. Guthrie (1985), 20
C.C.C. (3d) 73 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. White (1986), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(B.C.C.A.); R. v. Osolin, supra; and R. v. Livermore
(1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 221 (C.A.)).  The significance of diametrically opposing
stories is often misunderstood in two respects, however.

 

23               First, it is important to recall
that the two individuals' stories are only relevant to guilt or innocence of
sexual assault in so far as they relate in some way to the circumstances
affecting the parties at the time of the alleged assault.  Beyond
evidence such as the location and time of the alleged assault and the conduct
of the two parties at that time, this includes relevant and admissible
background facts which explain how the accused could have honestly interpreted
the complainant's conduct at the time of the alleged assault to mean that she
was consenting.  For instance, this Court has recognized that passivity may
express lack of consent (R. v. M. (M.L.), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 3).  Taken
together with passive behaviour by the complainant, earlier acts, gestures or
incidents may in certain cases colour the accused's perception of the
complainant's behaviour, and serve as relevant evidence in assessing the
existence or air of reality of an honest but mistaken belief in actual
consent.  Those acts and gestures may form part of a broader context or
continuum which is necessary to understand the accused's honest perception of
the complainant's behaviour at the time of the alleged assault. 

 

24                At the same time, it must always
be remembered that consent, even if given at one point, may be withdrawn at any
time.  Consequently, it can be dangerous to assume that evidence capable of
founding an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant would
consent to sexual activity is informative of the real question at issue, which
is whether the accused believed that the complainant in fact consented
to that activity.  An honest belief that the complainant would consent
is not a defence to sexual assault where the accused is aware of, or wilfully
blind or reckless as to, lack of consent at the time of the sexual activity. 
Only where an accused entertains an honest belief that the complainant actually
does consent does this mistake render the sexual assault non-culpable. 
Absent some realistic showing of how earlier events could have influenced the
accused's honest perceptions of the complainant's behaviour at the time of the
actual assault, such evidence will not be capable of supporting, by itself, the
defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.

 

25               Secondly, the fact that stories
are diametrically opposed, as well as the degree to which they are opposed, is
but one factor in the air of reality determination.  Instances in which stories
are diametrically opposed and where there is no air of reality are, in fact,
specific applications of the air of reality threshold.  They are not intrinsic
to the test, itself.  The question is not whether two stories are so
diametrically opposed that there can be no air of reality to the defence of
mistaken belief in consent.  This approach ignores the presence of other
factors, such as corroborative evidence, which may nonetheless justify putting
the defence of honest mistake to the jury (see Bulmer, supra). 
Rather, we must bear in mind that neither the version of the facts given by the
complainant nor that given by the accused is necessarily a full and complete
account of what actually took place and, as such, a jury may decide not to
believe certain parts of each person's testimony.  Thus, the question is
whether, in the absence of other evidence lending an air of reality to the
defence of honest mistake, a reasonable jury could cobble together some of the
complainant's evidence and some of the accused's evidence to produce a
sufficient basis for such a defence.  Would the acceptance of one version
necessarily involve the rejection of the other?   Put another way, is it
realistically possible for a properly instructed jury, acting judiciously, to
splice some of each person's evidence with respect to the encounter, and settle
upon a reasonably coherent set of facts, supported by the evidence, that is
capable of sustaining the defence of mistaken belief in consent?  If the
stories cannot realistically be spliced in such a manner, then the issue really
is purely one of credibility -- of consent or no consent -- and the defence of
mistaken belief in consent should not be put to the jury.

 

26               To summarize, when the complainant
and the accused give similar versions of the facts, and the only material
contradiction is in their interpretation of what happened, then the defence of
honest but mistaken belief in consent should generally be put to the jury,
except in cases where the accused's conduct demonstrates recklessness or wilful
blindness to the absence of consent.  On the other hand, courts have generally
refused to put the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent to the jury
when the accused clearly bases his defence on voluntary consent, and he also
testifies that the complainant was an active, eager or willing partner, whereas
the complainant testifies that she vigorously resisted.  In such cases, the
question is generally simply one of credibility, of consent or no consent.  

 

C.  Absence of an Air of Reality

                   

27               It is apparent from the problems
that judges, practitioners and academics have all encountered in finding a
satisfactory means by which to apply the ""air of reality"" test that
it is, indeed, a somewhat elusive standard to put into practice.  There is more
than one way, though, to approach every problem.  Although it may be difficult
to put into positive terms that which is necessary to satisfy the ""air of
reality"" test, framing the test negatively can be a more fruitful
endeavour.  In other words, though it may be difficult to define in precise
terms and as a matter of law the constituent components of ""air of
reality"", it can be a simpler task to delimit with some degree of
certainty when an ""air of reality"" is absent.  I will refer to
this approach as the ""absence of air of reality"", and preface the following
observations with the very sharp reminder that the two tests are not the same:
failure to find a readily ascertainable ""absence of air of reality""
using a particular legal test by no means precludes a finding that the
""air of reality"" threshold has nonetheless not been satisfied. 
Rather, the former constitutes a subset of the latter.  The following remarks
elaborate on this approach.

 

28               The air of reality standard cannot
be evaluated in light of the ""totality of the evidence"" without first
breaking down that formless and undigested mass of evidence, distilling it, and
finally analyzing it.  It could, for instance, be divided into four ""rough
and ready"" categories: (1) testimonial evidence which is materially
in dispute (i.e., addressing facts about which the case for the complainant and
the accused disagree in important respects); (2) real evidence, the existence,
significance or appreciation of which is materially in dispute; (3)
testimonial evidence which is not materially in dispute (i.e., 
addressing facts about which the complainant and accused do not disagree in
important respects), and (4) real evidence, the existence, significance and
appreciation of which is not materially in dispute.

 

29               For the purposes of deciding
whether a defence should or should not go to the jury, real and testimonial
evidence not materially in dispute (categories 3 and 4) are the
""objective comparators"" against which those aspects of the case for
the accused which are materially in dispute (categories 1 and 2) may be
measured.  Where evidence supporting the accused which is materially in
dispute is, realistically viewed, clearly logically inconsistent with evidence
which is not materially in dispute, then it can be concluded as a matter
of both law and logic that there can be no air of reality to the defence to
which those logical inconsistencies relate.  Whereas evaluations of the
accused's case against evidence that is materially in dispute generally
requires assessments as to credibility or as to the appropriate weight to be
given to that evidence, evaluations against evidence that is not materially in
dispute does not call for such a process and is therefore more properly
characterized as a question of law than as a question of fact.

 

30               Building upon this approach, it is
possible to say that there is no air of reality to a particular defence, and
therefore no need to put it to the jury, under the following circumstances:

 

                   (1)
the totality of the evidence for the accused is incapable of amounting to the
defence being sought; or

 

                   (2)the
totality of the evidence for the accused is clearly, logically inconsistent
with the totality of evidence which is not materially in dispute.

 

It goes without saying, of course,
that these standards should be viewed realistically, and not evaluated
according to purely speculative or hypothetical extremes.  We must recall that
a defence should not be put to the jury unless a reasonable jury, properly
instructed and acting judiciously, could acquit on that basis.

 

31               A court may conclude as a matter
of law that there is no air of reality to a particular defence if the accused's
case simply does not support it.  In Osolin, supra, at p. 651,
McLachlin J. concluded that the undisputed facts of the accused's case were, at
the very least, consistent with wilful blindness and therefore did not admit of
the defence of honest belief in consent (see also Sansregret v. The Queen,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 570).  In her view, no person, reasonable or otherwise, could
have honestly inferred consent from the circumstances, notwithstanding the fact
that the complainant may have passively acquiesced at certain points.  In such
instances, the absence of an air of reality to the defence of honest mistake
precludes it from being put to the jury.

 

32               The second branch of this approach
is both borne out and exemplified by the facts of Reddick, supra. 
A 29-year-old man was charged with sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl who
was a virgin at the time of the assault.  The complainant and her girlfriends
were watching television one Saturday afternoon.  The accused, whom the
complainant knew only slightly, arrived and began to tickle them all, telling
them to get up.  All but the complainant eventually left.  The accused tried to
kiss the complainant on a few occasions, and she eventually slapped him in the
face.  He then suggested that they go to McDonald's for a drink.  She assented,
thinking that her friends would be outside and that they would stop her.  They
were not outside.  The two drove to McDonald's and bought a drink.  When back
in the car, the accused tried to kiss her again and tried to put his hand down
her pants.  The complainant suggested they go for a drive, thinking that he
could not do anything while he was driving.  The accused drove to a dead-end
road, parked and tried to fondle her.  She told him to stop.  At that point a
security car drove by, and the accused stopped.  He then drove her to a remote
corner in the bottom level of an underground parking lot and raped her.  When
the complainant tried to resist by holding her track pants up, the accused
ripped a hole through them and had intercourse with her.  He took her home and
told her not to tell her mother.  

 

33               When she arrived home, she
informed her mother.  A medical examination revealed a half-inch tear on her
vagina which was still bleeding.  The accused corroborated the complainant's
evidence regarding his advances, regarding the trip to McDonald's, to the dead
end and to the parking lot.  However, he testified that the sexual activity met
with no resistance.  He explained that he drove her to the parking lot because
he thought that there was a good likelihood that she would have sex with him. 
He explained the ripped track pants on the basis that it was more convenient to
have sex through her track pants.  In a trial by judge alone, the judge found
absence of consent, but acquitted because he had a reasonable doubt as to
whether or not the accused knew the victim was consenting.  This Court upheld
the Court of Appeal's substitution of a verdict of guilty.

 

34               The fact of the torn track pants,
the medical evidence inconsistent with consensual sexual intercourse, the
complainant's age, and the sequence of events leading up to the alleged assault
were all not materially in dispute.  Most importantly, however, the significance
of the torn track pants could not be said to be materially in dispute, when
viewed realistically in light of the medical evidence and the girl's age.  It
could only be consistent with the use of force, overriding or wilfully blind to
the will of the victim.  The totality of the accused's case was therefore clearly
logically inconsistent with the defence of honest but mistaken belief and that
defence should not have been available to the finder of fact (in this case, the
judge sitting alone).

 

35               This approach also provides
further support for the proposition, already accepted by this Court, that an
air of reality cannot spring from what amounts to little more than a bare,
unsupported assertion by the accused.  The facts in R. v. Robertson,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 918, are illustrative of this fact.  The complainant testified
that the accused, a stranger, entered the apartment she shared with her
room-mate under the pretence that he was a friend of the room-mate.  Once in
the apartment, he put his hand over the complainant's mouth, pulled her hair,
forced her to the floor, threatened her, hit her, and sexually assaulted her. 
She did not resist the attack as she was afraid that he would hurt her more. 
At trial, defence counsel argued consent and, alternatively, honest belief as
to consent.  The accused did not testify.  He made only the bare, unsupported
assertion through his counsel that he honestly believed that the complainant
was consenting.  He did not contradict through his own testimony the version
told by the complainant but rather sought to point out inconsistencies in her
testimony through cross-examination.  This cross-examination did not, however,
succeed in bringing the complainant's evidence materially into dispute.  Nor
was there other evidence which brought that evidence materially into dispute. 
As such, the accused's case regarding mistaken belief amounted to little more
than a bare, unsupported assertion and it was clearly, logically inconsistent
with the totality of the evidence that was not materially in dispute (including,
in this case, the complainant's evidence).  It is difficult to see how the
outcome would be any different if the accused had actually testified yet still
only made a bare, unsupported assertion as to belief in consent without
materially disputing those portions of the complainant's story relevant to the
actual sexual assault.

 

36               This approach also offers helpful
insight into circumstances where the totality of the accused's claim to a
mistaken belief defence, realistically viewed, is clearly internally
inconsistent.  It states the obvious to say that an accused cannot be said to
dispute materially his own testimony.  Moreover, since the complainant's story
is to the effect that she did not consent, the complainant also cannot be said
to dispute materially statements made by the accused which indicate that the
accused knew that she was not consenting (or was wilfully blind or reckless to
that fact).  If, then, an accused on one hand cross-examines the complainant
and elicits some evidence which might support the conclusion that he believed
she consented but, on the other hand, essentially tells a story that amounts to
nothing less than wilful blindness as to her consent, then there would be a
clear inconsistency within his claim to a mistaken belief in consent
(principally advanced via cross-examination of the complainant).  Thus,
although the cross-examination, taken alone, could arguably constitute some
evidence lending an ""air of reality"" to the defence of honest belief
in consent, that defence should not be put to the jury because it suffers from
a clear, internal logical inconsistency with facts that are not materially in
dispute.

 

37               Much difficulty in defining the
nature and type of ""corroboration"" required to lend an ""air of
reality"" to the defence of mistake in consent may flow from past failures
to acknowledge the relationship outlined above.  Although clear logical
inconsistency is, in a way, the analytical antithesis to corroboration, it is
important to recognize that what is truly important to the ""air of
reality"" test in respect of a particular defence is that the evidence said
to provide some basis for that defence must actually relate to, and support, that
particular defence.  Evidence going to an ancillary issue or failing to
address a clear and undisputed logical inconsistency in an accused's claim to
the honest mistake defence, then, will not, itself, be sufficient to lend that
defence an air of reality.  Although this conclusion seems obvious, it is
apparently not always being followed, judging by the type of evidence deemed at
times to be supportive of the defence.  With all due respect to McClung J.A.,
the present case is no exception.

 

D. Mistake of Fact and Consent

 

38               This Court recently concluded that
a finding of lack of consent does not, as a matter of law, require some minimal
word or gesture of objection:  M. (M.L.), supra.  Passivity is,
in essence, capable of communicating lack of consent.  Although it is not
strictly necessary to address this issue in order to resolve the present
appeal, it seems to me that many of the difficulties relating to both the
nature and the application of the air of reality test to honest belief defences
may flow from the manner in which the common law approaches the mens rea
of the offence of sexual assault.  In Osolin, supra, at p. 669,
Cory J. observed that the crime of sexual assault is different from all other
manners of assault in that it is gender based in the vast majority of cases. 
He acknowledged that ss. 15  and 28  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms , guaranteeing equality to men and women, play a special role in
the context of sexual assault.  In my view, there may be reason to believe that
the existing role of consent in the mens rea of the offence of sexual
assault raises some concerns with respect to those two provisions of the Charter . 
Briefly put, the current common law approach to consent may perpetuate social
stereotypes that have historically victimized women and undermined their equal
right to bodily integrity and human dignity.

 

39               The actus reus of sexual
assault requires that the Crown demonstrate a touching of a sexual nature,
combined with a lack of actual consent to that touching.  The mens rea
for sexual assault is established by showing that the accused intended to touch
the complainant in a manner that is sexual, and knew of, or was reckless or
wilfully blind to, the fact that the complainant was not consenting to that
touching.  Our law typically takes this to mean that the accused must be shown
to be aware of, or reckless or wilfully blind to, the fact that non-consent was
communicated.  I shall elaborate immediately below on why, in my view, we must
accept that the mens rea for sexual assault is also established
by showing that the accused was aware of, or reckless or wilfully blind to, the
fact that consent was not communicated.  In other words, the mens rea of
sexual assault is not only satisfied when it is shown that the accused knew
that the complainant was essentially saying ""no"", but is also
satisfied when it is shown that the accused knew that the complainant was
essentially not saying ""yes"".

 

40               Few would dispute that there is a
clear communication gap between how most women experience consent, and
how many men perceive consent.  Some of this gap is attributable to
genuine, often gender-based, miscommunication between the parties.  Another
portion of this gap, however, can be attributed to the myths and stereotypes
that many men hold about consent.  As R. D. Wiener has observed in
""Shifting the Communication Burden: A Meaningful Consent Standard in
Rape"" (1983), 6 Harv. Women's L.J. 143, at p. 147:

 

[A]
gender gap in sexual communications exists.  Men and women frequently
misinterpret the intent of various dating behaviors and erotic play engaged in
by their opposite-sexed partners. 

 

 

                                                                    ...

 

 

                   Because
both men and women are socialized to accept coercive sexuality as the norm in
sexual behavior, men often see extreme forms of this aggressive behavior as
seduction, rather than rape.  A great many incidents women consider rape are,
in effect, considered ""normal"" by both male perpetrators and the
male-dominated legal system.

 

 

The current approach to consent may
perpetuate this unfortunate phenomenon.

 

41               Consent and assault are reciprocal
concepts.  The limits of one ultimately define the other.  The role that
consent plays in the law of sexual assault depends largely upon the purpose
that we ascribe to that offence in contemporary society.  Rape laws originally
developed to protect the proprietary interests that men -- fathers and husbands
-- had in women (Wiener, supra, at p. 160, note 104).  A last vestige of
this opprobrious notion -- the fact that the crime of rape did not apply to
activity between a husband and wife -- was not eliminated in Canada until
1983.  Long ago, however, the common law evolved to define rape in terms of
sexual intercourse without consent and induced by force, fear or fraud (Great
Britain, Report of the Advisory Group on the Law of Rape (1975), at p.
3).  At that time, it could be said that the primary purpose underlying the
offence of rape was concern for the protection of women from physical injury. 
The significance of the use of force has since diminished, however.  The crime
of rape has been replaced with the broader offence of sexual assault.  Actual
intercourse is not a prerequisite for a sexual assault.  Moreover, a woman need
no longer suffer actual physical injury before she can say that she was
sexually assaulted.  Sexual assault is now, essentially, a sexual touching
without consent.  The purpose of the criminal law in this domain has shifted
once again.  The primary concern is no longer solely with the physical safety
of women, but rather with something broader.  

 

42               In my view, the primary concern
animating and underlying the present offence of sexual assault is the belief
that women have an inherent right to exercise full control over their own
bodies, and to engage only in sexual activity that they wish to engage in.  If
this is the case, then our approach to consent must evolve accordingly, for it
may be out of phase with that conceptualization of the law.  In this respect,
L. Vandervort argues in ""Mistake of Law and Sexual Assault: Consent and
Mens Rea"" (1987-88), 2 C.J.W.L. 233, at p. 267, that consent must
be regarded from the standpoint of communication, rather than from the
standpoint of a private mental state:

 

                   The
social act of consent consists of communication to another person, by means of
verbal and non-verbal behaviour, of permission to perform one or more acts
which that person would otherwise have a legal or non-legal obligation not to
perform.... To consent is to waive a right and relieve another person of a
correlative duty....

 

...
Acts performed in reliance on such a waiver do not breach any operative legal
duty and do not constitute commission of an offence.  It is thus clear that
any analysis of consent must consider what, if anything, was actually
communicated, as well as whether the communication was voluntary. [Emphasis
added.]

 

Vandervort concludes as follows, at p.
277:

 

                   The
right of the individual to be free of non-consensual sexual contact will be
protected only if consent is interpreted as an absolute issue, such that a
failure to find that it was present is taken to demonstrate that it was
absent....  The law provides that sexual touching is assaultive unless the
person touched agrees to be touched.  It does not provide that the transaction
is non-assaultive unless the person touched objects. [Emphasis in
original.]

 

43               Consideration of communication
of consent has always implicitly informed our approach to how knowledge of
absence of consent relates to the mens rea of the offence of sexual
assault.  In fact, since consent is, itself, a private mental state, we go
about inferring it in much the same way as we would infer mens rea. 
Namely, we look to verbal and non-verbal cues and then draw inferences about a
particular mental state by evaluating the individual's behaviour in light of
the totality of the circumstances.  A finder of fact employs these techniques
to determine whether a complainant has, in fact, not consented to a sexual
touching.  In so far as the actus reus of the offence of sexual assault
is concerned, the inquiry stops there.  The mens rea of sexual assault,
however, requires proof of the accused's awareness of, or recklessness or
wilful blindness to, this absence of consent.  The inquiry into absence of
consent for the purposes of establishing the mens rea of the offence
must therefore go one step further, and delve into the accused's perception
of the absence of consent.  Since mistake of fact goes to the mens rea
of the offence, an honest mistake of fact by the accused in this respect may
therefore indicate that he possessed a non-culpable state of mind. 

 

44                As I mentioned earlier, however,
circumstances are not relevant to the defence of honest but mistaken belief
where they are only capable of supporting a belief on the part of the accused
that the complainant would consent, rather than being capable of
supporting his belief that she does, in fact, consent.  An accused cannot say
that he believed the complainant to be consenting without pointing out the
basis for that belief.  As a practical matter, therefore, the principal
considerations that are relevant to this defence are (1) the complainant's
actual communicative behaviour, and (2) the totality of the admissible and
relevant evidence explaining how the accused perceived that behaviour to
communicate consent.  Everything else is ancillary.  

 

45               Non-consensual sexual touching is
criminal unless, at the least, the accused honestly believes that consent has
been communicated with respect to that touching.  Thus, as a practical matter,
the mens rea of the offence does not relate so much to the complainant's
frame of mind as it does to the complainant's communication of that frame of
mind and to the accused's perception of that communication. 
Furthermore, although consent may exist in the mind of the woman without being
communicated in any form, it cannot be accepted by a reasonable finder of fact
as having been honestly perceived by the accused without first
identifying the behaviour that led the accused ostensibly to hold this
perception.  If the accused is unable to point to evidence tending to show that
the complainant's consent was communicated, then he risks a jury concluding
that he was aware of, or reckless or wilfully blind to, the complainant's
absence of consent.  Of course, passivity can, itself, under certain infrequent
circumstances, be communicative in character: M. (M.L.), supra. 
By way of another example, evidence of past sexual behaviour between the
parties might be relevant to the defence of mistake of fact in instances where
that behaviour may have influenced the accused's honest perception of the
complainant's communication relating to the particular sexual activity in
question.   

 

46               Under such an analytic approach,
although the communication gap between the sexes may still avail confusion and miscommunication,
the consequences will accrue more equally to both.  Women, as a practical
matter, still run the risk of being sexually assaulted unless they communicate
non-consent in a manner that is sufficiently clear for others to understand. 
Men, by contrast, must assume the responsibility for that part of the
communication gap that is driven by androcentric myths and stereotypes, rather
than by genuine misunderstanding due to gender-based miscommunication. 

 

47               The assumption that if a woman is
not consenting then she will say so is only helpful if we further assume that
men perceive non-consent in the same way that women communicate
it.  The elusive and multi-facetted character of sex-speak, however,
demonstrates this latter assumption to be patently incorrect:  

 

A
woman may believe she has communicated her unwillingness to have sex -- and
other women would agree, thus making it a ""reasonable"" female
expression.  Her male partner might still believe she is willing -- and other
men would agree with his interpretation, thus making it a
""reasonable"" male interpretation.  The woman, who believes that she has
conveyed her lack of consent, may interpret the man's persistence as an
indication that he does not care if she objects and plans to have sex despite
her lack of consent.  She may then feel frightened by the man's persistence,
and may submit against her will.  [Emphasis in original.] 

                   (Wiener, supra,
at pp. 148-49.)

 

Acknowledging the reality of this
communication gap between reasonable women and reasonable men requires us to
discard the assumption that voluntariness -- defined only in terms of force,
fear or fraud -- is a fair proxy for consent in the absence of communicated
non-consent.  It is not.  As long as the effect of our approach to the mens
rea of sexual assault reinforces the view that sexual activity is
consensual in the absence of communicated non-consent, the damaging
communication gap between the sexes, and the terrible costs that flow from it,
will continue unacknowledged and will be perpetuated rather than narrowed.  In
order to give full and meaningful effect to women's right to control their own
bodies, we must recognize that awareness of, or recklessness or wilful
blindness to, an absence of communicated consent is sufficient to found the mens
rea of the offence of sexual assault.

 

48               In my view, finders of fact will
benefit from focusing their attentions on communication, and honest perception
of that communication, when determining whether the mens rea of the
offence has been made out.  Such an approach will enable them to separate more
effectively the wheat from the chaff --- the myth and the stereotype from the
reality -- in determining whether the accused was aware of the complainant's absence
of consent, or whether he could have entertained an honest but mistaken belief
as to her consent.  It will help them to identify, and filter out,
stereotypical beliefs on the part of the accused that lead him to override
non-consent, or that lead him to be reckless towards whether a woman is
consenting or not.  I believe that it may therefore lead to fairer, more
accurate factual determinations.  I believe that it will also take women's and
men's distinct realities more equitably into account. 

 

49               There is nothing preventing the
common law governing consent from evolving to reflect contemporary social mores
and realities.  In fact, common law approaches to consent have always been
strongly informed by public policy considerations.  As Gonthier J. observed for
the majority of this Court in R. v. Jobidon, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 714, at p.
740:

 

[Historically,]
[i]t was a concern that the offence of assault -- more particularly the element
of consent -- be informed by considerations of public policy.  Such
considerations were thought sufficiently important to justify nullifying the
legal validity of consent as a defence to a charge of assault.

 

He went on to enumerate several
important public policy considerations, at pp. 762-65, to support his
conclusion that consent between adults at common law is vitiated by an
intention to cause serious hurt in the course of a fist fight or brawl.

 

50               In Leary v. The Queen,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 29, moreover, a majority of this Court recognized that public
policy considerations played a role in justifying a departure from the ordinary
principles of mens rea in instances of drunkenness by way of the
specific/general intent distinction.  See also R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 833, at p. 865, per McIntyre J. The classification of sexual
assault as a general intent offence to which drunkenness could not be a defence
was also undeniably partly influenced by those same policy considerations. 
This position was recently re-affirmed, subject to the narrowest
possible exception of drunkenness demonstrably akin to automatism, by a
majority of this Court in R. v. Daviault, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 63.  

 

51               The majority of this Court
recently concluded in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3
S.C.R. 835, that the common law must develop in a way that is consistent with Charter 
values.  It follows that the common law governing the mens rea of sexual
assault must be approached having regard to, inter alia, s. 15  of the Charter . 
As was the case in R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, this Court must
strive to ensure that criminal law is responsive to women's realities, rather
than a vehicle for the perpetuation of historic repression and disadvantage.  A
doctor who operates in the absence of the patient's informed and communicated
consent risks being charged with assault.  Awareness of, or recklessness or
wilful blindness to, the absence of that communication is culpable in such
situations.  I see no reason why an accused charged with sexual assault should
not be held to an identical standard.  

 

IV. Application to the Facts

 

52               In the present appeal, there was
no air of reality to the accused's defence of mistaken belief in consent.  The
factors listed by McClung J.A. as lending an air of reality to that defence --
the complainant's telephone overture to the respondent, the discussions of her
use of birth control, the sexual activity engaged in thirteen days earlier, and
the fact that she met him with a kiss at 6:10 a.m. on November 25 wearing only
her bathrobe -- are all only capable, if anything, of supporting a belief on
the part of the respondent that the complainant would consent, not a
belief that she did in fact consent.  None of these factors address or
relate in any realistic way to the events that actually took place at the time
of the alleged sexual assault.  They are therefore incapable of supporting a
defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.  

                   

53               What is relevant to a
possible defence of honest but mistaken belief is the account of the events
that took place in the bedroom, as well as any additional information
explaining why the respondent might have honestly interpreted those events at
that time to be consistent with consent.  In certain cases, evidence of prior
sexual activity between the two parties may be relevant in this respect.  In
the present case, however, the dissimilarities between the alleged assault and
the acts that took place in the encounter thirteen days earlier can only lead
one to conclude that evidence of that encounter was neither relevant to, nor capable
of supporting, an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant
was consenting at the time of the assault.  

 

54               In the present case, moreover, the
respondent's evidence is very sketchy as to the events that took place in the
bedroom.  He asserts that the complainant was a willing participant, that she
only resisted with respect to the timing of the use of the condom, and that
""as things were going on, it was getting hot"", leading him to
ejaculate on her stomach.  He asserts that intercourse never even took place. 
The complainant, on the other hand, claims to have vigorously resisted him,
both verbally, by saying repeatedly ""No Darryl"" and ""I don't
want this"", and physically.  His strength and considerably greater weight,
however, were too much for her and caused her then to go into a state of shock,
during which he penetrated her.  

 

55               There is nothing in the totality
of this evidence, coming from either the respondent or the complainant, to lend
any air of reality to the possibility that the respondent may have held a
mistaken belief as to her consent.  Nor, for that matter, would it have been
possible for a reasonable jury to splice together some of her evidence and some
of his with respect to the encounter, and to settle upon a reasonably coherent
set of facts that could support the defence of mistaken belief in consent.  A
reasonable jury, properly instructed and acting judiciously, could not come to
a conclusion both that the complainant did not consent to the sexual activity
and that the respondent could have had a mistaken belief about her
non-consent.  For all of these reasons, the trial judge was correct in refusing
to put the defence of mistake of fact to the jury.  

 

56               As such, I would allow the Crown's
appeal and restore the conviction.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

57               Sopinka
J. -- I have read the reasons for judgment written by my colleagues the
Chief Justice and Justice L'Heureux-Dubé and agree with the disposition of the
appeal proposed by them.  While I agree with many of the comments of
L'Heureux-Dubé J. with respect to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in
consent, in my view it is unnecessary and undesirable to attempt to
exhaustively define the constituents of the defence in this case.  As my
colleague properly observes in her reasons, it is a simpler task to delimit the
absence of an air of reality than to define in law its constituent components. 
The reason is that determining whether an air of reality exists involves an
examination of the evidence in each case to ascertain whether there is evidence
which, if accepted, would enable a properly instructed jury acting reasonably
to acquit.  Attempts to define in advance when such evidence will be present is
a hazardous, and in most cases fruitless, task.  Accordingly, I prefer to
dispose of this case by stating briefly why such evidence does not exist in
this case.

 

58               The issue of the application of
this defence does not arise unless the jury finds that the actus reus
charged has been made out beyond a reasonable doubt.  In this case the actus
reus was sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent.  The jury
convicted the respondent and concluded, therefore, that there was no consent to
intercourse.  The appropriate question in this appeal is:  Was there some
evidence that the respondent honestly believed that the complainant consented
to intercourse?  The evidence of the complainant is of no assistance to the
respondent.  As for the evidence of the respondent, he testified that no
intercourse took place.  This is inconsistent with a belief in consent to
intercourse.  Although less stark, the respondent's position is comparable to
that of an accused who defends on the basis of mistaken identity.  Accordingly,
I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and
restore the conviction.

 

                   The reasons of
Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ. were delivered by

 

I.                 Iacobucci
J. -- In my view, the trial judge did not err in withholding from the
jury the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent because he was
entitled to conclude that there was, in all the circumstances of the case, no
air of reality to the defence.  In this respect, it is noteworthy that the
respondent testified that no sexual intercourse had taken place between him and
the complainant.  However, a report from the medical examination of the
complainant was admitted into evidence as part of an agreed statement of facts,
and although the report indicated no physical injury, it noted the presence of
redness on the inner labia which was consistent with either consensual or
non-consensual intercourse.  This was a material discrepancy between what the
complainant and accused said had occurred going to the credibility of the
accused's version of what happened and ultimately to the air of reality issue. 
In effect, the accused denied that any intercourse occurred but alternately
argues that if it did occur, he thought there was consent.  Under these
circumstances, it makes no sense to apply the air of reality defence to such an
inconsistent position.

 

II.                I am also of the view that the
trial judge committed no error in ruling that evidence of previous sexual
activity was inadmissible.  Accordingly, I would dispose of the appeal in the
manner proposed by L'Heureux-Dubé J.

nova scotia

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Sexual assault ‑‑ Evidence ‑‑ Admissibility ‑‑
Statements making reference, some only incidentally, to previous sexual
activity ‑‑‑ Counsel wishing to cross‑examine on
inconsistent statements made to police and on preliminary hearing to test
credibility ‑‑ Whether or not Criminal Code (s. 276) bar to

                   The appellant and a
friend were both charged with sexually assaulting the complainant.  They were
tried separately.  The appellant was convicted at trial and the conviction was
upheld by the Court of Appeal.  The appellant then appealed, as of right, on
the basis that the trial judge had erred in excluding, pursuant to s. 276  of
the Criminal Code , certain prior inconsistent statements made by the complainant. 
Credibility was a major issue:  the complainant testified that both men had
attacked her and forced her to engage in non‑consensual sexual acts and
the appellant testified that she had consented throughout.  The defence theory
was that the complainant had fabricated the allegation of sexual assault
against the appellant and the other accused after she was confronted by her
parents about her sexual activity.  The defence sought permission from the
trial judge to lead evidence or cross‑examine the complainant on four
different statements that were alleged to be inconsistent with earlier
statements, all of which referred in some way to sexual activity other than
that which formed the subject matter of the charge and thereby triggered
s. 276  scrutiny.  The trial judge allowed evidence to be led on one of the
four statements, and excluded the other three.  In the first excluded
statement, the complainant indicated that she had visited the appellant on the
day of the alleged sexual assault with the intention of having sexual
intercourse with him.  This statement was inconsistent with the complainant's
testimony at trial and at the preliminary hearing.  It was ruled inadmissible
because it included an incidental police reference to an earlier sexual encounter
between the complainant and the appellant.  In the second excluded statement,
the complainant described unwanted sexual touching by the other accused a few
hours prior to the alleged sexual assault.  There was minor inconsistency
between this description and her description of these events at the preliminary
hearing.  Finally, in the third excluded statement, the complainant supposedly
told the appellant and the other accused, after the alleged sexual assault,
that she had engaged in group sex on prior occasions.  The defence of honest
but mistaken belief in consent was not raised and the constitutionality of
s. 276 of the Code was not challenged.  The only issue here was
with regard to the proper application of this provision.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ.:  The trial judge erred in excluding the first
statement.  The material inconsistency between this statement and the
complainant's later testimony raised questions as to the complainant's
credibility.  Excluding this statement denied defence counsel the opportunity
to cross‑examine the complainant on this material inconsistency. 
Ordinarily, nothing would prevent such a cross‑examination.  In this
case, however, the material inconsistency was inextricably linked to a police
reference to an earlier consensual sexual contact between the complainant and
the appellant.  The trial judge, in invoking s. 276 , therefore excluded
otherwise admissible evidence (the complainant's prior statement as to her
original intention in going to appellant's house) by piggybacking it atop
otherwise prima facie inadmissible evidence (the evidence of the
unrelated sexual activity).  It would be unfair for an accused person to be
denied access to evidence which is otherwise admissible and relevant to that
person's defence if the prejudice related to admitting that evidence is
uniquely attributable to the authorities' conduct.  Section 276  was never
designed or intended to be employed to prevent cross‑examination in such
a situation.

 

                   Section 276  cannot
be interpreted so as to deprive a person of a fair defence.  This does not
mean, however, that the accused is entitled to the most beneficial procedures
possible.  Rather, judges must undertake a balancing exercise under s. 276  that
is sensitive to many differing and potentially conflicting interests.  In the
present case, consideration of these factors favoured admission of the first
excluded statement.  Under the circumstances, the judge should have admitted
the prior statement on the basis that it had significant probative value on the
issue of credibility which was not substantially outweighed by the danger of
prejudice to the proper administration of justice.  In order to minimize any
possible prejudice to the fairness of the trial, however, the admission of this
evidence should be accompanied by a clear warning to the jury that the only
significance of this evidence is in relation to the effect of the inconsistent
statements on the complainant's credibility.

 

                   The evidence of
sexual conduct unrelated to the subject matter of the charge was not relevant
to the issue of ""motive to fabricate"" on the part of the
complainant.  This evidence was not shown to be probative of that defence.

 

                   The trial judge did
not err in excluding the second excluded statement.  The purported
inconsistency relating to the complainant's description of unwanted sexual
touching by the other accused did not relate in any way to the activity forming
the subject matter of the charge.  Moreover, this inconsistency was so minor
and so ancillary as to fail to be capable of undermining the complainant's
credibility in any meaningful way.  The impugned evidence did not have
significant probative value of any issue that was relevant at trial, as
required by s. 276(2) of the Code.

 

                   The third statement
was also properly excluded.  The defence maintained that it was indicative of
the complainant's state of mind after the sexual activity and therefore
probative of the fact that she had actually consented.  The appellant, however,
had ample opportunity to testify as to the complainant's conduct after the
alleged assault.  Introduction of this alleged statement, which the complainant
denied making, did not add significantly to the relevant issue sought to be
advanced by the defence at trial and, even if it did, its probative value was,
under the circumstances, substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to
the accused.

 

                   This was not an
appropriate case to apply the curative provision of the Criminal Code 
(s. 686(1) (b)(iii)).

 

                   Per Sopinka, Iacobucci and Major JJ.: 
The complainant's statement about previous experience with group sex (the third
statement) should be admitted.  The decision to exclude this evidence precluded
not only cross-examination on the statement but also the evidence of the
accused with respect to it.  Although consent cannot be given ex post facto,
a statement made ex post facto that there was consent or from which this
can be inferred is highly relevant.  This proposed evidence, if accepted by the
jury, was capable of supporting the interpretation advanced by counsel for the
accused.  A reference by the complainant immediately after group sex (allegedly
non-consensual) to a previous experience with consensual group sex strongly
implies that the complainant is equating the two episodes and that they were
both consensual.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ. was delivered by

 

1                 L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- On November 4, 1991, the accused, Scott Crosby, and his friend,
John Rines, allegedly sexually assaulted the complainant, L.R.  Crosby appeals,
as of right, to this Court on the basis that the trial judge erred in
excluding, pursuant to s. 276  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 , certain prior inconsistent statements made by the complainant.  This
Court allowed the accused's appeal from the bench, with reasons to follow.

 

2                 It should be noted at the outset
that this case does not involve any challenge to the constitutionality of s.
276 of the Code.  The only issue is with regard to the proper
application of this provision, which reads as follows:

 

                   276. (1) In proceedings in respect of an
offence under section 151, 152, 153, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3) or
section 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272 or 273, evidence that the complainant has
engaged in sexual activity, whether with the accused or with any other person,
is not admissible to support an inference that, by reason of the sexual nature
of that activity, the complainant

 

(a)               is
more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the
subject-matter of the charge; or

 

(b)is
less worthy of belief.

 

                   (2)   In
proceedings in respect of an offence referred to in subsection (1), no
evidence shall be adduced by or on behalf of the accused that the complainant
has engaged in sexual activity other than the sexual activity that forms the
subject-matter of the charge, whether with the accused or with any other
person, unless the judge, provincial court judge or justice determines, in
accordance with the procedures set out in sections 276.1 and 276.2, that the
evidence

 

(a)is
of specific instances of sexual activity;

 

(b)is
relevant to an issue at trial; and

 

(c)               has
significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger
of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.

 

 

                   (3)   In
determining whether evidence is admissible under subsection (2), the judge,
provincial court judge or justice shall take into account

 

(a)               the
interests of justice, including the right of the accused to make a full answer
and defence;

 

(b)               society's
interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual assault offences;

 

(c)               whether
there is a reasonable prospect that the evidence will assist in arriving at a
just determination in the case;

 

(d)               the
need to remove from the fact-finding process any discriminatory belief or bias;

 

(e)               the
risk that the evidence may unduly arouse sentiments of prejudice, sympathy or
hostility in the jury;

 

(f)                the
potential prejudice to the complainant's personal dignity and right of privacy;

 

(g)               the
right of the complainant and of every individual to personal security and to
the full protection and benefit of the law; and

 

(h)               any
other factor that the judge, provincial court judge or justice considers
relevant. [Emphasis added.]

 

I.  Facts and Judgments

 

3                 The facts and judgments relevant
to this appeal may be briefly summarized.  Crosby and Rines were tried
separately.  At Crosby's trial, which is the subject matter of this appeal, the
complainant testified that she had been attacked by both men and forced to
engage in non-consensual sexual acts with both.  By contrast, Crosby testified
that the complainant had consented throughout.  The defence theory was that the
complainant had fabricated the allegation of sexual assault against Crosby and
Rines after she was confronted by her parents about her sexual activities. 
This theory was supported by the fact that the complainant only reported the
sexual assault to police after her brother heard rumours of her sexual
activities with Crosby and reported them to her parents, who then confronted
her about them.  The defence submitted that the complainant made up the story
that she had been sexually assaulted because she was too embarrassed and
ashamed to admit that she consented to sexual activities with two men.  The
defence did not raise at trial the defence of honest but mistaken belief in
consent.

 

4                 In a voir dire before the
commencement of the trial, the defence sought permission from the trial judge
to lead evidence or cross-examine the complainant on four different statements,
all of which referred in some way to sexual activity other than that which
formed the subject matter of the charge, and which thereby triggered s. 276 
scrutiny.  The trial judge allowed evidence to be led on one of the four statements,
and excluded the other three.  Crosby was convicted of sexual assault.

 

5                 Crosby appealed to the Nova
Scotia Court of Appeal on the basis that the trial judge erred in excluding the
evidence of the other three statements.  The majority of that court upheld his
conviction ((1994), 130 N.S.R. (2d) 61).  Hallett J.A., dissenting, would have
ordered a new trial on the basis that two of the three excluded statements
regarding unrelated sexual conduct were relevant because they tended to prove a
motive to fabricate.  Crosby appeals as of right to this Court.

 

II.  Analysis

 

(i) The First Statement

 

6                 In her original statement to
police, the complainant admitted to having engaged in consensual sexual
intercourse with Crosby on November 1, 1991, three days before the alleged
assault.  She also admitted that when she visited Crosby on November 4, she did
so with the intention of having sexual intercourse with him again:

 

Q:Had
you had sex with Scott before?

 

A:The
Friday night before I did.

 

Q:Is
that the reason you went there on Monday?

 

A:Yup.

 

Q:Why
did you change your mind?

 

A:Because
I didn't feel right with John there and I didn't want to have sex with him. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

By contrast, at the preliminary
hearing, the complainant testified that she did not visit Crosby on November 4,
1991 with the intention of having sex with him:

 

Q:O.K.
were you hoping to have sex with Scott again that night?

 

                   A:No.

 

There was an apparent inconsistency
between these two statements.  

 

7                 Ordinarily, nothing would
prevent defence counsel from cross-examining the complainant on an
inconsistency which related to her intentions in going to the accused's house
on the day of the alleged assault.  Material inconsistencies are relevant to
the complainant's credibility.  Unfortunately for the accused in this case,
however, the material inconsistency was inextricably linked in the police
questioning to a reference to the earlier, consensual sexual contact between
the complainant and the accused.  Defence counsel (and apparently the trial
judge) thought that it was necessary to place into evidence the actual excerpts
from the interview between the complainant and the police.

 

8                 This created a dilemma.  If the
actual questions and answers were placed before the jury, then the jury would
also have been alerted to the prior sexual activity between the complainant and
Crosby on November 1.  Relying upon s. 276 of the Code, the trial judge
therefore prohibited defence counsel from cross-examining the complainant on
this entire portion of her original statement made to police.  When the
complainant was cross-examined at trial, the following exchange occurred
between defence counsel and the complainant:

 

                   Q:Now
when you went to Mr. Crosby's home on November 7th, did you want to have sex
with Mr. Crosby?

 

A:November
7th?

 

Q:Or
sorry, November 4th, the day this happened with you and Rines...

 

A:No.

 

Q:You
didn't?

 

A:No.

 

 

As a result of the s. 276  ruling,
counsel for the appellant was precluded from pursuing this inconsistency
between the complainant's trial testimony and her original statement to the
police.

 

9                 With respect, the trial judge
erred in excluding this statement, and therefore in preventing defence counsel
from cross-examining the complainant on this material inconsistency in her
statements.

 

10               Where the defence of honest but
mistaken belief is not realistically advanced by the accused at trial, then
evidence of prior, unrelated sexual activity between the complainant and the
accused will seldom be relevant to an issue at trial.  See R. v. Dickson
(1993), 81 C.C.C. (3d) 224 (Y.T.C.A), aff'd [1994] 1 S.C.R. 153.  However,
although the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent was not
realistically at issue in the present case, the circumstances were nonetheless
somewhat exceptional.  In particular, it appears from the transcripts that the
only reason the unrelated sexual activity of November 1 was at all implicated
was because it was directly referred to by police while posing a
question which did, indeed, bear on the sexual activity which formed the
subject matter of the charge.  The effect of the trial judge's invocation of s.
276  in this case was therefore to exclude otherwise admissible evidence (the
complainant's prior statement as to her original intention in going to Crosby's
house) by piggybacking it atop otherwise prima facie inadmissible
evidence (the evidence of the unrelated sexual activity).  In my view, it would
be unfair for an accused person to be denied access to evidence which is
otherwise admissible and relevant to his defence if the prejudice related to
admitting that evidence is uniquely attributable to the authorities' conduct. 
I do not believe that s. 276  was ever designed or intended to be employed to
prevent cross-examination in a situation such as this.

 

11               The following remarks by McLachlin
J. in R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at pp. 620-21, are highly
pertinent to the interpretation and application of the present version of s.
276 of the Code, which that case inspired:

 

Accepting
that the rejection of relevant evidence may sometimes be justified for policy
reasons, the fact remains that [former] s. 276  may operate to exclude evidence
where the very policy which imbues the section--finding the truth and arriving
at the correct verdict--suggests the evidence should be received.  Given the
primacy in our system of justice of the principle that the innocent should not
be convicted, the right to present one's case should not be curtailed in the
absence of an assurance that the curtailment is clearly justified by even stronger
contrary considerations.  What is required is a law which protects the
fundamental right to a fair trial while avoiding the illegitimate inferences
from other sexual conduct that the complainant is more likely to have consented
to the act or less likely to be telling the truth. [Emphasis added.]

 

Section 276  cannot be interpreted so
as to deprive a person of a fair defence.  This is not its purpose.  This does
not mean, of course, that the accused is entitled to the most beneficial
procedures possible:  R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 362.  Rather,
it is evident from the majority's remarks in Seaboyer and from the
criteria enumerated in s. 276(3) that judges must undertake a balancing
exercise under s. 276  that is sensitive to many differing, and potentially
conflicting, interests.

 

12               In the present case, however,
consideration of those factors favoured admission of the complainant's earlier
statement.  The versions told by the complainant and the accused were
diametrically opposed in every material respect, and credibility was
consequently the central issue at trial.  An inconsistency on a material and
pertinent issue is highly relevant in such circumstances.  The interests of
justice, including the right of the accused to make full answer and defence,
therefore militated in favour of admitting the evidence (s. 276(3)(a)). 
So, too, did the fact that there was a reasonable prospect that the evidence
would have assisted the jury in arriving at a just determination in the case
(s. 276(3)(c)).

 

13               Moreover, under the circumstances,
I do not believe that, if the jury had been apprised of the November 1
incident, this would have unduly aroused in them sentiments of prejudice or
hostility toward the complainant (s. 276(3)(e)), nor unduly injected
into the fact-finding process any discriminatory belief or bias which could not
reasonably be mitigated by a cautionary instruction to the jury (s. 276(3)(d)). 
It is equally significant that, on the scale of potential prejudices to the
complainant's personal dignity and right of privacy (s. 276(3)(f)),
admission of this particular instance of prior sexual activity was far less
prejudicial than could be contemplated in many other circumstances.  Finally,
the ""other factors"" mentioned in s. 276(3)(h) require
consideration of the fact that it would be unfair for the Crown, by virtue of
conduct over which the accused had no control, to render inadmissible certain
evidence that would otherwise have been admissible and relevant to the defence
of the accused.

 

14               As such, under the circumstances,
the judge should have admitted the prior statement on the basis that it had
significant probative value on the issue of credibility which was not
substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper
administration of justice.  In order to minimize any possible prejudice to the
fairness of the trial, however, the admission of this evidence should, of
course, be accompanied by a clear warning to the jury that the only
significance of this evidence is in relation to the effect of the inconsistent
statements on the complainant's credibility.  The jury must not infer from the
unrelated sexual act that the complainant was therefore more likely to have
consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject matter of the charge,
or that she is therefore less worthy of belief.

 

15               This being said, I must
respectfully disagree with Hallett J.A. that the evidence of sexual conduct
unrelated to the subject matter of this charge was relevant to the issue of
""motive to fabricate"".  Although ""motive to fabricate"" was,
indeed, the defence's theory, I do not see how evidence about the nature and
frequency of sex, either with the accused or with other persons, would advance
the ""motive to fabricate"" defence except in the most unusual of
circumstances.  By way of illustration only, I would note that such
circumstances might arise in the context of a poisoned or acrimonious
relationship.  See, e.g.,  State v. Jalo, 557 P.2d 1359 (Oregon Ct.
App., 1976).

 

16               I do not see, however, how the
evidence of unrelated sexual activity related to ""motive to
fabricate"" in the present case.  The manner in which it is sought to be
used in this case simply suggests to the jury that the complainant is
""loose"" and therefore less worthy of belief.  This is one of the very
stereotypes that s. 276  is intended to address.  In Seaboyer, supra,
at p. 690, I addressed the ""Female under Surveillance"" myth in the
following terms:

 

                   Many
also argue that the provision does not allow evidence going to show motive to
fabricate or bias.  Clearly, most such alleged motives or bias will not be
grounded in the complainant's past sexual history.  Moreover, much of this
evidence depends for its relevance on certain stereotypical visions of women;
that they lie about sexual assault, and that women who allege sexual assault
often do so in order to get back in the good graces of those who may have her
sexual conduct under scrutiny.

 

Thus, although the defence's
fabrication theory may, in light of the other evidence, have had a factual
basis, the appellant did not show how the evidence of the unrelated sexual acts
was, itself, in any way probative of that defence.  In fact, if the evidence
had been used in that manner under these circumstances, it would have visited a
very substantial prejudice both upon the complainant and upon the
administration of justice.  It quite properly did not form the basis of the
trial judge's decision with respect to any of the contested statements.

 

(ii) The Second Statement

 

17               The defence sought to
cross-examine the complainant on an inconsistent statement in relation to
sexual touching (the extent of which is unclear) with Rines a few hours prior
to the alleged sexual assault on November 4.  The complainant had told police
that Rines had made some unwanted sexual overtures to her while Crosby was
away.  In relating these events, she had originally told police that Rines had
lain beside her while trying to feel her breasts.  By contrast, at the
preliminary hearing, she indicated that he had ""sort of"" lain down on
top of her.

 

18               The trial judge was correct in
excluding the evidence of this inconsistency.  The purported inconsistency did
not relate in any way to the activity which formed the subject matter of the
charge.  Moreover, even when viewed together with the other inconsistencies in
the complainant's testimony, it was so minor and so ancillary as to fail to be
capable of undermining in any meaningful way her credibility.  Furthermore, for
the reasons outlined above, evidence of the unwanted sexual touching also did
not relate in any way to a ""motive to fabricate"".  The impugned
evidence therefore did not have significant probative value of any issue that
was relevant at trial, as required by s. 276(2) of the Code.

 

(iii) The Third Statement

 

19               The defence sought to lead
evidence that after the alleged sexual assault, the complainant supposedly told
Crosby and Rines that she had engaged in group sex on prior occasions.  The
defence maintained that this statement was indicative of the complainant's
state of mind after the sexual activity, and therefore probative of the fact
that she had actually consented.  The complainant denied at all times having
said this.  In my view, the trial judge was quite correct in refusing to permit
the defence to lead any such evidence.  The accused had ample opportunity to
testify as to the complainant's conduct after the alleged assault. 
Introduction of this alleged statement did not add significantly to the
relevant issue sought to be advanced by the defence at trial and, even if it
did, its probative value was, under the circumstances, substantially outweighed
by the danger of prejudice to the administration of justice.

 

III.  Conclusion and Disposition

 

20               The Crown advances no s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
argument, and I must say that I do not think that this would be an appropriate
case in which to invoke that curative proviso.  Credibility was the key issue
in the trial.  Under the circumstances, I believe that there was a reasonable
possibility that the verdict would have been different had the accused been
permitted to cross-examine the complainant on this material inconsistency in
her statements.

 

21                      Accordingly, the appeal is
allowed and a new trial is ordered.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

                   The reasons of
Sopinka, Iacobucci and Major JJ. were delivered by

 

22               Sopinka
J. -- I agree with the reasons for judgment of Justice L'Heureux-Dubé
with respect to the first and second statements and with the disposition
proposed by her.  I would, however, also admit the third statement.  The
following are the relevant passages from the record with respect to this
statement:

 

                   Mr.
Murphy [counsel
for the accused]  With respect to the statement that she made, that she had
multiple partners, she made this statement while she was in the presence of the
accused, I guess at the very time or during or after the sexual contact.  If it
is true that she made that statement, I believe that's for the jury to
determine.  Then it is certainly relevant with respect to actual consent, so if
they had a sexual encounter and she stated __ and they asked her
whether she had had sex with multiple partners before and she said, yes I had,
then she's practically __ she's giving consent or indicating her
consent.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   Mr.
Murphy  Uh, after
we finished having sex, or after the sex they had the conversation, they
questioned her and she indicated she had done it, so we're not attempting to
prove that it actually happened, simply the fact that she said it, I would
submit, goes to consent.  You wouldn't say that to someone who had just raped
you, that yes, I've done this before with other guys.  And we're not attempting
to introduce it to prove she had, in fact, done it, just that she said it,
'cause the very fact that she said it, well that goes to her __
indicates that she consented on the night in question, if the jury believes the
accused over the complainant.

 

23               The ruling on the voir dire
with respect to this statement was as follows:

 

                   The
Court  ... Any
statement made by the complainant, in my view, after the incident cannot be
considered to be consent.  Even if it were true, that is, even if it were true
that the complainant had made such a statement, such a statement cannot amount
to a post facto consent.  In my view this statement that is, with respect to
having had multiple partners before November 4th, 1991 has no probative value. 
Even if the contents of the statement were true, and perhaps even especially
so, it would have no probative value.  

 

This ruling precluded not only
cross-examination on the statement but also the evidence of the accused with
respect to it.

 

24               With respect, the trial judge
misapprehended the relevance of the evidence.  While it is true that consent
cannot be given ex post facto, a statement made ex post facto
that there was consent or from which this can be inferred is highly relevant. 
If the jury accepted the evidence proposed to be tendered, it was capable of
supporting the interpretation advanced by counsel for the accused.  A reference
by the complainant immediately after group sex (allegedly non-consensual) to a
previous experience with consensual group sex strongly implies that the
complainant is equating the two episodes and that they were both consensual.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
alberta

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Defences ‑‑ Insanity ‑‑ Delusions ‑‑ Murder
‑‑ Whether accused lacked capacity to distinguish right from wrong
at time of killing ‑‑ Meaning of phrase ""knowing that [the
act] was wrong"" in s. 16(1) of Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .

 

                   The accused killed,
without apparent motive, a friend who was sleeping in his apartment.  For a
number of years the accused had been suffering from a mental disorder described
as a psychosis of a paranoid delusional type and, at the time of the killing,
his paranoia was fixed on a belief that the members of a local union were
conspiring to ""destroy"" him.  On the night of the murder, he became
convinced that they had surrounded his apartment building with the intention of
killing him.  This delusion, combined with his belief that the victim was one
of the conspirators, persuaded him that he was obliged to kill the victim to
prevent her from killing him.

 

                   At his trial on a
charge of second degree murder, the accused raised the defence of insanity. 
Psychiatrists testified that the accused possessed the general capacity to
distinguish right from wrong and would know that to kill a person is wrong but
that, on the night of the murder, his delusion deprived him of that capacity
and led him to believe that killing was necessary and justified under the
circumstances as he perceived them.  The trial judge rejected the defence of
insanity, concluding that in view of the accused's general capacity to know
right from wrong, he was not relieved from criminal responsibility under
s. 16(1)  of the Criminal Code , notwithstanding his subjective
belief, at the time of the killing, that what he did was right and his
inability to apply his general knowledge of right and wrong.  The Court of
Appeal allowed the accused's appeal and ordered a new trial on the ground that
the trial judge had erred in his interpretation of s. 16(1) .

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Section 16(1)
of the Code embraces not only the intellectual ability to know right
from wrong in an abstract sense, but also the ability to apply that knowledge
in a rational way to the alleged criminal act.  Indeed, the section focuses on
the particular capacity of the accused to understand that his act was wrong at
the time of committing the act.  An accused should thus be exempted from
criminal liability where, at the time of the act, a mental disorder deprived him
of the capacity for rational perception and hence rational choice about the
rightness or wrongness of the act.  An accused need not establish that his
delusion permits him to raise a specific defence, such as self‑defence,
to be exempted from criminal responsibility.  The inability to make a rational
choice may result from a variety of mental disorders, including delusions which
cause an accused to perceive an act which is wrong as right or justifiable. 
Here, the evidence was capable of supporting a conclusion that the accused was
deprived of the capacity to know his act was wrong by the standards of the
ordinary person.

J. -- In the early
morning hours of March 24, 1991, Mathew Oommen killed Gina Lynn Beaton as she
lay sleeping on a mattress in his apartment by firing 9 to 13 shots at her from
a .22 calibre rimfire semi-automatic repeating rifle.  On February 26, 1992, he
was convicted of second degree murder before a judge alone and sentenced to
life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for ten years.  The Alberta
Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial on the ground
that the trial judge had erred in his interpretation of the insanity provision
of s. 16(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .  The
Crown appeals to this Court against that order, seeking reinstatement of the
conviction for murder.

 

The Evidence

 

            The evidence disclosed no
rational motive for the killing.  To understand it, we must delve into the
disordered workings of Mr. Oommen's mind.

 

            For a number of years Mr.
Oommen had been suffering from a mental disorder described as a psychosis of a
paranoid delusional type.  As a result, he harboured false and fixed beliefs
that he was the butt of conspiracies and situations that endangered him.  Mr.
Oommen's disorder had led to hospitalization in 1984, 1988 and in February of
1991, shortly before he killed Ms. Beaton.

 

            At the time of the
killing, Mr. Oommen's paranoia was fixed on a belief that the members of a
local union were conspiring to destroy him.  In November 1986, he had been struck
on the head and robbed while driving a taxi cab.  Mr. Oommen attributed this
incident to the fact that he had transported certain individuals during labour
disputes at one of the local plants.  His friends and doctors testified that he
became paranoid that there would be further attacks on his life.

 

            At this point, Gina Lynn
Beaton came into Mr. Oommen's life and tragically became part of his delusion. 
The two met prior to Christmas 1990.  Ms. Beaton needed a place to stay.  Mr.
Oommen let her stay in his apartment for a period of time, in return for some
cooking and cleaning.  Mr. Oommen sought the advice of both friends and a local
police officer as to the propriety of his sheltering Ms. Beaton.  He seemed to
be concerned that the relationship might be misapprehended as sexual.  After a
while, Ms. Beaton left the apartment and moved to Edmonton.  Shortly before her
death, she returned to Fort McMurray and Mr. Oommen's apartment.

 

            Mr. Oommen became fixated
with the notion that his assailants and enemies had incorporated Ms. Beaton and
commissioned her to kill him.  On the evening of the killing he became
convinced that members of the conspiracy had surrounded his apartment building with
the intention of moving in on him and killing him.  This delusion, combined
with his belief that Ms. Beaton was one of the conspirators, convinced him that
he was obliged to kill her to prevent her from killing him.  So he shot her
while she lay sleeping on the floor.

 

            It was established that
about the time of the killing, Mr. Oommen called a taxi dispatcher several
times to request the police.  It was also established that someone had rung the
buzzers or doorbells of all the apartments.  Mr. Oommen said that this was the
signal from the conspirators outside to Ms. Beaton to kill him.  A tenant,
awakened by the doorbell, saw Mr. Oommen outside the building twice soon
afterward, apparently putting liquor containers in the garbage.  Another
tenant, similarly awakened, went out into the hall and met Mr. Oommen, who
asked him to call the police because he had just killed someone who had come at
him with a knife.  When the police arrived Mr. Oommen told the officer, ""I
called the caretaker.  I shot and killed a girl inside.  She thought I was
sleeping.  She came with a knife.  I had no other choice, so I shot her,
okay.""  Mr. Oommen repeated this story to the lawyer a friend found for
him, Mr. George.  He explained that he had shot and killed the girl who had
been staying with him.  Mr. George asked why.  Mr. Oommen replied that she had
tried to come with a knife and kill him.  He said he saw something, a shiny
object, in her hand and ""[i]nstead [of her] killing me, I went and lowered
the gun and killed her"".

 

            Mr. Oommen repeated this
story at 5:27 a.m. in his statement to the police.  Constable Bazowski observed
that during the interview, Mr. Oommen vacillated between quiet and animated
behaviour.  Sometimes his voice would drop to a whisper; sometimes he would
pound his fist on the table to emphasize his points.  He seemed eager to offer
an explanation of what had happened.  He explained that he had seen the
deceased pass his bedroom door with a knife in her hand as she went to the
washroom on more than one occasion during the night.  He knew that she was
going to kill him, he thought on the instructions of others, and he
""opened fire"" on her as she lay pretending to be asleep.  He had no
choice or he would have been killed.  Constable Bazowski gained the impression
that Mr. Oommen believed the constable was investigating or ought to
investigate why the girl was trying to kill him.

 

            There was no question at
trial that Mr. Oommen had killed Ms. Beaton.  Nor was there much doubt that Mr.
Oommen's insane delusions provoked the killing.  As Dr. Trichard testified:

 

            He,
on that very night of the assault, was convinced that there were people outside
the building that had staked out the building and were coming to attack him. 
He had, in fact, heard the buzzers being rung throughout the building and had
incorporated this into his idea that he was being pursued.

 

            On
the night in question, he also became convinced that his assailants had
incorporated the unfortunate deceased and had given her the commission that she
was to kill him.  So that on that night, it was him alone with her in this
apartment, and it was either she was going to kill him, or he had to stop her. 
I believe that he was therefore acting under a delusion at the time that he
committed this offence.

 

            The only issue was whether
this delusion exempted Mr. Oommen from criminal responsibility under s. 16(1) 
of the Criminal Code  on the ground that he lacked the capacity at the
relevant time to know the difference between right and wrong.  Dr. Trichard
testified that a person suffering from this mental disorder would not lose the
intellectual capacity to understand right from wrong and would know that to
kill a person is wrong.  However, the person's delusions would affect the
person's interpretation of events so that the individual would honestly believe
killing to be justified under the circumstances.  In the abstract, the person
would know killing was wrong.  But his delusion would cause him to believe that
killing was justified under the circumstances as he perceived them.  In Crown
cross-examination Dr. Trichard stated:

 

Q.You
have a person suffering from the disease that you have described.  He kills
someone and does not believe he has done wrong, or does not at the time he is
doing the killing believe he is doing wrong.  In this disorder as opposed to
others, that cannot be because he thinks killing is not wrong in any abstract
sense, but because he has some particular delusion or belief, or maybe some
actual information -- maybe his killing really is justified in a particular
situation -- but he has some believe [sic] that justifies it to him?

 

A.I
believe that that would be so, yes.

 

And again:

 

Q.Dr.
Trichard, if you could address yourself then to the account you received of Mr.
Oommen's case and the killing that he did, it would be your belief that he, in
his own mind at the time of doing it, would, because of his delusions and his
fear, feel he was justified in doing what he was doing?

 

A.Yes,
I do believe that.

 

            In other words, Mr. Oommen
possessed the general capacity to distinguish right from wrong.  However, on
the night of the killing, his delusions deprived him of the capacity to know
that killing Ms. Beaton was wrong.  On the contrary, those delusions led him to
believe that killing was necessary and justified.

 

Statutory Provisions

 

            Section 16(1)  of the Criminal
Code  (as amended by S.C. 1991, c. 43, s. 2) reads as follows:

 

            16. (1)  No person is
criminally responsible for an act committed or an omission made while suffering
from a mental disorder that rendered the person incapable of appreciating the
nature and quality of the act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.

 

            The above version of s.
16(1)  came into force on February 4, 1992.  Prior to that, s. 16  of the Criminal
Code  provided:

 

            16. (1)  No person shall be
convicted of an offence in respect of an act or omission on his part while that
person was insane.

 

            (2)  For
the purposes of this section, a person is insane when the person is in a state
of natural imbecility or has disease of the mind to an extent that renders the
person incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission
or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.

 

            (3)  A
person who has specific delusions, but is in other respects sane, shall not be
acquitted on the ground of insanity unless the delusions caused that person to
believe in the existence of a state of things that, if it existed, would have
justified or excused the act or omission of that person.

 

            Section 16  was amended
following the judgment of this Court in R. v. Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
1303, in which the majority of the Court held that the former s. 16(3) was
redundant.

 

Judgments

 

Trial

 

            The trial judge found that
the accused was acting under the influence of a paranoid delusion at the time
of the killing and that this was the cause of the killing: ""When I
consider what caused the murder, I find that I have very little doubt that it
was caused and, indeed, compelled by the mental disorder suffered by [Mr.
Oommen] and described by the psychiatrists as psychosis of a delusional
paranoid type.""  The trial judge found that on a balance of probabilities
Mr. Oommen ""was capable of knowing that what he was doing was wrong
according to moral standards of society....  [H]e was capable of knowing that
society in general would regard it as wrong.""

 

            Despite this general
capacity to distinguish right from wrong, the trial judge found as a fact that
""subjectively the accused did not believe his act was wrong"". 
Whether because of this subjective belief in the rightness of his act or
confusion engendered by the delusion, the trial judge found that Mr. Oommen was
unable to apply his general ability to distinguish right from wrong to the act
of killing Ms. Beaton:  ""I must say that I'm certain that the fact of that
knowledge could not have in any way assisted the accused in refraining from
committing the act because in his own mind he believed he had no choice to do
anything but what he did.""  The trial judge concluded that in view of the
accused's general capacity to know right from wrong, he was not relieved from
criminal responsibility under s. 16(1) , notwithstanding his subjective belief
that what he did was right and his inability to apply his general knowledge of
right and wrong.

 

Court of Appeal (1993), 21 C.R. (4th) 117

 

            Kerans J.A. (Fraser C.J.A.
concurring) reviewed recent judgments and changes in the Criminal Code 
regarding insanity.  He interpreted the decision of this Court in Chaulk
to stand for the proposition that the former s. 16(3) of the Code was
""superfluous"", not that the defence stated therein is unavailable. 
In his view, s. 16(1) of the Code obliged the trial judge to direct his
mind to the question of whether Mr. Oommen, despite no proven incapacity to
understand societal views about right and wrong, lacked the capacity, because
of his disease and the resulting delusions, to apply that knowledge in any
meaningful way at the time of the killing.  The majority reasoned that if Mr.
Oommen could be said to have feared for his life at the time of the murder,
then the act of killing, from his point of view, would not be wrong, with the
result that he would be found not to be capable of distinguishing right from
wrong within s. 16(1) .  While it was the notion of self-defence that made the
act justifiable in the killer's mind,  the inquiry, according to Kerans J.A.,
was not a matter of applying the defence of self-defence, but rather a
personalized inquiry under insanity law.  He concluded (at pp. 125‑26):

 

I
conclude that s. 16(1)  must, to make sense, ordain a necessary degree of
personalization of the rules for those who can show, on a balance of
probabilities, that they suffer from insane delusions.  The question, then, is
whether, assuming the delusions to be true, would a reasonable person see a
threat to life and a need for death-threatening force?

 

A new trial was directed on the ground
that the trial judge had failed to direct his mind to the delusions Mr. Oommen
was under and their effect on whether he was capable, given those delusions, of
knowing that the killing was wrong.

 

            Côté J.A. concurred in the
result on the ground that the trial judge had failed to consider vital
matters.  However, in his view the phrase ""knowing that it was wrong""
in s. 16(1)  applies only to mistake or delusion of a moral or legal nature
and does not extend to mistakes or delusions of a purely factual nature.  So if
the only delusion was that his life was being threatened, he would be
criminally responsible notwithstanding his mental disorder.

 

Analysis

 

The Legal Question

 

            Section 16(1)  affirms that
a person who lacks the capacity to know that the act he is committing is wrong
is exempt from criminal responsibility.

 

            This appeal poses the
following legal issue.  What is meant by the phrase ""knowing that [the
act] was wrong"" in s. 16(1) ?  Does it refer only to abstract knowledge
that the act of killing would be viewed as wrong by society?  Or does it extend
to the inability to rationally apply knowledge of right and wrong and hence to
conclude that the act in question is one which one ought not to do?

 

            A review of the history of
our insanity provision and the cases indicates that the inquiry focuses not on
general capacity to know right from wrong, but rather on the ability to know
that a particular act was wrong in the circumstances.  The accused must possess
the intellectual ability to know right from wrong in an abstract sense.  But he
or she must also possess the ability to apply that knowledge in a rational way
to the alleged criminal act.

 

            The wording of s. 16(1) 
suggests this result.  It proclaims that the focus is not a general capacity to
understand that the act, say of killing, is wrong, but rather the act
""committed"" or omission ""made"", i.e. the particular act or
omission at issue in the criminal proceedings.

 

            The history of s. 16(1) 
confirms this.  The provision finds its origin in the ""M'Naghten
Rules"":  M'Naghten's Case (1843), 10 Cl. & Fin. 200, 8 E.R.
718.  The House of Lords put the following questions, inter alia, to the
judges (at p. 720):

 

            2d.  What
are the proper questions to be submitted to the jury, where a person alleged to
be afflicted with insane delusion respecting one or more particular subjects or
persons, is charged with the commission of a crime (murder, for example), and
insanity is set up as a defence?

 

            3d.  In
what terms ought the question to be left to the jury, as to the prisoner's
state of mind at the time when the act was committed?

 

            Lord Chief Justice Tindal
replied (at p. 722) that the judges thought that these two questions could be
answered together:

 

[W]e
have to submit our opinion to be, that the jurors ought to be told in all cases
that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree
of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to
their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity,
it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act,
the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease
of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or,
if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

Both the question and answer
demonstrate that the rule focuses not on a general capacity to understand right
and wrong in some abstract sense, but on the particular capacity of the accused
to understand that his or her act was wrong at the time of committing the
act.  Lord Chief Justice Tindal added an explanation of the word
""wrong"" (at p. 723):

 

If
the accused was conscious that the act was one which he ought not to do, and if
that act was at the same time contrary to the law of the land, he is
punishable; and the usual course therefore has been to leave the question to
the jury, whether the party accused had a sufficient degree of reason to
know that he was doing an act that was wrong....  [Emphasis added.]

 

Tollefson and Starkman, Mental
Disorder in Criminal Proceedings (1993), at p. 30, suggest that what the
judges were saying was this:

 

We
agree with you that the meaning to be conveyed to the jury is that the
exemption is based on whether the accused is capable of knowing that the act
was contrary to the law.  But for practical reasons, the jury cannot be told
that in so many words.  We therefore use the word `wrong', and make it as
clear as possible that the jurors must view the act in the context of the
specific charge and not in some general sense.  [Emphasis added.]

 

            In Chaulk, supra,
this Court affirmed that the focus must be on capacity to know that the act
committed was wrong, and not merely on a general capacity to distinguish right
from wrong.  Lamer C.J., writing for the majority, stated (at p. 1354):

 

The
principal issue in this regard is the capacity of the accused person to
know that a particular act or omission is wrong.  As such, to ask simply what
is the meaning of the word ""wrong"" for the purposes of s. 16(2) is to
frame the question too narrowly.  To paraphrase the words of the House of Lords
in M'Naghten's Case, the courts must determine in any particular case whether
an accused was rendered incapable, by the fact of his mental disorder, of
knowing that the act committed was one that he ought not have done. 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

            The crux of the inquiry is
whether the accused lacks the capacity to rationally decide whether the act is
right or wrong and hence to make a rational choice about whether to do it or
not.  The inability to make a rational choice may result from a variety of
mental disfunctions; as the following passages indicate these include at a
minimum the states to which the psychiatrists testified in this case --
delusions which make the accused perceive an act which is wrong as right or
justifiable, and a disordered condition of the mind which deprives the accused
of the ability to rationally evaluate what he is doing.

 

            In R. v. Porter
(1933), 55 C.L.R. 182 (H.C. Aust.), at pp. 189-90, Dixon J. charged a jury
in the following oft-cited manner:

 

The
question is whether [the accused] was able to appreciate the wrongness of the
particular act he was doing at the particular time.  Could this man be said to
know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or
disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to
ordinary people make that act right or wrong?  If through the disordered
condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate
degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what
he was doing was wrong....  What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard
to the everyday standards of reasonable people.  [Emphasis added.]

 

            In Stapleton v. The
Queen (1952), 86 C.L.R. 358, at p. 367, the High Court of Australia
concluded:

 

...
it is enough if [the disease, disorder, or defect of reason] so governed the
faculties at the time of the commission of the act that the accused was
incapable of reasoning with some moderate degree of calmness as to the
wrongness of the act or of comprehending the nature or significance of the act
of killing.

 

            G. Arthur Martin, Q.C.
(later Martin J.A.), put it this way in ""Insanity as a Defence""
(1965-66), 8 Crim. L.Q. 240, at p. 246:

 

            In
considering whether an accused was, by reason of insanity, incapable of knowing
the nature and quality of the act committed by him, or that it was wrong, the
legally relevant time is the time when the act was committed.  The accused may
by a process of reconstruction after committing some harmful act realize that
he has committed the act and know that it was wrong.  That is not inconsistent
with an inability to appreciate the nature and quality of the act or to know
that it was wrong at the moment of committing it.

 

            A
person may have adequate intelligence to know that the commission of a certain
act, e.g., murder, is wrong but at the time of the commission of the act
in question he may be so obsessed with delusions or subject to impulses which
are the product of insanity that he is incapable of bringing his mind to bear
on what he is doing and the considerations which to normal people would make
the act right or wrong.  In such a situation the accused should be exempt
from criminal liability.  [Emphasis added.]

 

            It was suggested that Mr.
Oommen could be exempted from criminal responsibility only if he could make out
the defence of self-defence.  I do not agree. There is no suggestion in the
authorities that the accused must establish that his delusion permits him to
raise a specific defence, such as self-defence.  The issue is whether the
accused possessed the capacity present in the ordinary person to know that the
act in question was wrong having regard to the everyday standards of the
ordinary person.  It is not necessary additionally to show that the defence of
self-defence would also apply.  Indeed, to posit such a requirement is to
require the defence to prove two logically inconsistent propositions: first,
that the accused was by reason of mental disorder unable to make the choice
which a reasonable person would make; and second, that the accused acted
reasonably in repelling an imminent attack.  The difficulty is avoided,
however, when it is recognized that s. 16  is not merely a vehicle for bringing
particular defences before the court; it is an independent condition of criminal
responsibility, as this Court affirmed in Chaulk and as the wording of
the amended section makes clear.  It may be that the nature of the delusion is
to create a subjective impression in the accused's mind that he must defend
himself or himself be killed, akin to that present when the defence of
self-defence is raised, but that is incidental.  Thus the question is not
whether, assuming the delusions to be true, a reasonable person would have seen
a threat to life and a need for death-threatening force.  Rather, the real
question is whether the accused should be exempted from criminal responsibility
because a mental disorder at the time of the act deprived him of the capacity
for rational perception and hence rational choice about the rightness or wrongness
of the act.

 

            It was also suggested that
to permit an exemption from criminal responsibility in this case would be to
open the door to exemption in cases of failure to exercise the will.  The law
has long distinguished between disorders affecting the ability to recognize
what is wrong, and the will to act or refrain from acting (although at the time
of M'Naghten's Case the distinction may not have been as clear as we are
wont to think:  see Tollefson and Starkman, supra, at p. 39).  Moreover,
the wording of s. 16(1)  suggests a cognitive test.  This said, it must be
recognized that impulse may be part of the mental mix which prevents a person
from rationally evaluating the wrongness of his act.  As Tollefson and Starkman
state at pp. 40-41:

 

            Section
16 of the Canadian Criminal Code employs a ""cognitive test""
and does not provide exemption from criminal responsibility for people who
claim that mental disorder rendered them incapable of controlling their
volition.  It has been recognized, however, that evidence of irresistible
impulse may be adduced as a symptom of disease of the mind which will be taken
into account by the jury in determining whether the accused was suffering from
mental disorder to the extent of being rendered incapable of exercising the
""cognitive"" functions of appreciating the nature and quality of the
act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.  See R. v. Wolfson
(1965), 51 D.L.R. (2d) 428 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Borg, [1969] S.C.R. 551,
per Hall J. at 570-71;  R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, at 38-39.

 

            Finally, it should be
noted that we are not here concerned with the psychopath or the person who
follows a personal and deviant code of right and wrong.  The accused in the
case at bar accepted society's views on right and wrong.  The suggestion is
that, accepting those views, he was unable because of his delusion to perceive
that his act of killing was wrong in the particular circumstances of the case. 
On the contrary, as the psychiatrists testified, he viewed it as right.  This
is different from the psychopath or person following a deviant moral code. 
Such a person is capable of knowing that his or her acts are wrong in the eyes
of society, and despite such knowledge, chooses to commit them.  To quote
Herbert Fingarette, The Meaning of Criminal Insanity (1972), at
pp. 200‑201:

 

            It
should be evident that we are not here reverting to the thesis that ""knew
it was wrong"" means ""judged it wrong in the light of his own
conscience."" ... [S]uch a definition could never be acceptable in a viable
criminal law.  As the courts have rightly insisted, it is a public standard of
wrong that must be used, whether public law or community morality.

 

            What
we are saying here is that ""knowing the nature and quality of the act or
that it is wrong"" in the context of insanity (and thus, rationality) means
""having the capacity to rationally assess -- define and evaluate -- his
own particular act in the light of the relevant public standards of
wrong""....

 

            The
preceding comments should not be taken to mean that a person is not responsible
if he holds irrational beliefs, for that is not the case....  The point is that
if the person has a mental makeup which is such that he lacks even the capacity
for rationality, then responsibility is vitiated.  If he has the capacity but
simply fails to use it, responsibility is not precluded.

 

Application of the Law
to this Appeal

 

            The evidence indicated
that the accused was suffering from a mental disorder causing paranoid delusion
at the time of the killing.  The trial judge found that this mental disorder
""compelled"" the killing.  The remaining question was whether the
disorder ""rendered [the accused] incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of the act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong"".

 

            The evidence was capable
of supporting an affirmative answer to the question of whether the accused was
deprived of the capacity to know his act was wrong.  First, there was evidence
that the accused honestly felt that he was under imminent danger of being
killed by Ms. Beaton if he did not kill her first, and that for this reason,
believed that the act of killing her was justified.  This delusion would have
deprived the accused of the ability to know that his act was wrong; in his
eyes, it was right.  Second (and this may be to say the same thing), there was
evidence capable of supporting the conclusion that the accused's mental state
was so disordered that he was unable to rationally consider whether his act was
right or wrong in the way a normal person would.

 

            The trial judge found that
while the accused was generally capable of knowing that the act of killing was
wrong, he could not apply that capacity for distinguishing right from wrong at
the time of the killing because of his mental disorder.  He further found that
because of that disorder, Mr. Oommen was deluded into believing that he had no
choice but to kill.  These findings are consistent with the conclusion that Mr.
Oommen's mental disorder deprived him of the capacity to know his act was wrong
by the standards of the ordinary person.  As the cases make clear  s. 16(1)  of
the Criminal Code  embraces not only the intellectual ability to know
right from wrong, but the capacity to apply that knowledge to the situation at
hand.

        A police officer observed the
accused going through a stop sign and began to follow him with the emergency
signals on the cruiser activated.  The accused accelerated, drove through two
more stop signs and then stopped at an apartment parking lot.  The officer, who
recognized him, saw the accused get out of his car and run toward the back door
of an apartment.  He yelled at him to stop running and come back, but the
accused entered the apartment.  The police officer called out through the door
but received no answer.  He identified himself as being a member of the RCMP
and, still receiving no answer, entered the apartment.  He found the accused in
bed and told him he was under arrest for failure to stop for a police officer. 
The accused repeatedly refused to follow the officer.  An altercation took
place, during which the officer could observe the usual signs of impairment. 
The accused was arrested.  He refused a demand for a breath sample and was
charged with impaired driving, failing to stop for a peace officer, failing to
submit to a breathalyser test and assaulting a peace officer with intent to
resist arrest.

 

        The trial judge held that the
officer's entry into the dwelling house in hot pursuit of a person suspected of
a breach of summary legislation contained in a provincial enactment, as opposed
to an indictable offence, was unlawful, and that the arrest of the person
within the premises was therefore also unlawful.  The resisting arrest charge
was accordingly dismissed.  As the evidence crucial to the impaired driving and
breathalyser charges was gathered during the unlawful arrest, the trial judge
refused to admit it on the basis that the administration of justice would be
brought into disrepute and the accused was acquitted on these charges as well. 
The summary conviction appeal judge upheld the acquittals.  The Court of Appeal
found that the right of arrest on private property was not limited to
indictable offences and that the arrest was therefore lawful.  It set aside the
acquittals and entered convictions.

 

        Held:  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

        It is well settled at common
law that police officers have the power to enter private premises to make an
arrest in hot pursuit.  This exception to the principle of sanctity of the home
can easily be justified.  It would be unacceptable for police officers who were
about to make a completely lawful arrest to be prevented from doing so merely
because the offender had taken refuge in his home or that of a third party. 
From a more practical standpoint, significant danger may be associated with the
flight of an offender and the pursuit that may result.  Further, in a case of
hot pursuit the police officer may have personal knowledge of the facts
justifying the arrest, which greatly reduces the risk of error.  Flight also
usually indicates some awareness of guilt on the part of the offender.  As
well, it may often be difficult to identify the offender without arresting him
on the spot.  Evidence of the offence leading to the pursuit or a related
offence may also be lost.  Finally, the offender may again flee or continue to
commit the offence and the police cannot be required to keep an indefinite
watch on the offender's residence in case he should decide to come out.  If an
arrest without a warrant is permissible at the outset, the offender's flight
into a dwelling house thus cannot make it unlawful.

 

        A right of entry to make an
arrest in hot pursuit exists at common law both for indictable offences and for
other types of offence, and there are strong policy considerations against
altering this rule.  Unlike the division which existed at common law between
felonies and misdemeanours, the division which currently exists in our law between
indictable offences and other categories of offence only very imperfectly
reflects the severity of the offence.  Most importantly, there is no logical
connection between the fact that an offence falls in one or other of these
categories and the need there may be to make an arrest in hot pursuit in
residential premises.  Even where there is no arrest warrant, there is thus in
a case of hot pursuit a right to enter residential premises to make an arrest
both for provincial offences and for indictable offences, provided the
circumstances justify an arrest without a warrant.  The entry by the police was
accordingly authorized in this case.

 

        The accused's rights under
ss. 7  and 9  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  have not
been infringed.  With respect to s. 9 , the police had reasonable grounds
to stop and detain the accused, and the detention was therefore not arbitrary. 
So far as s. 7  is concerned, even assuming that this provision implies
protection of a right to privacy, there can be no question of such a right
being infringed in this case.  A person who enters his house or that of someone
else to get away from the police who are pursuing him in connection with an
offence he has just committed and for which there is a power of arrest without
a warrant cannot expect his privacy to be protected in such circumstances so as
to prevent the police from making an arrest.

//Lamer C.J.//

 

        The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

 

        Lamer
C.J. -- This appeal again
raises the question of the territorial limits imposed on powers of arrest, this
time in the context of a provincial offence.  A peace officer entered a private
home to arrest the appellant for an offence under a provincial statute.  The
peace officer's authority to arrest the appellant without a warrant is not
disputed here.  The only question is whether the peace officer was authorized
to enter a dwelling house in order to arrest the appellant.

 

Facts

 

        At 3:45 a.m. on December 3,
1989, the appellant was observed by police going through a stop sign in the
small town of Spirit River, Alberta.  The police began to follow the appellant
with the emergency signals on the cruiser activated.  The appellant then
accelerated and drove through two more stop signs.  He stopped at an apartment
parking lot, where he was followed by police.  The police officer, who then
recognized the appellant, saw him rapidly getting out of his car and running
towards the back door of an apartment.  The policeman stepped out of his car
and screamed, ""Doug Macooh, stop running.  Get back here.  We'd like to
speak to you.""  The appellant entered the apartment.  The police officer
went to the back door of the apartment and called Doug Macooh inside the
apartment.  He received no answer.  He identified himself as being a member of
the RCMP and still receiving no answer, he entered the apartment.  From the
bedroom, the police officer heard a male voice whispering, ""Tell him that
I was here all night long with you"".  A woman answered, ""No,
Doug"".  The policeman proceeded into the bedroom and found the accused in
bed with Miss Kimberley Pack.  The appellant was told he was under arrest for
failure to stop for a police officer.  The appellant repeatedly refused to
follow the officer and also refused to get dressed.  As the police officer was
forcing the appellant to get dressed, an altercation took place, during which
the policeman could observe the usual signs of impairment.  The appellant was
arrested.  A demand for a breath sample was made and was refused.  The
appellant was charged with impaired driving, failing to stop for a peace
officer, failing to submit to a breathalyser test, and assaulting a peace
officer.

 

Judgments

 

Provincial Court (1990), 114 A.R. 314

 

        The trial judge held, at p.
315:

 

        I
am satisfied that the constable had the right to arrest the accused in the
circumstances of this case, pursuant to the provisions of s. 495  of the Criminal
Code .  The issue, however, is whether he had the right to enter the
dwelling house in question, uninvited, for the purpose of effecting the arrest
for a breach of a provincial statute.

 

He then turned to a consideration of R.
v. Landry, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 145, and held that the police constable's entry
""into the dwelling house in hot pursuit of a person suspected of a breach
of summary legislation contained in a provincial enactment, as opposed to an
indictable offence, was unlawful, and that the arrest of the person within the
premises was therefore also unlawful"" (p. 316).  Thus, the resisting
arrest charge was dismissed.  As the evidence crucial to the drinking and
driving related charges was gathered during the unlawful arrest, the trial
judge refused to admit it on the basis that the administration of justice would
be brought into disrepute.

 

Court of Queen's Bench

 

        The summary conviction appeal
judge agreed with the trial judge's interpretation of the effect of Landry,
and dismissed the appeal.

 

Court of Appeal (1991), 117 A.R. 312

 

        Irving J.A. for the court held
that the lower court judges had erred, at p. 313:

 

        The
Landry case does not limit the right of arrest on private property to
indictable offences as the courts below seem to have concluded.  Indeed, the
arresting constable in this case fully satisfied the requirements of the Landry
and the Eccles cases in effecting the arrest of the [appellant]. 
Counsel for the [appellant] very fairly conceded that the acquittals of his
client would have to be set aside and convictions entered if we have found the
arrest lawful as we do.

Analysis

 

(a)  Introduction

 

(i)Eccles
and Landry

 

        This appeal again raises the
question of the spatial limits imposed on powers of arrest, this time in the
context of a provincial offence.  Two judgments of this Court are particularly
relevant to this question, namely Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R.
739, and R. v. Landry, supra.

 

        In Eccles v. Bourque,
an action for damages for trespass was brought by the appellant against three
police officers who entered his apartment to apprehend a person against whom
there were outstanding warrants issued in another jurisdiction.  This Court had
to decide whether or not the police were authorized by law to commit a trespass
in such circumstances.  Dickson J. (as he then was) first noted that there
was nothing on the subject in the Criminal Code  and accordingly
concluded that if such authorization existed, it had to be found in the common
law.  Examining the common law, and in particular Semayne's Case (1604),
5 Co. Rep. 91 a, 77 E.R. 194, Dickson J. concluded that, though
fundamental, the principle of sanctity of the home set forth in that decision
had always been subject to certain exceptions, including the right to enter to
make an arrest.  He stated, at p. 743:

 

. .
.  there are occasions when the interest of a private individual in the
security of his house must yield to the public interest, when the public at
large has an interest in the process to be executed.  The criminal is not
immune from arrest in his own home nor in the home of one of his friends.  So
it is that in Semayne's Case a limitation was put on the
""castle"" concept and the Court resolved that:

 

        In
all cases when the King is party, the Sheriff (if the doors be not open) may
break the party's house, either to arrest him, or to do other execution of the
K.'s process, if otherwise he cannot enter.  But before he breaks it, he ought
to signify the cause of his coming, and to make request to open doors
. . .

 

See
also, a century later, to the same effect, Hale, Pleas of the Crown
(1736), 582; Foster, Crown Law (1762), 320.  Thus it will be seen that
the broad basic principle of sanctity of the home is subject to the exception
that upon proper demand the officials of the King may break down doors to arrest.

 

        Dickson J. noted,
however, at p. 744, that this was not an unrestricted right to enter, as
the right was subject to certain conditions:

 

Entry
can be made against the will of the householder only if (a) there
are reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is
within the premises and (b) proper announcement is made prior to
entry.

 

        In R. v. Landry, this
Court had to decide whether the power to enter private premises also existed in
connection with an arrest without a warrant under s. 450(1)(a) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 495(1) (a)).  That
paragraph provides for a power to make an arrest without a warrant in the case
of an indictable offence.  Dickson C.J. (Chouinard, Lamer and
Wilson JJ. concurring) first noted that as the authority to enter is not
provided for in the Criminal Code , it had to be found in the common
law.  Examining the common law, he held that neither Semayne's Case nor Eccles
v. Bourque indicated that the power to enter by force to make an arrest had
to be limited to cases where a warrant had been issued.  He added that there
were policy reasons for not imposing on the police the requirement that they
obtain a warrant to make an arrest in residential premises.  He stated, at
pp. 160‑61:

 

        There
is, moreover, good reason to stand by these authorities in lieu of adopting a
new rule requiring the police to obtain an arrest warrant in order to make an
arrest in residential premises.  Crime is often committed adjacent to
residential premises.  When a police officer witnesses a crime or appears on
the scene shortly thereafter, his ability to apprehend the offender should not
be capable of being foiled by an offender ducking into a nearby house or
apartment building.  Our society is more urban, more mobile, and more anonymous
than ever before.  If a police officer is forced to obtain an arrest warrant
before entering a residence, he will have to attempt to obtain the name of the
offender from the neighbours.  In many cases the offender may have slipped into
someone else's dwelling and the neighbours will be unable to supply this
information.  In other cases the offender may indeed have taken refuge in his
own dwelling, but the neighbours may not know him.  Even if the police officer
is fortunate enough to obtain the offender's name, he will have to seek a
justice of the peace to execute an arrest warrant.  Valuable time ‑‑
and probably the offender ‑‑ will be lost because, when the police
officer finally returns with his warrant, the offender will have sought refuge
elsewhere.

 

Dickson C.J. therefore concluded
that a right to enter existed in the context of an arrest without a warrant
under s. 450(1)(a) (now 495(1)(a)) of the Criminal Code 
provided the criteria of that paragraph and the standards set out in Eccles
v. Bourque are met.  He stated, at pp. 164‑65:

 

The
proper questions to be asked are:

 

1.Is
the offence in question indictable?

 

2.Has
the person who is the subject of arrest committed the offence in question or
does the peace officer, on reasonable and probable grounds, believe he or she
has committed or is about to commit the offence in question?

 

3.Are
there reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is
within the premises?

 

4.Was
proper announcement made before entry?

 

An
affirmative answer to all of these questions will mean that the arrest is
lawful.

 

(ii)Issue
Raised by this Appeal

 

        In the present appeal the
appellant did not dispute the peace officer's authority to make an arrest
without a warrant.  He argued, however, that the principles set out in Landry
applied exclusively to arrests without a warrant for an indictable offence and
should accordingly not apply to provincial offences.  He therefore argued there
was no power to enter in the case of an arrest without a warrant for a
provincial offence.

 

        In my opinion, that is not
exactly the issue here.  Although the lower courts decided this case on the
basis of the applicability of Landry to a provincial offence, the
question this Court has to decide is actually more narrow.  It was admitted
that the entry of the police officers into Miss Pack's residence took
place here in hot pursuit, which is an exception traditionally recognized by
the common law to the principle of the sanctity of the home, and this is
therefore a case where there is at common law a right to enter to make an
arrest without a warrant.  This Court must therefore only decide whether there
is any basis for extending the hot pursuit exception to arrests for provincial
offences.  Before moving on to consider this question, however, it is worth
making a few remarks of a more general nature on the concept of hot pursuit.

 

(b)  Hot pursuit

 

(i)
Right to Enter in Hot Pursuit:  the Common Law

 

        It is well settled at common
law that police officers have the power to enter private premises to make an
arrest in hot pursuit.  This exception is mentioned in Halsbury's Laws of
England, 3rd ed., vol. 10, at p. 354:

 

        If
a felony has been committed and the felon is followed to a house, and there is
no other means of entering, any person may, it seems, break open the door of
the house, to arrest the offender.  This may  also be done if a felony will
probably be committed unless some person interferes to prevent it.

 

        If
an affray occurs in the presence of a constable, and the offenders run away and
are immediately pursued by the constable and they enter a house, then the doors
may be broken open by the constable to apprehend them in the course of the
immediate pursuit.

 

        Before
doors are broken open to effect an arrest, due notice must be given and
admission be demanded and refused.

 

        The right of police officers
to enter private premises in hot pursuit is also confirmed by
Donaldson L.J.'s statement of the common law on these matters in Swales
v. Cox, [1981] 1 All E.R. 1115 (Q.B. Div.), at p. 1118:

 

. . .
there was power of entry into premises at common law and, if necessary, power
to break doors to do so in four cases, but in four cases only, that is to say
by a constable or a citizen in order to prevent murder, by a constable or a
citizen if a felony had in fact been committed and the felon had been followed
to a house, by a constable or a citizen if a felony was about to be
committed, and would be committed, unless prevented, and by a constable
following an offender running away from an affray.  [Emphasis added.]

 

        This Court referred to the
right to enter in hot pursuit in the two judgments dealing with the territorial
limits imposed on powers of arrest.  In Eccles v. Bourque,
Dickson J. suggested, at p. 747, that the requirement of a warning
might not apply in a hot pursuit situation:

 

. . .
it is recognized there will be occasions on which, for example, to save someone
within the premises from death or injury or to prevent destruction of evidence or
if in hot pursuit notice may not be required.  [Emphasis added.] 

 

        This passage was cited with
approval by Dickson C.J. in R. v. Landry (at p. 157).  I note
that the point raised by Dickson J. in this passage does not have to be
decided in the present appeal, since the pursuit which took place here did not prevent
the police officer from giving notice of his intention to enter.

 

 

        La Forest J.,
dissenting in Landry, also ‑‑ and more explicitly ‑‑
recognized the exception to the principle of sanctity of the home for cases of
hot pursuit.  His reasons contain several references to this exception.  Thus,
he states (at p. 168) that the discussion of the limitations on the principle
of sanctity of the home by the judges in Semayne's Case ""makes
clear that an arrest could be made by breaking into a house if the arrestor was
armed with a warrant, or again if he was in hot pursuit of an offender""
(emphasis added).  Commenting on Eccles v. Bourque,
La Forest J. also noted the fact that the person sought in that case
was a fugitive.  He said (at p. 176):  ""Fugitives from justice are
frequently treated differently from other offenders.  The most obvious
example is arrest on hot pursuit"" (emphasis added).  Finally,
La Forest J. summarizes the common law on the power of the police to
enter as follows, at p. 179:

 

        As
has been seen the common law sets a high value on the security and privacy of
the home.  The situations where it permitted entry by police without the
consent of the owner or occupier were all demonstrably compelling.  For
example, entry to prevent murder is obviously justified.  So too is entry on
hot pursuit.  Apart from the obvious practicality of that approach, in the case
of hot pursuit the police officer is himself cognizant of the facts justifying
entry; he acts on the basis of personal knowledge.  Obviously, too, entry
on the basis of a warrant is essential to a properly functioning system of
criminal justice.  The state must in the end have power to prevent criminals
from eluding justice by retreating to a private home.  [Emphasis added.]

 

        It can therefore be said that
at common law the police had a power to enter in hot pursuit, and that this
power also exists in our law.  This exception to the principle of sanctity of
the home can easily be justified.

 

(ii)Right
to Enter in Hot Pursuit:  Justifications

 

        To begin with, it would be
unacceptable for police officers who were about to make a completely lawful
arrest to be prevented from doing so merely because the offender had taken
refuge in his home or that of a third party.  In Eccles v. Bourque, supra,
Dickson J. said that ""[t]he criminal is not immune from arrest in his
own home nor in the home of one of his friends"" (p. 743).  He added: 
""I know of no place that gives a criminal fugitive sanctuary from
arrest"" (p. 744).  These concerns are nowhere as relevant as in the
case of hot pursuit.  The offender is then not being bothered by the police
unexpectedly while in domestic tranquility.  He has gone to his home while
fleeing solely to escape arrest.  In such circumstances, the police could not
be obliged to end the pursuit on the offender's doorstep, without making his
residence a real sanctuary, contrary to the principles stated by this Court in Eccles. 
The flight of the offender, an act contrary to public order, also should not be
thus rewarded.

 

        From a more practical
standpoint, it is not desirable for offenders to be encouraged to seek refuge
in their homes or those of third parties.  Significant danger may be associated
with such flight and the pursuit that may result.  Thus, in the present case the
appellant by his flight unnecessarily threatened the safety of those who might
have been in his way.

 

        Other reasons may be cited in
support of an exception in hot pursuit cases to the principle of sanctity of
the home.  As La Forest J. pointed out in Landry, in a case of
hot pursuit the police officer may have personal knowledge of the facts
justifying the arrest, which greatly reduces the risk of error.  Flight also
usually indicates some awareness of guilt on the part of the offender.  Then
too, it may often be difficult, even if that was not the case here, to identify
the offender without arresting him on the spot.  And evidence of the offence
leading to the pursuit or a related offence may be lost; in the present case,
for example, when the accused was apprehended, it was found that there was
evidence of impairment.  Finally, the offender may again flee or continue to
commit the offence and the police cannot be required to keep an indefinite
watch on the offender's residence in case he should decide to come out.

 

        In short, the basis for this
exception is common sense, which is opposed to the offender being able to
escape arrest by fleeing into his home or that of a third party.  This is why
if an arrest without a warrant is permissible at the outset, the offender's
flight into a dwelling house cannot make it unlawful.  The entry of the police
in hot pursuit is then perfectly justified.

 

(iii)
Hot Pursuit:  Definition

 

        This Court, which has several
times referred to this exception to the principle of sanctity of the home, has
never had occasion to define hot pursuit.  In Miller v. Stewart, [1991]
O.J. No. 2238 (Q.L.), Chadwick J. of the Ontario Court (General
Division) noted in this regard, at p. 25:

 

        Various
authorities refer to the words ""hot pursuit"" but there is no real
definition to these words.  In my view it requires a common sense approach as
to what is hot pursuit.

 

        In general, and subject to
further clarification which may be necessary in the particular factual
situations before the courts, I consider that the approach suggested by R.
E. Salhany in Canadian Criminal Procedure (5th ed. 1989), at p. 44,
adequately conveys the meaning of hot pursuit:

 

Generally,
the essence of fresh pursuit is that it must be continuous pursuit conducted
with reasonable diligence, so that pursuit and capture along with the
commission of the offence may be considered as forming part of a single
transaction.

 

        Using this approach, there is
no doubt that there was hot pursuit in the circumstances of this case.  The
pursuit which took place here is a classic example of what is generally meant
by hot pursuit.  Indeed, the appellant admitted that there had been a hot
pursuit.

 

        The appellant nonetheless
argues that there should be no right to enter private property, even in a case
of hot pursuit, except with respect to indictable offences, and so not with
respect to provincial offences.  I shall therefore now consider this question,
which is the main issue raised in this appeal.

 

(c)Whether
the Application of this Exception Should be Extended to Arrest for Provincial
Offences

 

        The appellant accordingly
maintained that the police power to enter in hot pursuit should be reserved for
arrest for indictable offences.  I cannot accept this distinction.

 

(i)
The Common Law

 

        To begin with, it does not
appear that at common law the right to enter in hot pursuit was limited to
arrest for felonies.  As Donaldson L.J. noted in Swales v. Cox, supra,
at p. 1118, there was also at common law a right to enter in the case of a
""constable following an offender running away from an affray"".  This
situation is also mentioned in Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed.,
vol. 10, at p. 354:

 

        If
an affray occurs in the presence of a constable, and the offenders run away and
are immediately pursued by the constable and they enter a house, then the doors
may be broken open by the constable to apprehend them in the course of the
immediate pursuit.

 

        According to the authors W.
F. Foster and Joseph E. Magnet (""The Law of Forcible
Entry"", (1977) 15 Alta. L. Rev. 271), the common law also more
generally recognized a right to enter in hot pursuit for any misdemeanour
provided it was committed in the presence of a police officer.  They state, at
p. 279:  ""A peace officer may make a forcible entry without a warrant for
a misdemeanour committed in his presence.  An entry for misdemeanour not
committed in his presence is not justified.""

 

        It is interesting to note that
the offence here was committed in the presence of the police, thus meeting the
requirement referred to by Foster and Magnet.  I do not think, however, that
this condition should be strictly imposed on the right to enter for offences
other than indictable offences.  This condition is too strict.  Police who
arrive shortly after the offence is committed and see the offender fleeing
should be able to follow him into private premises, for a provincial offence as
well as for an indictable offence.  This power of entry should also be enjoyed
by police continuing a pursuit already begun.  The requirement that there
really be hot pursuit is in my opinion sufficient and is an answer to the
concerns which led to the requirement described by Foster and Magnet.  This assumes,
as I said earlier, real continuity between the commission of the offence and
the pursuit undertaken by the police.

 

(ii)Policy
Considerations

 

        Accordingly, a right of entry
to make an arrest in hot pursuit exists at common law, both for indictable
offences and for other types of offence.  In my opinion, there is no need to
alter this rule.  There are strong policy considerations against retaining the
distinction between indictable offences and other categories of offence in
determining the spatial limits on the power of arrest in hot pursuit.  Unlike
the division which existed at common law between felonies and misdemeanours,
the division which currently exists in our law between indictable offences and
other categories of offence only very imperfectly reflects the severity of the
offence.  Most importantly, there is no logical connection between the fact
that an offence falls in one or other of these categories and the need there
may be to make an arrest in hot pursuit in residential premises.

 

        This is due in part to the
constitutional division of powers between Parliament and the provincial
legislatures.  Under s. 92(15) of the Constitution Act, 1867 ,
provincial legislatures have jurisdiction to create offences, which often prove
to be more serious than many of the offences falling in the category of
indictable offences, and which may much more urgently require arrest in hot
pursuit.  Such offences can however never be classified as indictable offences,
which are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the federal Parliament.  This
special characteristic of our legal system makes the distinction between
indictable offences and other categories of offence especially inadequate for
determining police powers of entry in hot pursuit.  In some situations, too, it
is not clear, as this case reveals, what the ultimate charge may be.  Denying
the existence of this power in the case of all offences which are not
indictable, and consequently in the case of all provincial offences, would in
my opinion be an excessive and unwarranted limitation on police powers, and
that is why I feel that the distinction between indictable offences and other
types of offence should not be retained in this context.  I would add that the
principal reasons justifying the entry of the police in hot pursuit, namely the
need to avoid making the home a real sanctuary against arrest and the risk of
encouraging individuals to flee the police, apply both in the context of
provincial offences (as well as federal offences punishable on summary
conviction) and in the context of indictable offences.

 

        This does not mean, however,
that the police can enter residential premises in hot pursuit in order to make
an arrest for any kind of offence.  Clearly, the police have this power when a
warrant has been issued against the offender; but if there is no warrant, there
must always be an offence or circumstances which will allow the police to make
an arrest without a warrant.  This requirement, which was not discussed in
connection with the present appeal because the power to make an arrest without
a warrant was not challenged, is essential.  It ensures that the right to
enter applies only to offences or in circumstances which the legislature has
considered sufficiently serious to justify a power of arrest without a
warrant.  By way of illustration I note in this regard that the Highway
Traffic Act, which the appellant contravened here, provides for a power of
arrest without a warrant only for a limited number of offences.

 

(d)  Summary

 

        In summary, I conclude that
even where there is no arrest warrant, there is in a case of hot pursuit a
right to enter residential premises to make an arrest both for provincial
offences and for indictable offences, provided the circumstances justify an
arrest without a warrant.  Accordingly, the entry by the police was authorized
in the case at bar.

 

        The Court does not have to
decide here on the existence of a general power to enter private premises in
order to make an arrest without a warrant for a provincial offence in
situations that do not involve hot pursuit.

 

(e)  The Charter 

 

        The appellant also raised
arguments based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  He
argued that his rights under ss. 7  and 9  of the Charter  had been
infringed.  These arguments are devoid of merit.

 

        With respect to s. 9 ,
this Court in R. v. Wilson, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1291, considered the
constitutionality of a stop under s. 119 of the Highway Traffic Act. 
A police officer had stopped a motorist after observing him at night in the
vicinity of a bar in a vehicle with out‑of‑province plates. 
Cory J. was of the view that in the setting of a rural community the
police could be regarded as having offered reasonable grounds for stopping the
motorist.  He accordingly concluded, at p. 1297, that although the
appellant had been detained, the detention was not arbitrary:

 

In a
case such as this, where the police offer grounds for stopping a motorist that
are reasonable and can be clearly expressed (the articulable cause referred to
in the American authorities), the stop should not be regarded as random.  As a
result, although the appellant was detained, the detention was not arbitrary in
this case and the stop did not violate s. 9  of the Charter .

 

        In the circumstances of this
case the police, who had seen the appellant drive through a red light, then
refuse to stop at their request and flee into Miss Pack's apartment, had
even more reasonable grounds than those relied on in Wilson to stop and
then detain the appellant.  The argument that in such circumstances the
detention may have been arbitrary is on its very face totally devoid of merit.

 

        So far as s. 7  is
concerned, even assuming that this provision implies protection of a right to
privacy, something which we do not have to decide here, there can be no
question of such a right being infringed in this case.  In R. v. Beare,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, La Forest J. stated, at p. 412:

 

        Assuming
section 7 includes a right to privacy such as that inhering in the
guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures in s. 8  of the Charter ,
a proposition for which I have considerable sympathy, it must be remembered
that the present Chief Justice in Southam was careful to underline that
what the Constitution guaranteed was a ""reasonable expectation"" of
privacy....

 

In the appellant's situation, it is
impossible to speak of a reasonable expectation of privacy.  The appellant went
into Miss Pack's apartment when he knew he was being pursued by a peace
officer, for the specific purpose of escaping him.  He must reasonably have
expected to be followed.  It goes without saying that a person who enters his
house or that of someone else to get away from the police who are pursuing him
in connection with an offence he has just committed and for which there is a
power of arrest without a warrant cannot expect his privacy to be protected in
such circumstances so as to prevent the police from making an arrest.

 

(f)  Conclusion

 

        For all these reasons the
appeal is dismissed.

Young offenders ‑‑ Sentencing ‑‑ Principles stated in 
Act including requirement that dispositions both protect society and be in best
interests of offender ‑‑ Act providing for annual review of
sentence ‑‑ Youth with prior record, uncompleted ""community
service"" probation, a poor family situation and yet good school reports

Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. Y‑1 , ss. 3(1) , (2) , 20 , 23(2) (f), 24(1) ,
24.1(1) , 28(1) , (3) .

 

                   Appellant was
convicted of three counts of break, enter and theft and one count of breach of
probation.  He had already acquired a significant record and was subject to a
probation order requiring him to undertake community service.  Very little of
it had been completed at the time of appellant's arrest because of appellant's
being uncooperative.

 

                   Appellant's home
life was depressing.  His parents were prone to alcohol abuse and incidents of
violence occurred, not only between the parents themselves but also by the
parents against the children.  On some of these occasions, appellant tried to
stop the fighting.  Eight of the nine children in the family had been, or were
at the time of sentencing, subject to probation orders and three of the five
younger children still living at home were in custody at the Manitoba Youth
Centre.  Appellant was a good student but became rebellious when his siblings
were released from custody and returned to school.  On several occasions he and
his siblings were placed in foster homes but were returned to their parents
when they proved to be uncontrollable.

 

                   The trial judge
took careful note of the prior record and the depressing family history and
ordered appellant be placed in open custody for two years.  The disposition was
found on appeal to be fit and proper, although the dissent, concerned that it
was an attempt to provide appellant with welfare assistance rather than
assessing the appropriate sentence, would have reduced the period of open
custody to one year.  This appeal deals with the sentencing of young offenders.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

                   The Young
Offenders Act is part of a spectrum of legislation running from those
statutes providing welfare care for children through to the strict sentencing
provisions of the Criminal Code .  Section 3  sets out a number of
principles.  This section is not merely a preamble but is to be given the force
normally attributed to substantive provisions.  The references in s. 3(1) 
to responsibility and to the protection of society suggest that a traditional
criminal law approach should be taken into account in the sentencing of young
offenders.  Yet dispositions must be imposed on young offenders differently
because the needs and requirements of the young are distinct from those of
adults.

 

                   Section 24(1) 
requires judges to consider the protection of society, the seriousness of the
offence and the needs and circumstances of the young person before imposing a
custodial term.  The judge can also decide, where custody is required, whether
it should be open or closed.  Open custody facilities have been defined and,
although they will restrict the liberty of the young offender, they do not and
should not resemble penitentiaries.  These facilities must be dedicated to the
long term welfare and reformation of the young offender.

 

                   Proportionality has
greater significance in the sentencing of adults than the sentencing of young
offenders.  For the young, a proper disposition must take into account not only
the seriousness of the crime but also all the other relevant factors.  

 

                   The home situation
should always be taken into account because it is relevant in complying with
the Act's requirement that an assessment must be made of the special needs and
requirements for guidance of the young offender.  The home situation, however,
should not be made the predominant factor in sentencing.

 

                   The principle of
general deterrence must be considered but has diminished importance in
determining the appropriate disposition in the case of a youthful offender as
opposed to that of an adult.  Sections 3 , 20  and 24  all indicate that
general deterrence must be taken into account.  Dispositions can have an effective
deterrent effect.  Since crimes committed by the young tend to be a group
activity, the disposition imposed on an individual member of the group should
be such that it will deter other members of the group.  General deterrence
should not be unduly emphasized.

 

                   The annual review
procedure provided in s. 28 is an integral part of the disposition and is
one factor ‑‑ and not a major one ‑‑ to be considered
in determining the appropriate disposition.  The annual review of disposition
provides an incentive to young offenders to perform well and to improve their
behaviour significantly as quickly as possible.  As well, it gives the court an
opportunity to assess the offenders again and to make certain that the
appropriate treatment or assistance has been made available to them.  It
introduces an aspect of review and flexibility into the sentencing procedure,
with the result that any marked improvement in the behaviour, outlook and
performance of the offender can be rewarded and any deterioration assessed.

 

                   The disposition of
two years in open custody was appropriate here in light of the offences
committed and the needs and requirements of the young offender.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Cory
J. -- Neither great
constitutional questions nor vexing Charter problems are raised on this
appeal.  Yet since it deals with the sentencing of young offenders it is
concerned with a subject of some importance that may affect the safety and
future of our society.

 

Factual Background

 

                   On January 18, 1991
J.J.M. and another young offender broke into premises occupied by a local radio
station.  An expensive camera and six audio cassettes were stolen together with
$120 cash.  On January 28, they broke into an office and stole some $1,200 to
$1,700 from an office cabinet.  On April 26, J.J.M. and his co-accused broke
into premises, which they severely damaged, and stole a camera and $324.

 

                   On June 17, 1991
J.J.M. was convicted of three counts of break, enter and theft and one count of
breach of probation.  Prior to that date he had already acquired a significant
record.  He had been found guilty of three counts of break, enter and theft
between February and April 1990, and two separate counts of taking an automobile
without consent in the months of January and February of that same year.  He
was, as well, subject to a probation order when the offences were committed in
1991.  The probation order required him to undertake community service. 
However he had not cooperated with the authorities and had completed very
little of it at the time of arrest.

 

                   J.J.M. is one of
nine children.  The family history is depressing.  The parents appear to be
prone to alcohol abuse.  What is worse, there are reported incidents of
violence not only between the parents themselves but also of violence by the
parents directed against the children.  On some of these occasions, J.J.M.
attempted to stop the fighting.  Of the nine children, no less than eight of
them had been, or were at the time of sentencing, subject to probation orders. 
Indeed at the time J.J.M. was sentenced, one of his sisters was sentenced in
connection with an unrelated offence.  Of the five younger children, still
living at home, three were in custody at the Manitoba Youth Centre.

 

                   His school
principal observed that the appellant was a good student until his siblings
were released from custody and returned to school.  As soon as that happened,
he became rebellious.  On several occasions J.J.M. and his siblings had been
apprehended by the Awasis Agency and placed in foster homes.  However, they
were returned to their parents when they proved to be uncontrollable.

 

Courts Below

 

                   At the trial, Gyles
Prov. Ct. J. took careful note of the prior record and the depressing family
history and ordered the appellant be placed in open custody for two years.

 

                   In the Court of
Appeal (1991), 75 Man. R. (2d) 296, Huband J.A., with Lyon J.A. concurring,
found the disposition to be a fit and proper one.  He found that it was appropriate
for the trial judge to take into account the mandatory judicial review of the
sentence after a year.  Helper J.A. in dissent would have reduced the period of
open custody to one year.  She expressed the concern that in reality the
disposition attempted to provide welfare assistance for the appellant rather
than assessing the appropriate sentence.

 

Analysis

 

General Approach to Young Offenders
Dispositions

 

                   The approach the
court should take when sentencing young offenders, is to be ascertained from
s. 3  of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. Y-1 .  That
section is entitled ""Declaration of Principle"" and sets out a
declaration of principle in subs. (1).

 

                   A quick reading of
that section indicates that there is a marked ambivalence in its approach to
the sentencing of young offenders.  Yet that ambivalence should not be
surprising when it is remembered that the Act reflects a courageous attempt to
balance concepts and interests that are frequently conflicting.

 

                   Society must be
concerned with the illegal acts of young people.  The wanton destruction of the
contents of a home by young offenders is just as keenly felt by the victims as
would be a ransacking by adult burglars.  ""Swarmings"" by young gangs,
where the victims are surrounded and their clothing or money torn from them,
are a serious cause for concern since they can be the forerunner of even more
violent mob action by the same offenders as adults.

 

                   Yet there must be
some flexibility in the dispositions imposed on young offenders.  It is not
unreasonable to expect that in many cases carefully crafted dispositions will
result in the reform and rehabilitation of the young person.  That must be the
ultimate aim of all dispositions.  They may often achieve this goal if the
disposition is carefully tailored to meet both the need to protect society and
to reform the offender.  Let us consider once again the provisions of
s. 3(1) .  It provides:

 

                   3. (1)  It is hereby
recognized and declared that

 

(a)  while
young persons should not in all instances be held accountable in the same
manner or suffer the same consequences for their behaviour as adults, young
persons who commit offences should nonetheless bear responsibility for their
contraventions;

 

(b)  society
must, although it has the responsibility to take reasonable measures to prevent
criminal conduct by young persons, be afforded the necessary protection from
illegal behaviour;

 

(c)  young
persons who commit offences require supervision, discipline and control, but,
because of their state of dependency and level of development and maturity,
they also have special needs and require guidance and assistance;

 

(d)  where
it is not inconsistent with the protection of society, taking no measures or
taking measures other than judicial proceedings under this Act should be
considered for dealing with young persons who have committed offences;

 

(e)  young
persons have rights and freedoms in their own right, including those stated in
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  or in the Canadian Bill
of Rights, and in particular a right to be heard in the course of, and to
participate in, the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, and young
persons should have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms;

 

(f)  in
the application of this Act, the rights and freedoms of young persons include a
right to the least possible interference with freedom that is consistent with
the protection of society, having regard to the needs of young persons and the
interests of their families;

 

(g)  young
persons have the right, in every instance where they have rights or freedoms
that may be affected by this Act, to be informed as to what those rights and
freedoms are; and

 

(h)  parents
have responsibility for the care and supervision of their children, and, for
that reason, young persons should be removed from parental supervision either
partly or entirely only when measures that provide for continuing parental
supervision are inappropriate.

 

                   (2)  This
Act shall be liberally construed to the end that young persons will be dealt
with in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1).

 

                   This court has
recognized the importance of this statement of principle.  In R. v. T. (V.),
[1992] 1 S.C.R. 749, L'Heureux-Dubé J. writing for the Court noted that the
section should not be considered as merely a preamble.  Rather it should be
given the force normally attributed to substantive provisions.

 

                   Section 3(1) 
attempts to balance the need to make the young offenders responsible for their
crimes while recognizing their vulnerability and special needs.  It seeks to
chart a course that avoids both the harshness of a pure criminal law approach
applied to minors and the paternalistic welfare approach that was emphasized in
the old Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3.  Society
must be protected from the violent and criminal acts committed by the young
just as much as from those committed by adults.  The references to
responsibility contained in s. 3(1) (a) and to the protection of
society in paras. (b), (d) and (f) suggest that a
traditional criminal law approach should be taken into account in the
sentencing of young offenders.  Yet we must approach dispositions imposed on
young offenders differently because the needs and requirements of the young are
distinct from those of adults.

 

                   For instance, the
declaration in s. 3(1) (a) and (c) notes that young offenders
cannot be held accountable in the same way as adult criminals because of their
dependency on others and their obvious lack of maturity.  There are other
elements in the declaration which suggest that there should be a departure from
the strict criminal justice model in imposing penalties on young offenders. 
Section 3(1) (d) for example, suggests that in some circumstances, no
judicial measure should be taken against the child.  Paragraph (f)
confirms the offender's right to the least possible interference with his or
her liberty.  As well, s. 3(1) (h) establishes that young people
coming within the provisions of the Act are, wherever possible, to remain under
parental supervision.  Further, while the wardship provisions that were set out
in the Juvenile Delinquents Act have been abolished, it is significant
that s. 23(2)(f) of the Young Offenders Act provides for
probation orders which will contain residence requirements.  These probation
orders may be used by correctional authorities to place children with
provincial welfare agencies.

 

                   Thus the Act does
specifically recognize that young offenders have special needs and require
careful guidance.  Each disposition should strive to recognize and balance the
interests of society and young offenders.  The very fact that these are young
offenders indicates that they may become long term adult offenders unless they
can be reformed to become useful and productive members of society.  Thus the
disposition imposed on a young offender must seek to have a beneficial and
significant effect on both the offender and the community.

 

                   Senior Judge
Beaulieu (as he then was), in "" From `Challenges and Choices' to `A
Climate for Change'"", Y.O.A. Dispositions:  Challenges and Choices
(1988), aptly described the Act's approach to sentencing at p. 4:

 

The Y.O.A.
does not do away with looking at who the offender is; it specifically
directs the judge to do so, but the youth's needs must be seen in the context
of his accountability and the protection of society.

 

                                                                    ...

 

The Y.O.A.
too, contains some ""blend"" of criminal law and protection
philosophies.  However, here the scales are weighted, at least at the
pre-adjudicative and adjudicative stage, toward the criminal law process.  The
paternalistic character of the J.D.A. is replaced by the concept of
accountability of the individual, coupled with the need to ensure that
individual rights are protected by proper procedure.

 

                                                                    ...

 

The Y.O.A.
attempts to balance the protection of society and the young offender's needs. 
It attempts to balance the due process and treatment approaches. [Italics in
original.]

 

                   I agree with the
academic writers who have observed that the Act should be seen as part of a
spectrum of legislation that runs from those statutes that provide welfare care
for children at one end to the strict sentencing provisions of the Criminal
Code .

 

Factors To Be Considered When Imposing
Custodial Sentences

 

                   Section 24(1) of
the Act requires judges to consider three elements before imposing a custodial
term:

 

(1)
the protection of society;

 

(2)
the seriousness of the offence;

 

(3)
the needs and circumstances of the young person.

 

                   The Act empowers
the judge, in those situations where it is decided that custody is required, to
determine whether it should be open or closed.  Section 24.1(1)  defines
""open custody"" as ""a community residential centre, group home,
child care institution, or forest or wilderness camp"" or other similar
facilities.  Certainly, places which come within the definition of ""open
custody"" will restrict the liberty of the young offender.  Yet those
facilities are not simply to be jails for young people.  Rather they are
facilities dedicated to the long term welfare and reformation of the young
offender.  Open custody facilities do not and should not resemble
penitentiaries.  Indeed the courts have very properly resisted attempts to
define as open those facilities which provide nothing but secure confinement. 
See for example Re D.B. and the Queen (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 468
(N.S.S.C.T.D.), and Re L.H.F. and the Queen (1985), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 152
(P.E.I.S.C.).

 

                   The Young
Offenders Act thus provides the sentencing judge with a wide latitude as to
how the disposition is to be served so as to better deal with the difficult and
complex problems presented by young offenders.

 

                   With that
background, it may now be appropriate to consider the specific objections that
were raised by the appellant to the custodial disposition imposed on J.J.M.

 

Child Welfare Concerns and the Proportionality
Principle

 

                   The appellant
contended that the trial judge erred in imposing a lengthy disposition that
could only be justified as proportional on welfare grounds.  It was his
submission that the dreadful conditions existing in the appellant's home should
not have been a factor in assessing the length of the term of open custody.  It
was said that this disposition was a throw back to a type of sentence which
would have been imposed under the paternalistic scheme of the  Juvenile
Delinquents Act.  The appellant argued that pursuant to the provisions of
the Young Offenders Act the disposition had to be proportional to the
offence committed.

 

                   It is true that for
both adults and minors the sentence must be proportional to the offence
committed.  But in the sentencing of adult offenders, the principle of
proportionality will have a greater significance than it will in the
disposition of young offenders.  For the young, a proper disposition must take
into account not only the seriousness of the crime but also all the other
relevant factors.

 

                   For example, two
years of closed custody could never be imposed on a young offender with no
prior record who had stolen a pair of gloves, no matter how intolerable or how
unsavoury the conditions were in the offender's home.  Nonetheless the home
situation is a factor that should always be taken into account in fashioning
the appropriate disposition.  It is relevant in complying with the Act's
requirement that an assessment must be made of the special needs and
requirements for guidance of the young offender.  Intolerable conditions in the
home indicate both a special need for care and the absence of any guidance
within the home.

 

                   The situation in
the home of a young offender should neither be ignored nor made the predominant
factor in sentencing.  Nonetheless, it is a factor that can properly be taken
into account in fashioning the disposition.

 

                   This was very ably
expressed by Thorson J.A. in R. v. R. I. (1985), 17 C.C.C. (3d) 523
(Ont. C.A.).  At pp. 530-31 he wrote:

 

...
I would sound a note of caution.  It does not follow, in my opinion, that
the relativity principle referred to by counsel must now be applied to young
offenders in exactly the same way as it is to adult offenders.  The close
correlation which is generally looked to as appropriate in the case of an adult
offender, between the seriousness of the offence and the length of the sentence
imposed for it, may or may not be equally as appropriate in the case of a young
offender, where the task of arriving at the ""right"" disposition may
be a considerably more difficult and complex one, given the special needs of
young persons and the kind of guidance and assistance they may require.  Any
uncritical application of the principle to young offenders could thus run
counter to the larger objectives of the new legislation.  On the other hand, as
a factor to be taken into account in the disposition process, the principle is
one which the new legislation must be taken to implicitly recognize.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Moreover,
the reasoning which has led our courts to favour, wherever possible, a short
first custodial sentence for a youthful adult offender may lose some of its
force when sought to be applied to someone of lesser maturity, as, for example,
where a young offender's committal to custody reflects an adjudged need to
remove him from an unhappy or hostile home environment.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The aim must be both to protect
society and at the same time to provide the young offender with the necessary
guidance and assistance that he or she may not be getting at home.  Those goals
are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  In the long run, society is best
protected by the reformation and rehabilitation of a young offender.  In turn,
the young offenders are best served when they are provided with the necessary
guidance and assistance to enable them to learn the skills required to become
fully integrated, useful members of society.

 

General Deterrence

 

                   The appellant
submitted that it was improper for the Court of Appeal to take into account the
need for general deterrence when it assessed the dispositions.  Reliance was
placed on the decisions of the Courts of Appeal in both Alberta and New
Brunswick.  In R. v. G.K. (1986), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 81 (Alta. C.A.), it was
held that general deterrence did not have any place in the sentencing of young
offenders.  This view was adopted by a special five member panel of the Alberta
Court of Appeal in R. v. C.W.W. (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 355.  The same
position was adopted by the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. R.C.S.
(1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 239.

 

                   This approach was
specifically disapproved by the Courts of Appeal of Ontario and Quebec.  See R.
v. O. (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 376 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. L.(S.)
(1990), 75 C.R. (3d) 94 (Que. C.A.).

 

                   In R. v. O.,
supra, Brooke J.A. writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal expressed the
opinion that although the principle of general deterrence must be considered,
it had diminished importance in determining the appropriate disposition in the
case of a youthful offender.  This, I believe, is the correct approach.  This
is apparent from a consideration of some of the provisions of the Young
Offenders Act.  Section 3  in emphasizing the need for the protection of
society, s. 20  by its observation that dispositions should have regard to
the best interest of the young person and the public, and s. 24 which
provides for a disposition imposing custody if it is in the best interest of
the young person and for the protection of the society, all indicate
that general deterrence must be taken into count.

 

                   There is reason to
believe that Young Offenders Act dispositions can have an effective deterrent
effect.  The crimes committed by the young tend to be a group activity.  The
group lends support and assistance to the prime offenders.  The criminological
literature is clear that about 80 percent of juvenile delinquency is a group
activity, whether as part of an organized gang or with an informal group of
accomplices.  See Maurice Cusson in Why delinquency? (1983), at pp.
138-39, and Franklin E. Zimring ""Kids, Groups and Crime"" (1981), 72 J.
Crim. L. & Criminology 867.  If the activity of the group is criminal
then the disposition imposed on an individual member of the group should be
such that it will deter other members of the group.  For example the sentence
imposed on one member of a ""swarming group"" should serve to deter
others in the gang.

 

                   Having said that, I
would underline that general deterrence should not, through undue emphasis,
have the same importance in fashioning the disposition for a youthful offender
as it would in the case of an adult.  One youthful offender should not be obliged
to accept the responsibility for all the young offenders of his or her
generation.

 

The Availability of a Yearly Review

 

                   The appellant
argued that the Court of Appeal was in error when it assessed the disposition
in light of the mandatory review provided for by s. 28(1) of the Young
Offenders Act.

 

                   Section 28(1)  and
(3)  provide:

 

                   28. (1)  Where a young person
is committed to custody pursuant to a disposition made in respect of an offence
for a period exceeding one year, the provincial director of the province in
which the young person is held in custody shall cause the young person to be
brought before the youth court forthwith at the end of one year from the date
of the most recent disposition made in respect of the offence, and the youth
court shall review the disposition.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (3)  Where
a young person is committed to custody pursuant to a disposition made in
respect of an offence, the provincial director may, on his own initiative, and
shall, on the request of the young person, his parent or the Attorney General
or his agent, on any of the grounds set out in subsection (4), cause the young
person to be brought before the youth court at any time after six months from
the date of the most recent disposition made in respect of the offence or, with
leave of a youth court judge, at any earlier time, and, where the youth court
is satisfied that there are grounds for the review under subsection (4), the
court shall review the disposition.

 

The section is obviously salutary.  It
provides an incentive to young offenders to perform well and to improve their
behaviour significantly as quickly as possible.  As well, it gives an
opportunity to the court to assess the offenders again and to make certain that
the appropriate treatment or assistance has been made available to them.  It
introduces an aspect of review and flexibility into the sentencing procedure,
with the result that any marked improvement in the behaviour, outlook and
performance of the offender can be rewarded and any deterioration assessed. 
The Act provides a system that it is akin to, yet broader than, the probation
review provided for adult offenders.

 

                   The appellant
sought to rely upon R. v. S. (H.S.), Nfld. C.A., June 2, 1990,
unreported.  In that case the trial judge had imposed a sentence based, in
part, on the fact that it would be reviewed before it had expired.  The Court
of Appeal disagreed and expressed the view that a disposition must be made on
the basis of the facts and law as they existed at the time it was made.  They held
that the review of a disposition for a young offender could not be considered
when a sentence is imposed any more than could be the possibility of parole for
an adult.  I cannot accept that position.

 

                   The Young
Offenders Act provides for a mandatory system of review.  In the case of
adult offenders, the court controls neither the parole nor remission
provisions.  In the Young Offenders Act  the review procedure is an
integral part of the disposition.  It is therefore appropriate to take it into
account as a factor, albeit not a major one, in assessing the appropriateness
of a disposition.

 

Assessment of the Disposition in This
Case

 

                   The disposition of
two years in open custody was appropriate.  The trial judge was faced with a
young offender with a significant prior record.  It was obvious that he was not
cooperating with the probation authorities or fulfilling his obligations with
regard to community service.  The offences themselves were serious.  The
situation in the home was intolerable.  Yet, in the absence of other family
members, his good work at school indicated that there was real hope for him and
that there was a pressing need to provide guidance and assistance for him.  The
aspect of the need for general deterrence could not be overlooked since these
offences had been committed with the help and assistance of others.  Further it
was appropriate to consider as a factor that there would be a review of the
disposition.  The disposition of two years open custody was, in all the
circumstances, a fit sentence in light of the offences committed and the needs
and requirements of the young offender.

 

                   In the result, as
this Court directed at the conclusion of the hearing, the appeal is dismissed.

of the Criminal Code .  The Ontario District Court affirmed the
forfeiture order but the Court of Appeal, in a majority judgment, allowed the
respondent's appeal.  The majority concluded that the word ""capable""
means ""capable in its present condition"" rather than a capability
which could be achieved of an adaptation of the weapon and set aside the
forfeiture order.

 

                   Held (Lamer C.J. and Major J. dissenting):  The
appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per La Forest, Gonthier and
Cory JJ.:  The respondent's weapon must be classified as a prohibited
weapon.  Any uncertainty as to the meaning of the word ""capable"" in
para. (c) of the definition of ""prohibited weapon"" in
s. 84(1) of the Code is resolved as soon as the word is interpreted
in light of the purpose of the prohibited weapons provisions of the Code. 
There is thus no need to resort to the rule of strict construction in this
case.  The purpose of these provisions is to protect the public from these
dangerous weapons that are designed specifically to kill or maim people.  The
word ""capable"" in para. (c) includes an aspect of
potential capability for conversion and, given a reasonable interpretation,
should be defined as meaning capable of conversion to an automatic weapon in a
relatively short period of time with relative ease.  To come to any other
conclusion would undermine the very purpose of the legislation.  Therefore,
where a weapon can be quickly and readily converted to automatic status, that
weapon falls within the definition of ""prohibited weapon"". The 1991
amendment to para. (c) does not indicate that the word
""capable"" should be given a narrow or strict interpretation.  Rather,
it should be viewed as a response to the perceived need to remove any doubt as
to the meaning of the word.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Major J.
(dissenting):  The word ""capable"" in para. (c) of
the definition of ""prohibited weapon"" in s. 84(1) of the Code
refers to the present firing ability of the weapon.  It is not used with terms
such as ""adapted"", ""altered"", ""designed"" and
""intended"", which can be found in other paragraphs of s. 84(1) 
and which more clearly refer to future ability.  Further,  the 1991 amendment
to para. (c) is redundant unless ""capable"" is restricted
to present firing ability.  A narrow interpretation of the term does not thwart
the concern for public protection.  Those weapons that would have been
classified as prohibited under a broad interpretation of ""capable"" in
para. (c) are still highly controlled under the Code as
""restricted weapons"".  Section 84(1)  also provides for the
classification of a particular firearm as a ""prohibited weapon"". 
Finally, a ""prohibited weapon"" conviction carries serious
consequences for an accused.  Any test based on capability extending to future
alterations, which may be beyond the accused's knowledge or skill, introduces
an undesirable level of uncertainty.

                   APPEAL from a
judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 225, 50 O.A.C. 186,
67 C.C.C. (3d) 426, 9 C.R. (4th) 281, allowing the respondent's appeal from a
judgment of Higgins Dist. Ct. J., which confirmed a decision of Payne
Prov. Ct. J. (1990), 9 W.C.B. (2d) 426, declaring a weapon to be a
prohibited weapon and ordering it to be forfeited by the Crown.  Appeal
allowed, Lamer C.J. and Major J. dissenting.

 

                   Brian McNeely, for the appellant.

 

                   Calvin Martin, Q.C., for the respondent.

 

//Major J.//

 

                   The reasons of
Lamer C.J. and Major J. were delivered by

 

                   Major
J. (dissenting) -- The
respondent owned a Mini-Uzi submachine gun.  On August 31, 1989 he attempted to
register it as a ""restricted weapon"".

 

                   The local registrar
decided that the firearm was a ""prohibited weapon"" under s. 84(1)  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and seized it.  He then
applied to the Ontario Provincial Court under s. 102(3) of the Code for
a declaration that the seized firearm be forfeited.  The effect of such a
forfeiture is seizure of the weapon only; there is no proceeding against the
owner.

 

                   In November 1989,
Payne Prov. Ct. J. held that since the firearm was readily convertible from
semi-automatic to fully automatic it was capable of firing bullets in rapid
succession upon single pressure of the trigger.  He concluded that it was a
""prohibited weapon"" as defined in s. 84(1) of the Code and
granted the order stating:

 

                   On
the evidence therefore, I am satisfied that notwithstanding that the original
manufacturer made this weapon as a semi-automatic and the fact that it was in
fact a semi-automatic when it was submitted to the authorities for registration
as a restricted weapon, it is my finding on the evidence that by reason of

 

a)                adjustment
of the restraining plate or

 

                   b)    replacing the
trigger mechanism with spare parts which are fully                       automatic
or

 

c)replacing
the trigger mechanism with the trigger mechanism of a replica weapon this gun
will fire as a fully automatic.

 

Because
of this capability it is in fact a prohibited weapon and an order will go for
its destruction accordingly.

 

                   The Ontario
District Court sustained the order but the Ontario Court of Appeal in a
majority judgment allowed the appeal: (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 225, 50 O.A.C. 186,
67 C.C.C. (3d) 426, 9 C.R. (4th) 281.  Carthy J.A., for the majority, stated
(at p. 227 O.R.):

 

                   In
interpreting a written document, here a statute, first impressions can often be
the most reliable. It is the simplest form of analysis and, unless the issue
itself is complicated and requires deeper searches for meaning, probably
reflects what the author intended.  Here, Parliament has used the expression
""anything that can be adapted for use as a firearm"" in the
definition of ""firearm"", and the expression ""that is capable
of firing bullets in rapid succession"" in the definition of
""prohibited weapon"". [Emphasis added by Carthy J.A.] There is an
intended difference between the two and the simplest identification of that
difference is to say that ""capable"" means ""capable in its
present condition"" rather than a capability which may be achieved by
adaptation.

 

                   Tarnopolsky J.A.,
in dissent, held that a firearm easily convertible to a fully automatic form
was a ""prohibited weapon"".  He followed the approach of the Alberta
Court of Appeal in R. v. Global Armaments Ltd. (1990), 105 A.R. 260. 
There it was held that the firearms under review, which were originally fully
automatic but had been converted to single shot weapons, retained their status
as ""prohibited weapons"" because the conversion process was quick and
easy.  Tarnopolsky J.A. concluded that if ""capable"" was not broadly
interpreted to include adaptability, a conviction could be avoided simply by
removing a portion of the weapon to make it inoperable.

 

                   This appeal turns
on the interpretation of ""capable"" in para. (c) of the
definition of ""prohibited weapon"" in s. 84(1) of the Code. 
Unless noted otherwise, all subsequent references to legislation are to s.
84(1) of the Code.  The appellant seeks a broad interpretation that
would include firearms with the potential to be made fully automatic with
relative ease, submitting that such an interpretation underscores the policy
underlying firearms control legislation.  The respondent submits that
Parliament must be taken to have chosen the word ""capable""
deliberately and seeks a narrow interpretation restricting ""capable""
to present firing ability.

 

                   ""Capable""
is used in the Code in defining ""firearm"", ""prohibited
weapon"" and ""restricted weapon"".  But the Code also uses
terms which more clearly encompass future ability, such as ""adapted"",
""designed"", ""altered"" and ""intended"".

 

                   In the present
case, the definitions of both ""prohibited weapon"" and
""restricted weapon"" depend on the definition of ""firearm"".
If a particular object is not a ""firearm"" we need not take the
further step of classifying it as ""restricted"" or ""prohibited"". 
""Firearm"" is defined as

 

any
barrelled weapon from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged
and that is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death to a
person, and includes any frame or receiver of such a barrelled weapon and
anything that can be adapted for use as a firearm; [Emphasis added.]

 

The determination of what is a
""firearm"" involves both a test of capability (of causing serious
bodily injury or death) and of adaptability (for use as a firearm). R. v.
Covin, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 725, sets out the criteria to be used in determining
when an object qualifies as a firearm.

 

                   The definition of
""prohibited weapon"" uses both ""capable"" and
""adapted"", however, not in the same paragraph:

 

""prohibited
weapon"" means 

 

. . .

 

(c)
any firearm, not being a restricted weapon described in paragraph (c) of
the definition of that expression in this subsection, that is capable of
firing bullets in rapid succession during one pressure of the trigger,

 

(d)
any firearm adapted from a rifle or shotgun, whether by sawing, cutting
or other alteration or modification, that, as so adapted, has a barrel
that is less than 457 mm in length or that is less than 660 mm in overall
length. . . . [Emphasis added.] 

 

Whether or not a ""firearm""
is prohibited on the basis of rapid firing ability depends on capability. In
contrast, prohibition on the basis of reduced barrel length depends on actual
adaptation. Submissions that ""capable"" includes future ability or
potential are weakened by the express reference to adaptation of a firearm in
para. (d), in the definition of ""prohibited weapon"". 

 

                   ""Capable""
is also used in the definition of ""restricted weapon"":

 

""restricted
weapon"" means

 

                   (a)
any firearm, not being a prohibited weapon, designed, altered or intended
to be aimed and fired by the action of one hand,

 

                   (b)
any firearm that

 

(i) 
is not a prohibited weapon, has a barrel that is less than 470 mm in length and
is capable of discharging  a centre-fire ammunition in a semi-automatic
manner, or

 

(ii)
is designed or adapted to be fired when reduced to a length of
less than 660 mm by folding, telescoping or otherwise, or

 

(c)
any firearm that is designed, altered or intended to fire
bullets in rapid succession during one pressure of the trigger and that, on
January 1, 1978, was registered as a restricted weapon and formed part of a gun
collection in Canada of a genuine gun collector. . . . [Emphasis added.] 

 

""Capable"" is used in
isolation from terms such as ""adapted"", ""altered"",
""designed"", and ""intended"" -- terms which more clearly
refer to future ability. This limits ""capable"" to present ability. 
Curiously, the only time rapid firing ability is referred to in association with
the phrase ""designed, altered or intended"" is in para. (c) in
the definition of ""restricted weapon"" (the grandfathering provision).

 

                   The recent
amendment of the definition of ""prohibited weapon"" (S.C. 1991, c. 40,
s. 2) has not clarified the meaning of ""capable"".

 

""prohibited
weapon"" means 

 

. . .

 

(c)               any
firearm, not being a restricted weapon described in paragraph (c) or (c.1)
of the definition of that expression in this subsection, that is capable of, or
assembled or designed and manufactured with the capability of, firing
projectiles in rapid succession during one pressure of the trigger, whether
or not it has been altered to fire only one projectile with one such pressure.
. . .  [Emphasis added.]

 

The effect of the amendment is that
there are now two categories of weapons classed as ""prohibited"" under
para. (c):

 

(i)firearms
capable of firing projectiles in rapid succession during one pressure of the
trigger

 

(ii)firearms
assembled or designed and manufactured with the capability of firing in rapid
succession during one pressure of the trigger regardless of whether they have
been so altered.

 

The respondent submits that the second
category includes only firearms that were originally fully automatic but now
downgraded to fire a single shot at a time. Such weapons are clearly prohibited
by that amendment.  In contrast, the appellant submits that the second category
also covers semi-automatic firearms that may be upgraded to full automation.
However, a broad interpretation of ""capable"" in the first category,
the only category in the unamended definition, catches all convertible weapons,
both converted fully automatics and convertible semi-automatics.  The amendment
is redundant unless ""capable"" is restricted to present firing ability.

 

                   In R. v.
Zeolkowski, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1378, this Court recognized the policy behind
firearms control legislation. See Sopinka J. at p. 1383:

 

While
firearms have been regulated in some form in Canada since 1892, the amendments
of 1977 were intended as a more comprehensive approach to protecting the public
from firearm misuse (Hawley, Canadian Firearms Law (1988), at p. 2). In
my opinion, Lane Co. Ct. J. accurately stated the purpose of legislation in R.
v. Anderson (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 439, at p. 447:

 

The
recognized intent of s. 98 as a whole is to remove, or to prevent the
acquisition of firearms from those members of the population who have committed
offences, or who it may be reasonably anticipated may commit an offence.

 

A narrow interpretation of
""capable"" does not thwart the concern for public protection. Those
weapons that would have been classified as prohibited under a broad
interpretation of ""capable"" in para. (c), are still highly
controlled under the Code as ""restricted weapons"".  An
applicant for a ""restricted"" weapons certificate must demonstrate to
the local registrar of firearms that the weapon's intended use falls within
narrow categories set out in s. 109(3).  If Parliament wishes to prohibit
semi-automatic firearms which are easily converted to fully automatic firing it
is open for Parliament to do so.

 

                   Section 84(1)  also
provides for the express classification of a particular firearm, as evidenced
in the Restricted Weapons Order, SOR/92-467, as well as in the various Prohibited
Weapons Orders.  Classification has the obvious advantage of specificity
and the elimination of judicial interpretation.

 

                   A broad
interpretation of ""capable"" may be acceptable in in rem
proceedings such as the present case, where the forfeiting of the firearm is
the only penalty.  However, the definition of ""prohibited weapon""
also applies in other circumstances.  Section 90 of the Code provides
for various possession offences of ""prohibited weapons"" punishable by
imprisonment up to ten years. Section 95 makes trade in ""prohibited
weapons"" punishable by up to ten years imprisonment. The definition of
""prohibited weapon"" is used in the Export and Import Permits Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. E-19 , the violation of which carries both monetary and penal
sanctions.

 

                   A ""prohibited
weapons"" conviction carries serious consequences for the accused.  Any
test based on capability extending to future alterations, which may be beyond
an accused's knowledge or skill, introduces an undesirable level of
uncertainty.  All persons are presumed to know the law.  That being so it is
incumbent on Parliament to ensure clarity in drafting penal statutes.

 

                   I would dismiss the
appeal.

 

//Cory J.//

 

                   The judgment of La
Forest, Gonthier and Cory JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Cory
J. -- I have read with
great interest the excellent reasons of Justice Major.  Unfortunately I cannot
agree with them.

 

                   On this appeal it
must be decided whether the Mini-Uzi submachine gun which is the subject of
this case should be classified as a prohibited weapon.  The decision requires a
consideration of the balance which must be struck between the protection of the
public from the potential scourge of killing from the use of automatic weapons
and the rights of the individual who, through possession of a prohibited
weapon, can become liable either to a conviction for an indictable offence
which, at the time, carried the potential of imprisonment for five years or to
a conviction on a summary conviction offence.

 

I - Factual Background

 

                   At the end of
August, 1989, Bernhard Hasselwander, the respondent, applied to the local
registrar of firearms in Guelph, Ontario, to register his Mini-Uzi submachine
gun as a restricted weapon.  Upon examining the gun, the registrar determined
that it was a prohibited weapon as defined by the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C‑46 , and seized it.

 

                   On September 26,
1989, the registrar applied to the Ontario Provincial Court for a declaration
pursuant to s. 102(3)  of the Criminal Code  that the seized Mini-Uzi
be forfeited and disposed of as the Attorney General directed.

 

II - The Courts Below

 

Provincial Court (Payne Prov. Ct. J.)

 

                   The Provincial
Court judge heard the testimony of the firearms expert, a collector of weapons
and the respondent.  On the basis of that evidence he made the following
significant findings of fact:

 

It
is obvious from the evidence with some minor work on the plate that the
obstruction could be removed, however, I am more influenced by the fact that
the entire trigger mechanism can be quite easily removed and replaced by a
fully automatic trigger mechanism and I am also influenced by the evidence that
the trigger mechanism from the replica weapon could be attached to the weapon
and it would fire in a fully automatic mode.  This aspect of the matter makes
control in itself almost impossible as there is no control over the sale of
replica weapons.  Constable Soley's evidence also indicated that alternate
parts were readily available from various sources and notwithstanding the
restricted aspect of some manufacturers parts supplies it does appear that the
adaptability of fully automatic parts to this weapon remains an easy exercise.

 

On the basis of these findings, Payne
Prov. Ct. J. held:

 

                   On
the evidence therefore, I am satisfied that notwithstanding that the original
manufacturer made this weapon as a semi-automatic and the fact that it was in
fact a semi-automatic when it was submitted to the authorities for registration
as a restricted weapon, it is my finding on the evidence that by reason of

 

a)adjustment
of the restraining plate or

 

b)replacing
the trigger mechanism with spare parts which are fully automatic or

 

c)replacing
the trigger mechanism with the trigger mechanism of a replica weapon this gun
will fire as a fully automatic.

 

Because
of this capability it is in fact a prohibited weapon and an order will go for
its destruction accordingly.

 

District Court (Higgins Dist. Ct. J.)

 

                   The District Court
judge found that the findings of the Provincial Court judge were justified and
supported by the evidence.  He found no error in the conclusions of the trial
judge and dismissed the respondent's appeal.

 

Court of Appeal

 

                   The Majority

 

                   The majority of the
Court of Appeal compared the definition of a  firearm to that of a prohibited
weapon.  It was noted that in the definition of ""firearm"" Parliament
had used the expression ""anything that can be adapted for use as a
firearm"" while in defining ""prohibited weapons"" they had used
the words ""that is capable of firing bullets in rapid succession"". 
The majority found that an inference could be drawn that there was an
intentional difference in the  wording of these definitions.  As a result, the
majority concluded that the word ""capable"" means ""capable in its
present condition"" rather than a capability which could be achieved by way
of an adaptation of the weapon.  The majority then set aside the orders of the
courts below: (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 225, 50 O.A.C. 186, 67 C.C.C. (3d) 426, 9
C.R. (4th) 281.

 

                   The Minority

 

                   Tarnopolsky J.A.
expressed the opinion that a firearm which could easily be converted into a
fully automatic weapon was a prohibited weapon within the meaning of para. (c)
of that definition in s. 84(1)  of the Criminal Code .  He cited and
adopted the approach that had been taken by the Alberta Court of Appeal in R.
v. Global Armaments Ltd. (1990), 105 A.R. 260.  He would have dismissed the
appeal.

 

III - Analysis

 

                   In 1989,
s. 84(1)  of the Criminal Code  included, among other things, the
following definition of a ""prohibited weapon"":

 

 

(c)  any
firearm, not being a restricted weapon described in paragraph (c) of the
definition of that expression in this subsection, that is capable of firing
bullets in rapid succession during one pressure of the trigger . . .

 

The same section defined a
""firearm"" as

 

any
barrelled weapon from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged
and that is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person, and
includes any frame or receiver of such a barrelled weapon and anything that can
be adapted for use as a firearm;

 

Section 102(3)  of the Criminal Code 
provides the authority for the seizure of prohibited weapons.  It reads as
follows:

 

                   (3)  Where
any restricted weapon, firearm or prohibited weapon that was seized pursuant to
subsection (1) is not returned as and when provided by subsection (2), a peace
officer shall forthwith take it before a provincial court judge who may, after
affording the person from whom it was seized or the owner thereof, if known, an
opportunity to establish that he is lawfully entitled to the possession
thereof, declare it to be forfeited to Her Majesty, whereupon it shall be
disposed of as the Attorney General directs.

 

                   Section 90(1)(a)
and (b) made it an offence to possess a prohibited weapon.  At the time
that section provided:

 

                   90. (1)  Every one who has in
his possession a prohibited weapon

 

(a)  is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding five years; or

 

(b)  is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   (2)  Every
one who is an occupant of a motor vehicle in which he knows there is a
prohibited weapon

 

(a)  is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding five years; or

 

(b)  is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   (3)  Subsection
(1) does not apply to a person who comes into possession of a prohibited weapon
by operation of law and thereafter, with reasonable despatch, lawfully disposes
thereof.

 

                   (4)  Subsection
(2) does not apply to an occupant of a motor vehicle in which there is a
prohibited weapon where, by virtue of subsection (3) or section 92, subsection
(1) does not apply to the person who is in possession of that weapon.

 

1.The
Approach that should be Taken to the Interpretation of the Definition of
""Prohibited Weapon""

 

                   We are dealing here
with the Criminal Code .  In days gone by it was a fundamental principle
of statutory interpretation that penal enactments should be strictly construed
so that any uncertainty as to the meaning or the scope of the law would be resolved
in favour of the accused.  See, for example, Cité de Montréal v. Bélec,
[1927] S.C.R. 535, and Winnipeg Film Society v. Webster, [1964] S.C.R.
280.  This rule has been modified and indeed transformed over the last fifty
years.  In his book, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (2nd
ed. 1991), Pierre-André Côté provides a helpful historical analysis of this
rule.  On pages 397-98, the following appears:

 

                   Historically,
the rule of strict construction drew its justification from a time when courts
had to temper extremely severe penal legislation.  Maxwell mentions that a
person who cut down a cherry tree in an orchard, or who was seen in the
presence of gypsies for a period of one month, could be sentenced to death (Maxwell
on the Interpretation of Statutes, 12th ed.,  London: Sweet &
Maxwell, 1969, p. 238).  Strict construction of penal statutes often meant
interpretation in favorem vitae.  The nineteenth century witnessed a
relaxation of penal legislation, and the death penalty ceased being the
standard punishment for serious crimes.  The reinforced presumption was
relegated to a subsidiary one (Livingston Hall, ""Strict or Liberal
Construction of Penal Statutes"", (1935) 48 Harv. L. Rev. 748, 752. 
Concerning interpretation of penal statutes, see:  André Jodouin,
""L'interprétation par le juge des lois pénales"", (1978) 13 R.J.T.
49; Stephen Kloepfer, ""The Status of Strict Construction in Canadian
Criminal Law"", (1983) 15 Ottawa L.R. 533).

 

                   As
early as the beginning of this century, Justice Lyman Duff, at that time a
member of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, observed that ""the rule
of strict construction, as applied to penal statutes, has been much relaxed (in
recent years) (McGregor v. Canadian Consolidated Mines Ltd.
(1906), 12 B.C.R. 116 (S.C.), 117).

 

                   The rule of strict
construction of penal statutes appears to conflict with s. 12  of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21 .  That section provides that:

 

Every
enactment is deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal
construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects.

 

                   The apparent
conflict between a strict construction of a penal statute and the remedial
interpretation required by s. 12  of the Interpretation Act  was resolved
by according the rule of strict construction of penal statutes a subsidiary
role.  In Bélanger v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 567, Cartwright C.J.
harmonized these opposing principles.  In so doing he cited with approval the
following words of Maxwell (The Interpretation of Statutes (7th ed.
1929), p. 244) at p. 573:

 

                   Where
an equivocal word or ambiguous sentence leaves a reasonable doubt of its
meaning which the canons of interpretation fail to solve, the benefit of the
doubt should be given to the subject and against the Legislature which has
failed to explain itself.

 

                   More recently,
Martin J.A., writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Goulis
(1981), 125 D.L.R. (3d) 137, employed this approach in interpreting the meaning
of a word in the Criminal Code .  He stated at pp. 141‑42:

 

                   This
Court has on many occasions applied the well-known rule of statutory
construction that if a penal provision is reasonably capable of two
interpretations, that interpretation which is the more favourable to the
accused must be adopted: see, for example, R. v. Cheetham (1980), 53
C.C.C. (2d) 109, 17 C.R. (3d) 1; R. v. Negridge (1980), 54 C.C.C. (2d)
304, 17 C.R. (3d) 14, 6 M.V.R. 255.  I do not think, however, that this
principle always requires a word which has two accepted meanings to be given
the more restrictive meaning.  Where a word used in a statute has two accepted
meanings, then either or both meanings may apply.  The Court is first required
to endeavour to determine the sense in which Parliament used the word from the
context in which it appears.  It is only in the case of an ambiguity which
still exists after the full context is considered, where it is uncertain in
which sense Parliament used the word, that the above rule of statutory
construction requires the interpretation which is the more favourable to the
defendant to be adopted.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Thus, the rule of strict construction
becomes applicable only when attempts at the neutral interpretation suggested
by s. 12  of the Interpretation Act  still leave reasonable doubt as
to the meaning or scope of the text of the statute.   As Professor Côté has
pointed out, this means that even with penal statutes, the real intention of
the legislature must be sought, and the meaning compatible with its goals
applied.  (See, for example,  R. v. Johnston (1977), 37 C.R.N.S. 234
(N.W.T.C.A.), aff'd [1978] 2 S.C.R. 391; R. v. Philips Electronics Ltd.
(1980), 116 D.L.R. (3d) 298 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd [1981] 2 S.C.R. 264; R. v.
Leroux, [1974] C.A. 151, and R. v. Nittolo, [1978] C.A. 146.)

 

                   In my view, any
uncertainty as to whether the word ""capable"" means either
""immediately capable"" or ""readily capable"", is resolved as
soon as the word is interpreted in light of the purpose and goals of the
prohibited weapons provisions of the Code.  Therefore, there is no need
to resort to the rule of strict construction in this case.

 

2.The
Purpose and Goals of the Provisions Pertaining to Prohibited Weapons

 

                   Let us consider for
a moment the nature of automatic weapons, that is to say, those weapons that
are capable of firing rounds in rapid succession during one pressure of the
trigger.  These guns are designed to kill and maim a large number of people
rapidly and effectively.  They serve no other purpose.  They are not designed for
hunting any animal but man.  They are not designed to test the skill and
accuracy of a marksman.  Their sole function is to kill people.  These weapons
are of no value for the hunter, or the marksman.  They should then be used only
by the Armed Forces and, in some circumstances, by the police forces.  There
can be no doubt that they pose such a threat that they constitute a real and
present danger to all Canadians.  There is good reason to prohibit their use in
light of the threat which they pose and the limited use to which they can be
put.  Their prohibition ensures a safer society.

 

                   The American
authorities should not be considered in this case.  Canadians, unlike Americans
do not have a constitutional right to bear arms.  Indeed, most Canadians prefer
the peace of mind and sense of security derived from the knowledge that the
possession of automatic weapons is prohibited.

 

                   This Court, in R.
v. Covin, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 725, determined that a purposive approach should
be taken in interpreting the definition of ""firearm"".  In that case,
the issue was whether a pellet gun from which several essential parts were
missing could be considered a firearm within the meaning of s. 83 (now
s. 85) and s. 82 (now s. 84) of the Criminal Code .  The
definition of ""firearm"" in s. 84(1)  includes ""anything that
can be adapted for use as a firearm"".  In deciding whether the instrument
in question fell within the definition of a ""firearm"", Lamer J., as
he then was, employed the purposive approach to determine the acceptable amount
of adaptation required in order for something to be considered a firearm.  At
page 729 of that case Lamer J. stated:

 

                   In
my view the acceptable amount of adaptation and the time required therefore for
something to still remain within the definition is dependent upon the nature of
the offence where the definition is involved.  The purpose of each section
should be identified and the amount, nature and the time span for adaptation
determined so as to support Parliament's endeavour when enacting that given
section.

 

                   It is equally
appropriate to utilize the purposive approach in order to determine the meaning
of the phrase ""capable of firing bullets in rapid succession during one
pressure of the trigger"".

 

3.  The Appropriate
Interpretation of the Definition of Prohibited Weapon

 

                   What then, should
""capable"" mean as it is used in the s. 84(1)  definition of
prohibited weapon?  It should not be restricted to the narrow meaning of
immediately capable.  Such a definition would mean that the simple removal of a
part which could be replaced in seconds would take the weapon outside the
definition.  This surely could not have been the intention of Parliament.  If
it were, the danger from automatic weapons would continue to exist just as
strongly as it did before the prohibition was enacted.

 

                   The word
""capable"" as it is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary
(2nd ed. 1989) includes an aspect of potential capability for conversion.  It
is defined as:

 

3.  Able or fit to receive and
be affected by; open to, susceptible . . . .

 

. . .

 

 

5.  Having the needful
capacity, power, or fitness for (some specified purpose or activity).

 

From this, it is clear that
""capable"" does in fact include a potential for conversion.  It is
then fair and reasonable to interpret the definition of ""prohibited
weapon"" as including a gun that has the potential to be readily converted
to a fully automatic weapon.

 

                   In French the term
""arme prohibée"" includes:

 

c)  toute arme à feu, autre
qu'une arme à autorisation restreinte décrite à l'alinéa c) de la
définition de cette expression au présent paragraphe, pouvant tirer
rapidement plusieurs balles pendant la durée d'une pression sur la détente;
[Emphasis added.]

 

Le Grand Robert de la langue française (2nd ed. 1986) defines the verb
""pouvoir"" as:

 

1.  Avoir la possibilité de, être
capable, en mesure de . . . (en raison des qualités de la personne ou de la
chose, ou en raison des moyens offerts par les circonstances) V. Capable,
état (en état de), même (à même de), mesure (en mesure
de), situation (en situation de), susceptible.

 

 

and:

 

3.  (En parlant de ce qui est
hypothétique, incertain, [. . .]).

 

Thus, it seems that the French
definition as well clearly conveys the idea that the word ""pouvant""
like ""capable"" includes a potential which has yet to be realized, a
future possibility as opposed to just an immediate capacity.

 

                   Yet, that potential
aspect must be given some reasonable restriction.  It is the proper role of the
court to define the meaning of ""capable"" as it is used in the
definition of ""prohibited weapon"" in s. 84(1) .  In my view, it
should mean capable of conversion to an automatic weapon in a relatively short
period of time with relative ease.  There can be no doubt that on the findings
of the Provincial Court judge, which are well supported by the evidence, this weapon
comes within that definition.

 

                   Nor can it be a
valid defence that a collector such as Mr. Hasselwander would never
convert the weapon.  Collectors are attractive targets for thieves who are
seeking these weapons with every intention of using them or selling them to
others who wish to make use of them.  Members of the community are entitled to
protection from the use of automatic weapons.  This can be accomplished by
giving the word capable given the definition set out above.

 

                   Major J. notes that
a conviction for possession of a prohibited weapon under s. 90  of the Criminal
Code  may now result in imprisonment for a term of up to ten years. (In
1989, the maximum term of imprisonment was five years.)  In his view, the
potential of imprisonment requires a strict construction of the statute.  With
respect, I disagree.  Automatic weapons or those which may be easily and
quickly converted to automatic status have such potential for killing and
indeed, mass killing, that their possession may properly bring consequences of
imprisonment.  It is because of their lethal potential that the definition of
""prohibited weapon"" requires a reasonable interpretation based upon
the wording of the section and the aim or purpose of the legislation. 
Furthermore, s. 90 permits the Crown to proceed by way of indictment or
summary conviction.  Therefore, an individual who is found to be in possession
of a weapon which he may not have realized was prohibited may be charged with a
summary offence and thus, if convicted, be eligible for an absolute discharge. 
Thus, I do not think that a strict interpretation of para. (c) of
the definition of ""prohibited weapon"", as it stood at the time of the
trial, was appropriate.

 

                   Nor can I agree
with Justice  Major's contention that the latest amendment to the section
indicates that the word ""capable"" should be given a narrow or strict
interpretation.  Rather, it should be viewed as a response to the perceived
need to remove any doubt as to the meaning of the word.

 

                   The reasoning in
other cases support the position that I have taken.  Thus, I am in agreement
with the reasons of Hart J.A. in R. v. Haines (1981), 45 N.S.R. (2d)
428, at p. 436, where he stated:

 

                   The
offences charged here against the appellant were the possession of prohibited
weapons.  In my opinion the determination of whether or not a particular thing
is a ""prohibited weapon"" is to be determined by applying the facts to
the definition contained in s. 82 [now s. 84] of the Criminal Code . 
If a firearm is partially or completely dismantled but can be rendered
""capable of firing bullets"" by the simple reassembly of its parts or
the making of some minor alterations to its works, I would think it could be
found as a fact that it was a prohibited weapon.  If, on the other hand, it was
in such a condition that it could not be made operable because of lack of all
parts or because of physical changes made to its structure which would be
difficult to repair that it may cease to be in fact a ""weapon"". 
There would have to be at the same time and place the necessary ingredients for
an operable firearm together with the ability to place it in operable form.

 

                   As well, I agree
with the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v. Global Armaments, supra. 
There the issue was whether the automatic weapons which had been converted to
semi-automatic guns should still be considered as prohibited weapons.  The
trial judge held that the guns could very easily be reconverted to their
original state and capability and therefore the guns retained their status as
prohibited weapons.  The Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge and
stated:

 

. .
. the learned Trial Judge has properly construed the intent of the legislation
in his interpretation of the definition of the word ""prohibited"" used
in s. 84  of the Criminal Code .  The modified weapons could be
reconverted in a matter of minutes to fire bullets in rapid succession during
one pressure of the trigger.  That is to say, that they never really lost the
characteristic or classification of an automatic weapon.

 

                   In R. v.
Ferguson (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 256, the Ontario Court of Appeal considered
whether a sawed-off shotgun constituted a prohibited weapon.  Although that
required the court to interpret a different definition from the one under
consideration in the case at bar, nevertheless, I think that the approach taken
by the Court of Appeal in resolving the ambiguity in that case is apposite. 
There the weapon was not operable since it was missing its ""firing
unit"", without which it could not discharge a bullet.  However,
Lacourcière J.A. stated (at p. 262):

 

                   Possession
is a continuing offence.  The evil that this section was designed to prevent
and the purpose of the section was obviously to suppress the possession of
devices, knives or firearms which constitute a particular danger to the public,
for example, silencers, switch-knives or, in the present case, under
s. 82(1)(d), a sawed-off rifle which can be easily concealed because
of its reduced length.  Because of the nature of the continuing offence of
possession of a prohibited weapon under s. 88(1) and having regard to the
purpose of the subsection, we are all satisfied that the acceptable amount of
adaptation and the time-span required to render the gun operable is longer than
that required for a s. 83 offence, where the adaptation has to be made on
the scene in order to support the charge of using a firearm during the
commission or attempted commission of an indictable offence or during the
flight thereafter.

 

                   The
expert evidence was that the firing mechanism was easily obtainable and could
be inserted in 30 seconds to one minute.  In view of that evidence we are
satisfied that the inoperable gun in this case could be adapted for use as a
firearm from which bullets capable of causing serious bodily injury or death
could be discharged and that being a ""firearm"" it was a
""prohibited weapon"" as defined in s. 82(1)(d).

 

He observed that it would be contrary
to the purpose of the legislation if, by removing a portion of the weapon, a
person could render his or her weapon inoperable and thereby avoid conviction.

 

                   Thus it appears
that in the majority of the decided cases the courts have properly considered
the purpose of the legislation.  That purpose is to protect the public from
these dangerous weapons that are designed specifically  to kill or maim
people.  Where a weapon can be quickly and readily converted to automatic
status, then that weapon must fall within the definition of ""prohibited
weapon"".  To come to any other conclusion would undermine the very purpose
of the legislation.

                   In the result, I
would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restore
the order of the Provincial Court judge.

(7) , 676(1) (a).

 

                   Appellant was
involved in a traffic accident.  Two blood samples were taken in hospital for
analysis of blood alcohol level ‑‑ one for the police and one for
independent analysis by the accused.  Some two months after the accident,
appellant was charged with two counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm (Criminal
Code , s. 255(2) ) and one ""over 80"" count (Criminal Code ,
s. 253 (b)).  At the same time he was served with a Certificate of
Analyst (CA) which revealed that he had had four times the statutory limit of
concentration of alcohol in his blood at the time the samples were taken.  The
Certificate of Analyst did not mention the existence of a second blood sample. 
In the six months between the time he gave blood samples and his trial,
appellant neither requested the extra sample of his blood nor applied to any
court for its release.  The appellant was served with a Certificate of
Qualified Technician (CQT) the day before his trial.  The CQT stated that the
taking of the two samples complied with the Criminal Code , and that a
second sample was taken to permit an analysis to be made by or on behalf of the
accused.  The delay in serving the CQT was apparently inadvertent, and the
Crown called the technician as a witness at trial.  The appellant was acquitted
of all counts when the trial judge refused to admit the CQT and the CA into
evidence.  With that the ""over 80"" charge fell.  The trial judge also
dismissed the other two charges for other reasons.  The Court of Appeal allowed
respondent's appeal and ordered a new trial on all counts.

 

                   Two questions arose
for determination.  First, what must the prosecution disclose to the accused,
and when, in order to have the benefit of the presumption that the reading in
the CA was the blood alcohol level at the time of the accident?  Second, what
action, if any, is necessary on the part of the accused to obtain the second
sample before the presumption is available?

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.

 

                   The accused had no
notice of the availability of the second blood sample until the CQT was served
the day before his trial.  The Court of Appeal was not empowered to overturn
this finding of fact because the Crown's appeal was limited to questions of law
alone by s. 676(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .  The trial
judge's finding was not alleged to be an error of law and was supported by the
evidence.

 

                   The availability of
the presumption and the admissibility as evidence of the CA and CQT, which do
no depend on the conditions governing the presumption, are two separate questions. 
The certificates are admissible if reasonable notice of the intent to produce
them and copies of them are given to the accused (s. 258(7) ) and they are
evidence of the factual allegations therein without formal proof of the
authenticity of the documents (s. 258(1) (h)(iii) for the CQT and
258(1)(i) for the CA).

 

                   The findings of
fact that the appellant was not given reasonable notice of the CQT, that the
usual practice of serving it or the Certificate of Qualified Medical
Practitioner (CQMP) when the sample is taken was not followed, and that the
Crown failed without excuse to execute and serve the certificate well in
advance of the trial were all supported in the evidence. It was well within the
trial judge's judicial discretion to find that service of the CQT the afternoon
before the trial did not in the circumstances constitute reasonable notice as
required by s. 258(7) .

 

                   The CA, which was
considered on the heels of the CQT and excluded without any independent ground
supporting that exclusion, should have been considered separately.  It was
served long in advance of the trial and was admissible.

 

                   Section 258(1) (d)
must be interpreted in light of the accused's right to make full answer and
defence and the Crown's duty to disclose all information reasonably capable of
affecting the accused's ability to exercise that right.  Disclosure must be
made early enough to leave the accused enough time to take any steps that may
affect that right and should be done before the accused elects a mode of trial
or pleads.  This obligation to disclose extends to information relevant and
necessary for the accused to decide whether or not to take such steps.  This
requires a determination by the reviewing judge as to whether the information
can reasonably be used by the accused either in meeting the case for the Crown,
advancing a defence or in making a decision which may affect the conduct of the
defence.  The Crown bears the burden of justifying its discretion to withhold
irrelevant or privileged information.

 

                   The statutory
presumption in s. 258(1) (d) requires that the accused know the
charge against him or her and know of the Crown's analysis evidence and be
informed of the existence of a second sample available for independent
testing.  Neither the CA nor the summons meets this requirement because neither
refers to the existence or availability for testing of the second sample. 
Since a certificate which is often the basis of conviction cannot be
cross-examined, the accused's only line of defence is to conduct his or her own
test of the sample.  The right to a sample must be a meaningful right to be
exercised or waived on the basis of relevant basic information.

 

                   Although the Crown
may be required to retain the second sample beyond the statutory requirement of
3 months and, therefore, the accused might have an alternative remedy under s.
605(1) of the Code, this is not a substitute for notice of the second
sample with the 3-month period.  Such notice would, however, satisfy any
production requirements of the Crown to produce after the statutory 3-month
period has expired.

 

                   The most
appropriate and convenient way to notify the accused of the existence of the
second sample is by serving the CQT or CQMP.  Notice can be effected by other
means, however, if it is to the same effect and it is proved in accordance with
the criminal standard that the accused was made aware in a timely fashion. 
(The criminal standard of proof applies because the admission of the evidence,
given the effect of the presumption can be conclusive proof of the accused's
blood alcohol concentration.)  The accused must receive the information with
enough time to apply for an order under s. 258(4).  The amount of time
reasonably necessary to do so is a question of fact.  The earlier the information
is provided, the better, and in most cases the CQT can be served when the
samples are taken.  If not served when taken, the CQT, or a notice advising of
the availability of the sample for testing, should be given when the summons is
served.

 

                   The appellant did
not have the information reasonably necessary for the informed exercise of his
right to obtain the second sample and hence the presumption in s. 258(1) (d)
was not available to the Crown.

 

                   The presumption is
available even if the accused takes no action to obtain the second sample.  An
interpretation consistent with the legislative intent must be adopted because
the plain and ordinary meaning of s. 258(1) (d)(i) would defeat its
legislative purpose which is to give the Crown the benefit of an evidentiary presumption,
given certain conditions, in order to facilitate the prosecution of drinking
and driving offences.  This purpose is inconsistent with making the presumption
subject to the caprice of the accused as to whether or not to exercise his or
her right to request the second blood sample.

 

                   The presumption
will not necessarily stand whenever the requisite notice is given, regardless
of other circumstances.  If the accused is not able to exercise his or her
right due to factors beyond his or her control, the application of the
presumption may be denied.  Being denied the benefit of the presumption
clearly, however, does not derail ""over 80"" prosecutions.  It simply
requires the Crown to prove them by recourse to the evidential tools on which
it would ordinarily have to rely in the absence of the presumption.

 

                   The Crown quite
rightly did not seek a new trial.  In the absence of the presumption in
s. 258(1) (d) or expert evidence of metabolic rates and
extrapolation to the time of the accident, the CA does no more than provide a
blood alcohol reading 2 hours after the accident.  Without the presumption
there was no evidence supporting the ""over 80"" count.  The Crown,
having relied on the presumption which it knew was disputed, could not seek to
set aside the acquittal and obtain a new trial in order to permit it to proceed
on another basis with new evidence.

Court was delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. -- This drinking and
driving case concerns the availability of the statutory presumption in
s. 258(1) (d) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 , that the accused's blood alcohol level at the time a sample of
the accused's blood was tested is proof of the accused's blood alcohol level at
the time of the alleged offence of driving ""over eighty"".  Section
258(1) (d) imposes several conditions on the availability of the
presumption.  The present appeal focuses only on some of these, namely what, if
anything, must be disclosed to the accused, and when must it be disclosed,
before the Crown may rely on the presumption, and whether a request by the
accused for the second blood sample (taken at the same time as the sample tested
by the prosecution) and its release to the accused are prerequisites for the
availability of the presumption.

 

Facts

 

                    On March 24, 1990,
the car the appellant was driving was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  At
the scene of the accident, the police formed the opinion that the appellant was
impaired, and demanded samples of his blood for analysis.  They did not demand
a breath sample because the appellant had some lacerations on his face and they
thought that the presence of blood in the appellant's mouth might affect the
accuracy of a breath sample analysis.  The appellant agreed to the blood sample
demand and was taken to a hospital where a nurse took the blood samples.  At
the hospital the appellant asked why blood samples were being taken; the
investigating constable told him that two blood samples would be taken and that
one was for police use while the other was kept for him in case he wanted to
analyze it later on.  The appellant was not charged with any offence at this
time, although the investigating officer told the appellant that he would be
charged with impaired driving in due course.  The trial judge found, however,
that in the circumstances the appellant did not have notice of the retention of
the second blood sample, a point to which I shall return later.

 

                   On May 22, 1990,
some two months after the accident, the appellant was charged with two counts
of impaired driving causing bodily harm (Criminal Code , s. 255(2) )
and one ""over 80"" count (driving with a blood-alcohol content of more
than 80 mg per 100 ml of blood -- Criminal Code , s. 253 (b)). 
At the same time he was served with a Certificate of Analyst (CA) which
revealed that he had had four times the statutory limit of concentration of
alcohol in his blood at the time the samples were taken.  The Certificate of
Analyst did not mention the existence of a second blood sample.

 

                   He was tried on
September 21, 1990.  In the six months between the time he gave blood samples
and his trial, he neither requested the extra sample of his blood nor applied
to any court for its release.  The appellant was served with a Certificate of
Qualified Technician (CQT) the day before his trial.  The CQT stated, among
other things, that the taking of the two samples complied with the Criminal
Code , and that a second sample was taken to permit an analysis to be made
by or on behalf of the accused.  The delay in serving the CQT was apparently
because of inadvertence, and the Crown called the technician (the nurse who had
taken the samples) as a witness at trial.  The appellant was acquitted of all
counts when the trial judge refused to admit the CQT and the CA into evidence. 
With that the ""over 80"" charge fell.  The trial judge also dismissed
the other two charges for other reasons.  The respondent's appeal was allowed
by the Court of Appeal which ordered a new trial on all counts.

 

Relevant Statutory Provisions

 

                   The statutory presumption
that the blood alcohol concentration at the time of testing the blood samples
is the same as at the time of driving is found in s. 258(1) (d) of
the Criminal Code .  The provisions in Part VIII of the Code
dealing with the use of evidence of breath and blood samples are, as McClung
J.A. in the court below described, ""long, convoluted and in some
instances, obscure"" (R. v. Egger (1991), 120 A.R. 360 (C.A.),
at p. 362).  Section 258(1) (d) provides as follows:

 

                   258. (1)  In any proceedings under
subsection 255(1) in respect of an offence committed under section 253  or in
any proceedings under subsection 255(2)  or (3) ,

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(d) 
where a sample of the blood of the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made
under subsection 254(3) or otherwise with the consent of the accused or
pursuant to a warrant issued under section 256, if

 

(i) 
at the time the sample was taken, the person taking the sample took an
additional sample of the blood of the accused and one of the samples was
retained, to permit an analysis thereof to be made by or on behalf of the
accused and, at the request of the accused made within three months from the
taking of the samples, one of the samples was ordered to be released pursuant
to subsection (4),

 

(ii) 
both samples referred to in subparagraph (i) were taken as soon as practicable
after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed and in any
event not later than two hours after that time,

 

(iii) 
both samples referred to in subparagraph (i) were taken by a qualified medical
practitioner or a qualified technician under the direction of a qualified
medical practitioner,

 

(iv) 
both samples referred to in subparagraph (i) were received from the accused
directly into, or placed directly into, approved containers that were
subsequently sealed, and

 

 

(v) 
an analysis was made by an analyst of at least one of the samples that was
contained in a sealed approved container,

 

evidence
of the result of the analysis is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
proof that the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time
when the offence was alleged to have been committed was the concentration
determined by the analysis or, where more than one sample was analyzed and the
results of the analyses are the same, the concentration determined by the
analyses and, where the results of the analyses are different, the lowest of
the concentrations determined by the analyses;

 

Subparagraph (i) refers to the request
of the accused, within three months from the taking of the sample, for the
release of the second sample.  The accused may apply for the release of the
sample by right within the three months.  Subsection (4) provides:

 

                   (4)  A
judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a court of criminal
jurisdiction shall, on the summary application of the accused made within three
months from the day on which samples of the blood of the accused were taken,
order the release of one of the samples for the purpose of an examination or
analysis thereof, subject to such terms as appear to be necessary or desirable
to ensure the safeguarding of the sample and its preservation for use in any
proceedings in respect of which it was retained.

 

                   The admissibility
in evidence of the CA and CQT are unrelated to the availability of the presumption,
and are governed by other provisions in s. 258(1) .  First, as to the CQT,
para. (h) provides:

 

(h) 
where a sample of the blood of the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand
made under subsection 254(3) or otherwise with the consent of the accused or
pursuant to a warrant issued under section 256,

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(iii) 
a certificate of a qualified technician stating that the technician took the
sample and the facts referred to in clauses (i)(B) to (D)

 

is
evidence of the facts alleged in the certificate without proof of the signature
or official character of the person appearing to have signed the certificate .
. . .

 

Clauses (i)(B) to (D) of para. (h)
provide:

 

(B) 
at the time the sample was taken, the medical practitioner took an additional
sample of the blood of the accused to permit an analysis of one of the samples
to be made by or on behalf of the accused,

 

(C) 
the time when and place where both samples referred to in clause (B) were
taken, and

 

(D) 
both samples referred to in clause (B) were received from the accused directly
into, or placed directly into, approved containers that were subsequently
sealed and that are identified in the certificate . . . .

 

Admissibility of the CA is governed by
s. 258(1) (i):

 

(i) 
a certificate of an analyst stating that the analyst has made an analysis of a
sample of the blood of the accused that was contained in a sealed approved
container identified in the certificate, the date on which and place where the
sample was analyzed and the result of that analysis is evidence of the facts
alleged in the certificate without proof of the signature or official character
of the person appearing to have signed it.

 

Finally, the admissibility of both the
CA and CQT is made subject to the notification requirement in s. 258(7) :

 

                   (7)  No
certificate shall be received in evidence pursuant to paragraph (1) . . . (h)
or (i) unless the party intending to produce it has, before the trial,
given to the other party reasonable notice of his intention and a copy of the
certificate.

 

Judgments Below

 

Provincial Court of Alberta, Reilly
Prov. Ct. J., September 21, 1990

 

                   Reilly Prov. Ct. J.
refused to admit into evidence either the CA or CQT because the CQT had been
served on the appellant the day before the trial even though the Crown had the
opportunity to serve it on him when the samples were taken.  Since only the CQT
made any mention of the existence of the second sample, the trial judge held
that:

 

. .
. [the appellant] has never had the written notice that there is a second
sample of blood available for him to test.  And I find that that does
constitute an abrogation of his right to make full answer in [sic]
defence and that the -- that because of that, Exhibit 2 [CQT] is not properly
in evidence and neither is Exhibit 3 [CA] because he has not had the background
which would allow him the proper opportunity in that regard.  And those two
items of evidence are ruled then, to be inadmissible.

 

The trial judge found as a fact that
the accused did not have notice of the second sample before being served with
the CQT.  Although the appellant had been told of the second sample at the hospital,
this did not constitute notice due to his injury and disorientation, and the
fact that the oral notice was only a conversation among a whole lot of other
conversation.

 

                   With the exclusion
of the CA the ""over 80"" charge fell because there was no other
evidence of the appellant's blood alcohol concentration.  Ultimately the
appellant was acquitted on all charges.

 

Alberta Court of Appeal (1991), 120
A.R. 360, McClung, J.A., Kerans and Egbert JJ.A., concurring

 

                   McClung J.A.
rejected Egger's contention that an application in court by the accused for the
second sample was a necessary precondition to the statutory presumption in
s. 258(1) (d) of the Criminal Code .  He held at p. 366
that if the accused were given a right of control over the use of the presumption
simply by not requesting the release of one of the samples within three months
of their taking, ""one suspects that the statutory provisions which guide
it might have said so and in explicit terms"".  McClung J.A. held that such
an interpretation went against the legislative intent, and rejected the holding
of Lambert J.A. in R. v. Aujla (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (B.C.C.A.),
that a request by the accused was a prerequisite for the use of the
presumption.  He concluded at p. 368 that s. 258(1) (d) does
not endow the accused with ""a silent veto over the later use of
certificate evidence arising from the analysis of the first sample"".

 

                   McClung J.A., at
p. 367, rejected as speculation the trial judge's finding of fact that the
accused might not have understood the oral notice police gave him concerning
the second sample immediately after the accident:

 

                   I
think the following facts are relevant.  Egger was told, after inquiry, of the
availability of the second sample for his use or that of his lawyer.  The judge
speculated that he might not have understood this but Egger did not say that. 
This all took place on March 24, 1989, [sic], at the Calgary General
Hospital and before the samples were taken.  On May 22, 1990 he was served with
a Certificate of Analysis which told him of the results of the analysis as well
as its intended use at his trial.  That trial took place on September 21, 1990,
some four months later, a period within which it was not unreasonable for him
to obtain the second sample if he disputed the accuracy of the laboratory
analysis of the first sample.  Clearly Egger was served with the Certificate of
Analysis within the three month window set out in s. 258(1) (d)(i).  On the
proven facts I do not see that Egger was either unfairly treated (apart from
his unnecessary arrest) or left uninformed about what he was facing from the
Crown.

 

Point in Issue

 

                   The issue in this
appeal is the proper interpretation of subpara. (i) of s. 258(1) (d). 
As indicated at the outset, two questions arise for determination.  First, what
must the prosecution disclose to the accused, and when must it do so, in order
to have the benefit of the presumption?  Second, what, if any, action by the
accused to obtain the second sample is necessary before the presumption is
available?

 

Analysis

 

                   Before dealing with
these questions, two preliminary points should be resolved.

 

1.  The Appellant Did Not
Have Notice of the Second Sample

 

                   The trial judge
found as a fact that before the service of the CQT, the appellant did not
receive notice so as to make him aware that a second sample was taken which was
available for testing by him or on his behalf.  The Court of Appeal overturned
this finding of fact.  It was not empowered to do so, however.  The Crown's
appeal to the Court of Appeal from the acquittal of the appellant was limited
to questions of law alone:  Criminal Code , s. 676(1) (a). 
There is no suggestion that the trial judge's finding amounted to an error of
law.  Since there was evidence which, if accepted, supported this finding, it
could not be characterized as speculation.  Therefore, I must proceed on the
basis that the accused had no notice of the availability of the second sample
until the day before his trial.

 

2.  Availability of the
Presumption and Admissibility of the Certificates

 

                   As I observed when
setting out the relevant statutory provisions above, the availability of the
presumption and the admissibility of the CA and CQT as evidence are two
separate questions.  The admissibility of the CA and CQT does not depend on
meeting the conditions for the presumption.  Unfortunately, there appears to be
some confusion of the two issues, and this is particularly apparent in the
decisions below in the present case.  McClung J.A. appears to have equated
unavailability of the presumption with inadmissibility of the CQT when he said,
at pp. 364-65:

 

If
we were to read s. 258(1) (d)(i) as [counsel for the appellant Egger]
urges, the blood samples and evidence of their content, although patently
relevant to the case, could not be evidence unless the accused had firstly,
requested release of one of the samples within three months of their taking
and, secondly, that the release had been ordered by a court under
s. 258(4).

 

Admissibility of the certificates of
analysis and qualified technician, on the contrary, is governed by
ss. 258(7) , which says that they are admissible if reasonable notice of
the intent to produce them and copies of them are given to the accused, and
ss. 258(1) (h)(iii) (CQT) and 258(1) (i) (CA) which say that the
certificates are evidence of the factual allegations therein without formal
proof of the authenticity of the documents.

 

                   Notice of the
Crown's intention to introduce the CQT, and a copy thereof, were only given to
the appellant on the afternoon of the day before the trial.  The respondent
notes that two days' notice has been held reasonable (R. v. Frizzell
(1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 499 (N.S.C.A.) (dealing with production of a CA in a
breathalyser case)).  The trial judge held that the appellant was not given
reasonable notice of the CQT, and in arriving at this conclusion he stressed
the facts that the usual practice of serving the CQT or CQMP at the time the
sample is taken was not followed, and that the Crown failed without excuse to
use the ample subsequent opportunity to execute and serve the certificate well
in advance of the trial.  This finding is supported in the evidence and it was
well within the trial judge's judicial discretion to find that service of the
CQT the afternoon before the trial did not in the circumstances constitute
reasonable notice as required by s. 258(7) .  The trial judge's ruling that
the CQT was inadmissible should therefore be restored.  This makes no practical
difference to the outcome, though, since the qualified technician testified at
the trial.

 

                   The CA is a
different story, however.  It was served long in advance of the trial, and
there is no reason to doubt its admissibility.  The trial judge cited no
independent ground for excluding it.  Rather, it was excluded directly on the
heels of the CQT.  The admissibility of the two documents should have been
considered separately.  Service of the CA four months before the trial
constituted, in my view, reasonable notice, and the trial judge thus erred in
excluding the CA.

 

                   It was necessary
for the sake of clarifying the issues to deal with these questions of
admissibility at the outset.  I must re-emphasize that my holding on the
admissibility of the certificate evidence has no influence on the availability
of the statutory presumption in s. 258(1) (d), which is the main
issue in this appeal and to which I now turn.  I will return to the
implications of my holdings on admissibility at the conclusion of my reasons.

 

3.  The First Issue: 
Notice Requirements of Section 258(1) (d)(i)

 

                   The Crown submitted
that s. 258(1) (d) does not require that the accused be advised in
writing or by any other means of the existence of a second sample which is
available for independent examination at his or her request within three months
of the time the sample was taken.  While the accused has the right to
production of the sample on request within three months, Crown counsel argued
that nothing requires the Crown to tell the accused of this right.  The Court
of Appeal held that having been charged and served with the CA within the three
months, and in light of the other circumstances, the appellant was aware of the
Crown's intentions and the presumption was available.

 

                   The interpretation
of s. 258(1) (d) must be approached keeping in mind the accused's
right to make full answer and defence.  It must be interpreted, where
reasonably possible, in accordance with the principle underlying this Court's
decision in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, that the Crown
has a duty to disclose to the accused all information reasonably capable of
affecting the accused's ability to make full answer and defence, and to do so
early enough to leave the accused adequate time to take any steps he or she is
expected to take that affect or may affect such right.  This obligation has
constitutional underpinnings deriving from s. 7  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms  which reflect

 

the
overriding concern that failure to disclose impedes the ability of the accused
to make full answer and defence.  This common law right has acquired new vigour
by virtue of its inclusion in s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  as one of the principles of fundamental justice.  [Stinchcombe,
supra, at p. 336.]

 

The Crown's disclosure obligation is
subject to a discretion, the burden of justifying the exercise of which lies on
the Crown, to withhold information which is clearly irrelevant or the
nondisclosure of which is required by the rules of privilege, or to delay the
disclosure of information out of the necessity to protect witnesses or complete
an investigation:  Stinchcombe, supra, at pp. 335-36,
339-40.  As was said in Stinchcombe, supra, at p. 340,
""[i]nasmuch as  disclosure of all relevant information is the general
rule, the Crown must bring itself within an exception to that rule"".

 

                   The trial judge
reviewing the Crown's disclosure decisions, and by backward extension the Crown
itself in exercising its discretion,

 

should
be guided by the general principle that information ought not to be withheld if
there is a reasonable possibility that the withholding of information will
impair the right of the accused to make full answer and defence, unless the
non-disclosure is justified by the law of privilege.  [Stinchcombe, at
p. 340.]

 

One measure of the relevance of
information in the Crown's hands is its usefulness to the defence:  if it is of
some use, it is relevant and should be disclosed -- Stinchcombe, supra,
at p. 345.  This requires a determination by the reviewing judge that
production of the information can reasonably be used by the accused either in
meeting the case for the Crown, advancing a defence or otherwise in making a
decision which may affect the conduct of the defence such as, for example,
whether to call evidence.

 

                   Finally, as to the
timing of disclosure, the Court held in Stinchcombe that initial
disclosure should occur before the accused is called upon to elect the mode of
trial or to plead.  The reason for this was that ""[t]hese are crucial
steps which the accused must take which affect his or her rights in a
fundamental way"" (at p. 342).  This reasoning does not apply just to
the fundamental steps of election or pleading, but to any situation in which
the accused is expected to take steps which affect or may affect his or her
right to make full answer and defence.  The Crown's disclosure obligation in
such circumstances extends at least to the disclosure of information which is
relevant and necessary for the accused to make a decision whether or not to
take such steps.

 

                   Applying the
foregoing principles to the interpretation of the statutory presumption in
s. 258(1) (d), the legislation requires, in my view, that the
accused have knowledge of the charge against him or her, the analysis evidence
upon which the Crown intends to rely and the existence of a second sample
available for testing by him before the presumption becomes available.  This
holding is a natural extension of the existing case law and is necessary to
make the accused's statutory right to demand the second sample meaningful.  The
statutory right to demand and have production of the second sample is contained
in s. 258(1) (d)(i) and (4), reproduced above.  The right to obtain
the second sample is a reflection of the concern of Parliament both with regard
to the potential conclusiveness of this form of evidence and its source.  The
combined operation of the various statutory provisions relating to impaired
driving often results in the conviction of the accused on the basis of several
certificates.  The basis of these certificates is a body substance emanating
from the accused.  Since a certificate cannot be cross-examined, the only line
of defence is the ability on the part of the accused to conduct his or her own
test of the sample.  The right to a sample must, therefore, have been intended
to be a meaningful right to be exercised or waived on the basis of relevant
basic information.

 

                   The case law has
developed in this direction.  In R. v. Aujla, supra, the majority
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that the Crown could not rely on
the presumption where, although a Certificate of Qualified Medical Practitioner
(CQMP) was served on the accused when the samples were taken, the CA and the
summons were not served within three months.  The CQMP serves basically the
same purpose as the CQT, depending on whether a nurse or a doctor draws the
blood samples.  Like the CQT, the CQMP states, inter alia, that there is
a second sample available to the accused.  Taggart J.A. held at
p. 487 (Toy J.A., concurring) that:

 

                   Section
241(1)(d) [258(1)(d)] imposes no obligations on the [accused].  If the
person from whom the two samples of blood are taken wishes to have one of them
analyzed he must act under s. 241(4) [258(4)] within three months of the
taking of the samples.  As I view the matter, his decision to do so must be one
made on the basis of information as to what, if any, charges he faces and what,
if any, evidence by way of an analyst's certificate is relied on by the Crown
as supporting its allegations.  Until he has such information he cannot make an
informed decision.

 

In R. v. Montgomery (1992), 70
C.C.C. (3d) 229 (Ont. C.A.), the Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with Taggart
J.A.  In that case the accused was not served with the summons, CA or CQMP
within the three-month period and, even though the delay was for compassionate
reasons, the Crown was denied the presumption for the following reasons at
pp. 237-38:

 

Given
the factual circumstances of this case, as the summary conviction appeal court
judge properly concluded, the respondent cannot be said to have received notice
either of the charges that had been or were to be brought against him, or of
the analyst's certificate in support of those charges upon which the Crown
intended to rely as evidence, before the expiration of the period during which
the statutory right to production must be exercised.

 

                   In
my opinion, the respondent was not obliged to decide in advance of such
notification whether or not to request a blood sample.  At that stage, he had
no practical reason to make such a request, and could not reasonably be expected
to do so.  A decision of this nature will realistically depend on an accused's
knowledge of the precise charges he or she faces and the certificate evidence
upon which the Crown proposes to rely.  The fact that service of the summons or
the certificate may have been delayed for compassionate reasons seems to me
immaterial in construing provisions of a penal statute which confer rights on
an accused that can only be exercised within a specific time period. Since that
time period had passed before the respondent in this case was made aware of the
charges against him and the certificate evidence upon which the Crown relied,
and since he, therefore, was not in a position within the three-month period
set by the Code to make an informed decision on whether to exercise his
right to request production of one of his blood samples, he was effectively
denied the opportunity of invoking the procedure required to obtain the
mandatory release of the sample to which he was clearly entitled under
s. 258(1) (d).

 

The court rejected the Crown's
argument that this holding would place an effective three-month limitation
period on ""over 80"" charges.  As the court held in that case, these
requirements only affect the availability of the presumption (see pp. 238-39). 
They do not affect admissibility of the certificate evidence and thus do not
preclude the successful prosecution of ""over 80"" charges in the event
that the presumption is unavailable.

 

                   The case of R.
v. Corning (1987), 81 N.S.R. (2d) 53 (C.A.), is not inconsistent with these
principles.  There the accused was tried within three months, after having been
served with the summons, CA and CQT.  He argued that the presumption could not
arise because the three months in which he could apply for the second sample
had not expired and he had not yet requested the sample.  That contention was
rejected.  Putting the facts of the case in terms of the requirements
enunciated in the above cases, the accused had notice of the charges and the
certificate evidence and thus had the opportunity to make an informed
decision.  His failure to choose to demand the sample should not deprive the
Crown of the presumption, a point which I will discuss further below.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
in this case did not dispute the correctness of these principles, but actually
cited them with approval.  McClung J.A. held that the presumption's
notification conditions were satisfied in this case, in that the appellant was
served with the summons and the CA within the three- month period and that in
any event he did have actual knowledge of the availability of the second sample
by virtue of his discussion with the constable at the hospital.  As I have held
that the trial judge's finding that the appellant did not have notice of the
second sample should not be disturbed, the question is reduced to whether
notice of the charges and the analyst's certificate within the three months is
sufficient to allow the Crown the benefit of the statutory presumption.

 

                   I conclude that
service of the CA and notice of the precise charges are not exhaustive of the
notice requirements under s. 258(1) (d).  The rationale behind the
holdings in Aujla and Montgomery, supra, is that the
accused must have sufficient information to make an informed decision as to the
exercise of the right to demand the second sample.  In Aujla the accused
had already been served with the CQMP so the issue of the effect of absence of
notice of the second sample did not arise.  In Montgomery, none of the
relevant information had been communicated to the accused, and the failure to
serve the CA and summons was a sufficient ground for the holding in that case. 
Neither case precludes, in my view, holding that the accused must know that
there is a sample available to him or her in order to exercise his or her right
intelligently.  Indeed, such knowledge is basic to the right:  how can the
accused make an informed decision without knowledge of the existence of the
very thing to which he or she has a right of access?  If the accused is unaware
of the existence of the sample, the very purpose of his or her statutory right 
-- to give him or her the benefit of independent analysis is, as the appellant
submits, thwarted.

 

                   What is required,
then, for the presumption of the blood alcohol level at the time of driving to
arise (subject to satisfaction of the other conditions spelled out in
s. 258(1) (d)), is that the accused have notice within the
three-month window that he or she is charged with an impaired driving offence,
that the Crown has had a sample of the accused's blood analyzed and that a
second sample was taken and is available to permit an analysis of it by or on
behalf of the accused.  To put it more simply, the accused must have notice
that a second sample is available for testing and that there is reason
(consisting in the jeopardy of criminal charges and the results of the Crown's
blood sample analysis) to obtain it.  Service of the CA and summons do not meet
this requirement because neither document refers to the existence or
availability for testing of the second sample.

 

                   This is consonant
with the Crown's disclosure obligation as enunciated in Stinchcombe, supra. 
The existence and availability for testing of the second sample is clearly
information that is reasonably capable of being used to test the Crown's case. 
Indeed, in this type of case, it is a statutory substitute for the right which
would otherwise exist to cross-examine an expert witness.  The accused is
placed in a situation in which he or she is expected to take steps which affect
or may affect his or her right to make full answer and defence:  within the
three-month period the accused may demand production as of right of a blood
sample which may provide evidence to rebut the presumption in s. 258(1) (d). 
Moreover, an interpretation of the legislation favouring early disclosure of
the availability of the sample is consistent with another point made in Stinchcombe,
supra, at p. 334:  in a significant portion of cases, access to the
second sample will save time and expense by demonstrating the strength or
weakness of the Crown's case and encouraging guilty pleas or withdrawal of
charges, as the case may be.

 

                   Furthermore, it was
suggested in argument that the accused's right to make full answer and defence
might be irreparably prejudiced if the accused were not notified of the
existence of the second sample before the three months pass by, since after
that time the Crown may destroy the samples:  Corning, supra, at
p. 54.  The Code only requires the second sample to be retained for
three months, after which time the accused does not have a statutory right of
access to it and there is no further statutory obligation to retain it.  There
may, however, be an obligation to retain the sample beyond the three-month
period based on the disclosure requirement resulting from Stinchcombe
referred to above.  Accordingly, if the sample is retained for a longer period,
the accused may be able to move for production of it in the discretion of a
judge under s. 605(1) of the Code, which allows for the release of
exhibits for examination and testing:  see, e.g., R. v. Hackie (1988), 8
M.V.R. (2d) 222 (Man. Prov. Ct.).  An ordinary production request or an
application for Charter  relief may also be available.  This does not
mean that these alternative remedies can be relied on by the Crown as a
substitute for notice of the second sample.  In this regard, I would adopt the
reasoning of Robins J.A. in Montgomery, supra, at p. 238,
with respect to the significance on the rights of the accused of other
remedies:

 

While
the respondent is not necessarily without a remedy once the three-month period
expires, s. 258(1) (d)(i) and (4) provide a summary procedure by
which he, as a person from whom blood samples have been lawfully taken, may
obtain mandatory production of a sample to allow for independent examination or
analysis.  He was entitled to avail himself of the procedure established by
these sections for the benefit of an accused charged under s. 253 , and was
not required to resort to other means in order to obtain the sample to which he
was statutorily entitled.

 

                   If an accused is
given timely notice of the existence of a second sample, as provided in these
reasons, absent special circumstances, any disclosure requirement based on Stinchcombe
would be satisfied and failure on the part of the accused to exercise the right
to request production within the three-month period would foreclose any
complaint that the prosecution was unable to produce the sample by reason of
its destruction following the expiry of the three-month period.

 

                   With respect to the
requirement to notify the accused within the three‑month period of the
existence of the second sample, the most appropriate and convenient way to
notify the accused is by service of the CQT (or CQMP, as the case may be),
which states that the qualified technician ""took an additional sample of
the blood of the said person to permit an analysis of one of the samples to be
made by or on behalf of this person"" (to quote from the CQT the appellant
received).  I would note that in this case the investigating constable
testified that the usual practice is to fill out and serve the CQT on the
person at the hospital when the samples are taken, and that this practice was
not observed because there were no blank certificates available.  I would not
rule out notice by other means so long as it is to the same effect and it is
proved in accordance with the criminal standard that the accused was made aware
in a timely fashion.  Indeed, it has been established in the breathalyser
jurisprudence that entitlement to the presumption does not depend on using the
CQT but may still arise when the technician gives oral testimony to the same
effect (Lightfoot v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 566, at pp. 568-69,
575).  In such circumstances, no CQT may exist and notice must be given by
means other than service of the CQT.

 

                   I have referred to
the fact that the criminal standard of proof applies.  When notice is given by
means of service of the CQT, there will usually be no difficulty in meeting
this standard.  It may assume greater significance in a case such as this in
which notice is alleged to have been given orally or by means other than
service of the CQT.  While proof on a balance of probabilities is an acceptable
standard in deciding a preliminary question of fact with respect to the
admissibility of evidence (see R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, the
general rule with respect to determination of vital issues in the criminal
process requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  See R. v. Gardiner,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, at p. 415.  The issue here is very different from a
question of admissibility of evidence.  The effect of satisfying the burden of
proving preliminary facts to the admissibility of evidence is only that the
evidence is admitted:  it determines neither the weight of the evidence nor the
guilt of the accused.  This occurs in the next step in the process during which
the Crown must satisfy its legal burden.  When admission of the evidence may itself
have a conclusive effect with respect to guilt, the criminal standard is
applied.  This accounts for the application of this standard with respect to
the admission of confessions (see Ward v. The Queen, [1979] 2
S.C.R. 30, at p. 40, per Spence J., for the Court, and Rothman
v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at pp. 670, 674-75, per
Martland J., for the majority, and at p. 696, per Lamer J. (as he
then was), concurring).  Establishing the facts which trigger a presumption
with respect to a vital issue relating to innocence or guilt is a step further
advanced than the admissibility of evidence and is only reached after crossing
the hurdle of admissibility.  The effect of the presumption in this case is to
provide conclusive proof of the accused's blood alcohol concentration at the
critical time, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  This conclusion
respecting the application of the criminal standard is supported by the view
which has been taken relating to the presumption which arises by virtue of
s. 258(1) (a).  In R. v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R. 303,
confirmed in this regard by R. v. Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3, per
Dickson C.J., at p. 13, it was accepted that ""[t]he presumption was
included to allow the Crown to prove care or control by proving beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused occupied the driver's seat"".

 

                   As to timeliness of
the notice, the accused must receive the information with enough time to
exercise the right.  In practical terms this means that the accused must
receive it in time to apply for an order under s. 258(4).  The amount of
time reasonably necessary to do so is a question of fact that does not arise in
this case.  Without derogating from this statement, I make the following
additional comments in order to simplify proof and to avoid unnecessary factual
disputes.  The earlier the information is provided, the better, and in most
cases there will be no obstacle to serving the CQT at the time the samples are
taken, which accords with standard practice in some jurisdictions.  If the CQT
is not served when the samples are taken, then the CQT, or a notice advising of
the availability of the sample for testing, should be given when the summons is
served.

 

                   Applying the above
reasoning to this case, the appellant did not have the information reasonably
necessary for the informed exercise of his right to obtain the second sample
and hence the presumption in s. 258(1) (d) was not available to the
Crown.

 

4.  The Second Issue: 
Demand by the Accused

 

                   The appellant
submits in the alternative that Lambert J.A., in Aujla, supra,
(alone in taking this position) was right to hold that the presumption is not
available unless a court has ordered the release of the second sample at the
request of the accused made within the three-month period:  Aujla, supra,
per Lambert J.A., at p. 490.  This submission must, in my opinion,
fail.  The language of s. 258(1) (d)(i) is problematic in this
regard.  To repeat the subparagraph for convenience, it provides:

 

258. (1)  . . .

 

(d)  .
. .

 

(i) 
at the time the sample was taken, the person taking the sample took an
additional sample of the blood of the accused and one of the samples was
retained, to permit an analysis thereof to be made by or on behalf of the
accused and, at the request of the accused made within three months from the
taking of the samples, one of the samples was ordered to be released pursuant
to subsection (4) . . . .

 

It has been observed that this
provision is ""at best, poorly drafted, and at worst, potentially out of
[harmony] with the legislative framework in which it appears"": 
Renee M. Pomerance, ""`Over 80' and Under Scrutiny:  Selected Charter
Issues in Drinking and Driving Cases"" (1992), 4 J.M.V.L. 121,
at p. 167.  Indeed, this is a case where the plain and ordinary meaning of
a portion of the statutory language would defeat the legislative purpose and
therefore, an interpretation consistent with the legislative intent which goes
against the literal meaning of the statute must be adopted.

 

                    The structure of
s. 258(1) (d)(i) suggests that there are three requirements for the
presumption to arise (ignoring for the moment the requirements in the other
subparagraphs):

 

1.at
the time the sample was taken, the person taking the sample took an additional
sample, AND

 

2.one
of the samples was retained to permit an analysis thereof by or on behalf of
the accused, AND

 

3.at
the request of the accused made with the three month period, one of the samples
was ordered to be released pursuant to subs. (4).

 

                   This is not a case
of ambiguity, as the appellant contends in the alternative.  The meaning is
clear, and it is just as clear that this meaning frustrates the purpose of the
legislative scheme enacted by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1985,
S.C. 1985, c. 19.  I would adopt McClung J.A.'s holding in the court
below that the principal objective of the legislative scheme for the gathering
and receipt of blood and breath sample evidence is to facilitate, with
appropriate safeguards, the admission of the evidence and not to exclude it. 
At a more basic level, the intent of the legislative reforms of 1985, which
introduced the provision currently under consideration, was to allow the more
effective prosecution of drunk driving offences.  The legislation should be
given a reasonable interpretation in line with the legislative intent.  If the
plain meaning of the words of subpara. (i) were given effect, the accused would
always be in a position to deprive the Crown of the evidentiary advantage the
legislation intended to give it, and every well advised accused would do just
that by choosing not to demand a sample.  The accused would, in effect, be
given a ""silent veto"" over the Crown's use of the statutory
presumption.

 

                   In my view, this
legislation fits into the principle of construction enunciated by Professor
Elmer A. Driedger in the following terms in Construction of Statutes
(2nd ed. 1983), at p. 105:

 

. .
.  If, notwithstanding that the words are clear and unambiguous when read in
their grammatical and ordinary sense, there is disharmony within the statute, .
. . then an unordinary meaning that will produce harmony is to be given the
words, if they are reasonably capable of bearing that meaning.

 

The purpose of s. 258(1) (d)
is to give the Crown the benefit of an evidentiary presumption where certain
conditions are met in order to facilitate the prosecution of offences which
involve driving while under the influence of alcohol.  Such a purpose is
inconsistent with making the presumption subject to the caprice of the
accused.  Even Lambert J.A., the sole authority relied on by the appellant in
this regard, recognized that his interpretation may not have been intended by
Parliament (Aujla, supra, at p. 490).  I would agree with
one commentator's remarks in a comment on Aujla, supra, that

 

such
an interpretation would obviously render nugatory the purpose of the
legislation.  To put it shortly, if compliance with s. 258(1) (d)(i) is
dependent upon accused persons requesting production of their blood samples,
one may query what would motivate an accused to do so.  [Rick Libman,
Annotation -- R. v. Aujla (1989), 13 M.V.R. (2d) 276, at
p. 279.]

 

                   The interpretation
most in line with the objective of the legislation and the Crown's disclosure
obligations is that arrived at in the previous section of these reasons, namely
that the accused must have notice of the existence and availability of the
second sample to permit reasonable time for an informed choice as to the
exercise of the right to demand production of the sample.  Requiring positive
action by the accused to exercise this right before the statutory presumption
becomes available would further neither the legislative intent nor the
accused's right to make full answer and defence.  Nor would it help to enforce
the Crown's disclosure obligation since that is accomplished by notifying the
accused of the existence and availability of the sample.  Under the
interpretation that I propose, the availability of the presumption would be
tied (as the reference to the right in the subparagraph appears to indicate) to
the accused's opportunity to exercise his or her right, without being hamstrung
by it.

 

                   One might object
that this allows the presumption to stand whenever the requisite notice is
given, regardless of other circumstances making the accused's right
meaningless.  This is not necessarily the case.  To give one example, in R.
v. Redmond (1990), 37 O.A.C. 133 (C.A.), the blood samples were accidentally
destroyed before the accused requested production of one of them.  The Court of
Appeal quite rightly denied the Crown the benefit of the presumption.  That was
a situation where the accused could not exercise his right because of factors
out of his control, and the court can always step in to deny the application of
the presumption in such circumstances.  The result in Redmond, supra,
was that the Crown was required to adduce viva voce expert testimony
extrapolating the accused's blood alcohol concentration and level of impairment
at the time of driving.  Being denied the benefit of the presumption clearly
does not derail ""over 80"" prosecutions.  It simply requires the Crown
to prove them by recourse to the evidential tools on which it would ordinarily
have to rely in the absence of the presumption.  As the Ontario Court of Appeal
held in Montgomery, supra, at pp. 238-39:

 

While
the Crown may lose the evidentiary advantage of the presumption in
s. 258(1) (d) and be precluded from using certificate evidence of
the result of the analysis as proof of the concentration of alcohol in
an accused's blood at the time the offence was allegedly committed, the Crown
remains free to prove the accused's guilt through viva voce evidence. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

5.  Implications for this
Case

 

                   The result of this
analysis is that the Crown was not entitled to the benefit of the presumption
in s. 258(1) (d) because it was not established on the facts, on the
criminal standard, that the appellant had received notice within the time
reasonably necessary for him to make an informed decision as to the exercise of
his right to demand the second blood sample, of the charges facing him, the
results of the Crown's blood sample analysis, and the existence and
availability of the second sample for testing by him.  On this basis, the
appeal should be allowed.  The respondent Crown did not ask for a new trial in
the event that this Court found that it was disentitled to the presumption in
s. 258(1) (d).  Without the benefit of the presumption, there was no
evidence supporting the ""over 80"" count.  The trial judge found that
the evidence on the other counts was insufficient to establish impairment
beyond a reasonable doubt.  Although I have concluded that the trial judge
improperly excluded the CA, this did not affect the result.  In the absence of
the presumption or expert evidence of metabolic rates and extrapolation to the
time of the accident, the CA does no more than provide a blood alcohol reading
two hours after the accident.

 

                   In the
circumstances, the respondent Crown was quite right in not seeking a new
trial.  In this respect, this Court is guided by the provisions of s. 45 
of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S‑26 , which
provides that when an appeal is not dismissed, we are entitled to make the
order that the court appealed from ought to have made.  In this case, the Court
of Appeal ought to have found that the presumption did not apply.  It properly
found that it was error to exclude the CA.  In the state of the record, could
the Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and direct a new trial?  In this
regard, it was bound to apply the principle expressed in R. v. Morin,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.  At page 374, the majority judgment states:

 

                   The
onus resting on the Crown when it appeals an acquittal was settled in Vézeau
v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.  It is the duty of the Crown to satisfy
the court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the jury
had been properly instructed.

 

                   I
am prepared to accept that the onus is a heavy one and that the Crown must satisfy
the court with a reasonable degree of certainty.  An accused who has been
acquitted once should not be sent back to be tried again unless it appears that
the error at the first trial was such that there is a reasonable degree of
certainty that the outcome may well have been affected by it.  Any more
stringent test would require an appellate court to predict with certainty what
happened in the jury room.  That it cannot do.

 

                   As I have explained
above, without the aid of the presumption, the Crown has no case and therefore
the accused would be necessarily acquitted.  The Crown, having relied on the
presumption which it knew was disputed, could not seek to set aside the
acquittal and obtain a new trial in order to permit it to proceed on another
basis with new evidence.  See Savard v. The King, [1946] S.C.R. 20,
at p. 49, and Wexler v. The King, [1939] S.C.R. 350, at p.
353.

                   The accused was
charged with first degree murder of an acquaintance.  He broke into the
victim's home early one morning and went to the basement, where he took and
loaded a 30.30 rifle, which he used to kill the victim's dog.  The accused, who
was a frequent visitor to the house, was aware that no one would be there until
the victim returned sometime around noon. He started ransacking the house,
found a .32 calibre pistol, loaded it with ammunition and placed it in his
belt. Later, he gathered together everything he had stolen and placed it by the
back door. When the victim returned home for lunch, the accused was still in
the house. The victim saw his slain dog and turned back towards the bathroom,
where the accused was hiding.  The accused came out of the tub and fired the
gun.  Eight bullets entered the victim's body.  Only one was in the area of the
legs; the rest were in the torso and neck.  After the shooting, the accused
took the victim's money and his car keys, placed the stolen goods in the
victim's car and drove away.  The accused was arrested three days later.  In
his statement to the police, he stated that he had gone to the victim's house
to break in and admitted that he had stolen money from the victim and from the
residence.  At trial, however, he testified that he had gone there only to ask
a favour from the victim.  He had then entered the house because of the heavy
rain and, once inside, had decided to steal.  He also testified that he had
aimed the gun at the victim's legs and that he had not intended to kill him but
was only trying to escape.  In cross‑examination, the accused testified
that the money which was found in his possession when he was arrested came in
part from his welfare allowance.  The Crown was allowed to adduce rebuttal
evidence on this issue and two welfare workers testified that the accused had
never received social assistance, and that his applications for welfare had
been refused.  In his charge, the trial judge told the jury that if they were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to kill the
victim and that the killing was planned and deliberate, they should find him
guilty of first degree murder.  The trial judge explained that the expression
""planned and deliberate"" meant a ""carefully thought out design
which precedes the carrying out of an unlawful act.  It is the commission of an
unlawful act after having thought about it.  In other words, . . . it
is a planned and desired act"".  The trial judge also instructed the jury
on second degree murder but not on manslaughter.  The accused was convicted of
first degree murder and the majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the
conviction.  This appeal raised three issues:  (1) whether the trial judge
erred in permitting the Crown to adduce rebuttal evidence; (2) whether the
trial judge adequately charged the jury on the ""planned and
deliberate"" nature of first degree murder; and (3) whether the trial
judge should have instructed the jury that manslaughter was an alternative
verdict.

 

                   Held (Sopinka J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and Cory JJ.:  The crucial question with regard to the admission
of rebuttal evidence is not whether the evidence which the Crown seeks to
adduce is determinative of an essential issue, but rather whether it is related
to an essential issue which may be determinative of the case.  If the rebuttal
evidence goes to an essential element of the case and the Crown could not have
foreseen that such evidence would be necessary, then it is generally
admissible.  Thus, if a statement is made during the course of a witness's
testimony at trial which conflicts with other evidence relating to an essential
issue in the case, rebuttal evidence will be permitted to resolve the
conflict.  Here, the rebuttal evidence was admissible.  The evidence of the
welfare workers goes to an integral element of the case and the Crown could not
have foreseen that the accused would testify as he did in light of his earlier
statement.  The bald admission of the robbery in the course of evidence, which
falsely coloured its nature and changed important details, cannot result in a
finding that the rebuttal evidence thereby goes solely to collateral issues. 
Evidence as to the details of the robbery formed an integral part of the
Crown's case and it was important that any confusion with regard to the
accused's statement and testimony on this essential issue be clarified.  This
could only be done by way of reply.  It cannot then be said that the rebuttal
evidence constituted a splitting of the Crown's case.

 

                   When the charge is
read as a whole, it is apparent that the jury was properly instructed on the
issue of planning and deliberation.  The trial judge's directions were quite
clear that these concepts were two distinct elements of the crime of first degree
murder, both of which had to be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

                   The trial judge did
not err in not putting manslaughter to the jury.  The killing in this case has
every indication of being a cold-blooded, planned and deliberate execution.  There
was no air of reality to the accused's defence of manslaughter.  It follows
that it would not have been appropriate to have left manslaughter to the jury.

 

                   Per Sopinka J. (dissenting):  The
trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to adduce the rebuttal evidence.  The
rebuttal evidence was not relevant to the accused's assertion that he did not
intend to kill the victim, and it was wholly unnecessary to prove the robbery,
as this had been admitted by the accused's own testimony.  While the Crown had
the right to cross‑examine the accused on collateral facts, in order to
attack his credibility, having done so the Crown had to take the accused's
answers.  Put in context, the rebuttal evidence attacked the accused's
credibility on the sole question of whether he was a recipient of social
assistance, a collateral issue which was raised for the first time in cross‑examination. 
The Crown also argued that the accused made his credibility a central issue by
giving testimony which differed from his police statement.

 

                   In any case where
the accused testifies, his credibility will be on the line.  Allowing rebuttal
evidence simply because the accused has chosen to make his credibility an issue
is far too broad an interpretation of Krause.

 

                   An error of this
nature cannot be cured by application of the proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

                   The judgment of La
Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and Cory JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Cory
J. -- Two main issues are
raised on this appeal.  The first is whether the trial judge erred in
permitting the Crown to call evidence in reply.  The second, turns on the
adequacy of the instructions given to the jury on the critical aspects of first
degree murder, namely planning and deliberation.

 

I.  Factual Background

 

                   On January 20,
1986, the appellant Aalders, shot and killed Lawrence Ford in his home in
St. Basile.  Earlier that morning, Aalders had arranged with a friend to
get a lift to the Ford home.  His friend left him off some distance from the
house.  Aalders was a frequent visitor and was well aware of the family
routine.  He knew when he arrived at 8:00 a.m. of a weekday morning that nobody
would be home.  He was aware that no one would be there until Mr. Ford returned
to the house sometime around noon.  The appellant tried the front door but
received no response.  He then went around to the back door and by means of a
screwdriver that he had fortuitously brought with him, broke into the house. 
As soon as he gained entrance, he immediately went to the basement where he
took and loaded a 30.30 rifle.  He then returned to the main floor.  When he
had descended to the basement the family dog, Tuppy, loyally attempting to
defend the family home, started barking and continued to do so.  Upon his
return to the main floor, Aalders entered the bedroom where the dog was
barking.  There, he shot and killed him.

 

                   With the dog
silenced, the appellant started ransacking the house.  He went first to the
master bedroom and searched the drawers of the night tables and dressers by
emptying their contents onto the floor.  He found a .32 calibre pistol which
was not loaded.  He then located the clip for the pistol with two bullets in
it.  He continued to look for more ammunition for the pistol and finally shot
the lock off a chest in the basement where he found the ammunition.  In his
statement to the police, Aalders said that he loaded the .32 pistol
because it was not as heavy and cumbersome as the 30.30 rifle.  He placed the loaded
pistol in his belt before running back upstairs.  He did this he said, in case
anyone should come into the house as he did not want to get caught.

 

                   While looking for
ammunition in the closets of the house Aalders had discovered jars full of
money.  Thus, after finding and loading the pistol, he returned to the bedroom
and took the jars down from the closets in the master bedroom.  He then went to
the bedroom of Laura Jane Ford, the daughter of the victim, where he
found some more money which he also took.  He then went back downstairs and
located several bags into which he put the money and the other weapons (the
shotguns and the rifle) which he had found in the house.  For nourishment he
took three bottles of wine which he placed in portable bars and two bags of
cookies.

 

                   Some of the money
which was taken from the Ford residence consisted of old Canadian and American
bills which the victim and his daughter had collected.  The total weight of all
the items seized from the house was 190 lbs.  Aalders placed all this material
on the floor beside the door by which he had gained entry.  He stated that he
intended to conceal the material in the woods near the home so that he could
return and collect it later.  Another inference which could be drawn was that
the robbery had been carefully planned to take place while the house was empty,
that Aalders required a car to carry the stolen property and that he was armed
and awaiting the return of Mr. Ford in his car around noon.

 

                   In any event, the
appellant testified that he went back upstairs and when he was in the bathroom
he heard the sound of a door closing downstairs.  With that he became aware
that someone else was in the house.  He stepped into the bathtub and drew the
pistol from his belt.  Aalders saw a shadow pass across the bathroom doorway
and then the reflection of a man's back appeared in the bathroom mirror.  The
man was standing in the master bedroom where the appellant had shot the family
pet.  When he saw the person in the bedroom turn around the appellant advanced
from the bathroom towards the bedroom with the gun in his hand.  He said also
in his evidence at trial that he pointed the gun at the legs of the person in
the room, closed his eyes and pressed the trigger.  He stated that he only
wanted to escape from the house and that he had not meant to kill the victim. 
However, it is of some significance that in his lengthy statement to the
police, Aalders did not mention that he aimed the gun at the victim's legs or
that he had only been trying to escape.  The autopsy revealed that of the eight
bullets that were fired into Ford's body, only one was located in the leg area
while the majority were in the torso and neck area.

 

                   After he shot the
victim, Aalders left the room and went out to Lawrence Ford's car.  When
he saw that the keys were not in the car, he went back into the home and looked
through Ford's pockets until he found them.  He took the keys and $50 to $60
which he found in the victim's wallet.  The appellant then took all the stolen
goods, including the rifle, shotguns and wine placed them in the trunk of the
car and drove away.  He was arrested three days later in Charlesbourg.

 

II.  The Courts Below

 

1.  The Trial Judge's Charge to the
Jury

 

                   The trial judge
explained to the jury that, according to the general rule, murder requires an
intention to kill according to the definitions set out in s. 212(a)(i)
and (ii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 , s. 229  (a)(i) and (ii)).  He advised the jury that they
must first consider whether the appellant had the intention to kill according
to that general rule.  If so, they must then consider whether this intention
involved planning and deliberation.  The trial judge stated that if they were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to kill the
victim and that the killing was planned and deliberate, then they should find
him guilty of first degree murder.  However, if they found that he
intended to kill the victim, but they had a reasonable doubt that the killing
was planned and deliberate, then they should find him guilty of second
degree murder.

 

                   The trial judge
provided the jury members with a written statement of the elements of the crime
of first degree murder.  The statement read as follows:

 

[translation]  In this case
the prosecution had the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, the
following constituent elements:

 

1. 
That the accused, Gifford Aalders, on or about January 20, 1986, at
Portneuf Station, District of Québec;

 

2. 
unlawfully caused the death of Lawrence Ford;

 

3. 
with the intent to cause his death or to cause him bodily harm that he knew was
likely to cause his death and was reckless whether his death ensued or not;

 

4. 
and he did this with planning and deliberation.

 

                   The trial judge
pointed out to the jury that if they struck out paragraph 4 in the above
statement they would have a list of the elements of second degree murder.

 

                   In explaining the
meaning of the term [TRANSLATION]
""planned and deliberate"", the trial judge stated:

 

[TRANSLATION]  In criminal law, this
expression means the carefully thought out design which precedes the carrying
out of an unlawful act.  It is the commission of an unlawful act after having
thought about it.

 

                   In
other words, one can summarize it by saying:  it is a planned and desired act. 
The person therefore commits a crime with planning and deliberation when he
planned it, when he foresaw this eventuality and when he prepared for it
accordingly, with full knowledge of it.  In other words, it was prepared.

 

                   The trial judge
then moved to a consideration of the exception under s. 213(d) (now s.
230 (d)) of the Code.  He told the jury that if they had a
reasonable doubt about the accused's intention to kill according to the general
rule, they should then consider the exception of s. 213(d).  If
they found the accused intended to commit robbery and caused the death of the
victim in the commission of the robbery, they should find him guilty of second
degree murder.  The trial judge also gave the jury a list of the elements
of constructive murder under s. 213(d) of the Code.  He
instructed the jury that if they had a doubt that the accused intended to kill
the victim, that it was planned and deliberate or that the elements of
s. 213(d) were present, they should acquit the accused.

 

                   In response to a
question from the jury on premeditation, the trial judge stated:

 

[translation]  I will
therefore begin by again explaining the meaning of the expression ""planned
and deliberate"" which can be summarized by the word ""planned"" or
the word ""planning"".

 

Often
instead of always using the full expression ""planned and deliberate"",
it is summarized by saying ""planned, prepared in advance, having thought
about it in advance, having thought about something in advance"", and
that's about it for planning.

 

He also stated:

 

[translation]  In criminal
law, then, the expression ""planned and deliberate"" means the
carefully thought out design which precedes the carrying out of an unlawful
act.  So it is the commission of an unlawful act after having thought about
it.  It is an act which is planned and desired.

 

                   In the result, the
jury found the appellant guilty of first degree murder.

 

2.  Court of Appeal 

 

                   The appellant
raised four grounds of appeal:  the admissibility of his statement to police,
the trial judge's charge on first degree murder, the trial judge's failure to
instruct on manslaughter and the admissibility of the Crown's rebuttal
evidence.  The Court of Appeal was unanimous as to the admissibility of the
statement, but Proulx J.A. dissented on the other three grounds:  [1991] R.J.Q.
2097, 69 C.C.C. (3d) 154.  (The appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court
on the admissibility of the statement but the application was dismissed on
February 6, 1992, [1992] 1 S.C.R. v.)

 

                   (a)  Proulx J.A.
(dissenting)

 

                   Proulx J.A. would
have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

 

                   (i) Planning and
Deliberation

 

                   Proulx J.A. held
that the charge to the jury failed to distinguish between planning and
deliberation.  He stated that the two elements are distinct and must coexist to
support a conviction for first degree murder:  R. v. Nygaard, [1989] 2
S.C.R. 1074, and R. v. Widdifield (1963), 6 Crim. L.Q. 152 (Ont.
H.C.).  Proulx J.A. stated (at p. 177 C.C.C.):

 

                   [translation]  While
""planned"" is understood in the sense of a calculated scheme, the
nature and consequences of which have been considered and weighed, it is still
necessary that the accused, by his deliberation, consider what he has planned,
that is, that he take the time to think about the effect of the act that he
proposes to do.

 

                   For Proulx J.A.,
""deliberate"" or ""propos délibéré"" had to do with
considered reflection once a plan has been formed.  He wrote:  [TRANSLATION] ""the process of deliberation
requires that the accused, as I pointed out, take the time to reflect on
it"".  Proulx J.A. also adopted the following statement from Pilon v.
The Queen (1965), 46 C.R. 272, [1966] 2 C.C.C. 53 (Que. Q.B.), at
p. 69 C.C.C.:

 

[translation]  . . .
the deliberate act [is] one proceeding from an intention and an intelligence
which knows the nature and quality of the criminal act.

 

                   Citing the cases of
More v. The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 522, McMartin v. The Queen,
[1964] S.C.R. 484, and R. v. Mitchell, [1964] S.C.R. 471, as authority,
Proulx J.A. determined that it is possible for a murder to be planned but
not deliberate, or deliberate but not planned.  Thus, in his view, if the
murder was planned but the final act was prompted by a sudden impulse rather
than consideration, it would not be deliberate.

 

                   Furthermore, Proulx
J.A. thought that if the murder took place as part of another offence, it was
essential, in the charge to the jury, to avoid any confusion between the
planning and deliberation required for the other offence, and planning and
deliberation required for first degree murder.

 

                   Considering the
whole of the charge to the jury, Proulx J.A. concluded that the trial judge
failed to make these distinctions.  The charge implied that
""deliberate"" was subsumed in the notion of ""planned"". 
Proulx J.A. stated:  [TRANSLATION] ""the trial judge ... only really submitted a single question to
the jury, that is:  was the murder planned, desired, premeditated?"" (p.
182 C.C.C.).  He also noted that the trial judge never defined
""deliberate"".

 

                   Proulx J.A. found
as well that the charge was not clear on the difference between the intention
to kill, and the further intention required for first degree murder.  In his
view by stating that [TRANSLATION] ""a planned murder is a desired or even prepared murder"" (p.
183 C.C.C.) the trial judge failed to distinguish between a premeditated
killing and an intentional killing.

 

                   Proulx J.A. thought
that if the jury was properly instructed the verdict would not necessarily be
the same in this case as the evidence left important questions unanswered.  For
example, did the appellant plan the murder?  Did he deliberate?  In Proulx
J.A.'s opinion, the answers to these questions must be left to a properly
instructed jury.

 

                   (ii)  The
Rebuttal Evidence

 

                   Applying the
principles set out in R. v. Krause, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 466, Proulx J.A.
held that the Crown's rebuttal evidence was not admissible, since it only went
to a collateral issue.  In his view, it was not enough that the evidence be
relevant; it had to be important or essential.

 

                   Proulx J.A. noted
that the appellant did not raise new facts in his testimony.  Rather, in his
cross-examination, the respondent introduced the idea that the money which was
found on the appellant when he was arrested came from his welfare allowance. 
The origins of the money was a proper question going to recent possession of
stolen property.  However, Proulx J.A. held that since the appellant had
already admitted that he had stolen money from the victim's person and from the
residence the testimony of the social services people was in no way essential. 
In his opinion, the rebuttal evidence went only to the credibility of the
appellant, and even though credibility was in issue, this did not make rebuttal
evidence on a collateral point admissible:  Krause, supra; John v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 476; Latour v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R.
361, and R. v. Perry (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 209 (Ont. C.A.).

 

                   (iii)  Manslaughter

 

                   Proulx J.A. held
that the trial judge erred in not allowing the issue of manslaughter to be put
to the jury.  In testimony, the appellant stated that he did not intend to kill
the victim.  Thus, since his intent to kill was an issue, Proulx J.A. thought
that manslaughter should have gone to the jury.  He stated that the trial judge
had an obligation to address all defences that arose on the evidence:  Lampard
v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 373, and Schuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 592.

 

                   (b)  Chouinard
J.A. (concurring with Tourigny J.A.)

 

                   (i)  Planning
and Deliberation

 

                   In light of the
evidence that the appellant knew the victim's daily routine of coming home for
lunch, the appellant's confession and his seizure of firearms as soon as he
broke in, Chouinard J.A. found that the defence theory (of surprise and panic
at the arrival of the victim) lacked credibility.  He stated:  [TRANSLATION] ""Accordingly, the verdict of
first degree murder rendered by the jury seems reasonable, in accordance with
the verdict that a properly instructed jury would have rendered in a similar
case"" (p. 158 C.C.C.).

 

                   While agreeing that
a premeditated crime could still be committed without deliberation, Chouinard
J.A. disagreed with Proulx J.A. that this was an issue in the present case. 
The appellant waited some four hours for the victim to come home, then shot him
eight times.  The Crown's theory was of long preparation and cold, lucid
execution of the plan.  Chouinard J.A. thought that this was a reasonable
inference to be drawn from the evidence and that it was irreconcilable with
fear, surprise and sudden impulse.  The jury obviously rejected the latter
theory.  Furthermore, Chouinard J.A. decided that when read as a whole, the
charge to the jury clearly distinguished the notions of planning and
deliberation.

 

                   (ii) The
Rebuttal Evidence

 

                   Chouinard J.A. held
that the recent possession of the car and the victim's possessions and money at
the time of arrest made the origins of these things an important issue even if
the theft itself was not contested by the accused.

 

                   (c)  Tourigny
J.A.

 

                   (i) The Rebuttal
Evidence

 

                   Tourigny J.A.
thought that in the context of the appellant's claims about the origin of the
money, the rebuttal evidence was admissible.  The facts here differed from Krause,
supra, where there was no evidence of a statement to police, the
contradictions only arose in cross-examination and where the credibility of
Krause went to a collateral point only.  Here, credibility was not incidental;
it was essential, going to mens rea.  Tourigny J.A. held that the
evidence of the social services people could not have been given in the Crown's
case, as the Crown could not have foreseen that the appellant would change his
story.

 

                   Tourigny J.A.
thought that this case was also different from Latour, supra,
where the accused made an alibi defence stating that he had never been to the
place in question.  The Crown brought rebuttal evidence that the accused had
been seen at the location some three months after the crime.  In that case, the
attack on credibility was collateral.  Here, in Tourigny J.A.'s opinion, the
appellant made his credibility a central issue by changing his story on his
intention to steal and intention to kill.

 

                   (ii)  Manslaughter

 

                   Tourigny J.A. held
that the trial judge did not err in not putting manslaughter to the jury as, in
her opinion, there was nothing in the evidence to support such a conviction. 
In any event, the jury decided that it was not second degree murder, nor
constructive murder, but rather, first degree murder.  Tourigny J.A. thought
that this verdict was reasonable, as long as the charge on first degree murder
was adequate.

 

                   (iii) Planning
and Deliberation

 

                   Tourigny J.A. cited
passages from the charge and also reproduced a document that the trial judge
had given to the jury.  This document set out the elements of the offence, and
referred to planning and deliberation as necessary to first degree murder. 
Tourigny J.A. concluded (at p. 174 C.C.C.):

 

                   [translation]  For my part, [I
have to say] I find no error in the instructions given by the judge.  Of
course, as I previously said, he did not each time repeat the exact words but
it appears to me however that, in light of the comments that he made and the
references made to the document he had distributed, the jury could not have
been led to understand anything else than that it was necessary to find the
presence beyond a reasonable doubt of all the constituent elements of first
degree murder, including ""planning and deliberation"".

 

III.  Points in Issue

 

1.Did
the trial judge err in permitting rebuttal evidence to be led by the Crown
concerning whether the appellant had been receiving social assistance?

 

2.Was
the trial judge's charge to the jury adequate with regard to the planned and
deliberate nature of first degree murder?

 

3.Was
the trial judge's charge to the jury insufficient in that he failed to put the
possibility of a conviction of manslaughter to them?

 

IV.  Analysis

 

1.  The Rebuttal Evidence

 

                   In Krause, supra,
this Court set out the principles governing the introduction of rebuttal
evidence.  The general rule is that Crown counsel, in cross-examining an
accused, are not limited to subjects which are strictly relevant to the
essential issues in a case.  Counsel are accorded wide latitude in
cross-examination which enables them to test and question the testimony of the
witnesses and their credibility.  However, where the questions asked by Crown
counsel are not relevant to an issue essential for the determination of the
case, the Crown is bound by the answers given and cannot present evidence in
rebuttal to challenge the statements made by the witness.  The reason for this
rule was stated by McIntyre J. in Krause at pp. 473-74 in the following
words:

 

This
rule prevents unfair surprise, prejudice and confusion which could result if
the Crown or the plaintiff were allowed to split its case, that is, to put in
part of its evidence -- as much as it deemed necessary at the outset -- then to
close the case and after the defence is complete to add further evidence to
bolster the position originally advanced.  The underlying reason for this rule
is that the defendant or the accused is entitled at the close of the Crown's
case to have before it the full case for the Crown so that it is known from the
outset what must be met in response.

 

However, an exception to this rule is
made when the defence has raised some new matter or a defence which the Crown
has had no opportunity to deal with in presenting its case and which the Crown
could not reasonably have anticipated.  McIntyre J. expressed the following
caveat to the exception on p. 474:

 

...
rebuttal will not be permitted regarding matters which merely confirm or
reinforce earlier evidence adduced in the Crown's case which could have been
brought before the defence was made.  It will be permitted only when it is
necessary to insure that at the end of the day each party will have had an
equal opportunity to hear and respond to the full submissions of the other.

 

He added the following comments
regarding the rule against rebuttal on collateral issues:

 

Where
something new emerges in cross-examination, which is new in the sense that the
Crown had no chance to deal with it in its case-in-chief (i.e., there was no
reason for the Crown to anticipate that the matter would arise), and where
the matter is concerned with the merits of the case (i.e., it concerns an issue
essential for the determination of the case) then the Crown may be allowed
to call evidence in rebuttal.  Where, however, the new matter is collateral,
that is, not determinative of an issue arising in the pleadings or indictment
or not relevant to matters which must be proved for the determination of the
case, no rebuttal will be allowed.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In the case at bar,
it has been argued that the rebuttal evidence served only to confirm the fact
that the appellant stole money from the Ford residence.  The appellant admitted
that he robbed the Ford home and therefore, it was argued, the rebuttal evidence
was not determinative of an issue which must be proved in order to come to a
decision in the case.

 

                   In my view, the
crucial question with regard to the admission of rebuttal evidence is not
whether the evidence which the Crown seeks to adduce is determinative of
an essential issue, but rather whether it is related to an essential
issue which may be determinative of the case.  If the reply evidence goes to an
essential element of the case and the Crown could not have foreseen that such
evidence would be necessary, then it is generally admissible.  Thus, if a
statement is made during the course of a witness's testimony at trial which
conflicts with other evidence relating to an essential issue in the case, reply
evidence will be permitted to resolve the conflict.

 

                   It is true that the
Crown cannot split its case to obtain an unfair advantage.  Nor should the
Crown be able to put in evidence in reply on a purely collateral issue. 
However, it is fit and proper that reply evidence be called which relates to an
integral and essential issue of the case.  In such circumstances, it would be
wrong to deprive the trier of fact of important evidence relating to an
essential element of the case.  The course of a trial, particularly a criminal
trial, must be based upon rules of fairness so as to ensure the protection of
the individual accused.  However, the rules should not go so far as to deprive
the trier of fact of important evidence, that can be helpful in resolving an
essential element of the case.

 

                   Let us consider now
the situation presented in this case.  It was essential for the Crown to
establish that the Ford residence had been robbed by Aalders.  It was necessary
to prove both that Aalders planned the robbery and that his killing of
Lawrence Ford was planned and deliberate.  The Crown was anxious to
establish the importance and significance of the robbery to Aalders.  Viewed
realistically the bulk and weight of the articles stolen were such that Aalders
had to obtain a vehicle to transport them.  That, in turn, required Aalders to
wait in the house for the return of Mr. Ford at lunchtime when he could shoot
him and take his vehicle.  Further, in order to demonstrate the significance
and importance of the robbery to Aalders it was necessary for the Crown to show
his possession of and his reliance upon the money he took from the Ford house.

 

                   In his evidence at
trial, Aalders testified that when he first came to the house he did not intend
to rob it but simply to ask Mr. Ford if he could get a ride with him from
the railway station later on.  He admitted that when he went into the house, he
committed the robbery, but he stated that the two five dollar bills, and one
two dollar bill which he had in his possession at the time of his arrest and
which appeared to be quite old, had been given to him by his mother or his
grandmother.  Yet the evidence given by the victim's son indicated that they
might well have come from collection of old bills that was kept by his father
and sister.  As well, Aalders testified that the $141 that he had at the time
of his arrest came from a welfare cheque which he had received and cashed. 
Thus the robbery was made to appear as something that was spontaneous, carried
out upon the spur of the moment and an incident that was relatively unimportant
to Aalders as he had alternative sources of funds.

 

                   The Crown would
have had no way of knowing that he would testify in that manner in light of his
earlier statement.  It is not a sufficient answer to say that Aalders admitted
the robbery because even though he did admit it, he denied important aspects of
the robbery.  This denial presented the robbery in a manner that was not only
more favourable to Aalders but also was false and misleading.  The evidence
from the welfare officials that he had never received welfare payments was
relevant and important because it would establish that the robbery was, in all
probability, the source of all the money in his possession at the time of his
arrest.  This evidence was also significant to the charge of murder as it could
lead to the reasonable inference that the robbery was of importance to
Aalders.  It can be inferred from the evidence that the murder of Ford in order
to obtain his car was an integral part of the robbery.  Evidence as to the
details of the robbery formed an important part of the Crown's case.  The
nature and details of the robbery did not constitute a collateral issue, but
rather an integral and essential aspect of the case.  In the circumstances of
this case, it was appropriate that the Crown call evidence in reply to
demonstrate the importance of the robbery to Aalders.

 

                   The reason for
permitting evidence to be led in reply in this case is not simply that the
reply will affect the credibility of Aalders for all testimony in a case will,
to some extent, be subject to testing for its credibility.  Rather, it is the
fact that the evidence goes to an integral element of the case coupled with the
recognition that the Crown could not have foreseen the accused would testify in
this way which makes the evidence admissible in reply.  The bald admission of
the robbery in the course of evidence which falsely coloured its nature and
changed important details cannot result in a finding that the reply evidence
thereby goes solely to collateral issues.  The statements given by Aalders to
the police which were admitted in the trial, varied from his testimony, and it
was important that any confusion with regard to the statements and his
testimony on this essential issue be clarified.  This could only be done by way
of reply.  It cannot then be said that the reply evidence constituted the
splitting of the Crown's case.

 

                   The appellant
relied upon two authorities to support his position.  The first of these was Krause,
supra.  As I have indicated, the admission of the reply evidence in this
case does not offend any of the principles put forward in Krause.  It
is, as well, important to take into account the very different factual
background which was presented in the Krause case.  Krause had testified
not only with regard to the circumstances which surrounded the murder but also
with respect to his involvement with the police during the course of the murder
investigation.  Crown counsel cross-examined Krause about his statements to the
police and then applied, pursuant to s. 11  of the Canada Evidence Act ,
to call rebuttal evidence at the conclusion of the case for the defence.

 

                   It was observed by
McIntyre J., writing on behalf of the unanimous Court, that the trial judge had
erred in admitting and permitting the cross- examination on the statement to
the police as there had been no inconsistent statement made by the accused in
the course of his testimony.  Furthermore, it was held that the evidence in
respect of which rebuttal had been permitted dealt with the accused's assertion
that the police had harassed him before his arrest.  This, it was found, was a
collateral issue that was neither material nor relevant to a decision as to
whether the accused had killed the victim.  It reflected only on the integrity
of the police and did not touch on the guilt or innocence of Krause.  That
factual situation is a far cry from the one presented in this case.  In the
case at bar, the reply evidence concerned an issue essential for the
determination of the case.

 

                   The appellant also
relied upon Latour, supra.  Latour had been charged with the robbery of
a jewellery store.  During the trial it was asserted that he had an alibi.  In
attempting to challenge this defence, the Crown asked Latour whether he had
ever been in a particular jewellery store on specified dates three months
subsequent to the robbery.  The Crown led rebuttal evidence relating only to
the collateral issue as to his presence in another jewellery store on a later
date.  There it was held that the rebuttal evidence should not have been
permitted as it did not deal with any issues relating to the robbery or to the
alibi or indeed to any other material issue presented in the case.  The sole
purpose of the rebuttal evidence was to discredit the appellant's testimony by attacking
his credibility on a purely collateral issue.  It was therefore improper and
inadmissible.  Once again that case is very different and readily
distinguishable from the one at bar where the rebuttal evidence dealt with an
essential issue that was integral to the Crown's case.

 

2.  The Adequacy of the Charge on
First Degree Murder

 

                   There can be no
doubt that the aspect of planning and deliberation are separate elements of the
crime of murder in the first degree, both of which must be established beyond a
reasonable doubt.  In More, supra, Cartwright J. (as he then was) stated
at pp. 533-34:

 

                   The
evidence that the murder was planned was very strong, but, as was properly
pointed out to the jury by the learned trial judge, they could not find the
accused guilty of capital murder unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt not only that the murder was planned but also that it was deliberate. 
The learned trial judge also rightly instructed the jury that the word
""deliberate"", as used in s. 202A (2)(a), means
""considered not impulsive"".

 

                   Other
meanings of the adjective given in the Oxford Dictionary are ""not hasty in
decision"", ""slow in deciding"" and ""intentional"".  The
word as used in the subsection cannot have simply the meaning
""intentional"" because it is only if the accused's act was intentional
that he can be guilty of murder and the subsection is creating an additional
ingredient to be proved as a condition of an accused being convicted of capital
murder.

 

                   It is the
appellant's contention that the trial judge failed to adequately distinguish
between the elements of planning and deliberation.  I cannot accept that
contention.  It is apparent, when the charge is read as a whole, that the jury
was properly instructed with regard to the elements of planning and
deliberation.  On several occasions, the trial judge told the jury that in
order to convict the appellant of first degree murder, they had to find that
the act had been [TRANSLATION]
""planned and desired"".  In the written description of the elements of
first degree murder which the trial judge gave to the jury, it was clearly
indicated in the last paragraph of that document that the Crown had to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing involved [TRANSLATION] ""planning and
deliberation"".  This instruction was repeated several times to the jury. 
As an example, the following instruction given to the jury properly conveys the
distinct meanings of the words planned and deliberate:

 

                   [translation]  In criminal
law, then, the expression ""planned and deliberate"" means:  the
carefully thought out design which precedes the carrying out of an unlawful
act.  So it is the commission of an unlawful act after having thought about
it.  It is an act which is planned and desired.

 

                   The jury submitted
a question on planning and deliberation.  It is, of course, important that a
trial judge respond to questions from the jury accurately and with reasonable
detail.  It is the position of the appellant that there was some confusion
created by the response of the trial judge to this question.  Yet the response
is, I think, adequate.  In defining the word [TRANSLATION] ""planned"", the trial judge
stated:

 

[translation]  Often instead
of always using the full expression ""planned and deliberate"", it is
summarized by saying ""planned, prepared in advance, having thought about
it in advance, having thought about something in advance"", and that's
about it for planning.

 

                   This instruction
was, I think, particularly appropriate in light of the facts of the case.  The
position of the Crown throughout the trial was that there had been long and
careful preparations for the robbery and murder and that it was carried out in
a cold and calculated manner.  I agree with the description put forward in the
reasons of Chouinard J.A., at p. 159 C.C.C. where he wrote:

 

[translation]  These two
elements were, in the present case, particularly interconnected.  How, in
effect, can one conceive that the victim's murder, carried out as it was, could
in the jury's mind have been isolated from the notion of commission which was
described at length, and thereby limited to planning?  The theory of the
prosecution, I repeat, alleged lengthy preparation and cold‑blooded and
lucid execution.

 

                   The directions
given to the jury by the trial judge on the issue of planning and deliberation
were quite clear that they were separate concepts, that is to say, distinct
elements of first degree murder both of which had to be established beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Importantly, his reply to the jury's question was lengthy
and detailed.  He repeated his original instructions and reviewed again the
written statement he had left with the jury.  Both his oral and written
instructions pointed to the need for the Crown to establish, beyond any
reasonable doubt, the elements of both planning and deliberation.

 

3.  Manslaughter

 

                   The appellant
submits that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that manslaughter
was an alternative verdict.  If there was evidence which had ""an air of
reality"" which indicated that Aalders did not intend to kill
Lawrence Ford or did not intend to cause him bodily harm which he knew was
likely to cause his death, then manslaughter should have been left to the jury
as an alternative verdict.  See R. v. Squire, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 13, Pappajohn
v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, and R. v. Faid, [1983] 1 S.C.R.
265.

 

                   The evidence put
forward is the testimony of Aalders to the effect that he did not wish to kill
Mr. Ford but only to shoot him in the legs.  I cannot see that there was
any air of reality to this testimony when it is viewed in the context of all
the evidence in this case.

 

                   The appellant
arrived at the Ford residence at 8:00 a.m.  He was familiar with the Ford
family routine and was well aware that no one would be home at that time.  He
broke into the home and immediately secured and loaded the 30.30 rifle which he
used at once to silence the dog.  He then armed himself with the smaller, more
convenient .32 calibre pistol.  Next he made a careful search for ammunition
for the handgun both upstairs and in the basement.  He shot the lock off a
chest and obtained more ammunition for it.  He loaded it and placed it in his
belt.  In his own evidence he did this so that he would not be surprised in the
course of his robbery.  He gathered together all the stolen articles and placed
them by the back door.

 

                   It is hard to
imagine that he could not have removed the stolen goods earlier, taken them to
the woods or left the premises with the money had he wished to do so.  Yet he
lay in wait for the return of Lawrence Ford which he knew must be around
noon, over four hours after he had broken into the house.  He took care to
conceal himself in the bathroom.  When Ford saw his slain dog and turned back towards
the bathroom, Aalders advanced towards him firing the gun.  Eight bullets
entered Ford's body.  Only one was in the area of the legs; the rest were in
the torso and neck.  Ford was executed, his death insured by the repeated shots
that were fired into his body.  In those circumstances I can see no air of
reality whatsoever to Aalders' testimony such that it could possibly be said to
raise the defence of manslaughter.  This killing has every indication of being
a cold blooded, planned and deliberate execution.  It follows that it would not
have been appropriate to have left manslaughter to the jury.

 

V.  Conclusion and Disposition

 

                   The evidence called
in reply by the Crown was properly admitted.  The directions to the jury on
planning and deliberation were adequate.  There was no air of reality to the
defence of manslaughter.  In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

 

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. (dissenting) -- The
appellant argued that the trial judge erred in allowing rebuttal evidence which
contradicted the appellant's assertion (made on cross-examination) that he
received certain monies from social assistance.  This Court addressed the rules
applicable to rebuttal evidence in R. v. Krause, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 466. 
McIntyre J. stated (at p. 474):

 

                   The
plaintiff or the Crown may be allowed to call evidence in rebuttal after
completion of the defence case, where the defence has raised some new matter or
defence which the Crown has had no opportunity to deal with and which the Crown
or the plaintiff could not reasonably have anticipated.  But rebuttal will not
be permitted regarding matters which merely confirm or reinforce earlier
evidence adduced in the Crown's case which could have been brought before the defence
was made.  It will be permitted only when it is necessary to insure that at the
end of the day each party will have had an equal opportunity to hear and
respond to the full submissions of the other.

 

                   In
the cross-examination of witnesses essentially the same principles apply. 
Crown counsel in cross-examining an accused are not limited to subjects which
are strictly relevant to the essential issues in a case.  Counsel are accorded
a wide freedom in cross-examination which enable them to test and question the
testimony of the witnesses and their credibility.  Where something new emerges
in cross-examination, which is new in the sense that the Crown had no chance to
deal with it in its case-in-chief (i.e., there was no reason for the Crown to anticipate
that the matter would arise), and where the matter is concerned with the merits
of the case (i.e., it concerns an issue essential for the determination of
the case) then the Crown may be allowed to call evidence in rebuttal. 
Where, however, the new matter is collateral, that is, not determinative of an
issue arising in the pleadings or indictment or not relevant to matters which
must be proved for the determination of the case, no rebuttal will be allowed. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   The relationship between
cross-examination and rebuttal were similarly described in McCormick on
Evidence (4th ed. 1992), vol. 1, at pp. 182-83:

 

                   On
cross-examination, every permissible type of impeachment that may be employed
during cross-examination has as one of its purposes the testing of the
credibility of the witness.  The use of extrinsic evidence to contradict is
more restricted due to considerations of confusion of the issues, misleading
the jury, undue consumption of time, and unfair prejudice raised by the introduction
of so-called collateral matters.  If a matter is considered collateral, the
testimony of the witness on direct or cross-examination stands -- the
cross-examiner must take the witness' answer; extrinsic evidence, i.e.,
evidence offered other than through the witness himself, in contradiction is
not permitted.  If the matter is not collateral, extrinsic evidence may be
introduced disputing the witness' testimony on direct examination or denial of
truth of the facts asserted in a question propounded on cross-examination.

 

                   The respondent
argued that the rebuttal evidence was justified because of discrepancies
between the appellant's statement to the police and his testimony.  In his
declaration to the police, the appellant stated that he went to the Ford house
to break in.  In testimony, he stated that he went to ask the deceased a
favour.  In the declaration, the appellant said nothing about aiming the gun at
the deceased's legs.  In testimony, the appellant stated that he aimed the gun
at the deceased's legs and that he did not intend to kill him.  The declaration
said nothing about the origins of funds found in the appellant's possession
upon arrest.  In direct examination, the appellant claimed that certain old
bank notes were given to him by his mother or his grandmother.  In
cross-examination, the appellant claimed that other funds in his possession
were from a social assistance cheque.  The rebuttal evidence of two social
welfare workers was that the appellant had never received social assistance, and
that his applications for social assistance had been refused.

 

                   The respondent took
the position that the appellant denied having any intention to commit robbery,
and that the rebuttal evidence showed recent possession of stolen property
which was essential to prove that the robbery was intentional.  The respondent
relied on the reasoning of Tourigny J.A., who held that the appellant's
testimony [translation] ""...
would be to the effect that he went to the Ford residence without any criminal
intent and, à la rigueur, there perhaps was not even a break, enter and
theft"" ([1991] R.J.Q. 2097, 69 C.C.C. (3d) 154, at p. 168 C.C.C.).  With
respect, the evidence does not support this analysis.  Although the appellant
did change his story with respect to his intentions in going to the Ford house
initially, he never changed his story with respect to the actual robbery.  The
rebuttal evidence was only relevant to this second point, which had been
admitted by the appellant.

 

                   In his testimony in
chief, the appellant specifically admitted robbing the deceased's house and
robbing the deceased's person:

 

[translation]  I searched in
his pockets until I found the keys.

 

His
wallet was in the same pocket, so I took it out, opened it and took all the
money inside it.  I went back downstairs and took the money, weapons and wine
and took all of this upstairs.  I took the keys and opened the trunk of the car
and put everything in the trunk, and closed it ....

 

After
that, I got into the car, started the engine and drove away from the house.

 

On cross-examination, the appellant
was not directly challenged on these points, nor did the appellant attempt to
deny the robbery.  Rather, he continued to admit it, as the following exchange
indicates:

 

                   [translation]

Q.The
money you took:  there were American notes, were there any Canadian notes?

 

A.I
think so.

 

                   The rebuttal
evidence of the social welfare workers was not relevant to the appellant's
assertion that he did not intend to kill the deceased, and it was wholly unnecessary
to prove the robbery, as this had been admitted by the appellant's own
testimony.  The respondent had the right to cross-examine the appellant on
collateral facts, in order to attack his credibility, but having done so the
respondent had to take the appellant's answers.  Put in context, the rebuttal
evidence attacked the appellant's credibility on the sole question of whether
he was a recipient of social assistance, a collateral issue which was raised
for the first time in cross-examination.

 

                   The respondent also
relied on the reasons of Tourigny J.A. arguing that the appellant made his
credibility a central issue by giving testimony which differed from his police
statement.  Tourigny J.A. stated (at p. 168 C.C.C.):

 

                   [translation]  Aalders'
credibility, by the choice that he himself had made to change his story and not
in the framework of cross‑examination, becomes an issue which is not
collateral or incidental, but an important issue.

 

                   In any case where
the accused testifies, his credibility will be on the line.  Allowing rebuttal
evidence simply because the accused has chosen to make his credibility an issue
is far too broad an interpretation of Krause.  I agree with Proulx J.A. 
who stated (at p. 187 C.C.C.):

 

                   [translation]  In the present
case, the appellant did not deny that he had taken moneys found on the victim's
person as well as in his residence.  In fact, the appellant had admitted it in
his statement and in his testimony; the judge, in his charge to the jury, even
took this fact for granted.  In this context, how could it be relevant
and important or essential to the determination of the case to
show that, contrary to what the appellant stated, the money found in his
possession at the time of his arrest, that is three days after the
commission of the theft and the homicide, did not come from Welfare?  [Emphasis
in original.]

 

                   An error of this
nature cannot be cured by application of the proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  In John v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 476, this Court stated (at pp. 481-82):

 

                   Section
613(1)(b)(iii) [now s. 686(1) (b)(iii)] of the Criminal Code 
cannot be invoked in these circumstances.  The reviewing tribunal cannot, with
anything approaching reality, retry the case to assess the worth of the
residual evidence after the improperly adduced evidence has been extracted from
the record.  The appellate tribunal does not have the advantage of seeing the
witnesses, and in any case, was never intended in the criminal process to
replace the jury.

 

                   Accordingly, I
would allow the appeal and order a new trial.

                   Appellant was
acquitted of first degree murder.  The Crown appealed and the British Columbia
Court of Appeal directed a new trial.  An appeal to this Court followed.  Given
that the scheduled date for the new trial was imminent, that no new issues of
law were raised here, and that the disposition turned upon the facts of the
case and the proceedings at trial, the Court allowed the appeal, set aside the
order of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial and restored the acquittal
with reasons to follow.

 

                   The victim was
killed by a gun owned by appellant.  Appellant contended that he had flown from
Calgary to Vancouver the day the victim was murdered to show the victim's wife,
Linda Sample, how to shoot.  When she refused to take the afternoon off, he
left the gun in her glove compartment and took a cab to visit the victim and
from there he walked to the airport for the return flight to Calgary. 
Appellant and Linda Sample had had some form of relationship which had created
tensions in the long friendship between the victim and appellant but these tensions
seemed to have been resolved before the murder.  Linda Sample testified that
she had not seen appellant the day of the murder, that she had been at work and
that she had been swimming during her lunch hour.

 

                   Three issues were
considered here.  Did the charge to the jury amount to a misdirection on the
issue of proof beyond a reasonable doubt?  Did the trial judge err in refusing
to allow the Crown to recall Linda Sample to give evidence as to having given
the name of the accused to the police as matching the police profile of the
suspect, notwithstanding the fact that the issue of her credibility had arisen
in cross‑examination?  If a misdirection occurred or if the trial judge
erred in refusing to recall Linda Sample, would a new trial have been warranted
because the verdict would not necessarily have been the same given the errors.

 

                   Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and
Major JJ.:  The charge to the jury was eminently fair and no error was
committed in the instructions relating to the manner in which the evidence was
to be considered when the charge is looked at as a whole.  The jury was
instructed to consider the evidence as a whole and not in piecemeal fashion. 
Indeed in dealing with the circumstantial evidence, the trial judge instructed
the jury to consider that evidence in the context of the Crown and defence
theories and in relation to the evidence as a whole.  The jury was never
invited to apply the criminal standard to isolated pieces of evidence or to
reach their decision through some sort of two‑step process.

 

                   The trial judge
erred in refusing to allow the Crown to re‑examine Linda Sample as to
whether she had named appellant as a person matching the police profile of the
killer.  This evidence was admissible as supporting the credibility of Linda
Sample on the grounds that she would never disclose the name of the person from
whom she got the gun when that would inevitably direct police attention back to
her.  It was not hearsay:  the Crown sought to elicit from a witness evidence
not about what was said to her but what she said to the police on an earlier
occasion.  Generally, the narration by a witness of his or her previous
declarations made to others outside of the court should be excluded because of
its general lack of probative value and because such a repetition is, as a
rule, self‑serving.  However, they may be admitted in support of the
credibility of a witness in situations where that witness's evidence is
challenged as being a recent fabrication or contrivance.  The right to re‑examine
is confined to matters arising from the cross‑examination.

 

                   The Crown, to
obtain a new trial, must satisfy the court that the verdict would not
necessarily have been the same if the trial judge had properly directed the
jury.  Appellate courts have always had a healthy respect for and exercised
deference to a jury verdict of acquittal.  The error on the question of re‑examination
did not, in any real way, deprive the jury of decisive evidence.  The trial
judge's error could not have affected the outcome of the trial.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
(dissenting):  A new trial was warranted for the reasons given by the Court of
Appeal.

                   APPEAL from a
judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 489, 22
W.A.C. 225, allowing an appeal and ordering a new trial from an acquittal by
Anderson J. sitting with jury.  Appeal allowed, L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
dissenting.

 

                   Noel C.
O'Brien, for the
appellant.

 

                   William F.
Ehrcke, for the
respondent.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting) -- I have
taken cognizance of the majority opinion and, with respect, I disagree as to
their reasons as well as the results they reach.

 

                   I entirely agree
with the Court of Appeal of British Columbia (1992), 70 C.C.C. (2d) 489, that a
new trial is warranted in this case for the reasons expressed by McEachern
C.J.B.C. writing for a unanimous court (Wood and Hinds JJA. concurring).

 

                   Accordingly, I
would dismiss the appeal.

 

//Cory J.//

 

                   The judgment of
Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Cory
J. -- The appellant Barry
Evans was charged with first degree murder.  After a three week trial, he was
acquitted.  The Crown appealed and the British Columbia Court of Appeal
directed a new trial.  An appeal to this Court followed.  During oral argument,
the Court was advised that the scheduled date for the new trial was imminent. 
No new issues of law were raised on this appeal.  The disposition turns upon
the facts of the case and the proceedings at trial.  As a result, at the
conclusion of oral submissions, the Court, with L'Heureux-Dubé J. dissenting,
allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal directing a new
trial and restored the acquittal with reasons to follow.

 

Factual Background

 

                   So much turns on
the facts that they must be set out at some length.  For many years, Barry
Evans had been a friend of the deceased Rick Sample.  They had similar
interests, worked together in a company and indeed lived together for some
time.  About a year and a half prior to the murder of Rick Sample, their
friendship had suffered as a result of a relationship which had developed
between Rick Sample's wife Linda and Barry Evans.  The evidence is confused as
to the nature of the relationship between Linda Sample and the appellant. 
There can be no doubt there was a mutual attraction.  The relationship
continued from 1987 until the death of Rick Sample.

 

                   There was an
attempt to resolve the differences caused by this association at a meeting in
November 1988.  However, tensions rose again a year later.  The appellant sent
Linda Sample a birthday gift of stuffed animals that Rick Sample judged
inappropriate.  That December, a few weeks before the homicide, during a ski
trip with Rick Sample and some mutual friends, Linda Sample and the
appellant, in the back seat of a car, simulated a stroking of each other.  At
trial, Linda Sample admitted she lied at the preliminary about whether she
told her husband about this incident.  After the trip, Linda Sample asked
for a letter from Evans stating that he loved her.  However, in the days prior
to the death of Mr. Sample, things seemed to have returned to normal as
the appellant sent both Rick and Linda Sample Christmas gifts.  By the fall of
1989, Barry Evans was interested in another young woman and Linda Sample was
aware of this.

 

                   The Crown tendered
some evidence which was intended to demonstrate that the appellant wanted to
play the role of an assassin and was developing a computer game with this
theme.  Linda Sample testified that he had said that contracting for a hit
man to eliminate rivals at work could be considered an investment in one's
future.  However, numerous witnesses testified that he was generally known as a
gentle, considerate, non-violent person with a sense of humour, an even
temperament and one who avoided confrontations.

 

                   In the fall of
1989, Evans purchased a second-hand .22 calibre pistol and asked the previous
owner how to transport it to Vancouver as he was thinking of moving out there. 
He joined the Firing Line Gun Club in Calgary where he lived.  He applied for
and obtained a permit for the gun.  The appellant testified that on October 27,
he called Linda Sample and told her that he had been to a local gun club.  In
the course of a telephone call to Linda Sample on December 1, he informed
her that he had purchased a gun and, during another call on December 17, he
said that he had been at the gun club again.

 

                   On December 26,
1989, there was a long conversation between Barry Evans and Linda Sample. 
The appellant testified that it was during the course of this conversation that
Linda Sample suggested in a joking way that he bring the gun to Vancouver
so that she could learn to shoot it.  Linda Sample testified that this
topic had not been discussed and that she had made no such request.

 

                   While she had
indicated that she did have an interest in shooting a gun, Linda Sample
testified that she was unsure about whether Barry Evans owned a gun.  She
assumed that he was using a club gun.  She did not mention the appellant's new
hobby during her brief interview with the police on the day of the murder,
December 28.  But, at the end of the interview of December 30, she did tell
them that Evans had joined a gun club.  After that interview, Corporal Doige,
an investigating R.C.M.P. officer, also noted that Linda Sample thought
the appellant might have a gun.  However, under cross-examination at trial, he
admitted that this might be ""a mental note"" rather than anything
Linda Sample had actually told him.  Indeed, on January 3 in a third
interview, when asked when she found out the appellant had a gun, she responded
that she did not know he had a gun, only that he had joined a gun club.

 

 

                   A friend of
Linda Sample who lived in Calgary gave evidence that she saw Evans in
Calgary on December 27.  She said that he appeared to be in a good mood and
there was nothing abnormal about his behaviour.  Similarly, Jeannie Tam, the
wife of Linda Sample's employer, saw Linda Sample at work the day of the
murder and found her to be her ""usual self"".

 

                   On December 28 the
appellant took his gun and some ammunition out to the airport.  There, he purchased
a ticket to Vancouver using the name of Jones.  He explained that he used a
false name in case there was trouble with the gun which he was illegally
transporting as luggage.  The flight from Calgary brought him into Vancouver at
10:25 a.m. local time.

 

                   He testified that
he met Linda Sample at the information booth at Simon Fraser University at
noon.  Linda Sample told him that she had changed her mind about going
shooting and that she was going back to work.  Evans was upset that she had
brought him all the way out to Vancouver and then refused to take the afternoon
off work.  After showing her how to operate his gun, he left it in the glove
compartment of her car.  Evans said they made some tentative arrangements to
meet at a restaurant on Granville Island.  Linda Sample, in her testimony,
denied meeting Evans on that date, receiving the gun from him, or being
involved in the death of her husband.

 

                   Evans stated that
when he left Linda he went to the Sample home by taxi to talk to Rick Sample. 
They had an argument about the appellant's relationship with
Linda Sample.  He left the house around 2:30 p.m.  He walked to the
airport and arrived around 3:30 p.m. or 3:45 p.m.  The airline records show
that he purchased a ticket at 4:23 p.m. on the 6:00 o'clock flight to Calgary. 
He paid cash and used the name of Wilson.  He made two calls to friends in
Calgary before flight time.  In the first call, he left the impression that he
was in Calgary.  In the second, he left a message stating he was in Calgary. 
Upon his return, the appellant told friends that he had been in Calgary all day
and had not been able to meet with them as planned because of a
misunderstanding.  At trial, he explained that he was embarrassed about having
gone out to Vancouver for nothing and that he lied to his friends for social
reasons.

 

                   The police said
that it was possible to walk the 10 kilometres from the Sample home to the
airport in 72 minutes by cutting across a field.  It was of course impossible
for the appellant, who does not drive, to have rented a car because he would
have been required to produce a valid driver's licence.  Just as there is no
record of a taxi taking the appellant to the Sample residence from the
university, there is no record of a cab company's picking up a passenger at or
near the Sample home and going to the airport.  The appellant testified that he
could run a 10 kilometre race in 40 to 45 minutes but that he was dressed for
work and not for running that day and was carrying a bag.

 

                   On December 28 the
day of the murder, Linda Sample drove to work arriving around 7:30 a.m. 
She testified that she later went to the Burnaby aquatic centre where she swam
for thirty to forty-five minutes, had lunch and then returned to work.  A wet
towel was later found in her car.  Jeannie Tam stated that Sample was away
from the office from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m.  Linda Sample stated that she
left work about 4:30 p.m. and Ms. Tam heard her leave at that time.  She
drove directly to her home and arrived around 5:00 p.m.  She said traffic
was light that day and she might have arrived 10 minutes earlier than
that.  When she came into the house, she found her husband lying on the floor. 
She dialled 911 for an ambulance and attempted to administer mouth to mouth resuscitation.

 

                   Rick Sample had
been shot three times, once in the head and twice in the chest.  Although the
murder weapon was never found, the shell casings at the scene indicated that
the appellant's gun had been used to kill Sample.  Expert evidence indicated that
death occurred sometime between 12:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.

 

                   There can be no
doubt that Rick Sample was alive at least until 3:30 p.m.  Gail Ross,
an employee of the University of British Columbia, said that she telephoned and
spoke to him between 3:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., but closer to 4:00 p.m.
as she was preparing to leave work when she called.  She said they had a
10 minute conversation about a computer problem that she was
experiencing.  She said that there was nothing from the telephone conversation
to indicate that there was anything wrong with him at that time. 
Irene Sample, the sister of Rick Sample, testified that she attempted to
telephone her brother between 3:30 p.m. and 3:45 p.m.  She said she
did not receive a busy signal but the telephone was not answered.  It is worthy
of note that even if the phone calls were made at the earlier time of
3:30 p.m., it might raise at least a reasonable doubt that Evans could
have killed Sample, walked to the airport and purchased a ticket by 4:23 p.m.
even without allowing any time for lineups.

 

                   The appellant
initially lied to police about his whereabouts on the day of the murder, saying
he was in Calgary.  He testified that he lied at that time because he was
afraid that Linda Sample had used the gun he had left with her to shoot
her husband.  After he had been arrested in Calgary, he made a series of
statements to police during the flight to Vancouver, that could be read as
either incriminatory or as simply expressing regret that Rick Sample had
been killed.  He later told the police that the murder weapon, which was never
recovered, was in a place where it would not hurt anybody.  At trial, he
explained that at the time he was thinking that Linda Sample either still
had the gun or had disposed of it safely.

 

                   In any event, after
three weeks of trial and hearing 38 witnesses, the jury acquitted Evans.

 

The Court of Appeal for British
Columbia (1992), 70
C.C.C. (3d) 489

 

                   The Court of Appeal
found that the trial judge erred in failing to allow the Crown to re-examine
Linda Sample.  The Crown wanted to show that she had volunteered the name
of the appellant as someone who matched the profile that the police had drawn
of the killer of her husband.  Since Linda Sample could only have obtained
the murder weapon from the appellant, it would be absurd for her to put the
police on a lead that would inevitably direct them back to her.  Her answer
would have supported her credibility in front of the jury.  On the same issue,
the court found that Corporal Doige's testimony that the appellant's name
""came up"" during his conversation with Linda Sample, was not
sufficient to remedy the ruling prohibiting her re-examination.

 

                   The court then
considered whether the Crown had met the burden of demonstrating that the
verdict would not necessarily have been the same but for this error.  At one
point, the court indicated at p. 502 that the Crown's case was ""very
strong . . . almost an unanswerable one"", at another point it referred to
the case as being ""closely balanced"".  The latter evaluation appears
to be the more accurate assessment.  In any event, it held that the jury was
presented with a choice between the conflicting testimony of the accused and of
Linda Sample.  Any additional evidence which would furnish a reason why
one of them should more likely be believed than the other became highly
material.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
also took issue with one aspect of the charge which dealt with the assessment
of circumstantial evidence.  It was found that this portion of the charge invited
the jury to apply the test of reasonable doubt not only to the essential
ingredients or elements of the defence but also to every subsidiary fact. 
Nonetheless, the court went on to mention that if this was the only error, it
was not sufficiently serious to warrant the granting of a new trial.  However,
when it was considered together with the failure to permit the re-examination
of Linda Sample, it constituted a basis for ordering a new trial.

 

Points in Issue

 

                   There are three
matters to be considered.  First, did the trial judge's instructions to the
jury amount to a misdirection on the issue of proof beyond a reasonable doubt? 
Second, should the trial judge have permitted the Crown to re-examine
Linda Sample as to whether she gave the name of the appellant to the
police as a person matching the police profile of the killer?  Three, if an
error was made in either of the above matters, would the verdict have
necessarily not been the same, but for the errors.

 

Analysis

 

1.  The Charge as to Reasonable
Doubt

 

                   The Crown raised
for the first time in the Court of Appeal an objection to the trial judge's
charge relating to circumstantial evidence.  That portion of the charge reads
as follows:

 

When
you are considering direct evidence or circumstantial evidence, you must bear
in mind the onus of the Crown to satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt.  In
dealing with direct evidence as to facts, you must be satisfied that those
facts have been so established.  And in dealing with circumstantial evidence
you must be satisfied not only that the facts have been established, but also
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that any inference that you draw
from them is a proper one.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   At the outset, its
worth repeating that a jury charge should not be microscopically examined and
parsed.  There is no such thing as a perfect jury charge.  Rather, the
directions to the jury must be looked at as a whole to determine if there has
been any error.  See, for example, R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at
p. 758.

 

                   When read as a
whole, it can be seen that the charge is eminently fair.  Although it is not
determinative, it is significant that the Crown made no objection at trial to
this aspect of the charge.  Indeed, as the Court of Appeal observed it is
doubtful that this direction, if it stood alone, would justify the granting of
a new trial.

 

                   A review of the
directions makes it crystal clear that the jury was instructed to consider the
evidence as a whole and not in piecemeal fashion.  Indeed in dealing with the
circumstantial evidence, it is significant that the trial judge instructed the
jury to consider that evidence in the context of the Crown and defence theories
and in relation to the evidence as a whole.  The following are examples of the
instructions to the jury which were eminently sound and correct in dealing with
the evidence:

 

(a)""During
your deliberations it will be your responsibility to consider the whole of
the evidence.  You do not consider the evidence piecemeal, you consider it as a
whole package.""

 

(b)               ""And
as in every other matter in the trial, it will be for you to determine what
weight, if any, you are prepared to give to the evidence in view of all of
the circumstances that you have heard and the evidence which has been placed
before you.""

 

(c)               ""Now,
it will be up to you to assess the evidence that he has given.  You will
have to take that evidence as a whole and as part of the evidence that you
heard.""

 

(d)""All
of his conversation is before you and you will have to consider his words in
that conversation and his explanation in light of the whole of the conversation
and in the light of the whole of the evidence.""

 

(e)               ""Now,
the Crown further says that you should consider the statements of the accused
in a taped interview of December 30th and the statements to the
police officers on January 18th after he had been arrested and
charged with first degree murder in conjunction with all of the evidence
before you.""

 

(f)                ""On
all of the evidence the Crown submits that there should be no doubt in your
mind that the accused did kill Rick Sample . . . ."" [Emphasis added.]

 

These instructions meet the test laid
down in R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 361, where Sopinka
J. wrote:

 

. .
. the law lays down only one basic requirement:  during the process of
deliberation the jury or other trier of fact must consider the evidence as a
whole and determine whether guilt is established by the prosecution beyond a
reasonable doubt.

 

And further at p. 362:

 

The
jury should be told that the facts are not to be examined separately and in
isolation with reference to the criminal standard.

 

                   It is evident that
the trial judge followed these directions.  The jury was never invited to apply
the criminal standard to isolated pieces of evidence or to reach their decision
through some sort of two-step process.  The nature of the trial itself
indicates the relative unimportance of this aspect of the charge.  In this case
the accused testified.  It was admitted that it was his gun that killed
Rick Sample.  Further, he admitted the statements he gave to the police. 
In essence, this case turned upon the credibility of the witnesses
Linda Sample and Barry Evans.

 

                   In sum, when the
jury charge is looked at as a whole, it can be seen that there was no error
committed in the instructions relating to the manner in which the evidence was
to be considered.  This cannot be a ground for ordering a new trial.

 

2.The
Ruling of the Trial Judge Prohibiting the Crown from Re-examining Linda Sample

 

                   The trial judge
refused to permit the Crown to re-examine Linda Sample as to whether she
named, during an interview on December 30, the appellant as a person matching
the police profile of the killer.  On this issue, it was the appellant's position
that the judge's ruling on the question the Crown wished to put to
Linda Sample was no more than a discretionary decision to refuse to permit
re-examination.  The Crown on the other hand, argued that it constituted an
erroneous ruling on the admissibility of the evidence.

 

                   Admissibility of
her Statements to Police

 

                   In my view, this
evidence, which the Crown attempted to introduce in re-examination, was
admissible.  The Crown sought to use this testimony to support the credibility
of Linda Sample on the grounds that she would never disclose the name of
the person from whom she got the gun when that would inevitably direct police
attention back to her.

 

                   Linda Sample's
testimony on this aspect of the case would not be hearsay.  Hearsay generally
involves the repetition by a witness at trial of an earlier declaration by
someone who is not a witness.  The statement is thus relayed indirectly to the
trier of fact.  But here, the Crown sought to elicit from a witness evidence
not about what was said to her but what she said to the police on
an earlier occasion.

 

                   Ordinarily, other
persons may not be called to testify as to a witness's out of court
statements.  Nor may a witness repeat, in court, her own earlier statements. 
Generally, the narration by a witness of her previous declarations made to
others outside of the court should be excluded because of its general lack of
probative value and because such a repetition is, as a rule, self-serving. 
However, they may be admitted in support of the credibility of a witness in
situations where that witness's evidence is challenged as being a recent
fabrication or contrivance.  See R. v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d)
6 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 18, per Martin J.A., and R. v. Béland,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 398, at p. 409.

 

                   Further, it has
been held that there need not be, in cross-examination, any express allegation
of recent fabrication for the prior statements to be admissible.  It is
sufficient if, in light of the circumstances of the case and the conduct of the
trial, the apparent position of the opposing party is that there has been a
prior contrivance.  In those situations, fairness and ordinary common sense
require that the jury receive a balanced picture of the whole of the witness's
conduct throughout the police investigation.  To demonstrate that the evidence
of the witness is not a recent fabrication it may be essential to introduce on
re-examination a prior statement which shows the consistency of the witness'
testimony.  See R. v. Simpson, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 25.

 

                   In this case, it
was apparent that it was the position of the defence that Linda Sample had
killed her husband and was attempting to blame the appellant for the murder. 
The nature of the cross-examination involved an attack on the truth of her testimony
and of her statements given to the police.  In those circumstances, the prior
consistent statement made by Linda Sample to the police was admissible.

 

                   Should the
Question Have Been Permitted on Re-examination

 

                   Even though it has
been determined that the evidence was admissible, it remains to be seen whether
the question should have been permitted on re-examination.

 

                   The issue is put
very well by E. G. Ewaschuk in Criminal Pleadings & Practice in Canada,
2nd ed., in these words at p. 16.29, para. 16:2510:

 

Questions
permitted as of right on re-examination must relate to matters arising
out of the cross-examination which deal with new matters, or with matters
raised in examination-in-chief which require explanation as to questions put
and answers given in cross-examination. [Emphasis added.]

 

Generally speaking, the right to
re-examine must be confined to matters arising from the cross-examination.  As
a general rule new facts cannot be introduced in re-examination.  See R. v.
Moore (1984), 15 C.C.C. (3d) 541 (Ont. C.A.), per Martin J.A.  In
this case, the cross-examination of Linda Sample referred to her
statements to police about the appellant.  The police interview of December 30
was specifically alluded to during the cross-examination and had not been dealt
with in-chief.  It was in response to this cross examination that
Linda Sample stated that, from the time of that meeting, she suspected the
appellant of committing the crime.  It would seem that the Crown had the right
to re-examine Linda Sample as to precisely what she told the police at
that time with regard to the appellant.  It was a subject that had not been
raised in the examination in chief but arose from the cross-examination.  The
trial judge erred in failing to allow re-examination on this point.

 

3.Has
the Crown Established that the Verdict Would not Necessarily Have Been the Same
if the Trial Judge Had Properly Directed the Jury?

 

                   In Vézeau v. The
Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277, the basis upon which a Crown can appeal an
acquittal pursuant to s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 , was set out.  There is was stated at p. 292, that ""it was the duty
of the Crown, in order to obtain a new trial, to satisfy the Court that the
verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the trial judge had
properly directed the jury.""  This test was re-affirmed in R. v. Morin,
supra, at p. 374.  There, it was emphasized that the onus resting
upon the Crown was a heavy one and that the Crown must satisfy the court with a
reasonable degree of certainty that the verdict would not necessarily have been
the same.  This is a very heavy onus and it is fitting that it should be.

 

                   In setting the
standard for reversal, it is worth observing that, among the major
English-speaking common-law jurisdictions, Canada appears to possess the most
liberal provisions for Crown appeals.  In some jurisdictions, particularly in
the United States, the prosecution is limited to interlocutory appeals from 
unfavourable rulings made before a verdict is reached.  Other jurisdictions
permit prosecution appeals in limited circumstances such as where the
information is quashed; where the trial is held to be a nullity or where a
directed verdict of acquittal is entered.  See Wharton's Criminal Procedure, 
13th ed., vol. 4, at pp. 836-38; J. B. Bishop, Criminal Procedure
(1983), at pp. 294-95; Archbold, Pleading, Evidence and Practice in
Criminal Cases, 43rd ed., vol. 1, § 7-132 to § 7-137, at pp. 1042-47.  It
is only Canada, New Zealand (Crimes Act, R.S.N.Z. 1961, vol. 1, no. 43,
ss. 380, 381, 382(2)(e) as amended by S.N.Z. 1991, no. 106, s. 11)
and Tasmania (Criminal Code Act, 1924, R.S. Tas. 1826-1959, vol. 1,
ss. 401(2)(b) and 402(5)(b) as amended by Criminal Code
Amendment Act, 1975, S. Tas. 1975, no. 74, s. 12, and Criminal
Code Amendment Act, 1987, S. Tas. 1987, no. 83, s. 8) that permit
full Crown appeals after verdicts of acquittal have been rendered on the
merits.  Of these, only Canada and Tasmania permit the Court of Appeal to
substitute a conviction for an acquittal at trial, though in Canada this
substitution is not possible after a jury verdict because of s. 686(4) (b)(ii)
of the Criminal Code .  Finally, only Canada permits Crown appeals, on
questions of law, as of right without having to first seek leave or reserve a
question of law.

 

                   Among appellate
courts there has always been a great deal of healthy respect for and deference
to a jury verdict of acquittal.  This deferential approach is appropriate and
correct.  The special significance of a verdict of acquittal by a jury has also
been recognized by this Court in R. v. Kirkness, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 74. 
There on behalf of the majority it was said at p. 83:

 

The
verdict of the jury constitutes, in a very real way, the verdict of the
community.  Trial by jury in criminal cases is a process that functions
exceedingly well and constitutes a fundamentally important aspect of our
democratic society.  It is not members of the judiciary, but rather the members
of the jury, sitting as members of the community, who make decision as to guilt
or innocence which is so vitally important both to the individual accused and
the community.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

It
follows that only if there was a significant error made by the trial
judge in the course of the charge should the verdict of acquittal be set
aside.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   It is against this
background that the evidence given at the trial of Barry Evans should be
considered.  In my view the error of the trial judge could not have affected
the outcome of the trial.  First and foremost, it must be remembered that the
very evidence which the Crown sought to introduce through Linda Sample on
re-examination was brought before the jury in the testimony of Corporal Doige. 
In response to Crown questioning as to why he interviewed Linda Sample,
the following testimony was elicited from him:

 

Q.And
what was the purpose in your going in, sir, or did you have several, I suppose?

 

A.I
had one in particular.  I had formed in my mind the type of person that I would
be looking for, and I wanted to present the situation to her so that she could possibly
attach a name to the type of person that I was looking for.  And that was
the main purpose for me taking her to the residence, and I went through the
process of showing her exactly what I believed took place and what was taking
place before the incident happened, and I had a discussion about much of their
lifestyle at that time.

Q.All
right.  So other than the scenario you were presenting to her, you are also, I
take it, extracting further details as best you could to again assist your
general knowledge; is that fair?

 

A.That
is right.

Q.Now,
ultimately in the course of your discussion with her it's correct to say that
the name Barry Evans came up; is that correct?

 

A.Yes
it did.   [Emphasis added.]

 

In this context, the most logical and
easiest inference for the jury to draw was that Linda Sample volunteered
the appellant's name.

 

                   As well, the
evidence of Linda Sample in cross-examination referred to her discussions
with Corporal Doige.  There she stated that, as a result of those discussions,
Barry Evans became a suspect in her mind.  Thus, once again, the very sort of
evidence that the Crown sought to introduce through the proposed re-examination
of Linda Sample came out in her cross-examination.

 

                   Further, in light
of Corporal Doige's testimony, it is clear that Linda Sample would not
give as cogent evidence as the Court of Appeal speculated that she would.  It
is apparent that she did not volunteer the name of Barry Evans as a suspect. 
In her statement to the police, she said no more than that he would fit the
pattern or profile created by Corporal Doige of the murderer.  In substance, this
very evidence was already before the jury through the testimony of Corporal
Doige.

 

                   The error on the
question of re-examination did not, in any real way, deprive the jury of
decisive evidence.  It is thus apparent that the Crown has not met the heavy
onus which lies upon it to establish that the verdict would not necessarily
have been the same.

 

Disposition

 

                   In the result the
appeal is allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial is
set aside and the verdict of acquittal restored.

                   Appellants were
convicted of the second degree murder of a man who had been beaten to death. 
The alleged motive was anger stemming from the victim's assault on a female
friend of both appellants.  The investigation was suspended for want of
evidence strong enough to support the charge until a witness, Belmont, who had
been arrested for other offences committed with the appellants, came forward
with details of several incriminating conversations with Bevan.  The
investigation was again discontinued when Belmont's use of a body pack to try
to record further incriminating evidence proved largely unsuccessful.  The
investigation resumed when another witness, Dietrich, who was incarcerated at
the time, wrote the police and later informed them of his having helped the
appellants clean a car of two tire irons and a blood‑soaked carpet.  He
also testified to a number of incriminating statements made by the appellants. 
Appellants testified at trial and denied or explained any incriminating
statements.  Each offered alibi defences.  Each also admitted to lying in
statements to the police.

 

                   At trial, Dietrich
read his letter, which contained statements prejudicial to the appellants,
during direct examination and was cross‑examined on it in an attack on
his testimony and credibility based on his apparent animosity towards the
appellants and on his motivations for lying to the police and at trial.  The
letter was subsequently marked as an exhibit and was given without objection to
the jury.

 

                   The trial judge
noted in her charge that credibility was important in this case, discussed
generally how credibility should be assessed, and made some references to
factors affecting the credibility of Belmont and Dietrich.  She did not,
however, give a clear sharp warning to the jury as to its being dangerous to
convict the appellants on the basis of Belmont's and Dietrich's evidence unless
their evidence was supported by other evidence.  Nor did she instruct the jury
on the use that could be made of prior inconsistent statements.

 

                   The appellants
unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Appeal.  At issue here was: 
(1) whether the trial judge should have given the jury a clear, sharp (Vetrovec)
warning with respect to the evidence of Dietrich and Belmont; (2) whether
the trial judge was correct in her instructions to the jury on the Dietrich
letter or in permitting it to go as an exhibit to the Jury Room;
(3) whether no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred even
though the trial judge failed to instruct the jury with respect to the use that
can be made of prior inconsistent statements; and (4) whether the trial
judge's errors could be cured by s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

 

                   Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
dissenting):  The appeals should be allowed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka,
Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin and Major JJ.:  The trial judge has a discretion
to determine whether the evidence of any witness ‑‑ not just
accomplices ‑‑ is for some reason untrustworthy to such an extent
that a warning to the jury is necessary.  Vetrovec v. The Queen did not
establish that, if a warning is given regarding a particular witness, the trial
judge must in all cases go on to point out in detail evidence which is capable
of corroborating that witness' testimony.  While an instruction of that nature
may be made in tandem with a Vetrovec warning, it is not a requirement
in all cases.

 

                   While it is usually
a corollary of the Vetrovec warning that the trial judge make some
reference to evidence that the jury may consider supportive of the impugned
evidence, in some cases part or all of the supporting evidence may be extremely
prejudicial to the accused, such that to draw the jury's attention to that
evidence in tandem with a Vetrovec warning could, in some circumstances,
be unfair to the accused.  The appropriate remedy in those circumstances lies
with the discretion of the trial judge to decide whether or not the Vetrovec
warning should be given, and if so, whether it should be accompanied by a
direction as to what other specific evidence the jury might conclude is
supportive of the impugned evidence.  Because the trial judge is in the best
position to assess the atmosphere of the trial and the effect that the evidence
or instruction may have on a jury hearing the case, the trial judge's decision
on these kinds of issues should not be lightly interfered with on appeal.

 

                   While under Vetrovec
a caution to the jury is a matter of the trial judge's discretion and is not
required in all cases involving testimony of accomplices or accessories after
the fact, there are some cases in which the circumstances may be such that a Vetrovec
caution must be given.  The trial judge's discretion whether to give a Vetrovec
warning should generally be given wide latitude by appellate courts.  But a Vetrovec
caution was clearly required here for the testimony of both Dietrich and
Belmont.

 

                   Appellants' counsel
at trial not only did not object, but also appeared to have wanted Dietrich's
letter to go to the jury even though it contained highly prejudicial statements
against the appellants.  Defence counsel made a strategic decision that there was
a benefit to the appellants in having the letter in the jury's possession
during their deliberations in that the letter undermined Dietrich's
credibility.  The defence could not then complain about the disadvantages of
the letter's going to the jury.  Appellants, nevertheless, were entitled to a
proper instruction being given to the jury as to the limited use that could be
made of the letter during their deliberations.  The trial judge did not
instruct the jury that the letter could not be used as substantive evidence and
referred to the letter in terms that could have given the jury the impression
that it could be used in that manner.

 

                   In determining
whether there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice as a
result of a trial judge's error an appellate court must determine if there is
any reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different had the
error at issue not been made.  While each of the errors made by the trial judge
was serious, it was not necessary to reflect upon whether any one of them would
have been a sufficient basis for directing a new trial.  When the cumulative
effect of the errors in question is considered, the curative provision should
not be applied.  There is a reasonable possibility that, but for the trial
judge's errors, the verdict here would have been different.

 

                   The jury may have
treated the evidence of Belmont and Dietrich less cautiously during their
deliberations than they would have had the trial judge given a proper Vetrovec
warning.  It could not be said with any degree of certainty that, in the
absence of a direction from the trial judge, the jury did not use Dietrich's
letter inappropriately.  Although the trial judge failed to instruct the jury
as to the use to be made of prior inconsistent statements, such instruction
would only have repeated the obvious fact, given defence counsels' cross‑examinations
and closing statements, that they concerned the credibility of witnesses.  The
real danger was that the jury may not have understood that such statements
could not be used as evidence to prove the truth of their contents.  This
danger was exacerbated by the trial judge's making a number of comments that
may have caused the jury to conclude that all prior statements (consistent or
inconsistent) could be used as substantive evidence.  Even though the prior
inconsistent statements were not used by counsel for the purpose of proving the
truth of their contents, the non‑direction by the trial judge on this
issue did not necessarily cause no prejudice to the appellants.  The law
requires an instruction of this nature because there is otherwise a risk that
jurors may not be aware that they cannot use such statements as substantive
evidence, irrespective of the use made of the statements by counsel.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
(dissenting):  If, taken as a whole, the charge is fair, whatever error it may
contain, it cannot amount to a miscarriage of justice and s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  will apply.  Jury trials should not be presided
over by courts of appeal who are removed from the atmosphere of a particular
trial and have no opportunity to assess the traits of the particular jury or to
hear counsels' addresses.  A trial judge's discretion to deal with a trial as
best fits the case over which he or she must preside is an essential element of
a trial.  Otherwise, a mechanical application of the rules would suffice.

 

                   A trial judge has a
wide and flexible discretion as to how to instruct juries on the need for
careful scrutiny of a witness' testimony.  Even where there are legitimate
concerns about the credibility of a witness, a clear and sharp warning may not
be appropriate in every case.  Appellants suffered no detriment because of the
absence of a Vetrovec warning and, indeed, their position may well have
been strengthened by the course followed by the trial judge because the
evidence against them would have been emphasized when such a warning was
given.  The trial judge considered the propriety and need for a Vetrovec
caution.  While declining to make such a caution, she nonetheless indicated
that Dietrich's evidence required careful scrutiny and directed the jury to
consider whether it was consistent with other credible evidence.

 

                   Neither counsel objected
to the alleged failure of the judge's charge to deal with the use to be made of
prior inconsistent statements.  Those statements were put to the witnesses for
the sole purpose of casting doubt on their credibility, never with the
intention that they be adopted by the witnesses as evidence of the truth of
their contents, and everyone assumed as much.

 

                   Although it is
generally recognized that the failure to warn a jury about the use it can make
of a witness' prior statement, unless adopted at trial, can be fatal in cases
where a jury might accept such a statement as evidence of its truth rather than
going only to credibility, this was not such a case.  The judge tailored her
charge to the case before her and the case did not mandate the warning in question. 
The statements were inconsequential and an instruction that prior inconsistent
statements could undermine the credibility of witnesses would have applied to
appellants as well as to the Crown witnesses.  The instruction could have done
the appellants more harm than good.

 

                   No miscarriage of
justice occurred in the circumstances and, if necessary, s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
should be applied to cure this type of defect.

//Major J.//

 

                   Major
J. -- The appellants were
convicted by a judge and jury of second degree murder in the death of Peter
Hodgin.  Each was sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole
for 10 years.  An appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed, Osborne
J.A. dissenting.

 

                   The appellants have
appealed as of right to this Court on the points of law raised by Osborne
J.A.'s dissent, that is whether the clear, sharp warning established in Vetrovec
v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, should have been given in the trial
judge's charge to the jury regarding the evidence of certain Crown witnesses,
and whether any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred as a
result of the trial judge's failing to instruct the jury on the use to be made
of prior inconsistent statements.  The appellants were granted leave to argue
the additional issue of the use made at trial of a letter that had been written
to the police by one of the Crown witnesses.

 

                   It is my opinion
that the appeals should be allowed, and a new trial ordered.  In light of this
result, it is not advisable to review the evidence except to the extent
necessary for this decision.

 

I.  Facts

 

                   Hodgin's body was
found on the morning of May 14, 1981, in a water-filled ditch near Stoney
Creek, Ontario.  Medical evidence was that he died as a result of heavy blows
to the head.  The time of death was estimated to be between 6:30 p.m. on May
13, 1981 and 6:30 a.m. on May 14, 1981.  Greater precision was not possible as
the body had been almost completely submerged in water.

 

                   Hodgin had been
seen leaving the Tap Room, a Hamilton bar, with the appellant Bevan at about
10:30 p.m. on May 13, 1981.  There was no evidence of the appellant Griffith's
having been at that bar on that evening, or of his being seen that night with
Hodgin.  The Crown's theory was that Griffith had been waiting in the area in a
white car, and that after Bevan and Hodgin left the Tap Room the three drove to
an unknown location, where the appellants beat Hodgin to death with tire irons.

 

                   On May 2, 1981,
about 11 days prior to the murder, Emily Ribble, a friend of the appellants,
was assaulted by Hodgin.  This was the alleged motive for the murder.  It was
conceded by both appellants that they were upset about the beating of Ribble by
Hodgin.  However, it was evident that a number of people had similar reasons to
be upset with Hodgin.  The evidence was that he had a history of spontaneous
violence towards women, including a previous conviction for manslaughter
arising out of the stabbing death of a girlfriend.

 

                   In the weeks
following the murder the police received information from several witnesses
inculpating the appellants.  But they considered the evidence too weak to
support a charge.  The investigation was suspended in early June 1981.

 

                   In late February 1982,
Patrick Belmont, who had been arrested for property offences committed with the
appellants, approached the police saying he had information about the murder. 
He told the police about several incriminating conversations he had with
Bevan.  He agreed to wear a bodypack and attempt to elicit further
incriminating statements from the appellants.  The bodypack was suggested by
the police because they viewed Belmont as unreliable.

 

                   According to
Belmont, he had further conversations with Bevan, and with Griffith, in which
each of the appellants implicated themselves in the murder.  However, due to
malfunctions of the bodypack equipment, only about 20 percent of the
conversations were audible to the police, none of which was incriminating.

 

                   In the spring of 1982,
there was insufficient evidence to lay charges against the appellants, and the
investigation was again discontinued.

 

                   In August 1986,
Stefan Dietrich, who was serving a three-year sentence at Warkworth
Penitentiary, wrote to Sgt. Ryan of the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police
Force that he had information concerning Hodgin's murder.  The investigation
was reactivated.

 

                     At the time of
the murder, Dietrich was a 16-year-old chronic drug and alcohol abuser living
with the appellant Griffith.  Dietrich testified that one evening in May 1981,
the appellants left together in a car.  The next day, Dietrich was asked to
help the appellants clean out the car, whose trunk contained two tire irons and
a blood-soaked carpet.  Dietrich put all of the contents from the trunk into
green garbage bags, and placed the bags at the front of Griffith's driveway for
municipal garbage pickup.  Dietrich also testified to a number of incriminating
statements made by the appellants, particularly Griffith.

 

                   The appellants were
arrested in September 1986.  At their trial they testified in their own
defence, denying or explaining the inculpatory statements allegedly made in the
presence of Dietrich, Belmont, and/or other witnesses.  As well each of them
offered alibi defences. 

 

                   The appellants
admitted in their testimony at trial that each had lied in statements to the
police.  After his September 1986 arrest, the appellant Griffith gave a
statement exculpating himself but inculpating Bevan.  At his trial, Griffith
denied the truth of the parts of his statement inculpating Bevan, stating that
he was confused when he gave the statement and told the police what he thought
they wanted to hear because he was scared.

 

                   The appellant Bevan
did not give the police a statement in 1986, but in a statement made to them
shortly after the murder, he falsely stated he and Ribble had gone to Ribble's
mother's on May 13, 1981.  Bevan admitted that he lied to the police about how
he had injured his hand about the time of the murder.  There was evidence, some
admitted and some denied by Bevan, that he had asked other witnesses to lie to
the police about various matters related to his conduct around the date of the
murder.

 

                   Crucial evidence
against the appellants was the testimony of Dietrich, and, to a lesser extent,
Belmont.  In her charge to the jury, the trial judge noted credibility was
important in this case, discussed generally how credibility should be assessed,
and made some references to factors affecting the credibility of Belmont and Dietrich. 
She did not, however, in the language of Vetrovec give a clear sharp
warning to the jury as to its being dangerous to convict the appellants on the
basis of the evidence of Belmont and Dietrich unless their evidence was
supported by other evidence.  Nor did she instruct the jury on the use that
could be made of prior inconsistent statements.

 

                   Dietrich's letter
of August 1986 was read aloud by him during his direct examination.  It
contained a number of statements prejudicial to the appellants.  Defence
counsel then used the letter in cross-examination to attack Dietrich's
testimony and credibility, on the basis of Dietrich's apparent animosity
towards the appellants and his motivations for lying to the police and at
trial.  It was subsequently marked as an exhibit and without objection was
given to the jury.

 

 

II.  Judgments in the Court of
Appeal for Ontario

 

                   The Court of Appeal
was unanimous in rejecting the appellants' arguments on Dietrich's letter to
the police.  

 

                   The majority,
Galligan and Tarnopolsky JJ.A., was of the view that the trial judge properly
exercised her discretion against giving a Vetrovec caution.

 

                   They also held that
the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury on the use to be made of
prior inconsistent statements, while in error, was of no consequence as it
would have been clear to the jury that the prior inconsistent statements were
relevant only to assessing the credibility of the witnesses.

 

                   The curative
provision of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , was applied and the appeal dismissed.

 

                   Osborne J.A.
dissented.  In his view, a Vetrovec caution was required with respect to
the evidence of Dietrich and Belmont, and in the circumstances of this case the
trial judge's warning was insufficient.

 

                   He found that the
prior inconsistent statements were important in assessing credibility of the
witnesses, and that the prior inconsistent statements of Dietrich and Belmont
could have seriously prejudiced the appellants if those statements were used as
evidence of the truth of their contents.  He concluded that the trial judge's
failure to instruct the jury on the use that could be made of prior
inconsistent statements could not be cured by application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

 

III.  Points in Issue

 

                   This appeal raises
these issues:

 

1.Did
the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding that the trial
judge was correct in not giving the jury a clear sharp warning with respect to
the evidence of Dietrich and Belmont?

 

2.Did
the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding there was no error by the trial
judge in either her instructions to the jury on the Dietrich letter or in
permitting it to go as an exhibit to the Jury Room?

 

3.
Did the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario err by holding that
although the trial judge was wrong in failing to instruct the jury with respect
to the use that can be made of prior inconsistent statements no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred?

 

4.Can
the errors made by the trial judge be cured by s. 686(1) (b)(iii)?

 

IV.  Analysis

 

                   1.The
Vetrovec Issue

 

                   The first ground of
appeal requires a determination of what Vetrovec established.  In Vetrovec,
the appellants had been convicted at trial on a charge of conspiracy to traffic
in heroin.  An accomplice had testified for the Crown, and the trial judge
warned the jury of the danger of convicting on the basis of uncorroborated
evidence of an accomplice.  On appeal, the appellants did not object to this
part of the trial judge's charge, but argued that the part of the charge
dealing with the evidence that was capable of corroborative effect was
improper.

 

                   In the course of
giving judgment for this Court, Dickson J. (as he then was) considered the
traditional, ""fixed and invariable"" rule of law that a warning to the
jury was automatically required on the evidence of an accomplice, and
ultimately rejected that traditional rule in favour of a flexible,
discretionary rule.  Under the new rule, the trial judge has a discretion to
determine whether the evidence of any witness -- not just accomplices -- is for
some reason untrustworthy to such an extent that a warning to the jury is
necessary.  He stated at p. 823:

 

All
that can be established is that the testimony of some accomplices may be
untrustworthy.  But this can be said of many other categories of witness. 
There is nothing inherent in the evidence of an accomplice which automatically
renders him untrustworthy.  To construct a universal rule singling out
accomplices, then, is to fasten upon this branch of the law of evidence a blind
and empty formalism.  Rather than attempting to pigeon-hole a witness into a
category and then recite a ritualistic incantation, the trial judge might better
direct his mind to the facts of the case, and thoroughly examine all the
factors which might impair the worth of a particular witness.  If, in his
judgment, the credit of the witness is such that the jury should be cautioned,
then he may instruct accordingly.  If, on the other hand, he believes the
witness to be trustworthy, then, regardless of whether the witness is
technically an `accomplice' no warning is necessary.

 

Dickson J. later commented upon the
practice that should be followed by trial judges in charging juries regarding
untrustworthy witnesses (at pp. 831-832):

 

Because
of the infinite range of circumstance which will arise in the criminal trial
process it is not sensible to attempt to compress into a rule, a formula, or a
direction the concept of the need for prudent scrutiny of the testimony of any
witness.  What may be appropriate, however, in some circumstances, is a clear
and sharp warning to attract the attention of the juror to the risks of adopting,
without more, the evidence of the witness.  There is no magic in the word
corroboration, or indeed in any other comparable expression such as
confirmation and support.  The idea implied in those words may, however, in an
appropriate case, be effectively and efficiently transmitted to the mind of the
trier of fact.  This may entail some illustration from the evidence of the
particular case of the type of evidence, documentary or testimonial, which
might be drawn upon by the juror in confirmation of the witness' testimony or
some important part thereof.  I do not wish to be taken as saying that such
illustration must be carried to exhaustion.  However, there is, in some
circumstances, particularly in lengthy trials, the need for helpful direction
on the question of sifting the evidence where guilt or innocence might, and
probably will turn on the acceptance or rejection, belief or disbelief, of the
evidence of one or more witnesses.

 

                   I do not interpret
Dickson J.'s reasons for judgment in Vetrovec to have established a rule
that if a warning is given regarding a particular witness, the trial judge must
in all cases go on to point out in detail evidence which is capable of
corroborating that witness' testimony.  While an instruction of that nature may
be made in tandem with a Vetrovec warning, Dickson J. did not intend
this to be a requirement in all cases.  This conclusion is supported by the
manner in which Dickson J. dealt with the issue of corroborative evidence in
relation to the facts at issue in Vetrovec.  The trial in that case
lasted more than 100 days, and the charge to the jury took six days.  Obviously
it was more complicated than this trial.  The trial judge in Vetrovec
warned the jury about the danger of convicting the appellants on the evidence of
the accomplice unless that evidence was corroborated in some material
particular by other evidence.  Despite the complexity of the evidence in that
case, Dickson J. expressed the opinion, at p. 832, that it was not necessary
for the trial judge to then go on to outline the evidence capable of
corroborating the accomplice's testimony: 

 

                   I
return to the facts of the present case.  In light of my earlier comments, it
would have been sufficient for the trial judge simply to have instructed the
jury that they should view the testimony of Langvand with great caution, and
that it would be wise to look for other supporting evidence before convicting
the appellants.

 

                   The principles
discussed in Vetrovec were slightly refined in R. v. Babinski
(1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 187 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd [1992] 3 S.C.R. 467.  In that
case, it was held that if a trial judge decides to give a Vetrovec
warning and there is evidence capable of corroborating the testimony of the
witness in question, ""the trial judge should make some reference to that
supporting evidence"" (Ont. C.A., at p. 190).  The extent to which the
trial judge should refer to potentially corroborative evidence depends upon the
circumstances of the case, although it is obviously not required, nor would it
be appropriate, that the potentially corroborative evidence be reviewed
exhaustively.

 

                   While it is usually
a corollary of the Vetrovec warning that the trial judge make some
reference to evidence that the jury may consider supportive of the impugned
evidence, in some cases part or all of the supporting evidence may be extremely
prejudicial to the accused, such that to draw the jury's attention to that
evidence in tandem with a Vetrovec warning could in some circumstances
be unfair to the accused.

 

                   I do not agree that
the only remedy for this problem lies in not giving a Vetrovec
warning.   Instead, the appropriate remedy in those circumstances lies with the
discretion of the trial judge to decide in the particular case (perhaps
following argument) if a Vetrovec warning is to be given, and, if so,
whether it should or should not be accompanied by a direction as to what other
specific evidence the jury might conclude is supportive of the impugned
evidence.

 

                   The trial judge's
decision on this type of question is similar in principle to the decisions
often made by trial judges as to whether to admit cogent but prejudicial
evidence.  Where that kind of issue arises, the trial judge decides whether the
probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.  Because the
trial judge is in the best position to assess the atmosphere of the trial and
the effect that the evidence or instruction may have on a jury hearing the
case, the trial judge's decision on these kinds of issues should not be lightly
interfered with on appeal.

 

                   Had this trial
occurred prior to Vetrovec, a caution would have been required on the
testimony of Dietrich.  Although Dietrich was not an accomplice, he was an
accessory after the fact.  In Sellars v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 527,
it was held that the same rule of caution applied to the testimony of an
accessory after the fact as to the testimony of an accomplice.

 

                   In submissions made
to the trial judge prior to the charge to the jury, defence counsel urged the
trial judge to include an ""unsavoury witness"" warning in her charge,
as did Crown counsel who stated:

 

Perhaps
starting with the easy ones.  The unsavory witness.  It is a matter of
discretion.  However, based on all the evidence your ladyship has before you I
would urge your ladyship to give instructions to the jury on that basis.

 

                   While under Vetrovec
a caution to the jury is a matter of the trial judge's discretion and is not
required in all cases involving testimony of accomplices or accessories after
the fact, there are some cases in which the circumstances may be such that a Vetrovec
caution must be given.  The trial judge's discretion whether to give a Vetrovec
warning should generally be given wide latitude by appellate courts.  But in my
respectful view a Vetrovec caution was clearly required in this case
with respect to the testimony of both Dietrich and Belmont.

 

                   Both of them had
lengthy criminal records, had strong motivations to lie, and approached the
police only when each perceived that some benefit -- such as release from
prison, a discontinuation of charges against them, or cash payments -- could be
obtained in exchange for their testimony.  Both of them explicitly told the
police at the time they came forward that they were seeking a ""deal""
in exchange for their evidence against the appellants.  Moreover, the evidence
of Belmont and Dietrich was incriminating to the appellants, and crucial to the
Crown's case.

 

                   The trial judge was
aware of the issue of credibility and made reference to factors that could
specifically affect the credibility of Dietrich and Belmont, but she did not
convey to the jury a clear sharp warning.  The references made by the trial
judge to the evidence of Dietrich and Belmont were made in the course of a
seriatim review of the evidence given by all of the witnesses who testified at
trial.  The trial judge used much the same language in addressing the evidence
of Dietrich and Belmont as she did in addressing the evidence of other
witnesses, both individually and in a general sense.

 

                   After the trial
judge's charge to the jury, defence counsel argued that the charge was
insufficient with respect to the ""unsavoury witness"" warning, but the
trial judge declined to recharge the jury.  It is not clear from the trial
judge's comments in the discussions following her charge to the jury whether
she was of the view that she had given an adequate Vetrovec warning, or
whether she had decided not to give such a warning.  In either event, the trial
judge's charge to the jury lacked the clear and sharp warning required by Vetrovec
to attract the attention of the jury to the risk of adopting, without more,
the evidence of Dietrich and Belmont.

 

                   2.The
Dietrich Letter

 

                   The key point in
dealing with the question of whether the trial judge erred in permitting the
Dietrich letter to go to the jury is that the appellants' counsel at trial not
only did not object, but appeared to have wanted the letter to go to
them.  Defence counsel made a strategic decision that there was benefit to the
appellants in having the letter in the jury's possession during their
deliberations, in that the letter undermined Dietrich's credibility.  It is not
now open to the appellants, having made that decision, to complain about the
disadvantages of Dietrich's letter's going to the jury.  

 

                   However, the
appellants were still entitled to a proper instruction being given to the jury
as to the limited use that could be made of the letter during their
deliberations.  The letter contained highly prejudicial statements against the
appellants, including a suggestion that the appellants wanted Dietrich dead
because of his knowledge about the murder (Dietrich did not adopt this in his
testimony).

 

                   The trial judge did
not instruct the jury that the letter could not be used as substantive
evidence, and referred to the letter in terms that may have given the jury the
impression that it could be used in that manner.  In her charge to the
jury, the trial judge noted the importance of Dietrich's testimony, and
referred to his letter as a ""very interesting piece of evidence"". 
She had also instructed the jury that the ""filed exhibits"" were
""evidence"".

 

                   3.Can
the Trial Judge's Error in Failing to Instruct the Jury with respect to the Use
that can be made of Prior Inconsistent Statements be cured by s. 686(1) (b)(iii)?

 

                   Since this issue
requires a consideration of the approach to be taken to s. 686(1) (b)(iii),
I will address it in the course of assessing whether all of the trial judge's
errors can be cured by that provision.

 

                   4.Should
the Curative Provision be Applied in this Case?

 

                   The question to be
asked in determining whether there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice as a result of a trial judge's error is whether ""the verdict
would necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred"":  see
Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, per Cartwright J. (as
he then was), at p. 744; Wildman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at
pp. 328-29.  This test has also been expressed in terms of whether there is any
possibility that if the error had not been committed, a judge or properly
instructed jury would have acquitted the accused:  see Colpitts, per
Spence J., at p. 756; R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, per
Sopinka J., at p. 919; R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, at p. 620; R.
v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697, per Iacobucci J. at pp. 736-37. 
I do not interpret these two approaches as being intended to convey different
meanings.  Under either approach, the task of an appellate court is to
determine whether there is any reasonable possibility that the verdict would
have been different had the error at issue not been made.

 

                   While each of the
errors made by the trial judge in this case was serious in nature, it is not
necessary to reflect upon whether any one of those errors, if it were the sole
error by the trial judge, would have been a sufficient basis for directing a
new trial.  When the cumulative effect of the errors in question is considered,
in my view this is clearly not a case in which it would be appropriate to apply
the curative provision.  In all the circumstances of this case there is a
reasonable possibility that, but for the trial judge's errors, the verdict
would have been different.

 

                   The jury may have
treated the evidence of Belmont and Dietrich less cautiously during their
deliberations than they would have had the trial judge given a proper Vetrovec
warning.  As for Dietrich's letter, it is noteworthy that the jury asked the
trial judge if there was a signed statement of Dietrich.  There was no such
statement available, but the jury had Dietrich's letter with them.  It is
difficult to say with any degree of certainty in the absence of a direction
from the trial judge that the jury did not use Dietrich's letter
inappropriately.

 

                   This leaves the
matter of the trial judge's failure to instruct the jury as to the use to be
made of prior inconsistent statements.  In light of the manner in which the
prior inconsistent statements were utilized in cross-examination of various
witnesses and in the closing submissions of defence counsel, the jury surely
understood that the credibility of witnesses was affected by prior inconsistent
statements made by those witnesses.  An instruction by the trial judge in this
regard would have only repeated what was already patently obvious to the jury
in the context of the trial proceedings in this case.

 

                   The real danger
flowing from the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury on the use
that may be made of prior inconsistent statements is that the jury may not have
understood that such statements could not be used as evidence to prove the
truth of their contents.  This danger was exacerbated by the trial judge's
making a number of comments that may have caused the jury to conclude that all
prior statements (consistent or inconsistent) could be used as
substantive evidence.  During the course of her charge to the jury, the trial
judge stated:

 

                   A
fact may be established by direct or circumstantial evidence or by a combination
of both.  Direct evidence consists of concrete objects, written statements, the
testimony of witnesses of things he saw, he perceived through his senses. 
Something the witness has seen, heard, felt.  Example - the photographs and
signed statements given to the police by each of the accused which have been
filed as exhibits, that is direct evidence.

 

While the trial judge explained to the
jury that statements by the accused could be used as substantive evidence, she
did not instruct the jury that they could not also utilize prior statements by
a witness as evidence of the truth of their contents.  She instructed the jury
that newspaper articles that had been filed as exhibits were not filed as
evidence of the truth of their contents.  This instruction, combined with the
absence of instruction as to the use that could be made of witness statements
generally, may have suggested in the minds of the jurors that they could use
witness statements as evidence of the truth of their contents.  Credence is given
to this possibility by the jury's question to the judge, during their
deliberations, as to whether there was a signed statement of Dietrich.  The
jury may have had the impression that such a statement -- or any other witness
statement -- could be used as substantive evidence.

 

                   The majority of the
Court of Appeal was of the view that because the prior inconsistent statements
were not used by counsel for the purpose of proving the truth of their
contents, the non-direction by the trial judge on this issue caused no
prejudice to the appellants.  With respect, I do not agree.  The reason why the
law requires an instruction of this nature is that there is otherwise a risk
that jurors may not be aware that they cannot use such statements as
substantive evidence, irrespective of the use made of the statements by
counsel.  While the trial judge and counsel undoubtedly appreciated the limited
purpose of reference to the prior inconsistent statements, it cannot be safely
assumed that the jury had a similar understanding.

 

                   At a new trial of
the charges against the appellants, the question of the substantive
admissibility of the prior inconsistent statements might have to be considered,
in light of this Court's reasons in R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R.
740. But I should not be taken in noting this to be suggesting that the
statements in issue should (or should not) be ruled substantively admissible at
a new trial.

 

VI.Conclusion

 

                   I would allow the
appeals and order a new trial.

 

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé J.//

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting) -- I
respectfully dissent from the majority and would dispose of this appeal as did
the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 381, (Tarnopolsky
and Galligan JJ.A., Osborne J.A. dissenting).

 

                    After a trial
which lasted four days before a jury presided over by a judge, the appellants
were convicted of the second degree murder of one Peter Hodgin.  Both accused
relied on a defence of alibi which, if believed, would have brought about their
acquittal.  The whole case, then, turned upon credibility.

 

                   The three grounds
of appeal raised by the accused relate to the trial judge's charge to the jury,
namely her failure to give a sharp and clear warning as set out in Vetrovec
v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, concerning the testimony of the
witnesses Dietrich and Belmont, her failure to instruct the jury with respect
to prior inconsistent statements and the filing as an exhibit, by consent, of a
letter written by the witness Dietrich.

 

                   I disagree with the
conclusions of the majority as to the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , in this case and must state
my agreement with the reasons of Galligan J.A., writing for the majority of the
Court of Appeal, and in particular with his remarks, at pp. 403-4, regarding
the trial judge's charge to the jury:

 

Read
as a whole it struck me as a model of fairness and even-handedness.  Even though the trial was long and difficult,
there were no complicated legal issues to be resolved.  The issue
ultimately was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the
appellants were the murderers of the victim.  They said they had nothing to do
with the killing and provided alibi defences.  If they had been
believed, or even if their evidence had raised a reasonable doubt on the issue,
they were entitled to be acquitted.  On the other hand, if the evidence of
certain Crown witnesses, including Dietrich and Belmont, had been believed,
then there could be no doubt of the appellants' guilt.  The jury  had that most
difficult of tasks entrusted to the trier of fact, the weighing of the
credibility of witnesses who contradict one another.

 

                   The
trial judge repeatedly told the jury that the burden of proof rested upon the
Crown and that the appellants were entitled to the benefit of any reasonable
doubt which arose on the evidence.  She also told the jury that the appellants
were entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt about the accuracy or
weight of any of the evidence.  She stressed that the credibility of witnesses
was very important in the case and carefully outlined the factors that should
be taken into account in weighing credibility.

 

                   The
trial judge gave short and even-handed summaries of the controversial testimony
and fairly presented the theory of the defence.  In short, from my reading of
her charge as a whole, it is my opinion that the trial judge laid out for the
jury accurately and objectively the issues it had to decide.  It is my view
that the charge to the jury in this case was admirable. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   This is, in my
view, the proper light in which a court of appeal, and for that matter our
Court, should address a trial judge's charge to a jury as regards the grounds
of appeal raised in relation to that charge.  If, taken as a whole, the charge
is fair, whatever error it may contain, it cannot amount to a miscarriage of
justice and s. 686(1) (b)(iii) will apply.

 

                   Jury trials should
not be presided over by courts of appeal who are removed from the atmosphere of
a particular trial, who have no possibility of appreciating the personality,
level of sophistication and understanding, or other traits of a particular jury
and who do not have the benefit of hearing counsels' addresses to the jury but
only of reading them.

 

                   A trial judge's
discretion to deal with a trial as best fits the case over which he or she must
preside is an essential element of a trial.  Otherwise, a mechanical
application of the rules would suffice.  Courts should be wary of usurping this
function and overruling that discretion.  Almost every accused in an appeal
challenges the judge's charge to the jury in the hope of winning a new trial or
an acquittal.  Judges' charges to the jury are easy targets and if courts give
in too easily to those alleged errors, the courts of appeal will take over a
trial judge's function.  The rationale underlying s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code  is precisely to insure that only in cases where a
miscarriage of justice has occurred will courts intervene in a trial judge's
handling of a trial.  This is the test and the only test.  An error by a trial
judge does not by itself warrant intervention by a court of appeal.  Only if
that error is sufficiently serious to constitute a miscarriage of justice will
it justify intervention.  This is what this case is all about.

 

                   Dealing first with
the Vetrovec issue, I would emphasize that this Court has rejected the
notion that ""ritualistic incantations"" must be given regarding the
danger of convicting on the uncorroborated testimony of certain categories of
witnesses such as accomplices.  This is no more than a recognition that the
testimony of a witness who is an accomplice may not be inherently any more
untrustworthy than that of many other witnesses.  In the words of Dickson J.
(as he then was) in Vetrovec at p. 823, ""[t]o construct a universal
rule singling out accomplices, then, is to fasten upon this branch of the law
of evidence a blind and empty formalism"".  Rather, a trial judge now has
the discretion to determine, after considering factors which might impair the worth
of a witness, whether ""the credit of the witness is such that the jury
should be cautioned"" (Vetrovec, at p. 823).

 

                   Respect for the
discretion of the trial judge in such matters is necessary because, even where
there are legitimate concerns about the credibility of a witness, a clear and
sharp warning may not be appropriate in every case.  Furthermore, the accused
may him- or herself benefit from the retention of the trial judge's discretion
regarding the wisdom of a warning in a particular trial.  As Galligan J.A.
pointed out, citing the following words of Martin J.A. in R. v. Yanover
(1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 300, at p. 324:

 

                   3.    Where
the judge decides that such a warning is called for he should assist the
jury by drawing to their attention by way of illustration an item or items of
evidence which they may draw upon as confirmation of the witness's evidence,
but he is not under the same mandatory obligation that existed prior to Vetrovec
to detail exhaustively ""the evidence"" capable of supporting the evidence
of the accomplice. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In the process of
giving a Vetrovec warning, the trial judge is required to review
evidence which corroborates the statements of the accomplice.  The necessary
effect of such a warning in some cases will be to emphasize evidence which is
prejudicial to the accused which otherwise would not be directly referred to by
the trial judge.  The result is, as Dickson J. observed in Vetrovec at
p. 818, that:

 

                   The
accused is in the unhappy position of hearing the judge draw particular
attention to the evidence which tends to confirm the testimony the accomplice
has given.  Cogent prejudicial testimony is thus repeated and high-lighted. 

 

                   This is precisely
what would have occurred in the present case had a Vetrovec warning been
given.  Galligan J.A. observed, at pp. 406-7, that:

 

                   If
the trial judge had decided to give a Vetrovec caution respecting
Dietrich's testimony, I think she would have been required not only to remind
the jury of Griffith's statement to the police confirming the presence of the
car at his home the day after the murder but also of Griffith's later denial of
the truth of his own statement.  The effect of doing so would have been
devastating to Griffith and would have outweighed by far any benefit he could
have obtained from a Vetrovec caution.  It is my opinion that in these
circumstances the trial judge correctly exercised her discretion in declining
to give the Vetrovec caution respecting the witness Dietrich.
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   Therefore, not only
have the appellants suffered no detriment because of the absence of a Vetrovec
warning, their position may well have been strengthened by the decision of the
trial judge to proceed as she did.

 

                   In my view, no
error was committed by the trial judge in the exercise of her discretion.  I
agree with Galligan J.A. that the effect of Vetrovec is to give trial
judges a wide and flexible discretion as to how they instruct juries of the
need for careful scrutiny of a witness' testimony.  It is evident from the discussion
that the judge had with counsel before the charge to the jury that she
considered the propriety and need for a Vetrovec caution.  While
declining to do so, she nonetheless indicated that Dietrich's evidence required
careful scrutiny and directed the jury to consider whether it was consistent
with other credible evidence. In the circumstances, I would only restate the
words of Galligan J.A., at p. 405, that:

 

. .
. the reviewing court must pay great deference to the trial judge's peculiar
advantage in evaluating the atmosphere of a trial and in assessing whether or
not, in all of the circumstances of a particular case, a Vetrovec
warning would redound to the benefit or detriment of an accused.

 

                   Turning now to the
alleged failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury regarding the use to be
made of the prior inconsistent statements of Dietrich and Belmont, one must
immediately point out that neither counsel objected to the judge's charge on
that point, although objections were made on other points.  The reason is quite
obvious when one considers that those statements were put to the witnesses for
the sole purpose of casting doubt on their credibility, never with the
intention that they be adopted by the witnesses as evidence of the truth of
their contents.  Those witnesses were vigorously cross-examined and, in defence
counsel's address to the jury, their statements were referred to on many
occasions for the sole purpose of credibility.  While failure to object would
not of itself be fatal, the tactics of defence counsel cannot be overlooked. 
As I stated in R. v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697, at pp. 713-14:  

 

                   I
am not suggesting that failure to object at trial will preclude counsel from
alleging on appeal that an error was made.  Mere silence of counsel cannot
displace the right of an accused to a fair trial.  However, it is important to
consider the reasons for counsel's failure to raise any objection to . . .
evidence.

 

In this case, the failure of counsel
to object indicates, in my view, that everybody took for granted that the
purpose of introducing those prior statements was only to test the credibility
of those witnesses.  No one ever suggested otherwise.  In the circumstances, it
cannot be a matter of reproach to the trial judge that she took the case as it
was presented and argued before the jury.

 

                   Prior to the charge
by the judge, the jury had the benefit of hearing numerous statements from
defence counsel on the unreliable nature of the testimony of Dietrich and
Belmont.  Counsel for Griffith stated:

 

                   The
evidence against Mr. Griffith, I submit, comes down to Mr. Curtis, Mr.
Dietrich, and Mr. Belmont.  I suggest to you that all their evidence, all three
of them, as I have gone through for the last period of time is riddled with
lies and inconsistencies.  And if you come to that conclusion too, you have to
ask yourself why would they lie about certain things but tell the truth about
other things?

 

Further on counsel suggested:

 

                   And,
again, not only are [sic] their evidence riddled with inconsistencies,
but all three of these men, as I have indicated, had ulterior motives to
implicate Mr. Griffith.  I submit their evidence can't be relied upon to give Mr.
Griffith spitting on a sidewalk, let alone to a charge of murder.  And there
has been no evidence presented at all by the Crown attorney involving Mr.
Griffith from any witnesses unbiased that implicates Mr. Griffith.

 

                   The trial judge, on
a number of occasions, stressed that credibility was at the core of the case. 
She also stressed that the statements in question should be scrutinized in that
light.  In her charge to the jury with respect to the evidence of Dietrich, the
trial judge reminded the jury that he had a lengthy criminal record.  She noted
the fact that he had approached the police shortly into his three year sentence
and his denial that he had received anything for his assistance.  Later in the
charge she remarked:

 

                   When
assessing Dietrich's evidence you will have to scrutinize it very carefully. 
Does it dovetail with the other evidence that you believe?  Bear in mind that
he approached the police and that letter... will be with you in the juryroom.

 

Finally, she reminded the jury:

 

                   Members
of the jury, the law is easy.  He was badly beaten whoever did it - murder. 
The real question is did both or either of these accused kill Hodgins?  The
evidence of the two accused and the evidence of Dietrich is extremely important
when deciding this question.  Scrutinize all the evidence carefully.  Decide
what you believe and what you do not believe.  Find your facts, reach your
verdicts, but as I have told you, this is basically a matter of credibility. 
Who do you believe and who do you not believe, and that is where you are going
to have to start.  Whose evidence do we believe, and then you can build on
that, and does the next evidence dovetail with that?  Does it agree with the
evidence that you have accepted? 

 

The trial judge began her review of
the evidence of Belmont and Mathers with the observation that they were
""partners in crime"".  After reviewing their testimony, she noted:

 

                   You
will recall that Helen Mathers and Patrick Belmont were both, it would appear
from the evidence, cooperating with the police in order to either get him,
Belmont, out of jail and, hopefully, have his charges dropped.  And I am
sure you will recall their evidence, how confusing it was at times.  And there
was the evidence he wore the bodypacks and what happened when he was wearing
those.  And, again, counsel have covered that with you.  And I think you
remember the evidence of the police officer that only 20 percent of those tapes
were audible. 

 

                   So,
again, you are going to have to think of all these things very carefully and
the circumstances in which that evidence was given when you are determining
what weight to give to it.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Although it is
generally recognized that the failure to warn a jury about the use it can make
of a witness' prior statement, unless adopted at trial, can be fatal in cases
where a jury might accept such a statement as evidence of its truth rather than
going only to credibility, this is not such a case.

 

                   The same conclusion
was reached in R. v. Hobart (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 518 (Ont. C.A.),
where Martin J.A, after stating, at p. 539, that ""a clear direction is
required that the prior inconsistent statement is not evidence of the truth of
the facts contained therein . . ."", went on to say, at pp. 539-40:

 

                   In
the present case the out-of-court statements of the witness that were more
incriminating of the appellants than her sworn testimony at the trial, were
introduced by the defence.  No doubt the purpose of defence counsel in
eliciting the evidence of Glover's prior statements to the police was to show
that she was careless of the truth or that she could not distinguish between fact
and fantasy.  No one suggested that these statements could be used to prove
the truth of the facts contained in them.  I do not wish to be taken as
holding, however, that even in this situation it was unnecessary to warn the
jury that the prior out-of-court statements of the witness not adopted by her,
were not evidence of the truth of the facts contained in them.  The absence
of such a warning in the present case does not, however, import the same
prejudice to the accused, as it might in other circumstances.

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

                   Although
it would have been preferable if the trial Judge had expressly instructed
the jury that Sandra Glover's unadopted out-of-court statements made to the
police were not evidence of the truth of the facts contained in them, I am
satisfied that his failure to do so did not in all the circumstances result in
a miscarriage of justice.  I also observe that no objection was taken at the
trial to his failure to give the instruction which it is now contended
should have been given.  I would, if necessary, apply the curative provisions
of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   This is precisely
the case here.  The judge tailored her charge to the case before her and the
case, in her view, did not mandate the warning in question.  Upon reviewing the
whole case and examining the address to the jury in that light, I could not agree
more.

 

                   Besides, I agree
with the Crown that such statements were inconsequential and, as Galligan J.A.
said at p. 411:

 

An
instruction that prior inconsistent statements could undermine the credibility
of witnesses would have applied to them as well as to the Crown witnesses. 
Thus, the instruction could have done the appellants more harm than good.

 

                   For all these
reasons, I am convinced that no miscarriage of justice has occurred in the
circumstances and, should it be necessary, I would apply the proviso in s.
686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  which is specifically
designed to cure the type of defect in question.

 

                   In the result, I
would dismiss these appeals.

on appeal from the court of appeal for

        Criminal law ‑‑
Sexual assault ‑‑ Accused grabbing three‑year‑old son
in genital area to discipline him ‑‑ Absence of evidence of sexual
gratification ‑‑ Accused convicted of sexual assault ‑‑
Whether assault was a sexual assault.

 

        The accused was charged with
sexually assaulting his three‑year‑old son.  In a statement to the
police, he explained that he grabbed his son's genitals in order to deter him
from grabbing the genital region of adults and to show him how much it hurts. 
The accused was convicted.  The trial judge concluded that the absence of
evidence of sexual gratification on the part of the accused was irrelevant in
this case, given the other indicia which lead to the conclusion that the
assault was in fact a sexual assault.  The majority of the Court of Appeal
upheld the accused's conviction.

 

        Held (Sopinka J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

        Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
L'Heureux‑Dubé, Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.:  It was
clearly open to the trial judge in this case to conclude, from all the
circumstances, that the assault was one of a sexual nature.  The assault was
such that the sexual integrity of the child was violated.

 

        Per Sopinka J. (dissenting):
 The lack of an intention of sexual gratification on the part of the
accused was relevant in this case and changes the whole complexion of the
accused's activity.  In every aspect of the test for sexual assault,
except the part of the body attacked, the assault was non‑sexual in
nature. The proper disposition is to dismiss the appeal and substitute a
conviction for common assault.

        The judgment of Lamer C.J. and
La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. was delivered by

 

        Iacobucci
J. -- This is an appeal
which comes to us as of right.  The appellant was convicted of sexually
assaulting his three-year-old son by grabbing his genitals; the conviction was
upheld by the Court of Appeal of Ontario (1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 20, Grange J.A.
dissenting on whether the assault was a sexual assault within the meaning of s.
271(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .   

 

        In R. v. Chase, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 293, the Court dealt with the offence of sexual assault and McIntyre
J., after discussing applicable principles and authorities, stated, in
delivering the judgment of the Court (at p. 302):

 

Sexual
assault is an assault within any one of the definitions of that concept in s.
244(1)  of the Criminal Code  [now s. 265(1) ] which is committed in
circumstances of a sexual nature, such that the sexual integrity of the victim
is violated.  The test to be applied in determining whether the impugned
conduct has the requisite sexual nature is an objective one: ""Viewed in
the light of all the circumstances, is the sexual or carnal context of the
assault visible to a reasonable observer"". . . .  The part of the body
touched, the nature of the contact, the situation in which it occurred, the
words and gestures accompanying the act, and all other circumstances
surrounding the conduct, including threats which may or may not be accompanied
by force, will be relevant. . . .  The intent or purpose of the person
committing the act, to the extent that this may appear from the evidence, may
also be a factor in considering whether the conduct is sexual.  If the motive
of the accused is sexual gratification, to the extent that this may appear from
the evidence, it may be a factor in determining whether the conduct is sexual. 
It must be emphasized, however, that the existence of such a motive is simply
one of many factors to be considered, the importance of which will vary
depending on the circumstances.

 

        In the case at bar, the trial
judge referred, as did Osborne J.A. for the majority in the Ontario Court of
Appeal, generally to the above comments of McIntyre J. in convicting the
appellant.  Among other things, the appellant, on three occasions, violently
clutched the little boy's scrotum and there was evidence of bruising and severe
pain.  In my view, it was clearly open to the trial judge to conclude from all
the circumstances that the assault was one of a sexual nature and that the
assault was such that the sexual integrity of the appellant's son was violated.

 

        Accordingly, I would dismiss
the appeal.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

        The following are the reasons
delivered by

 

        Sopinka
J. (dissenting) -- In my
opinion, the learned trial judge in this case failed to accord any weight to
the absence of any motive or intent on the part of the accused to seek sexual
gratification in doing what he did.  The weight to be accorded this factor in determining
whether the assault is of a sexual nature will depend on the circumstances of
the case.  See R. v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, at p. 302.  I agree
with Grange J.A., dissenting herein in the Court of Appeal (1992), 8 O.R. (3d)
20, who concluded as follows (at p. 26):

 

        When
I examine the undisputed circumstances of this assault, I cannot reach the same
conclusion.  I cannot agree that the lack of an intention of sexual
gratification is irrelevant.  It seems to me, in the circumstances of this case,
most relevant and changes the whole complexion of the appellant's activity.  In
every aspect of the test, except the part of the body attacked, the assault was
non-sexual in nature.

 

        The
assault was a misguided form of discipline and a cruel, unjustified attack upon
a helpless child.  It was assaultive; it was contemptible; it was deserving of
punishment; but it was not sexual assault.

 

        In
light of R. v. Nantais, [1966] 2 O.R. 246, [1966] 4 C.C.C. 108 (C.A.),
the proper disposition is to dismiss the appeal and substitute a conviction for
common assault.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

        I would dispose of the appeal
as proposed by Grange J.A.

Freedoms.

 

                   A prison inmate
challenged in the Federal Court, Trial Division the constitutionality of frisk
searching and patrolling of cell ranges conducted in male prisons by female
guards.  The frisk search consists of a hand search of a clothed inmate from
head to foot. Touching of the genital area, although not specifically
precluded, is avoided.  The surveillance patrols consist of regular scheduled
cell patrols (""counts"") and unannounced patrols conducted at random
times every hour (""winds"").  The inmate objected to the cross‑gender
touching that occurs during a frisk search and to the female guards' possible
viewing of inmates while undressed or while using the toilet during counts and
winds.  The trial judge concluded that the cross‑gender frisk searches
did not violate ss. 7 , 8  and 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  but that the winds conducted by female guards constituted an
invasion of privacy of male inmates contrary to s. 8 .  The Federal Court of
Appeal set aside the judgment, holding that neither the cross‑gender
frisk searches nor the cross-gender winds were unconstitutional.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

                   The frisk search,
the count and the wind are all practices necessary in a prison for the security
of the institution, the public and the prisoners themselves.  The possible
inappropriate effects of these practices are minimized by the provision of
special training to ensure they are professionally executed with due regard for
the dignity of the inmate.  A substantially reduced level of privacy is present
in prison ‑‑ a prison cell is expected to be exposed and to require
observation ‑‑ and a prisoner thus cannot hold a reasonable
expectation of privacy with respect to these practices.  This conclusion is
unaffected by the fact that the practices at times may be conducted by female
guards.  There being no reasonable expectation of privacy, s. 8  of the Charter 
is not called into play; nor is s. 7  implicated.

 

                   It does not follow
from the fact that female prison inmates are not subject to cross-gender frisk
searches and surveillance that these practices result in discriminatory
treatment of male inmates.  Equality under s. 15(1)  of the Charter  does
not necessarily connote identical treatment;  in fact, different treatment may
be called for in certain cases to promote equality.  Equality, in the present
context, does not demand that practices which are forbidden where male officers
guard female inmates must also be banned where female officers guard male
inmates.  Given the historical, biological and sociological differences between
men and women, it is clear that the effect of cross‑gender searching is
different and more threatening for women than for men.  In any event, even if
this different treatment amounts to a breach of s. 15(1) , the practices
are saved by s. 1  of the Charter .  The important government
objectives of inmate rehabilitation and security of the institution are
promoted as a result of the humanizing effect of having women in these
positions.  Moreover, Parliament's ideal of achieving employment equity is
given a material application by way of this initiative.  The proportionality of
the means used to the importance of these ends would thus justify the breach of
s. 15(1) , if any.

//La Forest J.//

 

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   La
Forest J. -- In this
appeal from the Federal Court of Appeal, [1991] 1 F.C. 85, the appellant
challenges the constitutionality of frisk searching and patrolling of cell
ranges conducted in male penitentiaries by female guards pursuant to ss. 7 , 8 
and 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

                   The frisk search
consists of a hand search of a clothed inmate, from head to foot, down the
front and rear of the body, around the legs and inside clothing folds, pockets
and footwear and includes searching by use of hand-held scanning devices. 
Although touching of the genital area is not specifically precluded in this
type of search, it is avoided; the appellant testified that he had never been
touched in the genital area during a frisk.  The frisk search ordinarily lasts
five seconds, although on occasion, might take up to fifteen.  The patrolling
practices challenged by the appellant are twofold:  the ""count"" and
the ""wind"".  Counts are performed regularly at four scheduled times
daily.  An officer first announces the count at the top of the particular range
to be counted, to let the inmates know that the count is starting, and then
walks down the range looking into each cell for two or three seconds in order
to ensure that the inmate is accounted for and is alive and well.  Winds are
conducted once an hour but, in contrast, are conducted at random times and are
unannounced.  This surveillance technique is performed in this way to preserve
an element of surprise in order to verify that the inmates are not engaged in any
activities detrimental to the good order and security of the institution.  In
practice, the first inmate on the range to see the officer alerts the other
inmates to the wind.

 

                   The appellant
objected to the cross-gender touching that occurs during the frisk search and
to the female guards' possible viewing of inmates while undressed or while
using the bathroom facilities in their cells during counts and winds.  During
oral argument, counsel for the appellant abandoned its objection to the counts,
recognizing that the inmates are sufficiently warned of the upcoming
surveillance to avoid these results.

 

                   The possible
inappropriate effects of the practices are minimized by the provision of
special training to ensure they are professionally executed with due regard for
the dignity of the inmate.  Few complaints are received from inmates regarding
invasions of privacy by virtue of having been searched by a female officer. 
Regarding the winds, the occasions when an inmate might be seen unclothed or
tending to personal functions are rare and fleeting:  one or two times a year,
according to the appellant, for the two or three seconds it takes a guard to
view the cell.  Modesty barriers, which are placed in front of the cell toilets
so that officers can only view the inmates from the waist up while using the
facilities, are present in certain cell blocks.

 

                   Imprisonment
necessarily entails surveillance, searching and scrutiny.  A prison cell is
expected to be exposed and to require observation.  The frisk search, the count
and the wind are all practices necessary in a penitentiary for the security of
the institution, the public and indeed the prisoners themselves.  A
substantially reduced level of privacy is present in this setting and a
prisoner thus cannot hold a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to
these practices.  This conclusion is unaffected by the fact that the practices
at times may be conducted by female guards.  There being no reasonable
expectation of privacy, s. 8  of the Charter  is not called into play; nor
is s. 7  implicated.

 

                   It is also doubtful
that s. 15(1)  is violated.  In arguing that the impugned practices result in
discriminatory treatment of male inmates, the appellant points to the fact that
female penitentiary inmates are not similarly subject to cross-gender frisk
searches and surveillance.  The jurisprudence of this Court is clear:  equality
does not necessarily connote identical treatment and, in fact, different
treatment may be called for in certain cases to promote equality.  Given the
historical, biological and sociological differences between men and women,
equality does not demand that practices which are forbidden where male officers
guard female inmates must also be banned where female officers guard male
inmates.  The reality of the relationship between the sexes is such that the
historical trend of violence perpetrated by men against women is not matched by
a comparable trend pursuant to which men are the victims and women the
aggressors.  Biologically, a frisk search or surveillance of a man's chest area
conducted by a female guard does not implicate the same concerns as the same
practice by a male guard in relation to a female inmate.  Moreover, women
generally occupy a disadvantaged position in society in relation to men. 
Viewed in this light, it becomes clear that the effect of cross-gender
searching is different and more threatening for women than for men.  The
different treatment to which the appellant objects thus may not be
discrimination at all.

 

                   In any event, even
if one were to look at this different treatment as amounting to a breach of s.
15(1) , the practices are saved by s. 1  of the Charter .  The assignment
of women to the surveillance of male inmates, with all of the resultant
searching and patrolling duties, is a rather recent phenomenon.  The important
government objectives of inmate rehabilitation and security of the institution
are promoted as a result of the humanizing effect of having women in these
positions.  Moreover, Parliament's ideal of achieving employment equity is
given a material application by way of this initiative.  The proportionality of
the means used to the importance of these ends would thus justify its breach of
s. 15(1) , if any.

 

                   I would therefore
dismiss the appeal with costs.

Charter of Rights and Freedoms , ss. 7 , 11 (b).

 

                   The appellant was
charged with criminal negligence causing death in an information sworn on
September 15, 1988.  He was released from custody on an undertaking.  A series
of lengthy delays occurred (in part to accommodate counsel for both the Crown
and the defence) with respect to matters preliminary to a trial and a trial
date was finally set at December 3, 1990.  Appellant applied on that date for
and was granted a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  on
the ground that the right to trial within a reasonable time in s. 11 (b)
of the Charter  had been infringed.  The Attorney General appealed
against the stay of proceedings on December 24, 1990 and the hearing for the
appeal was set for April 24, 1992.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on
June 22, 1992, and set aside the stay and remitted the matter for trial on an
expedited basis.  The issues before this Court were whether the delay preceding
the end of the trial was so unreasonable as to offend the provisions of s. 11 (b)
of the Charter  and whether s. 11 (b) applied to the delay in
respect of the appellate proceedings.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé, Sopinka,
Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci JJ.:  The appeal based on pre‑trial delay
was dismissed for the reasons given by Osborne J.A.

 

                   Section 11 (b)
does not apply to delay in respect of an appeal from conviction by the accused
or from an acquittal or stay by the Crown.  There is no distinction in this
regard between an acquittal after trial and a judicial stay.

 

                   The term
""[a]ny person charged"" under s. 11  does not, as a general rule,
include an accused person who is party to an appeal.  A particular subsection
in s. 11  may, however, apply to appeal proceedings as an exception to the
general rule if its purpose and language support this conclusion.  Section 11 (b),
however, has been interpreted as applying only to the consequences of delay
flowing from a formal charge and does not extend to the consequences of delay
at large.  Short of a formal charge, similar consequences proceeding from other
aspects of governmental activity in the criminal process do not trigger the
protection of the provision.

 

                   After an acquittal
and before the service of a notice of appeal, the person acquitted is not a
person charged because there is no proceeding which seeks to charge the person
acquitted.  Upon the appeal's being filed there is a possibility that the
acquittal will be set aside and the charge will be revived.  The plight of the
acquitted person is that of one against whom governmental action is directed
which may result in a charge.  In this respect the former accused is like the
suspect against whom an investigation has been completed and charges are
contemplated awaiting a decision by the prosecutor.  There is even less reason
to extend the protection of s. 11 (b) to a convicted person who appeals
because the appeal is not governmental action.

 

                   The conclusion that
the words ""[a]ny person charged"" in s. 11 (b) limit the
operation of the subsection to the trial process is supported by the use of the
word ""tried"".  If the subsection were to apply to final adjudication
as well, more apt wording would have been used.

 

                   Section 11 (b)
is not spent when there is an adjudication relating to a charge is appealed. 
If on the appeal the judgment is set aside and the matter is remitted for
trial, the accused reverts to the status of a person charged.

 

                   The criminal
appellant or respondent is not without a remedy when delay of appeal
proceedings affects the fairness of the trial.  The court's power to remedy an
abuse of process,  enshrined as a principle of fundamental justice in s. 7 , is
simply applied to delay.  The criminal appeal rules and provisions of the Criminal
Code  also afford a litigant in a criminal appeal a range of remedies to
eliminate any substantial delay on the part of the adversary.

 

                   The appropriate
forum for a remedy under s. 7  of the Charter  is the court in which the
delay occurred.  It is in the best position to assess the consequences of the
delay.  If a further appeal lies from the first appellate court, the issue of
delay can be reviewed in the second appellate court along with the consequences
of additional delay resulting from the second appeal.  This Court does not
favour issues being raised for the first time in an appeal to this Court.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and McLachlin and Major
JJ.:  ""[C]harged with an offence"" indicates a person subject to the
power of the criminal process.  Until the person is finally released from the
jeopardy of the criminal process by a final resolution of the
""charges"", the person remains, for the purposes of s. 11 (b), a
person charged with an offence.

 

                   Many of the rights
enumerated in s. 11 are restricted to the early stages of the criminal
process.  But others, such as s. 11(h) and 11(g), clearly apply
after a verdict.  Since s. 11 is directed to ensuring fairness at all stages of
the criminal process, it cannot be concluded that s. 11(b) must
necessarily be confined to the pre‑stay, pre‑verdict phase.

 

                   The rights which s.
11(b) seeks to protect are all engaged in the period between a verdict
or a stay and the final disposition of the criminal charges.  The language and
context of the subsection indicate that it is not confined to the pre‑stay
or pre‑verdict period of the criminal process.  The fact that the
restriction of the interest which s. 11(b) protects must result from an
actual charge does not lead to the conclusion that s. 11(b) does not
apply to post‑stay or post‑verdict appellate delay.  If ""[a]ny
person charged"" is read as being synonymous with ""a person who is the
subject of the criminal process"", s. 11(b) would apply even after a
verdict.  The appeal proceedings result from an actual charge and are dependant
upon it for their validity.  A person facing the prospect of a new trial as a
result of the appellate process, whether the original verdict was an acquittal,
conviction or stay, can become subject to unfairness caused by delay.

 

                   In light of its
objects, s. 11(b) applies to delays after the entry of a stay or a
verdict.  A complex two‑principle scheme for assessing delay in the
criminal process is not necessary in a practical sense because the same general
principles can and should apply throughout, even though they may impact
differently depending on the particulars and the stage of the delay. 
Interlocutory, trial and appellate proceedings may be so intertwined that it
makes little sense to attempt to apply different legal rules according to the
stage of the process.

 

                   The principles
applicable under s. 11(b) are:  (1) the length of the delay; (2) waiver,
if any, of parts of the delay; (3) the reasons for the delay; and (4) prejudice
to the subject of the criminal process.  These principles are broad and
flexible enough to apply at the post‑stay, post‑verdict stage of
the criminal process.

 

                   The many different
circumstances which may prevail at the post‑verdict, post‑stay
stage require a flexible approach to remedies.  The Charter  empowers the
court to grant such remedies as may be just in all the circumstances.  Factors
such as the length and nature of the delay, the seriousness of the offence, the
nature of the injury suffered by the accused and any prejudice caused to the
accused's defence inherent in the delay should be considered in selecting a
remedy.

 

                   The choice of forum
for the remedy should be flexible.  The proceedings would be unnecessarily truncated
and complicated if only courts of first instance could deal with pre‑stay,
pre‑verdict delay and courts of second instance with appellate delay.

 

                   Per La Forest J.:  Section 11 (b)
of the Charter  does not apply to appellate delay.  Given the interrelationship
between ss. 7  and 11 (b), s. 7  may in certain contexts provide residual
protection to the interests that the s. 11 (b) right is designed to
protect that goes beyond the specific protection it provides.  Those interests
are also entitled to protection at the appellate level but subject to the
special considerations specific to the appellate process and in consequence the
choice of an appropriate remedy.  In particular, a stay should not be used as
often as the appropriate remedy for appellate delay as for trial delay.  The
views of McLachlin J. on these matters and on the appropriate court for
considering delay were generally shared.  However, her concerns about a
bifurcated system were not agreed with.  Weight may be given to pre‑appeal
delay at the appellate level and a consideration of appellate delay can figure
in the equation when complaints about delay are raised at trial following
appellate review.  Sections 7  and 11 (b) are not mutually exclusive.  The
Charter  is an organic instrument.

//McLachlin J.//

 

                   The reasons of
Lamer C.J. and McLachlin and Major were delivered by 

                   McLachlin
J. -- I have read the
reasons of my colleague, Justice Sopinka, and must respectfully dissent from
his views on how appellate delay is treated under the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . 

 

                   My colleague
concludes that the criminal process must be divided into distinct phases for
the purpose of assessing whether an accused person has been denied the right to
have criminal proceedings against him dispatched without undue delay.  The
first phase, if I understand his reasons, is the period between the laying of
charges and the entry of a verdict or stay of proceedings.  This is assessed
under s. 11 (b) of the Charter  which guarantees the right to be
tried within a reasonable time.  The next stage lies between the entry of a
verdict or stay, and the resolution of appeals from the verdict or stay.  Delay
in this stage is to be assessed under quite different principles -- s. 7   abuse
of process.  However, that is not the end of the story.  If the result of the
appeal is an order for a trial (in the case of a stay) or for a new trial (in
the case of a verdict), the

clock is wound back.  My colleague
does not specify precisely what he means by this.  One possibility is that the
entire analysis, including the period of appellate delay, would be assessed
under s. 11 (b).  The other possibility is that different segments of the
process leading to the ordered trial, would be analyzed under different
sections of the Charter :  s. 11 (b) up to the stay or verdict; s.
7  abuse of process from then to the order for a trial; and s. 11 (b) once
again after that order is made.  

 

                   My colleague
concedes that the objects and purposes of s. 11 (b) -- to protect the
right to security of the person, the right to liberty and the right to a fair
trial -- on their face apply to post-stay and post-verdict appellate delay.  He
argues, however, that the complicated scenario he proposes is necessitated by
the wording and textual context of s. 11 (b); by prior decisions of this
Court; and by the fact that the entry of a stay or verdict radically changes
the interests at stake.  In my view, none of these considerations withstands
close scrutiny.  Until the person charged is released from the prospect of
further trials and proceedings by a final resolution of the matter, s. 11 (b)
and the principles which have been enunciated under it are applicable.  To be
sure, the factors considered under s. 11 (b) may have different weight
depending on the circumstances, and different considerations may fall to be
considered where appellate proceedings are at issue.  Furthermore, the remedies
may vary, depending on the stage of the criminal process where one is.  But
these factors can and should, in my view, all be assessed under the single test
imposed by s. 11 (b) of the Charter .

 

                   The Wording and
Context

 

                   I turn first to the
wording and context of s. 11 (b).  My colleague argues that the phrases
""charged with an offence"" and ""to be tried"" suggest that s.
11 (b) applies only to the time of trial.  I respectfully disagree. 
""[C]harged with an offence"", should, in my view, be read as
indicating a person who is subject to the power of the criminal process.  Until
the person is finally released from the jeopardy of the criminal process by a
final resolution of the ""charges"" against him or her, the person
remains, for the purposes of s. 11 (b), a person charged with an
offence.  This position in consistent with the comments of Lamer J., as he then
was, in R. v. Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588, at pp. 610-11:

 

...
s. 11 (b) protects against an overlong subjection to a pending criminal
case and aims to relieve against the stress and anxiety which continue until
the outcome of the case is final. . . .  The computation [of the
delay] cannot end as of the moment the trial begins, but rather must continue
until the end of the saga, all of which must be within a reasonable time.

 

                   The narrower
reading of ""charge"" contended for by my colleague, Sopinka J.,
produces a scenario of waning and waxing charges.  My colleague argues that a
stay or verdict ends the charge.  But he is then forced to assert that a
subsequent order for a trial or new trial ""revives"" the charge, which
has presumably lain dormant even though it has supposedly disappeared.  At the
verdict after the trial, the charge once more wanes, only to be revived yet
again if an appeal court orders yet further trial proceedings.  The accused is
subject to one criminal process, throughout which his freedom is in jeopardy. 
Yet the law would tell him that he is charged only part of the time, depending
in which particular part of the process he is.  

 

                   The interpretation
my colleague suggests for the phrase ""to be tried"" is similarly
problematic.  My colleague asserts that a person's s. 11 (b) right to be
tried within a reasonable time expires with the entry of a stay.  Yet this may
occur before the person has ever had a trial.  If the stay is set aside on
appeal and the accused ordered to stand trial, he or she has no right to complain
in the face of egregious Crown delay occurring at the appellate stage  that his
or her right to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached, even
though he or she has never stood trial.  The case of an order for a new trial
after acquittal is similarly problematic.  The first trial is declared
invalid.  In effect, the accused has not had a proper trial.  A new trial is
ordered.  Notwithstanding that the accused has not enjoyed the right which the Charter 
expressly gives him or her -- the right to a proper trial within a reasonable
time --  he or she would be precluded by the interpretation my colleague
suggests of claiming an infringement of s. 11 (b) on the basis of
unreasonable appellate delay, and confined to the much narrower remedy of s. 7 
abuse of process.  This cannot, in my view, have been what the framers of the Charter 
 intended.  

 

                   Nor does the
textual context of s. 11(b) dictate the interpretation for which my
colleague contends.  It is true that many of the rights enumerated in s. 11 are
restricted to the early stages of the criminal process.  But others, such as s.
11(h) and 11(g), clearly apply after a verdict.  So it does not
follow, with respect, that ""[i]f ""[a]ny person charged"" in s.
11(b) necessarily includes the accused as a party to an appeal then the
same conclusion would have to apply to the other subsections of the
section,"" as my colleague concludes at p. 000. Since s. 11 is directed to
ensuring fairness at all stages of the criminal process, it cannot be concluded
that s. 11(b) must necessarily be confined to the pre-stay, pre-verdict
phase.

 

                   My colleague argues
that because s. 11(b) has been held not to apply to pre-charge delay (R.
v. Kalanj, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1594), it cannot be held to apply to appellate
delay.  He concludes, at p. 000, that ""s. 11(b) does not apply
unless the restriction of the interests which the subsection protects results
from an actual charge.""  With this I agree.  But I do not agree that this
leads to the conclusion that s. 11(b) does not apply to post-stay or
post-verdict appellate delay.  If ""[a]ny person charged"" is read as
synonymous to ""a person who is the subject of the criminal process"",
as I suggest, it follows that s. 11(b) would apply even after a
verdict.  The appeal proceedings clearly result from an actual charge; indeed,
they are dependant upon it for their validity.

 

                   The Interests At
Stake

 

                   My colleague,
Sopinka J., argues that consideration of the rights protected by s. 11(b)
leads to the conclusion that it does not apply to post-stay or post-verdict
appellate proceedings. 

 

                   The rights
protected by s. 11(b), as noted earlier are the right to security of the
person, the right to liberty, and the right to a fair trial:  R. v. Morin,
[1992] 1 S.C.R. 771.  My colleague considers first the case of an appeal from
an acquittal.  He concludes, at p. 000, that during this period ""[n]o
proceeding is on foot which seeks to charge the person acquitted"", and
states that the ""plight of the acquitted person is that of one against
whom governmental action is directed which may result in a charge.""  With
respect, this diminishes the seriousness of the position of the acquitted
person facing an appeal.  Before a charge is laid, the suspect does not,
generally speaking, suffer the stigma of criminal proceedings.  The same cannot
be said of an accused who is the subject of a post-acquittal appeal.  He or she
has in fact been charged.  The law continues to require him or her to defend
him- or herself against the charges.  He or she must hire lawyers and plead
before judges.  While he or she has been acquitted, the prosecution continues
to aver publicly that the acquittal is invalid.  And he or she faces the
distinct possibility of an order overturning the acquittal and entering a
conviction or directing a new trial, a prospect which is not a speculative
possibility but a real danger.  The anxiety which an accused who has been
acquitted faces while awaiting the possibility of a second trial must be
considerable.  In all these respects, the situation of an accused on an appeal
from an acquittal is much closer to the situation of an accused awaiting trial
than to a person who has not been charged.  I respectfully cannot agree with my
colleague's conclusion, at p. 000, that ""[i]t would be incongruous to
extend protection to the acquitted accused pending appeal and not to the
suspect awaiting a charge. . . .""

 

                   The situation of a
convicted person who appeals, while less sympathetic than that of the acquitted
person who faces an appeal, nevertheless engages the concerns to which s. 11(b)
is directed.  In the narrow vernacular of trial procedure, the charges against
the accused have been resolved.  But they have not disappeared.  The accused
may succeed in showing that the trial was unfair or invalid, and that the
apparent resolution of the charges by the conviction was void.  Finally, he or
she hopes, he or she will get the trial he or she was entitled to in the first
place.  It would be cold comfort to tell him or her that the intervening delay
in obtaining that trial does not fall under s. 11(b) and stands to be
remedied, if at all, under the more restrictive application of abuse of process
doctrine under s. 7 . 

 

                   The position of a
person facing an appeal from a stay of proceedings is no better.  My colleague
argues that a stay is indistinguishable from an acquittal.  If so, I would
respond that like a person acquitted, the person against whom proceedings are
stayed faces a jeopardy which engages s. 11(b).  But I doubt that a stay
and an acquittal can be so simply equated.  Dickson C.J., speaking for the
Court warned against such an assumption in R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
128, at p. 148:

 

                   We
are concerned here with a stay of proceedings because of an abuse of process by
the Crown.  While a stay of proceedings of this nature will have the same
result as an acquittal and will be such a final determination of the issue that
it will sustain a plea of autrefois acquit, its assimilation to an acquittal
should only be for purposes of enabling an appeal by the Crown.  Otherwise, the
two concepts are not equated.  The stay of proceedings for abuse of process is
given as a substitute for an acquittal because, while on the merits the accused
may not deserve an acquittal, the Crown by its abuse of process is disentitled
to a conviction.  No consideration of the merits -- that is whether the accused
is guilty independently of a consideration of the conduct of the Crown -- is
required to justify a stay.

 

                   In one salient
respect, the person facing an appeal from a stay is in greater jeopardy than a
person who has been acquitted or convicted.  He or she has never had any
trial.  No witnesses have been called, no evidence committed to public record. 
The risk of not being able to bring forward a valid defence when the trial is
finally held may be greater than where one trial, however unfair, has been
held.

 

                   In short, the
rights which s. 11(b) seeks to protect are all engaged in the period
between a verdict or a stay and the final disposition of the criminal charges. 
Security of the person and the right to liberty are engaged.  The acquitted
person, having been found not guilty, faces the prospect of conviction and
incarceration.  The person against whom a stay has been entered faces the same
possibility.  The convicted person, if the appeal succeeds and the conviction
is found to be invalid, can equally argue that the law's delay in arriving at
that conclusion has deprived him or her of his or her liberty and security of
the person during the appellate interval.  The right to a fair trial is engaged
as well.  In all three situations, the acquittal, conviction and stay, the
subject of the criminal proceedings faces the prospect of a new trial, whose
fairness may be jeopardized by excessive delay.

 

                   The narrow remedy
proposed by my colleague for post-stay, post-verdict delay would not, with
respect, provide a remedy capable of meeting these concerns.  He concludes that
s. 7  applies where the delay is so long that it constitutes abuse of process. 
The accused would be entitled to a remedy only where he or she could show that
a new trial would be so unfair as to amount to an abuse of the court's
process.  I have several problems with this conclusion.  

                   I note parenthetically
that this conclusion begs the question which Wilson J. left open in R. v.
Keyowski, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, at p. 661, of the relationship between s. 7 
and the doctrine of abuse of process.  Accepting, for purposes of argument,
however, Sopinka J.'s conclusion that only post-stay or post-verdict delay
which constitute abuse of process can be remedied under s. 7 , it presents the
following difficulties.

 

                   The abuse of
process doctrine is a narrow doctrine which has only on rare occasions provided
a remedy to accused persons caught overlong in the meshes of the criminal
process.  Its primary aim is not the rights of the accused person, but the
repute of the system of justice.  As Lamer J., as he then was, put it in R.
v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 942, in treating entrapment as abuse of
process:

 

The
issuance of the stay obviously benefits the accused but the Court is primarily
concerned with a larger issue:  the maintenance of public confidence in the
legal and judicial process.  In this way, the benefit to the accused is really
a derivative one.  

 

Moreover, it has repeatedly been held
that the doctrine of abuse of process should be applied only in the clearest of
cases:  R. v. Keyowski, supra, at pp. 659-60.  This has been
taken to impose a higher standard of proof than would face an accused relying
on a breach of rights under the Charter :  see Bayda C.J. in R. v.
Keyowski (1986), 49 Sask. R. 64  (C.A.).  Without definitively ruling on
that question, the fact remains that abuse of process has seldom, in its long
history, served as a remedy for delay in the criminal process.  It has been
stringently and sparingly applied.  As one author puts it:  ""while abuse
of process has frequently been argued and its availability increasingly
acknowledged, a remedy for the accused has not readily been forthcoming"": 
Morgan, ""Controlling Prosecutorial Powers -- Judicial Review, Abuse of
Process and Section 7  of the Charter "" (1986), 29 Crim. Law Q. 15,
at p. 38.  To hold that the only remedy for delay in the criminal process after
the entry of a stay or acquittal is abuse of process would be to create an
anomaly in the law.  The rights engaged and the jeopardy experienced are
similar before and after the stay or verdict.  Yet before the stay or verdict
one has a full and easily accessed remedy; after, one has only a narrow and
circumscribed hope.

 

                   Acceptance of my
colleague's conclusion that s. 11 (b) of the Charter  does not
apply to post-stay or post-verdict delay leaves two possible options for
remedying such delay under the Charter .  The first is that post-stay and
post-verdict delay are held to be remediable under common law doctrine of abuse
of process under s. 7 .  This is the route chosen by Sopinka J.  It is, I have
respectfully suggested, too narrow to provide an adequate or just remedy for
many of the circumstances which may result from post-stay, post-verdict delay. 
The alternative might be to seek a distinct and broader remedy for such delay
under s. 7  of the Charter .  But such an approach should be undertaken
only if the Charter  provision expressly aimed at delay in the criminal
process is inapplicable or inappropriate; the law should not be complicated
unnecessarily.  I have argued thus far that s. 11 (b) by its wording and
objects is not inapplicable to post-stay, post-verdict delay.  I turn now to
the appropriateness from a practical point of view of treating such a delay
under s. 11 (b) of the Charter .

 

Applying
Section 11(b) to Post-Stay, Post-Verdict Appellate Delay

 

                   I have concluded
that not only does the language and context of s. 11(b) not mandate that
it be confined to the pre-stay, pre-verdict period of the criminal process, but
also the objects and goals underlying s. 11(b) suggest that it does
apply to delays after the entry of a stay or a verdict.  In this section, I
argue that there is no need from a practical point of view to adopt a complex
two-principle scheme for assessing delay in the criminal process; the same
general principles can and should apply throughout, even though they may impact
differently depending on the particular considerations which arise at different
stages.  The reality of the judicial process is that interlocutory, trial and
appellate proceedings may be so intertwined in a given case that it makes
little sense to attempt to apply different legal rules according to the stage
one is at.

 

                   The principles
applicable under s. 11(b) have been enunciated in R. v. Morin, supra.
  They are: (1) the length of the delay; (2) waiver, if any, of parts of
the delay; (3) the reasons for the delay; and (4) prejudice to the subject of
the criminal process.  In my view, these principles are broad and flexible
enough to apply at the post-stay, post-verdict stage of the criminal process.

 

                   The length of the
delay must always be taken into account in determining its reasonableness,
whether it be trial delay or appellate delay.  It may be less easy to set a
""normal"" yardstick in appellate delay, given the need for
deliberation and discussion between members of the panel.  But as for delay
before verdict or stay, some delays will clearly be within a normal time
period, some will clearly be egregious, barring explanations, and some, the
most difficult to assess, will lie between the two extremes.

 

                   Waiver applies
equally to delay before a stay and verdict and delay after a stay and verdict.

 

                   The reasons for the
delay may be similar before and after a stay or a verdict.  Overloaded judicial
systems, poor organization, negligence, foot-dragging by the accused -- these
and more may play a role at all stages of the judicial process.  But the
reasons for appellate delay include some which do not figure, or do not figure
as importantly, at lower levels.  In addition to reaching the just result in
the case before it, an appellate court has a duty to settle and articulate
principles of law which transcend the needs of the particular case.  This may
require more preparation, more research, more elaborate reasons and more
discussion and debate among members of the appellate tribunal, and as a
consequence, more time.  The fact that a number of people with different views
may be involved in the decision may add to the length of time required to
settle the appeal finally.  In some cases, counsel may need more time to
prepare for a case given the complexity of the issues involved.  For example,
interveners are often involved at the appellate stage.  The proper development
of the law is an important goal which must be pursued, even at the expense of
some additional delay in the case.  This must be taken into account in
considering the reasons for the delay.

 

                   The final factor
set out in Morin, prejudice to the accused, is relevant both before, and
after, a stay or a verdict has been ordered. What is protected at all stages is
the accused's right to a fair and timely criminal process.  As seen above,
stigma, anxiety and restrictions on liberty may adversely affect the subject of
the proceedings after a stay or verdict, just as before.  Similarly, the
subject's opportunity to present a full defence at a post-appeal trial may be
adversely affected by post-verdict or post-stay delay.  The impact of these
adverse effects on the accused must be put in the balance in determining
whether the delay complained of was reasonable.

 

                   This brings me to
the matter of remedy.  This Court has held in cases of pre-verdict,
non-appellate delay, that a stay of proceedings is the minimum and generally
appropriate remedy:  R. v. Rahey, supra, at p. 614.  However,
where a verdict has been entered, a stay may not be appropriate.  For example,
a stay of proceedings would be useless to a convicted person complaining of appellate
delay; indeed, it would deny him or her a just remedy by preventing him or her
from proceeding with his or her appeal.  The nearest alternative to a stay of
proceedings, quashing the conviction, might seem inappropriate given that one
would be releasing, not a person presumed to be innocent as at the pre-trial
stage, but a convicted felon who has not served his or her sentence.  To
release a convicted killer into society, for example,  without having served
his or her sentence, solely because the appeal he or she chose to bring took
more time than reasonable, would be to grant a remedy which far outstrips the
wrong and which overlooks the important societal interest in the safety and
security of members of the public.  Confronted with these alternatives, a judge
finding unreasonable delay in such a case might wish instead to make a
different order.  He or she might order that the appeal be expedited, for
example.  Nor would I rule out other remedies such as damages to compensate for
loss of liberty or mental suffering, although I would leave the question of
what remedies may be appropriate for resolution on a case-by-case basis.

 

                   The many different
circumstances which may prevail at the post-verdict, post-stay stage require a
flexible approach to remedies.  In some cases stays of proceedings may be
appropriate.  In other cases, other remedies will necessarily arise for
consideration.  The Charter  empowers the court to grant such remedies as
may be just in all the circumstances.  In selecting a remedy, the judge should
bear in mind such factors as the length and nature of the delay, the
seriousness of the offence, the nature of the injury suffered by the accused
and any prejudice caused to the accused's defence by the delay: see La Forest
J. in R.v. Rahey, supra, at p. 648.

 

                   I would be flexible
as to the forum for the remedy.  If it appears to the Court of Appeal that the
accused's rights have been violated by excessive pre-verdict and appellate
delay, for example, that court should be able to deal with both types of delay
without sending the new issue of appellate delay back to a judge of first
instance.  On the other hand, the subject of a criminal process should not be
prevented from applying to a judge of first instance with respect of any delay,
including appellate delay.  The practical reality, as noted earlier, is that
pre-stay, pre-verdict delay and appellate delay are often intertwined and
impact upon each other.  To say that only courts of first instance can deal
with the former and only courts of second instance can deal with the latter
would be to unnecessarily truncate and complicate the proceedings.

 

Application
to this Case

 

                   Applying s. 11(b)
to this case, I conclude with my colleague Sopinka J. that unreasonable delay
has not been established.  As to the pre-stay delay, while the time period was
long, much of it can be explained by a series of interlocutory proceedings
which were necessary given the complexity of the case.  There were thus good
reasons for much of the delay. Waiver is not a factor.  As for prejudice, I
agree with the Court of Appeal below that the prejudice that may be inferred
was minimal. 

 

                   Nor, in my view,
was the post-stay appellate delay unreasonable in this case.  The greatest
delay in this period was a gap between June 21, 1991, when the appeal book was
served and January 15, 1992, when the respondent scheduled the hearing. 
Thereafter the appeal proceeded with reasonable dispatch, given certain
problems with the unavailability of appellant's counsel for the first hearing
date.  However, there is no suggestion that the appellant was prejudiced by any
of this delay, or that he wanted things to move faster.  Presumably, he was
content to let the stay stand as long as possible.  In these circumstances,
unreasonable delay in the post-stay period is not made out.  I note that the
Court of Appeal ordered an accelerated trial, aimed at avoiding any further
delay.

 

                   I would dismiss the
appeal. 

 

//La Forest J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   La
Forest J. -- I agree with
Justice Sopinka that s. 11 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  does not apply to appellate delay.  I find support for this in the
French version of the Charter  and in the European Court of Human Rights
judgment in the Wemhoff case, judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A No. 7,
cited by my colleague; see my reasons in R. v. Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
588, at pp. 632-33.  However, I am of the view, given the interrelationship
between ss. 7  and 11 (b), that s. 7  may in certain contexts provide residual
protection to the interests the right under s. 11 (b) is designed to
protect that goes beyond the specific protection it provides; see Thomson
Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive
Trade Practices Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425.  Accordingly, those
interests are also entitled to protection at the appellate level but subject to
the special considerations specific to the appellate process and in consequence
the choice of an appropriate remedy.  In particular, a stay should not as often
be used as the appropriate remedy for appellate delay as for trial delay.  On
these matters, it will be obvious that I generally share the views of Justice
McLachlin.  I also agree with her regarding the appropriate court for considering
delay.

 

                   I should say,
however, that I do not share her concerns about a bifurcated system.  In
considering delay at the appellate level, I do not see why weight should not be
given to pre-appeal delay, or why a consideration of appellate delay could not
figure in the equation when complaints about delay are raised at trial
following appellate review.  Sections 7  and 11 (b) are not mutually
exclusive.  The Charter  is an organic instrument.

 

                   I agree that there
was no unreasonable delay in this case and I would accordingly dismiss the
appeal.

 

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

                   The judgment of
L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci was delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. -- This appeal
concerns the application of the constitutional guarantee to be tried within a
reasonable time contained in s. 11 (b) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .  The important question of law to be resolved is
whether s. 11 (b) applies to appellate proceedings.

 

Facts

 

                   The appellant was
charged with criminal negligence causing death in an information sworn on
September 15, 1988.  He was released from custody on an undertaking, and on
consent, the matter was adjourned to October 25, 1988.  At that time, counsel
for the appellant (not Mr. Greenspan who was counsel before this Court and at
the Court of Appeal) advised the Provincial Court judge that the investigation
was ongoing and that a disclosure brief was not available.  At the suggestion
of Crown counsel, the matter was adjourned to November 8, 1988.   On November
8, an agent for counsel for the appellant requested an adjournment to permit
defence counsel to arrange a pre‑trial, and the matter was accordingly
adjourned to December 6, 1988.

 

                   On December 6,
1988, the charge was further adjourned to January 31, 1989 for a pre‑trial. 
Counsel for the appellant estimated that the preliminary hearing would require
five days and that it was likely that a great deal of scientific evidence would
be called at that time.  Crown counsel requested that the pre‑trial judge
be permitted to read the Crown brief prior to the pre‑trial.  The court
approved this request as consistent with the ""usual practice.""  Trial
counsel for the appellant consented to the request but advised the court that
all of the Crown's scientific reports were not yet available and that this
evidence was crucial to the resolution of the case.  He also indicated that the
pre‑trial judge would likely require two days to read the Crown brief. 
Both counsel agreed to January 31, 1989 as a date for the pre‑trial
conference.

 

                   The pre‑trial
conference was held on January 31, 1989.  It was conducted in the pre‑trial
judge's chambers and no transcript is available.  However, court resumed once
the pre‑trial had been completed, and counsel for the Crown and defence
spoke to the provincial judge about setting a date for trial or for a
preliminary hearing.  The judge indicated that five days would be required for
a preliminary and suggested September or October 1989, subject to counsel's
availability.  Because the appellant was not present in court on this date, the
matter was adjourned to February 7, 1989 to set the trial date.

 

                   On February 7, 1989
counsel for the appellant advised the court that he would be calling eight or
nine witnesses, in addition to the seven witnesses to be called by the Crown
and that he was prepared to set a date for the first week of October, 1989. 
October 2, 1989 through October 6, 1989 were set for the trial or preliminary
hearing.  Counsel for the appellant declined to elect a trial or preliminary
hearing for that date because he did not have all the material, which suggests
that some, but not full, disclosure had been made.  On February 14, 1989, the
appellant appeared in court and the week of October 2 to 6 was confirmed.

 

                   On October 2, 1989
the appellant elected to be tried by a court composed of judge and jury and the
preliminary hearing commenced.  On October 5, 1989, the appellant was committed
for trial and re‑elected to be tried by judge alone.

 

                   The indictment was
signed on October 20, 1989.  On November 7, 1989, the appellant first appeared
in the District Court assignment court.  At that time the transcript of the
preliminary hearing had not been completed.  It was completed on November 14, 1989. 
On November 7, both counsel agreed that a pre‑trial would be worthwhile,
and the court suggested December 13, 1989 as a date for the pre‑trial. 
However, counsel for the appellant was not available on that date, and
therefore January 17, 1990 was selected.

 

                   On January 17,
1990, Crown counsel was unable to attend the pre‑trial conference due to
a conflicting commitment, and the pre‑trial was adjourned.  The date of
February 6, 1990 was chosen as the date upon which a new pre‑trial date
would be set.  On that date, May 2, 1990 was chosen as a date for the pre‑trial. 
There is no transcript or other evidence to explain why May 2 was selected. 
Further, while a secretary at the firm representing the appellant, Kelly Annet,
stated in her affidavit that she had been informed that Crown counsel advised
the court that he wished to have a pre‑trial conference, the affidavit of
the Crown indicates that Crown counsel does not recall whether he wished to
have a pre‑trial conference.

 

                   The pre‑trial
conference was held on May 2, 1990.  The issues were discussed and the matter
was adjourned to June 5, 1990 to set a date for trial.

 

                   At assignment court
on June 5, 1990, defence counsel indicated to the court that the trial would
likely last ten days and that an out‑of‑town judge was required. 
According to counsel for the appellant, an out‑of‑town judge was
necessary because all the judges in the jurisdiction knew the family of the
deceased.  It is agreed that, in the circumstances, this request was
reasonable.  The trial co‑ordinator made it clear that the trial date
would be set and that a judge from outside Sudbury would then be found to
preside at the trial.  The date of December 3, 1990 was suggested as an
appropriate date, but defence counsel expressed a preference for a January 1991
date as he had other commitments in December.  At defence counsel's suggestion,
the matter was adjourned to July 3, 1990 in order for counsel to make
appropriate arrangements about a date. 

 

                   During June, 1990,
counsel for the appellant and respondent met with Loukidelis J. in chambers and
agreed to the dates of December 3 to 10 for the trial.  The affidavit of Greg
Rodgers, Assistant Crown Attorney, states that ""[i]f the matter was
shorter and could be heard by a local Judge a trial date could have been
obtained within 3 months"".  On July 3, 1990, it was decided that the trial
would proceed on December 3, 1990.

 

                   On December 3,
1990, the appellant applied for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1)  of the Charter ,
arguing that his right to be tried within a reasonable time had been
infringed.  In the alternative, he sought an order excluding the evidence of a
certain witness on the grounds of late disclosure.  On December 4, 1990, the
trial judge stayed the proceedings on the grounds that the right to trial
within a reasonable time in s. 11 (b) of the Charter  had been
infringed.

 

                   As the respondent
noted in its factum, no motion to adduce fresh evidence regarding appellate
delay was made at the Court of Appeal or before this Court, and no affidavit
evidence regarding this period has been adduced.  There is accordingly no
evidence before this Court regarding delay during the appellate period, but for
the purposes of setting out the time frame, the following dates from the factum
of the appellant are accepted as fact.  On December 24, 1990, the Attorney
General appealed against the stay of proceedings.   The transcript of the
argument and the judgment were served on counsel for the appellant on February
13, 1991, and on June 21, 1991, the appeal book was served.  On January 15,
1992, the respondent scheduled the hearing, suggesting that the appeal proceed
on March 13, 1992.  Due to the unavailability of counsel for the appellant on
that date, counsel for the respondent proposed various dates commencing April
6, 1992, at which point April 24, 1992 was set as the earliest available date. 
The appeal was heard in the Court of Appeal for Ontario on April 24 during
which the issue of appellate delay was raised.  On June 22, 1992, the Court of
Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the stay and remitted the matter for trial
on an expedited basis.  On July 30, 1992, the appellant filed his Notice of
Appeal in this Court.

 

Judgments Below

 

Ontario Court of Justice -‑
General Division, Stortini
J.

 

                   Stortini J. held
that the appellant's s. 11 (b) rights had been violated.  He noted that
the total delay in this case was two years and two and a half months from the
first appearance to trial, and that four months passed from the accused's arrest
to the holding of the pre‑trial conference.  This latter delay was mostly
due to the then‑existing system which sought to accommodate counsel in
arranging for pre‑trial conferences and could not be attributed solely to
the prosecutor or to systemic or institutional delay.   He considered the
argument that the delay was reasonable given the complexities of the case in
terms of scientific evidence, the number of witnesses, the length of the
preliminary hearing and trial, and the fact that an out‑of‑town judge
was required.  Noting that complex cases would justify longer delays than would
simple cases, he stated, nonetheless, that lack of institutional resources
should not constitute an acceptable excuse for unreasonable delays.   He
concluded that the delay was unreasonable as it was too long and that the
explanations for the delay were either non‑existent or insufficient to
justify the delay.

 

Ontario Court of Appeal (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 111 (Morden
A.C.J.O and Osborne and Weiler JJ.A.) 

 

                   Osborne J.A.,
writing for the court, held that the appeal should be allowed.  After
identifying waiver as a critical issue in the case, Osborne J.A. focused on two
periods:  the seven and one‑half month period preceding the preliminary
hearing, which began on October 2, 1989 and the six‑month period
preceding the trial which began on December 3, 1990.  The court concluded that
""waver in the entire period from January 31, 1989 to October 2, 1989, has
not been established.""  The court did find that the respondent waived his
right to complain of one month of the delay between December 13, 1989 and
January 17, 1990 because he expressed a preference for January 17, 1990 rather
than the scheduled date of December 13, 1989.  The court did not find, however,
that the respondent waived his right to complain of the six‑month delay
between June 1990 and December 1990, although counsel for the appellant did
agree to the December trial date.  Although there was no evidence before the
court with respect to alternative trial dates, Osborne J.A. concluded that the
December 3 date was likely the first date available for a ten‑day trial.

 

                   With respect to the
reasons for the delay, the Court of Appeal concluded that the four‑month
period from the appellant's arrest to the pre‑trial conference was
attributable to delay inherent in the nature of the case, including some intake
delay.  Some two months of delay between committal and the first date for the
pre‑trial was also held to be inherent delay.  Osborne J.A. was of the
view that neither the Crown nor the accused could be said to be responsible for
much of the delay, except that it was Crown counsel's scheduling problems which
required the pre‑trial to be adjourned from January 17, 1990 to May 2,
1990.  The two periods from February 7, 1989 (when the preliminary hearing date
was set) to October 2, 1989 (when the preliminary hearing commenced) and from
June 5, 1990 (when the trial date was set) to December 3, 1990 (when the trial
was to begin) were held to be systemic delay, although it was noted that the
lengthy court times necessary justified a longer delay than would be acceptable
in a simpler case.

 

                   With respect to the
issue of prejudice, Osborne J.A. agreed with the trial judge that the
respondent suffered no actual or special prejudice as a result of the delay
from the time the information was sworn in September, 1988 to the time his
trial commenced in December, 1990.

 

                   To determine
whether the delay was unreasonable, the Court of Appeal weighed the explanation
for the delay and prejudice to the accused to determine whether the appellant's
constitutional right to be tried within a reasonable time had been breached. 
Osborne J.A. noted that this Court had held in R. v. Morin, [1992] 1
S.C.R. 771, that, although prejudice is only one factor to be taken into
account in the balancing process, a conclusion that prejudice was absent or
that it was minimal is significant.  The rationale for the pre‑eminent
position given to prejudice was held to be consistent for the purposes of s. 11 (b)
-- to protect the rights of the accused and the dual societal interest in
seeing an accused treated humanely and fairly and in seeing those accused of
crimes be brought to trial.

 

                   Weighing all the
factors, Osborne J.A. found that the delay was not unreasonable.  He concluded
that the prejudice that may be inferred was minimal, and that there was nothing
on the record to suggest that the respondent ever sought an earlier date for the
pre‑trials, the preliminary hearing or the trial.  While noting that
""there may be a fine line between acceptance of the inevitability of the
pace of proceedings and contentment with the speed of the process"",
Osborne J.A. held that the guidelines set out in Morin do not establish
a limitation period and that a balancing of all aspects of the delay in this
case led to the conclusion that the delay was not unreasonable.

 

                   Osborne J.A.
therefore ordered that the appeal should be allowed, the stay set aside and
remitted the matter for trial, on an expedited basis.

 

The Issues

 

                   There are two
issues:  (1) was the delay preceding the end of the trial unreasonable so as to
offend the provisions of s. 11 (b) of the Charter ; and (2) does s.
11 (b) apply to the delay in respect of the appellate proceedings?

 

Pre‑trial Delay

 

                   The facts relating
to this issue were reviewed in detail in relation to the principles expressed
by this Court in R. v. Morin, supra, by Osborne J.A. in the Court
of Appeal.  Bearing in mind the approach to review of appellate judgments in
respect of the application of s. 11 (b) adopted by this Court in R. v.
Stensrud, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1115, I would adopt the conclusions and reasons
of Osborne J.A. and dismiss this ground of appeal.

 

Appellate Delay

 

                   This issue was
raised in the Court of Appeal but was not dealt with.  I have concluded that s.
11 (b) does not apply to delay in respect of an appeal from conviction by
the accused nor an appeal from an acquittal by the Crown.  Moreover, in my
opinion, there is no distinction in this regard between an acquittal after
trial and a judicial stay.

 

                   Section 11  of the Charter 
is to be interpreted in a manner that harmonizes as much as possible all of its
subsections.  In R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 353, La Forest
J., for the majority, stated:

 

As I
observed in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, the phrase ""Any
person charged with an offence"" in the opening words of the section must
be given a constant meaning that harmonizes with the various paragraphs of the
section.  It seems clear to me that for the purposes of s. 11  it would be quite
inappropriate to conclude that a convicted person is charged with an offence
when confronted with a Part XXI application.  How can it be said that the right
to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty (s. 11 (d))
and the right to bail (s. 11 (e)), for example, could have any
application in the context of the unique post‑conviction proceeding
mandated by Part XXI?  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   Many of the rights
found in s. 11  cannot apply to appeals and are restricted to the pre‑trial
or trial process.  If ""[a]ny person charged"" in s. 11 (b)
necessarily includes the accused as a party to an appeal then the same
conclusion would have to apply to the other subsections of the section.  An
examination of the various subsections shows s. 11 (a), (c), (f)
and (i) clearly do not apply to appeals.  Section 11 (e) could not
apply to an appellant who has been acquitted and other subsections are
primarily concerned with what occurs at trial although exceptionally they might
have some application on appeal.

 

                   I conclude from the
foregoing that as a general rule ""[a]ny person charged"" under s. 11 
does not include an accused person who is party to an appeal.  A particular
subsection may apply to appeal proceedings as an exception to the general rule
if its purpose and language support this conclusion.  After considering the
purpose and language of s. 11 (b), I have concluded that the
interpretation that gives effect to both of these elements and best harmonizes
the other subsections is that the subsection applies to the pre‑trial
period and the trial process but not to appellate proceedings.  While I am
uncomfortably aware that I expressed a different view in my dissenting reasons
in R. v. Conway, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, I have come to this conclusion in
light of the considerable additional judicial experience of this Court in the
application of s. 11 (b) since the judgment in Conway.  In
particular, I refer to the judgment in R. v. Kalanj, [1989] 1 S.C.R.
1594, and cases that followed it as to the purpose of s. 11 (b).

 

                   The general objects
and purposes of s. 11 (b) were recently re‑stated in R. v. Morin,
supra, as follows at p. 786:

 

                   The
individual rights which the section seeks to protect are:  (1) the right to
security of the person, (2) the right to liberty, and (3) the right to a fair
trial.

 

                   The
right to security of the person is protected in s. 11 (b) by seeking to
minimize the anxiety, concern and stigma of exposure to criminal proceedings. 
The right to liberty is protected by seeking to minimize exposure to the
restrictions on liberty which result from pre‑trial incarceration and
restrictive bail conditions.  The right to a fair trial is protected by
attempting to ensure that proceedings take place while evidence is available
and fresh.

 

                   If these purposes
and objects were embodied in s. 11 (b) without restriction, it would be
difficult to argue that the section had no application to appeals.  The section
has, however, been interpreted in a manner that does not extend its protection
of these interests against the consequences of delay at large, but only from
the consequences of delay flowing from a formal charge.  Short of a formal
charge, similar consequences proceeding from other aspects of governmental
activity in the criminal process do not trigger the protection of the
provision.  Accordingly, in Kalanj, supra, this Court dealt with
a situation in which the accused were arrested after a lengthy investigation. 
On the day of the arrest the accused were fingerprinted and released but were
advised not to leave town, that they would be charged and that a summons would
issue.  More than eight months later charges were laid.  This Court was invited
to hold that, because of the involvement of the interests that underlie s. 11 (b),
it should extend to the pre‑charge delay.  The invasion of the interests
protected by s. 11  in the broad sense could certainly be equated to the
consequences of a charge.  The stigma and anxiety resulting from arrest and
fingerprinting would exceed the consequences flowing from laying of a charge
followed by a summons.  The restraint on liberty was the equivalent to that
which occurs when a charge is laid and the accused is released on bail.  The
pre‑trial delay has the same effect on the freshness of the evidence as
post‑charge delay.  Nonetheless, this Court held that the accused were
not persons charged until a formal charge was laid and that s. 11 (b) did
not apply.  This judgment has been applied to rule out review of pre‑charge
delay unless the accused can establish a breach under s. 7 .  See R. v. L.
(W.K.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 1091.

 

                   It follows from Kalanj
that s. 11 (b) does not apply unless the restriction of the interests
which the subsection protects results from an actual charge.  Circumstances
which produce the same consequences do not qualify for the protection of this
provision unless those consequences proceed from a formal charge.  The question
which is in issue in this appeal is whether the consequences of delay resulting
from an appeal from acquittal or conviction are distinguishable from pre‑charge
delay and can be attributed to the existence of a formal charge.

 

                   Clearly, during the
period after an acquittal and the service of a notice of appeal, the person
acquitted is not a person charged.  No proceeding is on foot which seeks to
charge the person acquitted.  Upon the appeal's being filed there is a possibility,
the strength of which will vary with each case, that the acquittal will be set
aside and the charge will be revived.  The plight of the acquitted person is
that of one against whom governmental action is directed which may result in a
charge.  In this respect the former accused is like the suspect against whom an
investigation has been completed and charges are contemplated awaiting a
decision by the prosecutor.  Indeed the acquitted accused is somewhat more
removed from the prospect of being subject to a charge than the suspect.  In
the former case, no charge can be revived until the acquittal is set aside by
reason of an error of law that a court determines with a reasonable degree of
certainty affected the decision at trial.  In the latter case, all that stands
between the suspect and a charge is the ex parte decision of the
prosecutor.  It would be incongruous to extend protection to the acquitted
accused pending appeal and not to the suspect awaiting a charge who knows he or
she is awaiting the decision of the prosecutor.

 

                   There is even less
reason to extend the protection of s. 11 (b) to a convicted person who
appeals.  The appeal itself is not governmental action.  In R. v. CIP Inc.,
[1992] 1 S.C.R. 843, Stevenson J. stated for the Court, at pp. 864‑65:

 

                   We
are reviewing the decision that was made on November 1, 1988.  The delay after
that motion was granted is appellate delay.  The bulk of that delay is
attributable to the appellant's decision to pursue appeals.  The appellant
invoked the processes of which it now complains and must accept the burdens
inherent in full appellate review.  There is no evidence or argument to support
a finding that some extraordinary factor lengthened that review process.  

 

The delay due to some extraordinary
factor referred to by Stevenson J. would not be attributed to the fact that the
accused was a person charged but rather to the conviction.  A convicted person
is not a person charged.  See Lyons, supra, at p. 353.  The
effect of such an extraordinary factor would fall to be assessed under s. 7  in
light of its impact on the fairness of the proceedings.

 

                   This discussion has
focused on the interpretation of the words ""[a]ny person charged"" in
s. 11 (b) in the context of  the purpose of the subsection.  The
conclusion that those words limit the operation of the subsection to the trial
process is supported by the use of the word ""tried"".  It would seem
that if it was intended that the subsection apply not only to the trial but
also to final adjudication, more apt wording would have been employed.  This is
illustrated by the decision of the European Court of Human Rights, Wemhoff
case, judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A No. 7.  The court dealt with two
sections of the Convention:  s. 5(3) and s. 6(1).  The former provided that
""[e]veryone ... shall be entitled to a trial within a reasonable
time. . ."" while the latter provided that ""In the
determination . . . of any criminal charge against him, everyone is
entitled to a fair and public hearing . . ."".  The court
held that the former section extended only to the trial while the latter
extended to the final determination even if this was on appeal.  No doubt this
language was before the framers of the Charter , and the selection of the
more limiting term is significant.

 

                   This does not mean
that when there is an adjudication relating to a charge which is appealed, s.
11 (b) is spent.  If on the appeal the judgment is set aside and the
matter is remitted for trial, the accused reverts to the status of a person
charged.  As stated by D.H. Doherty (now a justice of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario) in ""More Flesh on the Bones: The Continued Judicial
Interpretation of s. 11 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms "" (1984), Canadian Bar Association ‑ Ontario; Annual Institute
on Continuing Legal Education, at p. 9:

 

Section
11 (b) does not appear to operate at the appellate stage.  Section 11 (b)
guarantees a trial within a reasonable time, not a final determination of the
matter at an appellate level within that time.  If, however, a new trial is
ordered on appeal, or some other order is made directing the continuation of
the trial proceedings, the constitutional clock should be rewound at the time
of the order by the appellate court.  

 

                   A similar
conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court of the United States.  In United
States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U.S. 302 (1986), it was argued that the speedy
trial guarantee in the 6th Amendment applied to an appeal by the government
from a dismissal of charges prior to a trial on the merits by reason of
excessive delay in prosecuting the charges.  The court stated, at pp. 311-12:

 

                   During
much of the litigation, respondents were neither under indictment nor subject
to bail.  Further judicial proceedings would have been necessary to subject respondents
to any actual restraints . . . .  As we stated in MacDonald: 
""(W)ith no charges outstanding, personal liberty is certainly not impaired
to the same degree as it is after arrest while charges are pending.  After the
charges against him have been dismissed, `a citizen suffers no restraints on
his liberty and is (no longer) the subject of public accusation:  his situation
does not compare with that of a defendant who has been arrested and held to
answer'."" . . .

 

                   Respondents
argue that the speedy trial guarantee should apply to this period because the
Government's desire to prosecute them was a matter of public record.  Public
suspicion, however, is not sufficient to justify the delay in favour of a
defendant's speedy trial claim.  We find that after the District Court
dismissed the indictment against respondents and after respondents were freed
without restraint, they were ""in the same position as any other subject of
a criminal investigation"" . . . .  The Speedy Trial
Clause does not purport to protect a defendant from all effects flowing from a
delay before trial.  The Clause does not, for example, limit the length of
a preindictment criminal investigation even though ""the (suspect's)
knowledge of an ongoing criminal investigation will cause stress, discomfort,
and perhaps a certain disruption in normal life.""  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   The American courts
do not appear to resort to judicial stays but rather dismiss the charges with
or without prejudice.  The former is the equivalent to a judicial stay and the
charges cannot be relaid unless the order dismissing charges is overturned on
appeal.  The latter allows the charges to be relaid without further judicial
action.  While the speedy trial provisions of the 6th Amendment apply to
appeals from interlocutory orders which do not dismiss the charges, the remedy
for appellate delay when charges are dismissed with prejudice lies in the due
process guarantee in the 14th Amendment.  See:  Simmons v. Reynolds, 898
F.2d 865 (2nd Cir. 1990), at p. 868; United States v. Antoine, 906 F.2d
1379 (9th Cir. 1990), at p. 1382; United States v. Kimmons, 917 F.2d
1011 (7th Cir. 1990), at pp. 1013-15; Burkett v. Cunningham, 826 F.2d
1208 (3rd Cir. 1987), at p. 1221; DeLancy v. Caldwell, 741 F.2d 1246
(10th Cir. 1984), at p. 1248; United States v. Johnson, 732 F.2d 379
(4th Cir. 1984), at pp. 381‑83; United States v. Pratt, 645 F.2d
89 (1st Cir. 1981); Rheuark v. Shaw, 628 F.2d 297 (5th Cir. 1980), at
pp. 300‑4 certiorari denied 450 U.S. 931 (1981); Roque v.
Puerto Rico, 558 F.2d 606 (1st Cir. 1976); People v. Cousart, 444
N.E.2d 971 (N.Y. 1982).

 

                   The conclusion I
have reached applies to appeals from acquittals and convictions.  Furthermore,
I see no valid reason to distinguish between an acquittal on the merits and a
judicial stay.  In light of the interest protected under s. 11 (b), the
differences between an acquittal and a judicial stay are purely technical.  In
both cases the accused can plead autrefois acquit and no proceedings may
be brought in respect of the same charge unless the acquittal or stay is set
aside on appeal.  No restraints can be placed on the liberty of the former
accused pending appeal.  There is no basis on which to assume that the
theoretical existence of a charge that has been stayed carries any greater
stigma or causes greater anxiety to the respondent in an appeal from a judicial
stay than an appeal from acquittal.  Certainly there is no evidence on this
point.  I doubt that the public understands the difference.  An unpopular
acquittal generates as much public indignation as a stay.  The degree of
anxiety is dictated more by the strength of the grounds of appeal than by the
form of the verdict.  These observations were neatly summed up by Estey J. in Amato
v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 418, at p. 457:

 

While
the charge may be said to hang over the head of the accused, this is a wholly
theoretical observation because there is no forum for its further processing.

 

The Application of Section 7 

 

                   This conclusion
does not leave the criminal appellant or respondent without a remedy when delay
of appeal proceedings affects the fairness of the trial.  While s. 11(b)
does not apply, s. 7  may in appropriate circumstances afford a remedy.  In R.
v. L. (W.K.), supra, this Court held that, in respect of pre‑charge
delay, if the particular circumstances of the case indicated that the fairness
of the trial had been affected by the delay, s. 7  can be resorted to.  This is
simply the application to delay of the court's power to remedy an abuse of
process which is enshrined in s. 7  as a principle of fundamental justice.  The
general principle was expressed in R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, at
pp. 136‑37.  Dickson C.J. adopted the following passage from the judgment
of Dubin J.A. (as he then was) in R. v. Young (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289,
at p. 329:

 

...
there is a residual discretion in a trial court judge to stay proceedings where
compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles
of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency and to
prevent the abuse of a court's process through oppressive or vexatious
proceedings.

 

This test has been reaffirmed in R.
v. Keyowski, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657.

 

                   In addition to s.
7, the criminal appeal rules and provisions of the Criminal Code  afford
a litigant in a criminal appeal a range of remedies at virtually every stage of
the appellate proceeding.  This enables a party interested in a timely
disposition of the appeal to eliminate any substantial delay on the part of the
adversary.  As for systemic delay, resort can be had to s. 7  in the cases in
which real prejudice is occasioned.

 

                   This raises the
issue of the appropriate forum for a remedy pursuant to s. 7 with respect to
appellate delay.  In R. v. Gallagher, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 000, counsel for
the respondent submitted that an appellate court should not decide matters of
first instance which may require factual determinations.  While neither
solution is perfect I am of the opinion that the appropriate forum is the court
in which the delay occurred.  That court is in the best position to assess the
consequences of delay.  Moreover, this approach avoids the necessity of a
referral back of the issue to a trial court whenever a serious case of delay is
made out.  In addition, it avoids the awkwardness inherent in a lower court's
passing upon proceedings in a higher court which the latter must then review. 
While, generally matters of first instance are not decided in an appellate
court the nature of the issues and the material in support would not be
radically different from the issues and material in other motions which an
appellate court is called upon to decide.  If a further appeal lies from the
first appellate court, the issue of delay can be reviewed in the second
appellate court along with the consequences of additional delay resulting from
the second appeal.  As with other issues in appeal, this Court does not favour
issues being raised for the first time in an appeal to this Court.

 

Application to this case

 

                   No evidence was
offered nor was any attempt made in this appeal to show that any real prejudice
resulted from the appellate delay.  Counsel for the appellant quite properly
conceded that no breach of s. 7 could be made out and I find none.  The appeal
is therefore dismissed.

                   Trial ‑‑ Procedure
‑‑ Motion to amend charge ‑‑ Motion made late in trial ‑‑
Whether or not serious prejudice to accused. 

 

                   The appellants were charged
with keeping a bawdy-house for the purpose of the practice of indecent acts
contrary to s. 193(1) (now s. 210(1) ) of the Criminal Code .  Nude
dancers would perform in individual cubicles for their clients and would assume
a variety of suggestive positions.  The clients were permitted to remove their
clothing and many masturbated during the performance.  The management strictly
enforced a ""no touching"" policy and monitored this policy with a peep
hole on each room.  The peep hole was not used for purposes of voyeurism.

 

                   At trial, the Crown's motion
to amend the charge by deleting the words ""the practice of
indecency"", and its subsequent motion to include the words ""practice
of prostitution"" were denied because they would cause serious prejudice to
the accused.  The motions were made late in the trial when virtually all the
evidence had been called.  The Court of Appeal materially amended the charge
and entered a conviction on the basis of the amended charge.  The issues before
this Court are:  (1) whether the Crown should have been permitted to amend
the charge substantially, and (2) whether the acts were indecent when
viewed in light of the current standard of community tolerance.

 

                   Held (Gonthier and La Forest JJ. dissenting): 
The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé, Cory and
McLachlin JJ.:  Although the courts possess reasonably wide powers of
amendment under s. 529(3) (now s. 601(3) ) of the Criminal Code ,
persons accused of a crime must know the charge brought against them in order to
present a full answer and defence.  A court can amend an information or
indictment only when the amendment would not result in irreparable prejudice
and only if the evidence can support such a charge.  Here, to have permitted
the amendment so late in the trial would have caused irreparable prejudice to
the appellants.  It might have been appropriate to allow the proposed amendment
much earlier in the trial proceedings provided an adequate adjournment was
granted to the appellants to prepare their defence to meet the amended
charges.  The Court of Appeal's decision to amend the charge materially and
enter a conviction on the basis of the amended charge was extraordinary and
inappropriate.

 

                   The ""community standard
of tolerance"" test for indecency, like the one used in obscenity cases,
involves an analysis of the impugned acts involving several considerations. 
These accepted standards of tolerance, which are contemporary and change with
the times, and which reflect the standards of society as a whole, exist and
should not be exceeded.  The decision as to whether the acts fall below the
community standard of tolerance rests with the court.  The determination must
be made objectively in accordance with the contemporary standards of the
Canadian community, and not merely project a judge's own personal ideas of what
is tolerable.

 

                   The degree of harm ‑‑
in the sense of predisposing persons to act in an anti‑social manner ‑‑
is a factor that the courts can consider in determining the community standard
of tolerance.  The public harm that might result from the public exposure to
the impugned acts is relevant to the determination of whether or not they are
indecent.

 

                   The circumstances surrounding
the act must be taken into account for the community standard of tolerance will
vary from place to place and with the composition of the audience.  The purpose
of the performance and the nature of the warning or notice that is given of the
performance may be considered.

 

                   The use of expert evidence to
assess the community standard of tolerance is advisable.  Here, the trial
judge, in determining this standard, properly considered the expert opinion of
a psychologist and sexologist, a government report studying the problems
associated with pornography and prostitution and a police officer who attended
at the premises.

 

                   No complaints were made about
the club's activities, either from neighbours or clients, and this fact too can
be considered in deciding whether there was community tolerance for the acts. 
The community tolerated sexually suggestive acts performed by naked dancers and
the acts of both the clients and the dancers came within the range of this
tolerance.  Both clients and dancers knew exactly what to expect, consented to
the activities and could leave at will.  Whether the acts of simulated
masturbation or masturbation itself are  indecent depends on the
circumstances.  The lack of physical contact, although not determinative, was
significant since there was little likelihood of physical harm being caused to
either individual.  Equally important, the ""no contact"" rule
ensured that the transmission of infectious sexual diseases was prevented and
so increased the level of the community tolerance for the acts at issue.

 

                   Although the premises here
fell within the Criminal Code 's definition of a public place, common
sense indicates that there are great differences between locations which can
come within the definition of public places.  The performance of an activity in
a closed room in a house, where only two consenting adults are present, is far
different from carrying out the same activity in a school yard or a public
park.  The existence of the monitoring peep hole, even if it were to be used
for consensual voyeurism, was hardly enough to render the act any more public,
in any significant sense, than it was when performed between the two persons
apparently alone in the room.  The presence of the peep holes would, if
anything, indicate that the acts were not viewed as indecent by any of the
persons in the room or by the management enforcing their rule against physical
contact.

 

                   Per La Forest and Gonthier JJ.
(dissenting):  The standard for determining whether or not an act is indecent
is what the community as a whole is prepared to tolerate and not what was
approved of or seen as tasteful by that community.  This single standard of
tolerance does not vary with the actual audience and is constant, regardless of
the time, place or manner of the representation at issue inasmuch as those
factors serve to define the audience.  The standard is responsive to the
various harms which may be caused by obscene activity or depictions.  The
combination of a given content and a representation together constitute the
particular essence of obscenity.

 

                   This case did not concern
pornographic material but rather a live performance of sexual activity, by both
the client and the dancer, in a public place.  The acts in issue were not in
substance the same as other acts found to be tolerated by the trial judge.

 

                   The way in which a
representation occurs can contribute to harmfulness or a lack of tolerance by
the community.  The community was concerned about the activities occurring in
the Club and any tolerance that neighbours may have been shown to have had
towards the Club did not account for the activity of the client.

 

                   The place where the acts
occurred was public, i.e., a place to which the public has access, either as of
right, or by express or implied invitation.  The relative privacy of an
activity, while relevant, is but one of many factors to be considered.  The
division of what is private from what is public rests only in part on the
number of persons who may witness the activities in question.  It also rests
upon the special set of expectations which the public rightly holds with regard
to what activity will occur only in private, and what may occur in public. 
These expectations are not limited to those which may be justified on the basis
that there should be no direct exposure of persons, against their will, to the
activities in question.  They extend to the expectations which the public
rightly has in relation to the sphere which is shared by each and every
person.  While exposure of persons is one of those harms, there are many others
which are undoubtedly important -- exploitation, degradation, the undue
commercialization of certain activities, and the dangers these harms entail.

 

                   There was no evidence to
support the conclusion that masturbation in a public place meets the standard
of community tolerance.  The normality of an act in private cannot be directly
relied upon in establishing the tolerance of that act in public when, as here,
the act is in part defined by its public character.  The very qualities of an
act which make it normal in private may not make it normal in public, or
tolerated.

 

                   The evidence of the expert
witness and the reliance placed on the Fraser Committee were misplaced for,
although they did consider aspects peripheral to the issue of society's
tolerance of masturbation in public, they did not consider that issue itself. 
The activity here was not the same as that which occurred in other establishments
and which was tolerated.

 

                   The defence of lack of mens
rea was not available.  The appellants, although they did not intend to
break the law, did intend to do what they did and to operate the club as they
did, and so cannot avail themselves of this defence.  The defence of officially
induced error, too, was not available even though appellants were given reason
by official sources to believe they were not breaking the law.  A clear
connection must exist between the inducement relied upon and the activity of
the defendants.  The licence (as an establishment for private erotic
conversation), which is the most convincing form of inducement, was for
activities greatly different from the activities actually occurring at the
premises.  The defence, moreover, does not operate to prevent the courts from
determining what activity is indecent.  The application of the defence is
usually limited to regulatory offences where the reliance placed on the
inducement is more reasonable.

                   Gonthier
J. (dissenting) -- I have had the
benefit of the reasons of Justice Cory.  As he states, the two issues in this
appeal are whether the Court of Appeal erred in setting aside the decision of
the trial judge refusing to permit the Crown to amend the charge substantially,
and second, whether the acts in question satisfy the community standard of
tolerance, and are therefore not indecent.  I am in agreement with Cory J. in
relation to the first issue, and I am also in agreement with the review of the
facts which he presents as they relate to the activities of the appellants. 
However, there are a number of additional facts relevant in particular to the
standard of community tolerance which will be referred to, as required, in the
course of these reasons.  I respectfully disagree with him on the second issue
and would dismiss the appeal confirming in the result the decision of the Court
of Appeal.

 

The Standard of Community Tolerance as Applied to
this Case

 

                   The test by which the
indecency of an act is to be determined for the purposes of the charge in this
case is rightly identified by Cory J. as the standard set by what the
community is prepared to tolerate.  That test was recently affirmed in R. v.
Butler, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 452, where the relevant standard was confirmed to
be that which the community as a whole, and not a mere segment of it, was
prepared to tolerate, and not what was approved of or seen as tasteful by that
community (at p. 476).  This single standard of tolerance does not vary
with the actual audience and is constant, regardless of the time, place or
manner of the representation at issue inasmuch as they serve to define the audience. 
The standard is responsive to the various harms which may be caused by obscene
activity or depictions.  As I had occasion to note in that case, at
p. 512, it is the combination of a given content and a representation
which together constitute the particular essence of obscenity and, as I stated
at pp. 517-18:

 

A host of
factors could intervene in the manner of representation to affect the
characterization of the material, among which are the medium, the type or the
use.

 

                   The
medium provides a good example....

 

. . .
the likelihood of harm, and the tolerance of the community, may vary according
to the medium of representation, even if the content stays the same.

 

While that case concerned s. 163  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , and various depictions of sexual
activity, and this case concerns activity under s. 210 of the Code
(formerly R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 193) rather than a depiction, there is a
representation of sexual activity in both instances:  the dancer in this case
performed in a place to which the public had access, to an audience, albeit of
one, who was a member of the public, and the dance was intended for and
addressed to a member of the public against remuneration.  As a live
representation, the impact of the dance is considerably stronger than that of a
statue, painting, picture or even movie.

 

                   This case, then, does not
concern pornographic material, but rather a live performance of sexual
activity, by both the client and the dancer, in a public place.

 

                   In identifying the acts in
question, Cory J. concludes that the performance in question was similar to
dancing performances which were tolerated by the police.  He refers to the fact
that unlike most performances which occur in strip bars, in this case, clients
did undress and masturbate when they were in the room viewing the performance
of the dancer.  He states at p. 000:

 

Several
witnesses testified that the only difference between the performance by the
dancers in the Pussy Cat and that of dancers performing in the strip bars was
that the client was permitted to take off his clothes and masturbate.  The
actions and movements of the nude dancers performing in bars were not subject
to any police action.

 

                   However, in my view the acts
which occurred at the Pussy Cat Club were not in substance the same as those
which, according to the evidence, occurred elsewhere and were found to be
tolerated by the trial judge.  This is clear when the three salient features of
the performance, namely its live nature, the public locale and the activity of
the client are considered.  This is so even when the activity of the dancer as
a live performance is considered by itself.  Johanne Totunov, who was sworn as
a witness for the Crown, had approximately seven years experience as a nude
dancer in Montreal, and had worked at the Pussy Cat Club as a dancer.  She
testified that she had never seen a dancer use a vibrator in the course of a
nude dance in a club.  This was common practice in the Pussy Cat Club, and it
is a noteworthy aspect of the performance.  It changes the quality of the
activity of the dancer as perceived by the client from a dance performance
having an erotic quality into something more in the nature of a demonstration
of sexual activity.  The performance was not merely evocative of sexual imagery
and sexuality, but was a performance of a sexual act.  Because a vibrator is
used for actual stimulation, the activity from the point of view of the dancer
is actual masturbation, as opposed to a mere simulation of being in a state of
arousal or stimulation.  On the basis of the substance of the performance of
the dancer alone, the activity in question is clearly distinguished from what
was done, and found to be tolerated, elsewhere.

 

                   The evidence of Constables
Rochon and Cormier does not support the conclusion that the acts of the dancers
in the Pussy Cat Club were sufficiently similar in nature to the acts of
dancers performed and tolerated elsewhere so as to meet the standard of community
tolerance.  Constable Rochon states that the acts he saw in the Pussy Cat Club
were not the same as those which he had seen occur elsewhere, and his statement
is uncontradicted.  This opinion concerned the nature of the acts, when seen as
a whole.  There is no evidence that he had seen dancers use vibrators for acts
of masturbation, nor did he state that other dancing performances included all
the aspects of the performance at the Pussy Cat Club.  His evidence on
cross-examination that a number of the parts of the performance at the Pussy
Cat Club were equivalent to acts which formed a part of performances he had
seen elsewhere, does not detract from his overall assessment.

 

                   Constable Cormier gave
evidence based on approximately one hundred visits to nude dance clubs which he
had made during five and a half years of service with the drug and morals
division.  His testimony was that, when seen as a whole, the dancing at the
Pussy Cat Club was not like that which he had seen elsewhere.  In particular, he
testified that he had never seen dancers touching their genitals in the way
they did at the Pussy Cat.  He stated that if he had seen such activity, he
would have intervened to do what was ""necessary"", meaning at a
minimum, to issue a warning.  This evidence confirms that even the activity of
the dancer, considered alone, was not similar to the performances of dancers
which were found to occur and be tolerated elsewhere.

 

                   In R. v. Butler, supra,
at p. 517, I had occasion to note that the way in which a representation
occurs can contribute to harmfulness or a lack of tolerance by the community. 
This case does not concern the depiction of acts of masturbation, or a movie of
a dancer, for example, but those activities themselves.  The client was not a
passive observer of a spectacle.  It makes the activities in question less an
erotic portrayal, and more like a sexual encounter.  The importance of such a
distinction, and how it bears on the tolerance that persons may have towards
the acts in question, is illustrated by the testimony of Dr. Campbell.   
The only direct evidence which Dr. Campbell gives regarding tolerance
relates to that of persons in the neighbourhood of the Club towards the acts
that occurred there.  It suggests that their tolerance is based upon, and
indeed limited to, the performance of acts where the client would be a mere
passive observer:

 

[translation]  Once he knew what was
happening, they appeared to me -- ""Well, okay, that's what's going
on!"" -- they wondered -- it was not clear in their minds whether this was
prostitution with sexual intercourse, that was not clear to them; they said to
me, ""So exactly what is it?"", and I explained, ""Well, as I
understand it, they watch"", and when I explained that they said ""Yes,
okay, now we understand, that's all right"".  Those were the only persons I
contacted; there is my wife . . ..

 

This evidence suggests that there was some basis
for the conclusion that the community was concerned about the activities
occurring in the Club, but also that any tolerance that neighbours may have
been shown to have had towards the Club did not account for the activity of the
client.

 

                   The second aspect is the
public character of the place in which the acts took place.  The definition of
a public place which is adopted in s. 197  of the Criminal Code , but
also in s. 150  in relation to other offences, is very wide indeed.  It
includes all places to which the public have access, either as of right, or by
express or implied invitation.  It is true, as pointed out by Cory J.,
that there is a spectrum of situations or locales, some of which are more open
and crowded than others.  It is also true that this fact is relevant to the
characterization of the acts in question, and that acts which occur in one sort
of public place may be tolerated while those which occur in another may not be.

 

                   However, this does not mean
that acts done in a public place that is less exposed than a school yard or a
public park are equivalent to acts which are done in privacy.  Cory J.
correctly notes that the dancer would be the only one who would be exposed to
the masturbation of the client, and that she was a consenting adult.  On this
basis, it is concluded that the acts were ""relatively private"". 
Although the relative privacy of an activity is relevant, as it may bear on the
expectations of persons, for example, it is but one of many factors which must
be considered.  The division of what is private from what is public rests only
in part on the number of persons who may witness the activities in question. 
It also rests upon the special set of expectations which the public rightly
holds with regard to what activity will occur only in private, and what may
occur in public.  These expectations are not limited to those which may be
justified on the basis that there should be no direct exposure of persons,
against their will, to the activities in question.  They extend to the
expectations which the public rightly has in relation to the sphere which is
shared by each and every person.  The public sphere is specially attended to by
the law in general, and the Criminal Code  in particular, because it is
into that sphere that persons enter to earn a living, to conduct business, and
to enjoy community life.  As such, there are certain harms which occur only in
the public realm and which are properly given particular attention as such. 
While exposure of persons is one of those harms, there are many others which
are undoubtedly important, and they include exploitation, degradation, the
undue commercialization of certain activities, and the dangers these harms
entail.

 

                   The law regulates the activity
occurring in the public sphere for these and many other reasons.  One has to
look no further than the structure of the law governing the activities
associated with prostitution to gain an appreciation for the many varied
interests of peace, security, and public order which are secured by the legal
regime governing activity permitted in public.  The Criminal Code  makes
special reference to the common bawdy-house because the activity occurring in
those houses may well not be tolerated, regardless of the potential for direct
exposure of the general public to the activity:  a bawdy-house is
""relatively private"", but it is nonetheless singled out for special
attention by the Criminal Code .

 

                   It is not necessary for the
purposes of this appeal to address all the policy considerations which support
the wide definition of what is a public place in the meaning which has been
adopted in the Code.  If the removal of the activity occurring in a
common bawdy-house from the sight of the general public had of itself a great
significance, there would be little need for s. 210  of the Criminal
Code.

 

                   The third aspect of the
activity which occurred at the Pussy Cat Club and which must be noted is the
activity of the client.  There is no evidence which supports the conclusion
that masturbation in a public place meets the standard of community tolerance. 
Reference was made by the trial judge to the evidence of Dr. Campbell, an
expert witness, and the contents of the Fraser Committee.  I have had occasion
to note above that the evidence of Dr. Campbell which bears directly on
the question of tolerance does not support the conclusion that acts of
masturbation in public are tolerated, and indeed suggests the opposite. 
Further, the relevance of expert testimony with regard to the understanding of
the community standard of tolerance is limited.  This was recognized in Towne
Cinema Theatres Ltd. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494,
at p. 515.  Two aspects of that decision are relevant here.  First,
the opinion of experts is always subject to evaluation by the courts.  Second,
and more importantly, the kind of expert testimony which was at issue in that
case was testimony by the Chairman of the Censor Board that a film called Dracula
Sucks, the content of which gave rise to the litigation, did not fall below
the contemporary community standard of tolerance.  The evidence there bore
directly on the matter before the Court.  The evidence given by Dr. Campbell,
who is concerned with human sexual behaviour and treatment of sexual problems,
is very different.  It relates essentially to the normality of the activity of
masturbation which he considered was engaged in by a large portion of the
population, but undoubtedly in a private place.  While this testimony may bear
on how persons may view private acts of masturbation, it is not relevant in the
manner accepted at trial.  Testimony that an activity is not a perversion may
be directly relevant to excluding that activity from the category of those acts
which would be indecent wherever they occurred.  But such a narrow and
straightforward inquiry is not what is at issue here.  The normality of an act
in private cannot be directly relied upon in establishing the tolerance of that
act in public when, as here, the act is in part defined by its public
character.  All the circumstances of the act must be considered, and the act in
all its features must be examined.  There is no doubt that the very qualities
of an act which make it normal in private may not make it normal in public. 
The normality of an activity undertaken in private does not demonstrate that
the same activity would be tolerated in public.

 

                   The evidence of
Dr. Campbell is that masturbation per se is tolerated, and the only
reference to the specific acts which occurred at the Pussy Cat Club concerns
the toleration which persons would have of clients watching the dancers. 
Equally, his testimony that there would be a tendency for tolerance of the acts
in question because of the public health risks which attend prostitution does
not amount to an affirmation that masturbation in a public place is tolerated
by the public.

 

                   For similar reasons, I am also
of the view that the reliance placed by the trial judge on the contents of the
Fraser Committee is misplaced.  A general review of the nature of the sexual
activity in its many facets with reference to various social problems
associated with these activities is not the same as a review of the societal
tolerance of acts of masturbation in public.  The Fraser report does not
address the latter issue.

 

                   Not only is there an absence
of evidence supporting the conclusion that masturbation in a public place is
tolerated, the relevant evidence in this case is to the contrary.  On the basis
that the client was in a state of undress, Ms. Totunov described the
activity at the Pussy Cat Club as being not comparable to what was done in strip
clubs because it was more ""osé"" or risqué.  This testimony,
particularly when viewed in light of the fact that not only did the clients
undress but they also masturbated while in a state of undress, strongly
supports the conclusion reached by both Constables that when the acts are seen
as a whole, they are not similar in character to those acts apparently
performed and tolerated in strip clubs.

 

                   As a result, when all the
evidence is considered, there is no basis upon which the activity in question
can be viewed as essentially the same as that which occurred in other
establishments.

 

                   The Court of Appeal referred
to and followed its previous decision in R. v. Laliberté (1973), 12
C.C.C. (2d) 109, a case involving masturbation of clients by masseuses in a massage
parlour.  Cory J. refers to that case, and distinguishes it, as he does R.
v. Lantay, [1966] 3 C.C.C. 270, a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal. 
While it is true that in both cases there was physical contact between the
client and the woman offering services, the presence of physical contact did
not in my view form the basis for the conclusion that masturbation in a place
to which the public have access is indecent, or an act of prostitution. 
Indeed, the latter decision, which is referred to by the former case, relies
upon the English authority of R. v. De Munck, [1918] 1 K.B. 635.  That
case decided at pp. 637-38 that ""prostitution is proved if it be
shown that a woman offers her body commonly for lewdness for payment in
return"", intercourse was not a requirement.  The law has never required
that the most lewd form or variety of an activity which is not tolerated by the
community occur in order that such activity be viewed as indecent.  It does not
do so here.

 

                   The decision of the Court of
Appeal to reverse the conclusion of the trial judge was correctly based upon a
reconsideration of the evidence, and an application of the law to the facts of
this case.  A conclusion that certain activities are indecent is one which is
based on the facts, but in the final analysis is a question of law, since, as
mentioned by Cory J. in his reasons at p. 000, ""(t)he decision
whether (the acts in question are) tolerable according to Canadian community
standards rests with the court"".

 

                   In this case, a consideration
of the evidence leads to the conclusion that there was a manifest error in the
reasoning of the trial judge.  I am in agreement with the decision of Brossard
J.A. of the Court of Appeal, at (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 439, at p. 446,
that a consideration of the masturbation by the client leads by itself to the
following conclusion:

 

(translation) . . . in so
far as it is not private in nature, carried out before a pure stranger, in a
house [the public nature of which] is undeniable, and in a room where he can be
seen by third parties, amply satisfies me so as to find the existence of acts
of indecency.

 

                   In my view, the conclusion
must be the same even if it is accepted that viewing by third parties would be
limited to security and control purposes.

 

                   In the result, it is necessary
to consider the arguments raised on behalf of the appellants by way of
defences.  These arguments were not dealt with below.  They may, however, be
briefly disposed of.  The defences of lack of mens rea and officially
induced error are put forward on the common basis that the appellants did not
intend to break the law and were given reason, by official sources, to believe
that they were not breaking the law.  This basis cannot support a defence of
lack of mens rea when, as here, the accused intended to do the acts they
did and operate the Club in the way they did.  As for the defence of officially
induced error, it has no application to the facts of this case, for two
reasons.  First, the most convincing form of inducement referred to in this
case, a licence which the appellants obtained, was for activities substantially
different from those which ultimately occurred in the Pussy Cat Club, namely a
""Bureau de conversations érotiques en personne"" ([translation] ""Establishment for
private erotic conversations"").  A clear connection must exist between the
inducement relied upon and the activity of the defendants.  Second, the defence
does not operate to prevent the courts from determining what activity is
indecent.  The application of the defence is usually limited to regulatory
offences where the reliance placed on the inducement is more reasonable.  For
both these reasons, the defences raised in this case cannot succeed.

 

                   In the result, I would dismiss
the appeal and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeal on the basis of the
second issue, and direct that the matter be returned to the trial court for
sentencing.

 

                   The judgment of
L'Heureux-Dubé, Cory and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

 

//Cory J.//

 

                   Cory
J. -- There are two principal issues
raised on this appeal.  The first is whether the Court of Appeal erred in
setting aside the decision of the trial judge refusing to permit the Crown to
amend substantially the charge late in the trial when virtually all the
evidence had been called.  The second is whether the acts described in the
evidence should be considered as indecent when viewed in light of the current
standard of community tolerance.

 

Factual Background

 

                   The appellants were charged
with keeping a bawdy-house at 3668 Ontario St. E. for the purpose of the
practice of acts of indecency contrary to s. 193(1) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, now R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 210(1) .

 

                   An example of the wording of
the charges faced by the appellants can be found in that brought against Robert
Bourdeau:

 

[translation]  Robert
Bourdeau, between March 22, 1988 and April 20, 1988, in Montreal,
judicial district of Montreal, did unlawfully keep a common bawdy‑house
at 3668 Ontario East, by assisting the occupant of premises used for the
purpose of the practice of acts of indecency contrary to s. 193(1)  of the Criminal
Code .

 

                   The address given is a house. 
Affixed to it is a small plaque stating simply the ""Pussy Cat"". 
Advertisements appeared in Montreal newspapers giving the name and address of
the house and stating that nude dancers would perform for individual clients in
a private setting.  There were apparently no complaints about the operation of
the house from either neighbours or clients.

 

                   When a client came to the
premises, he was allowed to select a dancer from pictures which were shown to
him.  He was told that there was to be absolutely no touching; he could not
touch the dancer, nor could she touch him.

 

                   The client would be taken to a
private room that was furnished with a mattress and a chair.  In that room the
selected dancer would, for a fee of $40, undress and perform an erotic dance
for the client on the mattress.  For an additional fee of $10 the dancer would
caress herself with a vibrator while she danced.  During the course of the
performance the dancer would assume a variety of suggestive positions while
caressing herself in simulated or actual masturbation.  The clients were
invited to remove their clothes.  The evidence disclosed that the majority of
them masturbated while the dancer performed.

 

                   The rule against physical
contact was strictly enforced.  There was a small hole the size of a coin
located in the wall of each room.  This permitted the owners of the
establishment to ensure that the rule was respected.  The hole in the wall
served no other purpose than surveillance by the management.  There is
certainly no indication that it was used by voyeurs.

 

                   The Crown sought to amend the
charge by deleting the words ""the practice of indecency"".  The trial
judge refused this motion.  The Crown then asked that the charge be amended to
include the words ""practice of prostitution"".  This motion too was
denied on the same grounds as the first, namely that it would cause serious
prejudice to the accused.

 

                   After the trial was completed,
the decision was reserved.  On November 9, 1988, Fontaine M.C.J. of the
Municipal Court acquitted all the appellants.  The Crown launched an appeal and
on September 17, 1991 the Court of Appeal of Quebec allowed the appeal, set
aside the acquittals and convicted the appellants on the charges brought
against them.

 

Judgments in the Courts Below

 

Municipal Court (Fontaine M.C.J.), [1989] R.J.Q. 217

 

                   For Fontaine M.C.J. the key
issue was whether the Pussy Cat constituted a ""bawdy-house"" as those
words were defined in the Criminal Code  and in the case law.  He noted
that there was no evidence either that the house had a reputation for
debauchery or that there had been any complaints made about it by local
residents.  The house appeared to be a private dwelling bearing the small
plaque with the words the ""Pussy Cat"".  In his view it therefore did
not come within the definition of a bawdy-house that was explored in Patterson
v. The Queen, [1968] S.C.R. 157.

 

                   He then reviewed the evidence
that was presented in order to determine whether the activities in the Pussy
Cat were indecent.  He relied upon the testimony of an expert witness called by
the defence.  The witness testified that the acts were not indecent but rather
were examples of nonpathological voyeurism and exhibitionism and as such, they
were tolerated by the community provided they were performed in private.  As
well the trial judge referred to the Fraser Committee report on pornography.

 

                   The trial judge carefully
considered the test for indecency set out in Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd. v.
The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494, in these words at p. 224:

 

[translation]  If we apply the
information gathered by the Fraser Committee to the case of the Pussy Cat, we
can quite readily and logically conclude that the Canadian community in general
is prepared to accept that acts of masturbation do not exceed the standards
of decency, provided there is no contact between the persons and provided
they are between consenting adults in private, even if the premises are open to
the public.

 

                   This
is particularly so as there is no violence connected with these activities of
sexual self‑stimulation and self‑gratification and, as the expert
witness Dr. Campbell explained, in the circumstances in which they take
place this is neither sexual deviance nor a degrading act; although of course
part of the public may well disagree with such activities, the fact
remains that it is prepared to tolerate other persons engaging in them in
private and discreetly, with no coercion and without disturbing individuals who
do not agree with such activities or do not wish to take part in them. 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

                   Fontaine M.C.J. found that: 
(1) the evidence indicated that the clients of the Pussy Cat knew exactly what
awaited them; (2) none of them was shocked by what happened in there; (3) the
acts of self masturbation were consented to by the adults present; (4) the nude
dancing performed at the Pussy Cat was the same as nude dance shows performed
in bars in which the dancers touched their bodies and which were not interfered
with by the police; (5) there had been no complaints by any private citizens
about the activities in the Pussy Cat; and finally, (6) the acts engaged in at
the Pussy Cat were not pathological and were tolerated by the community.  He
concluded that in these circumstances the acts were not indecent acts and
therefore, the Pussy Cat was not a common bawdy-house.

 

Court of Appeal (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 439, [1991] R.J.Q. 2766

 

                   Brossard J.A. (for
the majority)

 

                   Brossard J.A. found that
the conclusions drawn by the expert witness with regard to the nature of the
sexual activities which took place at the Pussy Cat and their therapeutic value
was not relevant in determining the only issue in the appeal -- whether
masturbation in a public place constituted an act of indecency.  He noted that
the expert did not make a comment on this issue.  In his opinion both the Crown
and the defence witnesses devoted a great deal more time to the analysis of the
dancer's movements than those of the client.  He stated at p. 446:

 

                   (translation)  In my view, I
do not even believe it necessary to characterize the acts done by the dancer. 
The act done by the client, in so far as it is not private in nature, carried
out before a pure stranger, in a house whose public nature is undeniable, and
in a room where he can be seen by third parties, amply satisfies me so as to
find the existence of acts of indecency.  I cannot otherwise characterize the
sexual act of masturbation done by a man in a place where he can be seen and/or
observed by pure strangers.

 

In the absence of proof to the contrary, he
concluded that masturbation in a location other than the privacy of a room in
one's home, must be considered an act which exceeded the standards of community
tolerance.

 

                   With respect to the amendments
to the charges, Brossard J.A. concluded that they would not create any
prejudice to the appellants.  In his opinion, the trial judge should not, at
the amendment stage, have considered whether the evidence entered to that point
was sufficient to convict the appellants of prostitution.  On this point,
Brossard J.A. decided that there was evidence of prostitution.  He concluded
that, under the circumstances, an amendment which limited the charge to the
keeping of a common bawdy-house when the specific provision of the Code
provided that the premises would meet the definition if they were used either
for the purposes of acts of indecency or prostitution was appropriate.

 

                   Brossard J.A. turned
finally to the question of whether the acts in question constituted acts of
prostitution.  He determined that all of the classic elements of prostitution
were present:  solicitation, lewd and even indecent gestures by the dancer to
entice the client, sexual gratification of the client and all of this for
remuneration.  Nonetheless, he inquired whether physical contact was necessary
for there to be prostitution.  He referred to the decisions in R. v. De
Munck, [1918] 1 K.B. 635, R. v. Webb, [1963] 3 W.L.R. 638, and R.
v. Lantay, [1966] 3 C.C.C. 270, and concluded that it was not.

 

                   Accordingly,
Brossard J.A. concluded that the Pussy Cat was a common bawdy-house for
the purpose of committing indecent acts as well as prostitution.

 

                   Proulx J.A.
(concurring reasons)

 

                   Proulx J.A. allowed the
appeal for reasons that were, in part, different from those of
Brossard J.A.

 

                   With respect to the request to
amend the charges presented by the Crown, Proulx J.A. concluded that the
trial judge erred in deciding a procedural matter on the basis of his
assessment of the merits of the issue.  On the issue of prejudice, he
determined that the amendment would not affect the fairness of the trial since
its only effect would be to enlarge the scope of the debate on issues of law
which had not already been broached.

 

                   Proulx J.A. considered
prostitution to be the sale of sexual favours or the offering of sexual
services in exchange for payment by another.  In his view, it is not necessary
for there to be complete sexual relations between the service provider and the
client in order to constitute prostitution.  He concluded that both the offer
of sexual services in the newspaper advertisement and the provision of services
by the dancer to her client established that the Pussy Cat was a common
bawdy-house for the purposes of acts of prostitution.

 

Points in Issue

 

1.Did the Court
of Appeal err in law when it decided that the amendments to the charge proposed
by the Crown should have been permitted by the trial judge?

 

2.Did the Court
of Appeal err in law in its conclusion that the impugned acts were indecent in
light of the standard of community tolerance?

 

Analysis

 

Should the Information have been Amended?

 

                   The Crown brought two motions
to amend the information pertaining to each of the appellants.  They were
brought very late in the trial after all the evidence to be called on behalf of
the appellants had been submitted.  All that remained was for the Crown to
tender evidence as to whether Robert Bourdeau was a ""keeper"" within
the meaning of the section.

 

                   In the first motion for
amendments, the Crown requested that the words ""utilisés à des fins
d'actes d'indécence"" ([translation]
""used for the practice of acts of indecency"") be struck from the
information.  The trial judge rejected this motion stating that if he granted
it, the accused would suffer prejudice.  He put his position in this way:

 

[translation]  . . .
one of the reasons which I see that could cause prejudice to the defence is
that all the . . . all these accused persons, from the time ‑‑
and even if you say ""Well, your Honour, we are offering, the Crown is
offering the defence an adjournment"", for say a month to prepare the
defence ‑‑ all the accused from the outset have obviously focused
their defence on and in terms of the charges brought against them, and so in
terms of premises which were a common bawdy‑house, premises used for the
practice of acts of indecency; and when premises are kept in that way, there is
a defence which is possible. . . .

 

                   The Crown's second motion was
to include the words ""utilisés à des fins de prostitution et pour la
pratique d'actes d'indécence"" ([translation]
""used for purposes of prostitution and for the practice of acts of
indecency"") in the informations for each of the accused.  This second
motion was also rejected.  The trial judge again noted the prejudice that would
result to the accused if such an amendment were to be made at this late stage
of the trial.  He also found that the evidence did not support the claim that the
Pussy Cat was being kept for the purpose of prostitution.  The Court of Appeal
disagreed with the trial judge on both of these points.

 

                   The Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 529(3) (as am. by S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 123) and
(4) (now ss. 601(3)  and (4) ), provides for the amendment of a charge in these
terms:

(b)

state or states defectively anything that is requisite to constitute the
offence,

 

(ii) does not
negative an exception that should be negatived,

 

(iii) is in
any way defective in substance,

 

and the
matters to be alleged in the proposed amendment are disclosed by the evidence
taken on the preliminary inquiry or on the trial; or

 

(c)
that the indictment or a count thereof is in any way defective in form.

 

                   (4)
The court shall, in considering whether or not an amendment should be made,
consider

 

(a) the
matters disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry,

 

(b) the
evidence taken on the trial, if any,

 

(c) the
circumstances of the case,

 

(d)
whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by a variance,
error or omission mentioned in subsection (2) or (3), and

 

(e)
whether, having regard to the merits of the case, the proposed amendment can be
made without injustice being done.

 

                   By virtue of this section, the
courts now possess reasonably wide powers of amendment.  Yet, it remains an
important principle of criminal law that persons accused of a crime must know
the charge brought against them in order to present a full answer and defence (Vézina
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2).  A court cannot amend an information or
indictment where to do so would cause irreparable prejudice (R. v. Moore,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 1097).  Moreover, a court cannot amend an information unless
the evidence tendered is capable of supporting such a charge.

 

                   In the present case it is not
necessary to consider whether evidence of prostitution was disclosed during the
trial.  The prejudice that granting the amendment would cause the appellants is
determinative of the issue.

 

                   When the motion for the
amendment was brought it was obvious that the appellants had prepared their
defence on the basis that the acts performed were not indecent.  In light of
the wording of the original charge the appellants quite properly prepared their
entire defence on this issue.  This can be seen from the careful and lengthy
testimony provided by the expert witness on this very question.  To have
permitted the amendment at this stage would have caused irreparable prejudice
to the appellants.  Perhaps much earlier in the trial proceedings it might have
been appropriate to allow the proposed amendment provided an adequate
adjournment was granted to the appellants to prepare their defence to meet the
amended charges.  Undoubtedly, the appellants would have needed time to
consider their position and to consult and retain experts with regard to the
issue as to whether the acts constituted prostitution.  That, of course, is
speculation.  It is sufficient to say that, in the circumstances of this case,
the trial judge was correct in his conclusion that to grant the amendment at
this late stage would have caused irreparable prejudice to the appellants.

 

                   Further, in my view, it was
inappropriate for the Court of Appeal to grant the amendment.  It is, I think,
an extraordinary step for an appellate court to amend the charge materially and
then to enter a conviction on the basis of the charge as amended.  The
unfairness that results from such a procedure was aptly described by
Zuber J.A. in R. v. Geauvreau (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 75
(Ont. C.A.).  At p. 84 he wrote:

 

                   It
is part of our law of criminal procedure that a person accused of crime is
entitled to know the charge against him, whether contained in an information or
an indictment, in reasonably specific terms and he is tried on that charge. 
This principle retains its vitality even though the formalism of an earlier era
has been diminished and trial Courts now possess reasonably wide powers of
amendment.  However, even though criminal procedure has become less technical
and more flexible, the concept of an amendment at an appellate stage involves
difficult considerations.  An amendment at trial contemplates a continuing
ability by the accused to meet an amended charge; the appellate stage occurs
long after the evidence has been led, arguments made and facts found.  In my
view, it would be an extraordinary step for an appellate Court to materially
amend the charge and uphold a conviction based on the charge as amended.  I
would think that such an extraordinary step would require the clearest
statutory basis.

 

Were the Acts in the Circumstances in which they
were Committed Indecent?

 

                   (i) The Nature of the Acts
in Question

 

                   After being informed about the
rules of the premises and having chosen the picture of the dancer he wished to
meet, the client was ushered to the room where the performance was to take
place.  The sole occupants were the dancer and the client.  In the room the
dancer once again explained that there was to be no physical contact.

 

                   During the course of the
20-minute performance the dancer talked about sex, took off her clothes and
caressed her body, including her genitals (with or without the vibrator,
depending on the client's choice).  Several witnesses testified that the only
difference between the performance by the dancers in the Pussy Cat and that of
dancers performing in the strip bars was that the client was permitted to take
off his clothes and masturbate.  The actions and movements of the nude dancers
performing in bars were not subject to any police action.  The issue is,
therefore, whether the acts performed in the Pussy Cat were indecent.

 

(ii)The
Appropriate Test to Determine Indecency:  The Community Standard of Tolerance

 

                   In Reference re ss. 193 and
195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, Lamer J. (as
he then was), stated at p. 1159 that in determining whether an act is indecent
the ""community standard of tolerance"" test should be applied.  That
test is similar to the one used in obscenity cases.  When applied to the issue
of indecency, the community standard test, enunciated in Towne Cinema
Theatres Ltd., supra, involves an analysis of the impugned acts in
light of the following considerations at p. 508:

 

(i) [there are]
accepted standards of tolerance in the contemporary Canadian community [which
should not be exceeded]; (ii) [these] standards must be contemporary as times
change and ideas change with them, one manifestation being the relative freedom
with which the whole question of sex is discussed; (iii) it is the standards of
the community as a whole which must be considered and not the standards of a
small segment of that community. . . ; (iv) the decision whether [the acts in
question are] tolerable according to Canadian community standards rests with
the court; (v) the task is to determine in an objective way what is tolerable
in accordance with the contemporary standards of the Canadian community, and
not merely to project one's own personal ideas of what is tolerable.

 

                   In discussing the meaning of
community standard of tolerance in Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd., supra,
Dickson C.J. at p. 508 stated:

 

                   The
cases all emphasize that it is a standard of tolerance, not taste, that
is relevant.  What matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves
to see.  What matters is what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing
because it would be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to
allow them to see it.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   In the same case, Wilson J.
provided a helpful distinction between tolerance and taste at p. 522:

 

                   The
Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines ""toleration"" as
""the action or practice of tolerating or allowing what is not actually
approved.""  It is apparent from this definition that there is a
distinction between that which is not approved and that which is not to be
tolerated.

 

Wilson J., at p. 523, quoted with approval from
the decision of R. v. Doug Rankine Co. (1983), 36 C.R. (3d) 154 (Ont.),
at p. 173.  There Borins Co. Ct. J. made the following assessment in
relation to what may be described as ""sex films"":

 

In my opinion,
contemporary community standards would tolerate the distribution of films which
consist substantially of scenes of people engaged in sexual intercourse. 
Contemporary community standards would also tolerate the distribution of films
which consist of scenes of group sex, lesbianism, fellatio, cunnilingus, and
anal sex.  However, films which consist substantially or partially of scenes
which portray violence and cruelty in conjunction with sex, particularly where
the performance of indignities degrades and dehumanizes the people upon whom
they are performed, exceed the level of community tolerance.

 

Wilson J. then continued at p. 523:

 

In drawing this
distinction I do not think that Borins Co. Ct. J. was suggesting that the
average Canadian finds the former type of film to his or her taste or that such
films are inoffensive to most Canadians.  Rather, I think that Borins Co.
Ct. J. recognized that whether or not Canadians found the former type of
films distasteful, they were prepared to tolerate their being shown.

 

                   More recently in R. v.
Butler, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 452, this Court considered the community standard
of tolerance in order to determine whether the pornographic material in
question constituted such an undue exploitation of sex that it could be
labelled obscene.  In that case one of the issues the Court considered was when
a work might cease to be art and becomes, instead, obscene.  Sopinka J.
concluded that the final determination of that question might lie with the
degree of harm which could result from public exposure to the impugned
material.  At page 485 he stated:

 

                   The
courts must determine as best they can what the community would tolerate others
being exposed to on the basis of the degree of harm that may flow from such
exposure.  Harm in this context means that it predisposes persons to act in an
anti-social manner as, for example, the physical or mental mistreatment of
women by men, or, what is perhaps debatable, the reverse.  Anti-social conduct
for this purpose is conduct which society formally recognizes as incompatible
with its proper functioning.  The stronger the inference of a risk of harm the
lesser the likelihood of tolerance.  The inference may be drawn from the
material itself or from the material and other evidence.  Similarly evidence as
to the community standards is desirable but not essential.

 

                   That same consideration of the
degree of harm which may flow from the questioned work must also be relevant to
the determination of the community standard of tolerance with respect to acts
which are said to be indecent.

 

(iii)The
Circumstances Surrounding the Act; that is to say the Context in Which It Took
Place.

 

                   In any consideration of the
indecency of an act, the circumstances which surround the performance of the
act must be taken into account.  Acts do not take place in a vacuum.  The
community standard of tolerance is that of the whole community.  However just
what the community will tolerate will vary with the place in which the acts
take place and the composition of the audience.  For example, entertainment
which may be tolerated by the community as appropriate for the patrons of a bar
may well be completely inappropriate for an audience of high school students. 
What is acceptable in a stage production performed for adults may be completely
unacceptable if performed for elementary school pupils in a school auditorium. 
As well, the nature of the warning or notice that is given of the performance
may be of significance.  No one is compelled to attend a performance of a nude
dancer.  Nor could it be said that members of the audience were surprised by the
performance if notice of the nature of the dancing has been given.  Further,
the purpose of the performance may be a factor to be taken into account.  See
for example the reasons of Holden J.A. in R. v. MacLean and MacLean
(No. 2) (1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 412 (Ont. C.A.), and
Martin J.A. in R. v. Giambalvo (1982), 70 C.C.C. (2d) 324
(Ont. C.A.).

 

                   A number of cases have
properly taken into account the surrounding circumstances in determining
whether the acts were indecent.  In R. v. Traynor, [1987] O.J. No. 1943
(Q.L.) (Ont. Prov. Ct., Crim. Div.), the question was whether a
performance in a licensed tavern by a professional singer, dancer and burlesque
performer offended the community standards of tolerance.  During the course of
the performance, the dancer removed all of her clothing except her boots and a
g-string while singing a song.  She gave the appearance of pressing her breasts
and her genitals against a vertical pole.  Nosanchuk Prov. Ct. J. stated,
in my view correctly, that the following factors were significant in his
decision that the performance did not offend the community standards of
tolerance:

 

1) The
performance took place in a licenced [sic] tavern, publicly advertised
as an adult entertainment lounge;

 

2) The
prospective patrons were forewarned to stop if offended by total nudity;

 

3) The accused
was a professionally trained singer, dancer and actress who had appeared in
such a capacity in various parts of the United States, Canada, Australia,
England and Japan;

 

4) The accused
enjoyed a celebrity status which resulted in her being a guest on national
network television programs hosted by entertainers well known to the North
American public;

 

5) The
performance was described in the prosecution evidence as essentially funny,
upbeat and comic;

 

6) The singing
and dancing was described as professional and the gestures of the hands and
legs and the dancing was in rhythm;

 

7) The entire
act was described as well rehearsed;

 

8) The audience
was appreciative and well behaved;

 

9) The
performance of the accused essentially went no further than exposing her bare
breasts and vagina to the patrons in the course of the dance and doing other
gyrating motions on the stage.

 

                   Thus, the trial judge held
that while there were undoubtedly Canadians who would not approve of the type
of performance given by the accused, and would find it distasteful, offensive
or unacceptable, it did not offend the community standards of tolerance.

 

                   In R. v. Pelletier
(1985), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 77, [1986] R.J.Q. 595, the Quebec Superior Court used
the contextual approach to determine whether the showing at a bar of a video
tape which displayed scenes of cunnilingus, fellatio, lesbianism and sexual
penetration while nude dancers performed on stage offended the community
standards of tolerance.  The participants in the video were all nude.  On
occasion there were close-up shots of the genitals of the man and of the
woman.  In one scene a woman introduced the handle of a feather duster into her
vagina.  Another showed a woman observing the sexual antics of the participants
and demonstrating by the movement of her hand on her body that they were a
source of pleasurable stimulation for her.

 

                   In determining what the
appropriate level of community standard of tolerance would be in the context of
these specific facts, Boilard J. stated at p. 89 that:

 

(translation) . . . indecency concerns
sexual behaviour or its representation which is neither obscene nor immoral but
inappropriate according to the Canadian standards of tolerance because of the
context in which it takes place.  In other words, indecency is not a function
of the behaviour itself but rather of the circumstances in which it takes
place.

 

He held that the audience, the place and the
context of the representation were essential elements in the determination of
indecency.  Thus, although he was personally disgusted by the performance, he
found that in the context in which it was performed it would not have offended
the community's level of tolerance.

 

                   Other cases in which the
circumstances surrounding the act were determinative of the issue of indecency
include R. v. Kleppe (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 168 (Ont. Prov. Ct.), R.
v. Sequin, [1969] 2 C.C.C. 150 (Ont. Co. Ct.), and R. v. Belanger
(1980), 5 W.C.B. 446 (Ont. Co. Ct.).

 

The Appropriate Consideration of the Evidence in
this Case

 

                   In this case the trial judge
properly recognized that the appropriate standard is not what the community
would applaud, appreciate or even accept but rather, the much less stringent
standard of community tolerance.  He wrote at p. 223:

 

                   [translation]  Applying this
test to the present case, one can say the following:  what matters and what is
relevant is not what individual Canadians approve for themselves, it is what
individual Canadians are prepared to tolerate as an activity in a particular
place, without it being shocking, revolting or degrading.

 

                   In reaching his decision with
regard to the objective standard of community tolerance, the trial judge relied
on three sources of evidence.  They were first the expert testimony of Dr.
Michel Campbell, a psychologist, sexologist and professor at the University of
Quebec in Montreal; secondly, the Fraser Committee study on Pornography and
Prostitution in Canada and thirdly, the testimony of a former employee of the
Pussy Cat and of a police officer who attended at the premises.  This approach
is eminently reasonable and in accordance with the conclusions of this Court in
Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd., supra.  There it was held that the
use of expert evidence to assess the community standard of tolerance is
certainly advisable.  Let us then first consider the testimony of
Dr. Campbell.

 

                   (i) Dr. Campbell's
Evidence

 

                   Dr. Campbell gave a
lengthy and detailed explanation of human sexual behaviour and attitudes.  He
testified that the incidents of masturbation had increased to where it can now
be said that some 90 percent of all men and 50 percent of all women engage in
masturbation.  In his view the increase was due to a change in attitudes and
beliefs which have progressed from the view that masturbation was a harmful
activity to the present opinion that for most people masturbation is a healthy
and acceptable behaviour.

 

                   In the opinion of
Dr. Campbell the acts performed in the Pussy Cat were non-pathological
acts of voyeurism and exhibitionism which did not cause harm to anyone.  He
went further and described the acts as constituting ""safe sex"" since
sexually transmitted diseases could obviously not be contracted through this kind
of activity.  He also testified that the acts in question were neither
degrading nor dehumanizing; nor were they perverse.  He thus concluded that the
acts were not likely to exceed the standards of tolerance of the majority of
the Canadian population.

 

                   He further expressed the view
that Canadians would be more likely to tolerate the activities conducted in the
Pussy Cat than acts of prostitution the classic sense involving sexual
intercourse, since the public health risks were obviously much less. 
Furthermore, the fact that the activities in question involved consensual and
heterosexual adults increased the likelihood that they would be tolerated.

 

                   Unlike the Court of Appeal, I
am of the view that it was entirely appropriate for the trial judge to take
into account the expert testimony of Dr. Campbell in determining the community
standard of tolerance.  That testimony was relevant and helpful in arriving at
an objective appreciation as to what types of sexual behaviour would be
tolerated by the Canadian public.  It was on the basis of the statistics
provided by Dr. Campbell, which indicated that most Canadians engage in
masturbation, that the trial judge concluded that the average Canadian was more
likely to tolerate activities which were similar to those in which they engaged
in themselves.  Obviously, any perception of what would be tolerated will very
properly be influenced by what is perceived as normal.  What is normal will, in
turn, depend upon the extent to which that same activity is engaged in by
others.  If the act in question is one that is performed by the majority in the
community then it is impossible to say that the act itself would not be
tolerated by the community.  It can then only be the ""where"" and
""when"" of the performance of the act, that is to say its surrounding
circumstances, that could lead to its being found to be outside the range of
community tolerance and therefore indecent.  Thus, once the act itself is found
to be tolerated then the inquiry must focus on the circumstances surrounding its
performance.  It was then appropriate and reasonable for the trial judge to
take into account and rely upon the expert evidence of Dr. Campbell.

 

                   I am supported in this view by
the conclusions of Dubin J.A. as he then was in R. v. St. Pierre
(1974), 3 O.R. (2d) 642.  In that case the trial judge had ruled as
inadmissible the testimony of a duly-qualified psychiatrist who stated that
depending on the circumstances, an act of cunnilingus as a preliminary to
sexual intercourse was perfectly normal and was practised by a large proportion
of the population.  He also testified that it was a practice which had been
increasing in use over the past 20 years.  In reversing the trial judge's
decision to exclude the evidence, Dubin J.A. stated at pp. 649-50:

 

                   Attitudes
relating to sexual behaviour are constantly changing.  In determining whether
the conduct of the accused was a very marked departure from decent conduct, it
would have been of great assistance to the jury to have been apprised by an
admittedly qualified expert as to sexual practices being carried on in this
country, which are not regarded by many as abnormal or perverted.  In the
absence of such evidence the jury would be left to make the determination
dependent solely on their own private views and their own experience.

 

(ii)The
Report of the Fraser Committee on Pornography and Prostitution

 

                   The trial judge also made use
of the report drafted by the Fraser Committee on Pornography and Prostitution. 
This committee was established by the Government of Canada to study the
problems associated with pornography and prostitution and to carry out a program
of socio-legal research in support of their work.  It held public hearings and
private sessions from coast to coast seeking the views of individuals and
groups of Canadians.

 

                   In addition, in order to
assist the Committee in its efforts to understand the current situation with
respect to pornography and prostitution in Canada, the Department of Justice
commissioned a number of studies, one of which was the National Population
Study.  In this study a sample of 2,018 Canadians, representative of all parts
of the country except the Yukon and Northwest Territories, answered questions
about pornography.  Once again I believe that the trial judge was correct in
relying upon the Fraser Committee Report and the studies it had reviewed.  I
would agree with the trial judge's statement at p. 224 that:

 

[translation]  . . . 
the recommendations of this Committee are a valuable and important tool for
measuring the threshold of tolerance of Canadians in general for phenomena such
as pornography, prostitution or bawdy‑houses, which it goes without
saying clearly includes the phenomenon of what is indecent or what is not.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

                   What
matters for the Court is to note that in 1985 the community threshold of
tolerance was measured quite adequately by the Fraser Committee, even though
the recommendations made were not adopted by Parliament.  The Court may
therefore take this study into consideration as one factor by which it can
measure the standards of the Canadian community with respect to
""indecent acts"" which may be tolerated in so‑called ""bawdy‑houses"". 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

(iii)Testimony
regarding Police Tolerance of the Performance of Dances at Bars Which were
Similar to Those performed at the Pussy Cat

 

                   The respondent contended that
the trial judge erred in taking into consideration the apparent police
tolerance of nude dancing in strip clubs across Canada where the acts performed
were very similar to those performed in the Pussy Cat.  The respondent argued
that the trial judge did not base his conclusions regarding police tolerance on
any evidence that was presented at trial and that indeed, there was evidence to
the contrary.  Reference was made to the testimony of Constable Claude Cormier
who stated that when he saw nude dancing of the kind undertaken at the Pussy
Cat, he did [translation]
""what was necessary"".

 

                   However, the transcripts
reveal that there was, in fact, testimony given by Johanne Totunov and
Constable Gilles Rochon, both of whom were witnesses for the Crown, which
indicated that there was a wide degree of police tolerance for
""dancing"" which simulated sexual activity and which was similar to
that performed at the Pussy Cat.  The evidence quite clearly suggests that
strip tease or nude dances in which the dancer caressed her own genitals and
simulated orgasms were tolerated by the police.  Although evidence of police
acceptance of the impugned conduct is not determinative of the community
standard of tolerance, it is, nonetheless, a useful indication of what that
standard might be.

 

                   Constable Gilles Rochon, one
of the police officers who attended at the Pussy Cat, first denied that he had
witnessed dancing of a similar nature to that performed in the Pussy Cat. 
However, when cross-examined by defence counsel, he admitted that he had seen
dancers in strip clubs lying on the stage, spreading their legs, caressing
their genitals, breasts and simulating orgasms.  It would appear that the
performance at the Pussy Cat was no more graphic or sexually specific, that is
to say, no worse than the dancing the police tolerated at the strip bars.

 

                   As well, Johanne Totunov, a
former employee of the Pussy Cat and a former nude dancer in Montreal,
testified that it was her experience that the practice of touching the breasts,
buttocks and even, at times, the genitals, was something which had become
tolerated by the Montreal police.

 

                   Finally, I would note that
Constable Gilles Rochon testified that on various occasions he had viewed
video films depicting graphic sexual scenes involving anal and vaginal
penetration, masturbation, cunnilingus and fellatio in several strip bars
without concluding that charges should be brought.

 

                   Thus, there was ample evidence
upon which the trial judge could properly base his conclusion that activities
similar to those engaged in at the Pussy Cat were tolerated by the police. 
This too could be considered an appropriate factor in assessing the community
standard of tolerance for the acts which took place in the Pussy Cat.

 

The Surrounding Circumstances that were Unique to
this Case

 

                   Let us consider the
circumstances that surrounded the acts in this case.  As we have seen in this
case the acts, in themselves, of both the clients and the dancers came within
the range of community tolerance.  This conclusion with regard to the acts of
masturbation was properly drawn on the basis of the evidence given by Dr.
Campbell on human sexual behaviour and attitudes and on the report of the
Fraser Committee on Pornography and Prostitution.  With regard to the
performance of the dances, the conclusion could be properly based upon the
evidence of those who had, in the past, performed in strip bars and the
evidence of police tolerance of activities in strip bars which were similar to
those performed at the Pussy Cat.  The inquiry must then focus on the
circumstances which surrounded the activities at the Pussy Cat.  It is those
circumstances which will determine whether the activities would be tolerated by
the community.  

 

The Rule Against Physical Contact

 

                   It is significant that clients
were warned when they first arrived at the Pussy Cat and again later by the
dancer which they had selected that there was to be no physical contact of any
kind.  That was the rule of the establishment and there is no evidence that it
was ever breached.  It is true that there was masturbation, or in the case of
the dancer, simulated masturbation.  Whether the act of masturbation itself is
indecent must depend on all the surrounding circumstances or the context in which
it takes place.  If masturbation can be one of the principal themes of the well
accepted novel, Portnoy's Complaint (1969), by the outstanding author
Philip Roth, it surely cannot have the same connotation of indecency it
possessed in the past.

 

                   Although the lack of physical
contact is not determinative of the issue, it is nonetheless highly
significant.  The rule ensured that there would be little likelihood that
physical harm or hurt would be done to either individual.  Of equal importance
was that it ensured that the transmission of infectious sexual diseases was
prevented.  This factor should increase the level of the tolerance of the
community for the acts performed at the Pussy Cat.

 

                   I note also that in those
reported cases where masturbation was held to have been indecent it was clearly
established that there was physical contact between the client and the woman
performing the services.  See R. v. Laliberté (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 109
(Que. C.A.), and R. v. Lantay, supra.

 

The Place Where the Acts Took Place

 

                   It cannot be forgotten that
the sexual activities were conducted behind closed doors out of the view of the
general public.  It is true that the public did have access to the Pussy Cat
premises.  Thus it came within the definition of a public place provided by
s. 150  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , which
""includes any place to which the public have access as of right or by
invitation, express or implied"".  Nonetheless, common sense indicates that
there are great differences between locations which can come within the
definition of public places.  Obviously, the performance of an activity in a
closed room in a house, where only two consenting adults are present is far different
from carrying out the same activity in a school yard or a public park.

 

                   On this aspect of the case,
the Court of Appeal was concerned with the presence of the small peep hole in
the wall of each room.  A former employee of the Pussy Cat testified that
before she accepted a job she looked through the peep holes to satisfy herself
that there was no physical contact between the clients and the dancer.  Based
on this evidence the Court of Appeal concluded that the peep holes could well
be used more often than the court was being told.  That, I think, is
speculation.  There is no evidence that they were used for any purely
voyeuristic purpose.  At the most their presence would mean that one other
consenting adult observed the proceedings.  This is hardly enough to render the
act any more public, in any significant sense, than it was when performed
between the two persons apparently alone in the room.  The presence of the peep
holes would, if anything, indicate that the acts were not viewed as indecent by
any of the persons in the room or by the management enforcing their rule
against physical contact.

 

                   Thus although the acts took
place in a public place, as those words are defined in the Criminal Code ,
they were not a blatantly public display.  Rather the closed room was
relatively private with only consenting adults present.

 

The Absence of Harm

 

                   There was no harm caused by
the activities.  The peep holes, if anything, provided a means of ensuring that
no harm came to the dancers or the clients.  As Dr. Campbell observed, the
activities took place between consenting adults who chose to be in a place
which they, at least, would consider relatively private.  In these times when
so many sexual activities can have a truly fatal attraction, these acts provided
an opportunity for safe sex with no risk of any infection.  The absence of any
risk of harm could properly be taken into account in assessing community
tolerance for the act.

 

The Informed and Consensual Nature of the Acts

 

                   It is clear that everyone
attending the premises knew exactly what they could expect.  If they had any
misgivings about being in a room with a naked female they could leave the
premises.  Both the clients and dancers knew what the activities entailed. 
Both parties in the room consented to the activities.  This was a factor that
could be considered in determining if there was community tolerance for the
acts.

 

Absence of Complaints

 

                   There were no complaints about
the Pussy Cat either from its clients or residents.  The clients who testified
stated that they were neither shocked nor insulted by what took place within
the establishment.  This too can be considered in deciding whether there was
community tolerance for the acts.

 

Similarity to Accepted Nude Dancing

 

                   It is clear from the evidence
that the actions of the dancers at the Pussy Cat were very similar to those of
dancers in strip bars.  The performances of the dancers in strip bars were
clearly accepted by the public and by the police.  This indicates that there
was indeed a community tolerance for sexually suggestive acts performed by
naked dancers.  These actions are not violent and in the milieu of the strip
bar they are accepted or at least tolerated by the community.  It follows that
the actions of the dancers in the Pussy Cat would be tolerated by the
community.

 

                   Thus, neither the actions of
the dancers nor, in the factual circumstances presented by this case, the acts
of masturbation constituted indecent acts.  Here, the surrounding circumstances
were such that the acts would be tolerated by the community and they were
therefore not indecent.  This result may seem offensive to some.  Yet, it must
be remembered that we are not concerned with standards of good taste.  Rather
the question is whether the acts will be tolerated by the community.

 

Disposition

 

                   In the result I would allow
the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal registering convictions
against the appellants and restore the acquittal of the appellants.

                   Criminal law --
Narcotics -- Accused acquitted on certain charges ‑‑ Acquittals
overturned by Court of Appeal and new trial ordered ‑‑ Whether
trial judge erred in failing to consider whether Crown had proved accused guilty
of one of charges.

 

                   The accused was
charged with various drug trafficking offences, and with possession of the
proceeds of narcotic trafficking and laundering such proceeds.  These latter
charges included counts involving conduct prior to July 1989, counts relating
to early July 1989, and one count alleging that the accused had been in
unlawful possession of the proceeds of narcotic trafficking between April and
July 1989 (the ""global count"").  The trial was conducted
intermittently over almost eight months.  At the conclusion of the Crown's
case, the accused moved to have the charges dismissed.  In oral reasons
dismissing the motion, the trial judge said he had had difficulty dealing with
the case because of the intermittent nature of the trial proceedings and had
had to rely entirely on his notes.  Three months later he convicted the accused
of the trafficking charges, but acquitted him of the proceeds‑related
charges.  In rendering his verdict the trial judge again commented on the
sporadic nature of the proceedings.  He said he had seriously considered
declaring a mistrial because the trial proceedings were ""extremely
unsatisfactory"", but had decided not to because that would cause undue
hardship to the accused.  The Court of Appeal allowed the accused's and the
Crown's appeals and ordered a new trial on all of the charges.  It was
satisfied on the basis of the trial judge's conclusions as to his difficulties
in dealing with the case that a mistrial should have been declared.  It also
found that the trial judge erred in his assessment of the proceeds-related
charges, by seeming to proceed on the basis that the Crown had to prove the
actual amount of money in the accused's possession which was the proceeds of
narcotic trafficking.  The accused appealed to this Court from the Court of
Appeal's decision to order a new trial on the charges of which he was
acquitted.

 

                   Held (Gonthier and Cory JJ.
dissenting in part):  The appeal should be allowed in part.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka and
Major JJ.:  The trial judge was correct in not declaring a mistrial on the
charges of which the accused was acquitted.  The Court of Appeal's conclusion
that the trial judge must have had the same difficulty with the evidence at the
time of rendering his verdict as he had when dealing with the nonsuit motion
does not necessarily follow, but is based on conjecture.  The trial judge may
have improved his understanding of the evidence in the intervening three
months.  He could have refreshed his memory by a more thorough review of his
notes, and may have seen a transcript.  He may also have gained renewed
appreciation of the evidence from the closing submissions of counsel.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
erred in overturning the trial judge's acquittals on the pre‑July and
July proceeds counts.  While different inferences of fact may have been drawn
by another judge from the findings of fact at the trial, it is not open to an
appellate court, on a Crown appeal from an acquittal, to interfere with the
inferences of fact drawn by the trial judge simply because the appellate court
would draw different inferences.  The acquittal by the trial judge on the
global count cannot be affirmed, however, in light of his finding that some
money must have come into the accused's possession as a result of trafficking
in cocaine.  It was open to the trial judge to conclude that although he could
not identify which of the transactions particularized in the various proceeds
counts involved the proceeds of narcotic trafficking, the Crown had proved
beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of those transactions involved the
proceeds of narcotic trafficking.  The accused would then have been convicted
on the global count.  The trial judge's failure to direct his mind to this
issue was an error of law.

 

                   Per Gonthier and Cory JJ.
(dissenting in part):  There is no reason to interfere with the Court of
Appeal's disposition that all the acquittals should be set aside.  While the
trial judge did not state the specific nature of the difficulty he was having
at either the time of the nonsuit motion or subsequently, it is nevertheless
clear that the intermittent nature of the hearings had caused him to conclude
that he had not been able to acquire a satisfactory appreciation of the complex
factual record which was required to decide the matters before him on a sound
basis.  The persistence of a difficulty is underlined by his reference to it in
the strongest terms both when dealing with the motion and three months later by
way of preface to his reasons for verdict.  The suggestion that the trial
judge's recollection improved with the additional lapse of time between the
nonsuit motion and the rendering of a verdict is belied by his comment at the
latter time that the extended and sporadic nature of the trial had been so extremely
unsatisfactory that he gave serious consideration to declaring a mistrial and
that his reason for not doing so was undue hardship to the accused.  This
reason cannot justify rendering a verdict on the basis of a trial that is not
fair, be it a conviction or an acquittal.  A proper remedy in the event a fair
trial cannot be held within a reasonable delay is a stay of proceedings.  The
fact that the trial judge gave reasons referring to the evidence is not
sufficient to allay the concern as to the fairness of the trial.  His comments
indicate that he did not consider that the fact-gathering process had provided
him with an adequate basis for a due consideration of the evidence.  There was
a variety of testimony and evidence in this case which was necessarily subject
to an assessment regarding credibility.  In these circumstances, the presence
of a statement by the trial judge that the fact‑finding process was
inadequate is sufficient grounds for a declaration of a mistrial.

//Major J.//

 

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Major
J. -- The appellant was
charged with: one count of conspiracy to traffic in a narcotic; two counts of
trafficking in narcotics; two counts of possession of narcotics for the purpose
of trafficking; ten counts of possession of the proceeds of narcotic
trafficking, contrary to s. 11.1 of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. N-1 (now s. 19.1); and nine counts of laundering the proceeds of
narcotic trafficking, contrary to s. 11.2 (now s. 19.2) of the Narcotic
Control Act.  He was convicted in the Ontario Provincial Court, Criminal
Division of the conspiracy, trafficking and possession of narcotics charges,
but was acquitted of the proceeds-related charges.

 

                   The appellant and
the respondent each appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which allowed both
appeals and ordered a new trial on all of the charges:  (1992), 9 O.R. (3d)
161, 75 C.C.C. (3d) 50, 57 O.A.C. 13.  The appellant now appeals to this Court
as of right from that part of the Court of Appeal's judgment which directed a
new trial on the charges of which he was acquitted.  The respondent has not
cross-appealed from the Court of Appeal's decision to order a new trial on the
charges of which the appellant was convicted.

 

I.  Facts

 

                   The Crown's case
against the appellant relied primarily upon police surveillance of the
appellant and an alleged co-conspirator, Alejandro Manolio.  The trial judge
found that the police surveillance evidence of June 17, 1989 did not advance
the Crown's case, but that the surveillance evidence of June 19, 20, and 28,
1989, and of July 3 to 7, 1989, established a relationship between the
appellant and Manolio.

 

                   There was further
surveillance evidence which showed an association between the appellant and two
men, Zevallos and Narvaez.  Part of this evidence was that on July 7, 1989, the
appellant and Manolio drove in a Mazda registered in the name of Zevallos to a
school lot and then parked behind a Mustang a short distance from the lot. 
Narvaez, who was a passenger in the Mustang, approached the appellant and
Manolio.  The appellant, after a short conversation with Narvaez, went to the
passenger side of the Mazda and took out a white plastic bag.  He handed the
bag to Narvaez, who then got into a Toyota.  The police followed and stopped
the Toyota.  The other occupant of the Toyota, Zevallos, was at that time found
in possession of one kilogram of cocaine and $4,200 in Canadian money.  The
cocaine was contained in a bag which, at least on the surface, did not appear
to be similar to the package handed to Narvaez by the appellant.

 

                   The police arrested
the appellant later on July 7, 1989.  The appellant was found upon his arrest
to have approximately $306,000 in cash in the trunk of the car he was driving. 
At the same time the police searched an Oldsmobile Toronado (which the
appellant had been observed driving on July 3, 1989), and found 15 kilograms of
cocaine.  The evidence indicated that Manolio had more frequent contact with
this car than had the appellant.

 

                   The evidence
disclosed that on a number of occasions from April to July 1989, the appellant
was in possession of large amounts of Canadian currency, which he was
exchanging for U.S. currency and Swiss francs.  The total amount of currency
that the appellant was shown to have handled over this period was in excess of
$700,000 Canadian.  The Crown's theory was that Manolio was the person who did
the actual trafficking in narcotics and that the appellant handled the money.

 

                   The appellant
called evidence at trial in an attempt to explain the large amounts of cash he
had handled over the period in question.  It was claimed that the appellant and
his brother, who lives in Argentina, were conducting a currency exchange
business.  The appellant's brother testified that this business involved buying
Argentinean money with U.S. dollars on the Argentinean black market, then using
the Argentinean money to purchase Canadian dollars on the black market, and
finally shipping the Canadian money to Canada to be exchanged for U.S.
dollars.  The appellant's brother stated that the difference between the value
of Canadian and U.S. currency on the Argentinean black market would result in
this type of circular exchange yielding a substantial profit, a claim supported
by the expert testimony of an economist.  The appellant also called as
witnesses a relative who testified to having acted on one occasion as a courier
of Canadian currency between Argentina and Canada for the appellant and his
brother, and an Argentinean who testified to having lent $400,000 U.S. to the
appellant's brother.  The appellant did not testify.

 

                   The appellant's
trial was conducted intermittently over 20 days from November 16, 1989 to July
3, 1990.  At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the appellant moved to have
the charges dismissed on the basis that the Crown had failed to adduce any
evidence to prove the essential elements of the offences.  The trial judge
dismissed that motion on April 2, 1990.  In the course of his oral reasons for
denying the motion, the trial judge commented upon having difficulty dealing
with the case because of the intermittent nature of the trial proceedings and
that he had to rely entirely on his notes.

 

                   Three months later,
on July 3, 1990, the trial judge delivered judgment with oral reasons.  In
rendering his verdict the trial judge again commented on the sporadic nature of
the proceedings but his comments did not indicate that he had the same
difficulty in dealing with the evidence as he had in April.  The trial judge
said he had seriously considered declaring a mistrial because the trial
proceedings were ""extremely unsatisfactory"", but that he had decided
not to declare a mistrial because that would cause undue hardship to the
appellant.  The trial judge then convicted the appellant on the conspiracy,
trafficking and possession of narcotics charges, and acquitted him on the
proceeds-related charges.  On July 25, 1990, the trial judge sentenced the
appellant to nine years' imprisonment.

 

                   In considering the
trial judge's decision to acquit the appellant on the proceeds-related charges,
it is helpful to divide the proceeds-related charges into separate groups based
on the time periods involved.  The proceeds-related charges against the
appellant were counts 6 to 24 on the information dated November 16, 1989. 
Counts 6 to 11 and 22 involved allegations of unlawful possession of the
proceeds of narcotic trafficking, and of laundering the proceeds of narcotic
trafficking, between April 28, 1989 and May 24, 1989 (""the pre-July counts"").  
Counts 12 to 21 and 24 involved allegations of similar illegal conduct by the
appellant in early July 1989 (""the July counts"").  Finally, count 23
alleged the appellant had been in unlawful possession of the proceeds of
narcotic trafficking between April 28, 1989 and July 6, 1989 (""the global
count"").

 

II.  Judgments in the Courts Below

 

A.  Provincial Court 

 

(i)Application
to have the charges dismissed for no evidence (April 2, 1990)

 

                   The trial judge in
rejecting the application stated: 

 

                   One
of the difficulties I have had in dealing with this case and coming to any
conclusion is the length of time it took to complete the crown's case.  This
case started back in about the middle of November of 1989, and proceeded from
time to time into March of this year, and I have had to rely entirely upon my
notes.

 

                   In rejecting the
application for a nonsuit, the trial judge applied the proper test when he
said:

 

                   I
have gone through my notes on the evidence carefully, and I have come to the
conclusion that there is some evidence, without weighing or assessing it, some
evidence, to support the charges that Mr. Tortone faces, and this includes the
conspiracy charge.

 

                   (ii) Trial
verdict (July 3, 1990)

 

                   The trial judge
first commented:

 

A
trial conducted sporadically over this length of time can only be extremely
unsatisfactory to the accused, who has been in custody from the day of his
arrest, the 7th of July, 1989 and cannot be commensurate with the proper
administration of justice.  I, from a trial judge's point of view, find such an
extended and sporadic trial extremely unsatisfactory.  So much so, that I've
given serious consideration to declaring a mistrial.  However, I'm not going to
take that step, since to do so would cause undue hardship to the accused.

 

                   In the course of
reviewing the evidence, the trial judge rejected the Crown's contention that
finding the appellant guilty on the conspiracy, possession of narcotics, and
trafficking charges meant that the proceeds-related charges were also proven beyond
a reasonable doubt (the Crown's argument being that there could be no other
explanation for the source of the large amounts of cash the appellant was
handling).  He then stated:

 

 

Any
evidence of cocaine dealing does not exist before the 5th, 6th or 7th of July,
1989 or perhaps the 19th of June, 1989.  It may be valid to suspect the accused
was involved in the cocaine trade as far back as April or May of 1989, but that
cannot be anything more than a suspicion.

 

The trial judge reviewed the defence
evidence, and concluded that evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to the
pre-July counts:

 

The
Crown submitted this evidence of supposedly legitimate foreign exchange
transactions should be totally disbelieved because no one carrying on a
legitimate business would operate in such a sloppy, inept and careless way as
described by [the appellant's brother].

 

I
agree their way of carrying on their money business was incredibly careless;
however, even though I discount that evidence and give it little weight, there
is still some evidence of large amounts of Canadian cash money coming to the
accused from a source other than the cocaine trade.

 

He then dismissed the pre-July counts.

 

                   The trial judge
found that while the evidence had not proved a conspiracy to have commenced in
March 1989, it was established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant and
Manolio ""entered into such a conspiracy commencing Monday, the 3rd of
July, 1989, and ending on Friday, the 7th of July, 1989.""  He found the
appellant guilty of the conspiracy charge (over the shorter time period than
that stated in the charge), and of the possession of narcotics and trafficking
charges.

 

                   The trial judge
went on to rule that there was a reasonable doubt as to the remaining
proceeds-related charges (the July and global counts):

 

Due
to there being some evidence that at least some of the money the accused was in
possession of and dealing with was sent to him from Argentina for legitimate
business purposes, and due to there being very little evidence, or perhaps
none, of how much money actually came into the accused's possession as a result
of trafficking in cocaine -- and there must have been some money -- I
reluctantly come to the conclusion that the Crown has failed to establish
beyond a reasonable doubt the remaining money offences, counts 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23 and 24.  Those counts are dismissed.

                   [Emphasis added.]

 

B.  Court of Appeal (1992), 9
O.R. (3d) 161

 

(i) Appeal
by the appellant from the convictions

 

                   Goodman J.A. noted
(at p. 165) in reviewing the facts and evidence that because the activities of
the appellant and Manolio ""were very complicated and difficult to
follow"",

 

[i]t
is little wonder that the trial judge expressed such consternation about the
intermittent nature of the trial which undoubtedly made it very difficult to
piece together the sequence of the events disclosed by surveillance over such a
lengthy period of time as given in evidence by so many witnesses.

 

Goodman J.A. would have dismissed a
number of the appellant's grounds of appeal but was satisfied on the basis of
the trial judge's conclusions as to his difficulties in dealing with the case
that a new trial should be ordered.

 

(ii)
Appeal by the Crown from the acquittals

 

                   In dealing with the
argument that the trial judge should have declared a mistrial on all of the
charges, Goodman J.A stated, at p. 170:

 

In
order to succeed, the Crown must show that the trial judge erred in law.  In my
opinion, the evidence with respect to these charges was inextricably interwoven
with the evidence upon which the convictions against Tortone were based.  If,
as I have found, the trial judge could not fairly proceed to convict Tortone
for the reasons stated, he erred in law in failing to declare a mistrial.  The
same reasoning applies to the trial of the charges of which Tortone was
acquitted.

 

He also found that the trial judge
erred in his assessment of the proceeds-related charges, by his seeming to
proceed on the basis that the Crown had to prove the actual amount of money in
the appellant's possession which was the proceeds of narcotic trafficking.

 

                   As a result, the
Court of Appeal also ordered a new trial on the proceeds-related charges.

 

III.  Points in Issue

 

                   The appellant
raises four issues in his appeal to this Court:

 

1.Did
the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding that the failure of the trial
judge to declare a mistrial in relation to counts 6 to 24 of the information
was an error of law upon which the Attorney General of Canada could appeal
pursuant to the provisions of s. 676  of the Criminal Code ?

 

2.Did
the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding that the trial judge erred in
law in failing to declare a mistrial in relation to counts 6 to 24 of the
information?

 

3.Did
the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding that the trial judge misdirected
himself as to the elements of the offences contrary to ss. 11.1(2)(a)
and 11.2(2)(a) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1
(as amended)?

 

4.Did
the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in failing to consider whether the Attorney
General of Canada had shown that if the trial judge had properly instructed
himself, his judgment of acquittal would not necessarily have been the same?

 

IV.  Analysis

 

A.  The trial judge's decision not
to declare a mistrial

 

                   As the Crown did
not appeal the decision to order a new trial on the charges of which the
appellant was convicted, the question of whether the trial judge erred in
deciding not to declare a mistrial on those charges is not before this Court. 
It is only the charges of which the appellant was acquitted that are now in
issue.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
held that the trial judge must have had the same difficulty with the evidence
at the time of rendering his verdict (July 3, 1990) as he had when dealing with
the nonsuit motion (April 2, 1990).  That conclusion does not necessarily
follow.

 

                   The trial judge's
decision on the nonsuit motion in April required only that he consider if there
was some evidence of the essential elements of the charges against the
appellant, but the process of reaching a verdict in July required the trial
judge to actually weigh that evidence.  While it is speculative, nonetheless in
the time between April and July, the trial judge may have improved his
understanding of the evidence, he could have refreshed his memory by a more
thorough review of his notes.  He may have seen a transcript.  He may have
gained renewed appreciation of the evidence from the closing submissions of
counsel.  This Court was told on the appeal that the trial judge had detailed
submissions from Crown counsel at the conclusion of the trial.  It is
noteworthy that the trial judge did not express the same concerns in reaching
his trial decision as he did when dealing with the nonsuit.  It is conjecture
to say he must have had the same difficulty in July as he had in April.  It
would also be conjecture to say that this must have been the reason why the
trial judge considered declaring a mistrial.  The trial judge did not indicate
in giving his trial verdict why he had considered declaring a mistrial.

 

                   Although the trial
judge did not deal exhaustively with the evidence in reaching his decision,
there is no reason to conclude that he was not able to appreciate the
evidence.   On the contrary the trial judge gave reasons on the evidence for
his conclusions.  This was adequate, particularly as there is no requirement
for a trial judge to comment upon all the evidence in his reasons for
judgment:  R. v. Morin, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 286, at p. 296; R. v. C. (R.),
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 226.

 

                   In the result the
trial judge was correct in not declaring a mistrial on the charges of which the
appellant was acquitted.

 

B.  The trial judge's findings on
the proceeds charges

 

                   The trial judge
found as a fact that there was no more than a suspicion that prior to June 19,
1989, at the earliest, the appellant was involved in a conspiracy to traffic in
cocaine.  He also found as a fact that the appellant had raised a reasonable doubt
that large amounts of currency had come into his possession through a foreign
exchange business being operated by the appellant and his brother.  On the
basis of these findings, the trial judge went on to conclude as a fact that
there was a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the pre-July
counts.  The trial judge also drew an inference of fact that in light of the
evidence regarding the claimed foreign exchange business, in combination with
the absence of evidence of money coming into the appellant's possession as a
result of cocaine trafficking, the Crown had failed to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the July counts and the
global count.

 

                   While different
inferences of fact may have been drawn by another judge from the findings of
fact at the trial, it is not open to an appellate court, on a Crown appeal from
an acquittal, to interfere with the inferences of fact drawn by the trial judge
simply because the appellate court would draw different inferences:  Schuldt
v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592.  In my view the Court of Appeal erred in
overturning the trial judge's verdict on the pre-July counts and the July
counts.

 

                   However, it is open
to an appellate court to overturn a trial judge's verdict where the trial judge
has not directed his mind to an issue or issues that require determination in
order to reach the verdict.  In this case, it was necessary for the trial judge
to determine not only whether the Crown had proven that the specific amounts
particularized in the various proceeds counts were the proceeds of narcotic
trafficking, but also whether, even if there were a reasonable doubt on all the
other proceeds counts, the Crown had proven the global count beyond a
reasonable doubt.  A finding that there was reasonable doubt as to all the
other proceeds counts would not necessarily lead to a conclusion that there was
also reasonable doubt on the global count.

 

                   It was open to the
trial judge to conclude that although he could not identify which of the
transactions particularized in the various proceeds counts involved the
proceeds of narcotic trafficking, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable
doubt that at least one of those transactions involved the proceeds of narcotic
trafficking.  If so, the result should have been to convict the appellant on
the global count, and to acquit him on all the other proceeds counts.

 

                   In my view, the
acquittal reached by the trial judge on the global count cannot be affirmed in
light of his findings that there was

 

. .
. very little evidence, or perhaps none, of how much money actually came into
the accused's possession as a result of trafficking in cocaine -- and there
must have been some money ....[Emphasis added.]

 

This is an ambiguous statement that is
neither an expression of reasonable doubt nor a satisfaction of sufficient
evidence to convict.  It also indicates that the trial judge did not consider
whether, despite there being a reasonable doubt on all the other charges, the
Crown had proved the appellant guilty of the global count.  The trial judge's
failure to direct his mind to this issue was an error of law.  This can only be
remedied by the Court of Appeal's direction of a new trial.

 

VI.  Conclusion

 

                   I would therefore
allow the appeal in part by restoring the acquittals on counts 6 to 22 and 24,
and would confirm the order for a new trial on count 23. 

 

//Gonthier J.//

 

                   The reasons of
Gonthier and Cory JJ. were delivered by

 

                   Gonthier
J. (dissenting in part)
-- I have had the benefit of the reasons of Justice Major and refer to his
review of the facts and proceedings.  While I am in any event in agreement with
him that the conclusion reached by the trial judge on count 23, the global count,
cannot be affirmed, I find no error in the Court of Appeal's understanding of
the statements of the trial judge referring to grounds for a mistrial and its
conclusion that the trial cannot be considered to have been a fair one, that
the acquittals should be set aside as were the convictions and a new trial
ordered.  I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

 

                   The central issue
in this case, upon which I respectfully differ from Major J., is as to the
Court of Appeal's finding concerning the fairness of the trial related to the
trial judge's inability to consider all of the evidence in rendering his
verdict.  This issue goes to the very heart of the trial process, wherein an
accused is to be tried and the verdict rendered on the basis of the evidence
before the court as a whole.  It is one of law with which the Court of Appeal
was entitled to deal and indeed so fundamental that the court was obligated to
do so.

 

                   The question arises
by reason of statements made by the trial judge upon dealing with a motion for
nonsuit on April 2, 1990 and when giving his verdict three months
later.  As Major J. notes in his reasons, the trial judge in deciding that
motion made special reference to the difficulties which the length of time for
completing the Crown's case caused him.  He had had to rely entirely on a
review of his notes as the hearings had run intermittently over a period of
approximately five months.  The Crown's case had been completed a month prior
to this motion.

 

                   These difficulties
in the evidence-gathering process were once again mentioned by the trial judge
when the verdict was given on July 3, 1990.  The relevant passage
reads as follows:

 

A
trial conducted sporadically over this length of time can only be extremely
unsatisfactory to the accused, who has been in custody from the day of his
arrest, the 7th of July, 1989 and cannot be commensurate with the proper
administration of justice.  I, from a trial judge's point of view, find such an
extended and sporadic trial extremely unsatisfactory.  So much so, that I've
given serious consideration to declaring a mistrial.  However, I'm not going to
take that step, since to do so would cause undue hardship to the accused. 

 

                   In the Court of
Appeal (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 161, Goodman J.A. concluded, at p. 169:

 

 His
statements irresistibly leave the impression that the long and sporadic nature
of the trial gave him difficulty in dealing with the evidence.  The only reason
that he gave for not declaring a mistrial was ""since to do so would cause
undue hardship to the accused"".

 

and (at p. 170):

 

I
am, however, satisfied that having regard to those statements and the nature of
the evidence, the trial cannot be considered to have been a fair one.  Justice
must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.

 

                   I agree.  The trial
judge viewed the circumstances to be such as to cause him to give serious
consideration to declaring a mistrial and he indicates in effect that he would
have done so but for his concern that this would cause undue hardship to the
accused.

 

                   Goodman J.A.
rightly distinguished this case from other appeals which are based on the mere
fact of delay or an inference of prejudice which may be drawn from such a fact.

 

                   While the trial
judge did not state the specific nature of the difficulty he was having at either
the time of the nonsuit motion or subsequently, it is nevertheless clear that
the intermittent nature of the hearings had caused the trial judge to conclude
that he had not been able to acquire a satisfactory appreciation of the complex
factual record which was required to decide the matters before him on a sound
basis.  In the words of the Court of Appeal (at p. 169):

 

His
use of the word ""entirely"" leaves the distinct impression that he had
a somewhat diminished recollection or appreciation of the evidence except as
disclosed by his notes. 

 

                   The persistence of
a difficulty is underlined by his reference to it in the strongest terms both
when dealing with the motion for nonsuit and three months later by way of
preface to his reasons for verdict.  As Major J. mentions, it is
speculative to inquire whether the trial judge may have improved his
recollection of the facts by reference to notes and transcripts in the period
following the hearing of the nonsuit motion.  However, the suggestion that the
recollection of the trial judge improved with the additional lapse of time
between that occasion and the rendering of a verdict is belied by his comment
at the latter time that, for him as a judge, the extended and sporadic nature
of the trial had been so extremely unsatisfactory that he gave serious
consideration to declaring a mistrial and that his reason for not doing so was
undue hardship to the accused.

 

                   It is remarkable
that the reason for not declaring a mistrial is not that the trial judge has
been able to overcome his difficulties as a judge (this would be the necessary
and only valid reason for doing this), but rather concern for causing prejudice
to the accused, presumably because a mistrial would lead to a new trial.  This
reason cannot justify rendering a verdict on the basis of a trial that is not
fair, be it a conviction or an acquittal.  A proper remedy in the event a fair
trial cannot be held within a reasonable delay is a stay of proceedings.

 

                   Nor is the fact
that the trial judge gave reasons referring to the evidence sufficient to allay
the concern as to the fairness of the trial.  The value of the reasons is dependent
upon the grasp their author has of the evidence and the assessment he can make
of it.  The judge's comments imply that the deficiency in this respect was such
that he would have declared a mistrial but for the prejudice this would cause
the accused.  This indicates that he was aware that the basis for his decision
was flawed though he misapprehended the proper remedy.

 

                   The difficulty
which was encountered by the trial judge, which related to the adequacy of the
trial as a process, is very different from the requirement of a properly
motivated judgment which was at issue in R. v. Morin, [1992] 3 S.C.R.
286, to which Major J. makes reference.  In that case, the question which
this Court was considering was whether the failure of a trial judge to make reference
to each piece of the evidence in the course of giving reasons, among other
things, constituted an error of law.  Sopinka J. concluded at p. 296 that:

 

A
trial judge must consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue
but unless the reasons demonstrate that this was not done, the failure
to record the fact of it having been done is not a proper basis for concluding
that there was error in law in this respect.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Even though a trial judge need not
make reference to all the evidence before him in the course of giving reasons
for judgment, the reasons may yet demonstrate that there were significant
inadequacies in the fact-finding process which justify the declaration of a
mistrial.  While the trial judge did give reasons for his conclusions in this
case, his comments indicate that he did not consider that the process of fact
gathering had provided him with an adequate basis for a due consideration of
the evidence.  I am, with respect, unable to share the conclusion of Major J.
that the trial judge did not indicate in giving his trial verdict his reason
why he had considered declaring a mistrial, and that there is no reason to
conclude that he was not able to appreciate the evidence.

 

                   The comments of the
trial judge are particularly significant given the nature of the evidence in
this case.  Apart from the complexity of the factual record, there were a
number of issues of credibility which were raised on the evidence.  An
opportunity to make reference to and consider the totality of the evidence is
an important part of any process of the assessment of evidence, and
particularly credibility.

 

                   The circumstances
of this case are different from those which demand an investigation of the
sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence.  The issue here is not limited to
whether the decision of the trial judge was within the scope of conclusions
which the evidence allowed or mandated.  Rather, the propriety of the
conclusions of the trial judge is closely connected to the question of whether
there was a proper consideration of the evidence in the first place.  The facts
in this case were such that the evidence upon which both the convictions and
the acquittals were based was to a significant degree the same.  It was
correctly noted in the Court of Appeal that the evidence regarding the various
counts was interwoven and interdependent, with the result that conclusions
based on part of the evidence cannot be isolated from inadequacies in the
fact-finding process as a whole.  There was a variety of testimony and evidence
which was necessarily subject to an assessment regarding credibility.  In these
circumstances, the presence of a statement by the trial judge that the
fact-finding process was inadequate is sufficient grounds for a declaration of
a mistrial.

 

                   In these
circumstances, it was appropriate to send the entire matter, including the
counts for which an acquittal was entered, back to trial.  While the fairness
and integrity of the trial process, including the fact-finding process, is a
matter of law of concern to both trial and appellate courts, the proper place
for the trial is before a trial judge and not in the Court of Appeal.

 

Conclusion

 

                   In view of the
statements made by the trial judge, the Court of Appeal correctly understood
the position of the trial judge at the time of the consideration of the nonsuit
motion and when rendering a verdict.  The statements of the trial judge
demonstrate not only an inadequacy in the basis for his consideration of the
evidence, but also that such an inadequacy was recognized at trial, despite the
fact that it was improperly addressed.  The importance which was accorded to
the statements of the trial judge is consistent with the decision of this Court
in Morin, supra, for statements such as that of the trial judge
may evidence an inability to consider all of the evidence in relation to the
ultimate issue.  Such a failure cannot be remedied by the provision of a reasoned
decision.

 

                   There is,
therefore, no reason in this case to interfere with the disposition of the
Court of Appeal that the acquittals should be set aside and a new trial ordered
in respect of those counts for which acquittals were entered, and I would
accordingly dismiss the appeal.

                   The appellant and
her common law husband were charged with aggravated assault of, and failure to
provide necessaries of life to, their infant son.  The infant, then aged eleven
weeks, had been brought to hospital, where he was found to have sustained a
number of serious injuries which had caused permanent damage.  The injuries had
been sustained over a period of time, estimated by physicians to be four
weeks.  The appellant gave exculpatory statements concerning her child's
condition to police and other authorities which were inconsistent with the
medical evidence at trial.  She did not testify at trial.  Her common law
husband did testify, denying any involvement in causing the injuries to the
child, and claiming that the appellant was the child's primary caregiver.  His
counsel obtained permission to comment on the appellant's failure to testify. 
In his charge to the jury, the trial judge remarked that the appropriate test
to be applied to the charge of failure to provide necessaries was an objective
one, and that the jury should convict if they were of the view that the parent
""knew, or ought to have known, the seriousness of the child's con­dition
and that it required medical attention"".  After the jury had retired, they
returned to ask ""Do we have to agree on guilty or not guilty?""  The
trial judge answered that they had to be ""unanimous one way or the
other"".  The jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts for both
accused.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appellant's appeal from her conviction
on the count of failure to provide necessaries and ordered a new trial on that
count, on the basis that lack of subjective knowledge or honest belief (whether
reasonable or not) were sufficient to negate the mens rea for the
offence.  The court also found that the comment by counsel for the co‑accused
on the appellant's failure to testify was not prohibited by s. 4(6)  of the
Canada Evidence Act , by the common law or by s. 11 (c) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and the majority of the court found
there was no error in the charge to the jury.  The appellant appealed the
ruling with respect to comment by counsel for a co‑accused and with
respect to the charge to the jury.  The Crown cross‑appealed the Court of
Appeal's ruling with respect to the mens rea for failure to provide
necessaries.

 

                   Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé and Gonthier
JJ. dissenting in part):  The appeal and cross‑appeal should be
allowed.  The appellant's convictions on both counts should be set aside and a
new trial ordered on each count.

 

(1) Mens Rea for Failure to Provide
Necessaries

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier,
Cory and McLachlin JJ.:  Lamer C.J.'s reasons were agreed with
respecting the mens rea for s. 215 , except his adoption of the
objective test for penal negligence discussed in R. v. Gosset.  For the
reasons given in R. v. Creighton, in determining what the accused
""ought to have known"", the trier of fact must determine the conduct
of the reasonable person when engaging in the particular activity of the
accused in the specific circumstances that prevailed.  These circumstances do
not include the personal characteristics of the accused, short of
characteristics which deprived her of the capacity to appreciate the risk. 
Youth, inexperience, and lack of education were not suggested on the evidence
to deprive the accused of the capacity to appreciate the risk associated with
neglecting her child.  Therefore, she must be held to the standard of the reasonably
prudent person.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka,
Iacobucci and Major JJ.:      While there is no language in s. 215 
such as ""ought to have known"" indicating that Parliament intended an
objective standard of fault, the reference to the failure to perform a ""duty""
suggests that the accused's conduct in a particular circumstance is to be
determined on an objective, or community, standard.  The concept of a duty
indicates a societal minimum which has been established for conduct:  as in the
law of civil negligence, a duty would be meaningless if every individual
defined its content for him or herself according to his or her subjective
beliefs and priorities.  The policy goals of the provision support this
interpretation.  Section 215  is aimed at establishing a uniform minimum
level of care to be provided for those to whom it applies, and this can only be
achieved if those under the duty are held to a societal, rather than a
personal, standard of conduct.

 

                   Section 215(2)(a)(ii)
makes the failure to fulfil the duty to provide necessaries an offence where
""the failure to perform the duty endangers the life of the person to whom
the duty is owed, or causes or is likely to cause the health of that person to
be endangered permanently"".  It thus punishes a marked departure from the
conduct of a reasonably prudent parent in circumstances where it was
objectively foreseeable that the failure to provide the necessaries of life
would lead to a risk of danger to the life, or a risk of permanent endangerment
to the health, of the child.  The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt
both that the circumstances listed in subs. (2)(a)(ii) were
objectively foreseeable in the circumstances, and that the conduct of the
accused represented a marked departure from the standard of care required by
those circumstances.  This objective basis of criminal liability does not per
se violate the Charter .  Nor does a conviction under s. 215 
carry with it such social stigma and such a severe penalty that a conviction
based on penal negligence would violate s. 7  of the Charter .  While
a conviction under s. 215(2) (a)(ii) will no doubt result in the
stigmatization, or even vilification, of the accused, this stigmatization is
neither unfairly disproportionate nor unrelated to the culpable conduct of which
the accused was found guilty.  The lack of a minimum penalty means that the
sentencing judge can tailor the sentence to the circumstances of the particular
offence and offender, eliminating the danger of the accused being punished to a
degree out of proportion to the level of fault actually found to exist.  The
availability of a defence of lawful excuse in s. 215(2)  also serves to
prevent the punishment of the morally innocent, even where the accused fails to
meet the standard of care imposed by the objective test of penal negligence.

 

(2) Charge to the Jury

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  Answers to questions
from the jury are extremely important, and carry influence far exceeding
instructions given in the main charge.  If the jury asks a question about an
issue addressed in the main charge, it is clear that they did not understand or
remember that part of the main charge, and it is also clear that they must
exclusively rely on the answer given by the trial judge to resolve any
confusion or debate on the point which may have taken place in the jury room
during their deliberations up to that point.  The trial judge's answer to the
jury's question in this case, which gave the jury the impression that they had
no right to disagree, superseded the initial instruction in the minds of the
jury.  Accordingly, it is possible, if not likely, that the jury members
resumed their deliberations with the mistaken impression that they were
required to reach a verdict, and that they had misunderstood the earlier
reference to their right to disagree.  Given this error, a new trial must be
ordered on both counts.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé and
Gonthier JJ. (dissenting on this issue):  The trial judge's charge to the jury
contained no error.  There is no suggestion that the response to the jury's
query failed to satisfy their concerns or that it raised further doubts as to
the previous instructions.  The charge must be read as a whole.  Here the trial
judge had already made it clear to the jury in his initial instructions that
they had the right to disagree, and an appellate court should assume that such
instructions are understood.  The question as formulated by the jury shows that
the members were not under any misapprehension about their ability to disagree,
but rather that they were uncertain as to whether or not they needed to be
unanimous in reaching a verdict.  To that specific interrogation, the trial
judge gave a full, careful and correct response.  There is no further
obligation to provide answers to questions that are not asked.  Moreover, any
doubt was completely laid to rest by the fact that the jurors were individually
polled at the request of counsel for the appellant.  The principal appeal
should be dismissed, the cross-appeal allowed and the conviction restored.

 

(3) Comment by Counsel for
Co-Accused on Accused's Failure to Testify

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  It is not necessary to
address the issue relating to comment by counsel for a co-accused since a new
trial is to be held given the disposition regarding the charge to the jury.

 

                   Per L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ.: 
There is no rule of law prohibiting such comment, which is permitted as part
and parcel of the right of an accused to make full answer and defence.

I.Facts

 

                   In 1987, Christine
Naglik (to whom I shall refer as ""Naglik"", as she is both appellant
and respondent before this Court) and her common law husband, Peter Geoffrey
Pople, were charged with the aggravated assault of, and failure to provide
necessaries of life to, their infant son Peter Naglik.  The Crown proceeded by
indictment.  The evidence established that Peter Naglik, then aged 11 weeks,
was brought to hospital where he was found to have sustained a number of
serious injuries (including a broken collarbone, fractured ribs in at least 15
places, a fractured vertebra, two separate skull fractures, and haemorrhaging
of the brain and the retina) which had caused permanent damage.  The injuries
had been sustained over a period of time, estimated by physicians to be four
weeks.  Naglik gave exculpatory statements concerning her child's condition to police
and other authorities which were inconsistent with the medical evidence at
trial.  At trial before a judge and jury, Naglik did not testify.  Pople did
testify, denying any involvement in causing the injuries to the child, and
claiming that Naglik was the child's primary caregiver.

 

                   Pople's counsel
sought, and obtained, permission to comment on the failure of Naglik to
testify.  The trial judge allowed the comment, warning counsel that it had
""better be within the bounds of propriety"".  In his address, Pople's
counsel stated, in part:

 

The
evidence shows that it must have been at least one of them.  Now, he has sworn
before you that it wasn't him.  Your eyes turn to the other and she does not
get up and deny it.  Her counsel makes an effort to put it on Peter Pople, to
accuse him conjecturally, but she doesn't get up or explain anything or accuse
anyone.

 

In response, Naglik's counsel
explained s. 11 (c) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
and pointed out that she had made exculpatory statements to various persons in
authority at the first opportunity, unlike Pople.  Naglik's counsel also moved
for a mistrial because of the comment, but the motion was denied.

 

                   In his charge to
the jury, the trial judge remarked that, under s. 215  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly s. 197 ), the appropri­ate test to be applied
was an objective one, and that the jury should convict if they were of the view
that the parent ""knew, or ought to have known, the seriousness of the
child's con­dition and that it required medical attention"".

 

                   With respect to the
need for a unanimous verdict, the trial judge initially charged the jury as
follows:

 

In
other words, each and all of you must agree on each verdict that you see fit to
return with respect to each accused.  It is your right to disagree but I know
you will do your best to come to an agreement.  This trial has involved
considerable time and expense and there have been the lives of people, your
lives, the lives of witnesses, have been disrupted and I am certain that no
other jury can deal with this matter better than you.

 

                   The jury retired at
3:08 p.m.  They returned to ask a question at 3:35 p.m., which the trial judge
answered, and then again at 4:35 p.m., when they asked ""Do we have to
agree on guilty or not guilty?""  The trial judge answered this question as
follows:

 

Your
question is ""do we have to agree on guilty or not guilty"".  Well, the
12 of you have to agree on a verdict of guilty or not guilty with respect to
count one and with respect to each accused.  In other words, you must be
unanimous one way or the other with respect to each accused and with respect to
each count.  Is that confusing?  

 

In
other words, you have to look at count one and you have to consider the
evidence with respect to each accused and bring in your verdict one way or the
other.  The 12 of you have to come to a decision one way or the other.

 

                   The jury returned
verdicts of guilty on both counts for both Naglik and Pople at 8:08 p.m., and
was polled at the request of defence counsel.  Both were sentenced to four and
one-half years on the first count (aggravated assault) and two years on the
second count (failure to provide necessaries), to be served concurrently.

 

                   The Ontario Court
of Appeal allowed Naglik's appeal from her conviction on the second count
(failure to provide necessaries), set aside the conviction, and ordered a new
trial on that count:  (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 385, 65 C.C.C. (3d) 272, 46 O.A.C.
81.

 

                   Naglik has appealed
the Court of Appeal's ruling with respect to comment by counsel for a
co-accused by leave, and with respect to the charge to the jury as of right
(based on a dissent by Morden A.C.J.O.).  The Attorney General for Ontario has
cross-appealed the Court of Appeal's ruling with respect to the mens rea
for s. 215  by leave.

III.               Judgments Below

 

Court of Appeal (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 385

 

A.  Morden
A.C.J.O. (dissenting in part)

 

                   (1) Comment by
Co-Accused:  Morden A.C.J.O. first dealt with the comment by counsel for
the co-accused on Naglik's failure to testify.  He noted that the comment was
not prohibited by the terms of s. 4(6)  of the Canada Evidence Act , and
was not prohibited by the common law, citing R. v. Wickham; R. v.
Ferrara; R. v. Bean (1971), 55 Cr. App. R. 199  (C.A.).

 

                   Turning to s. 11 (c)
of the Charter , Morden A.C.J.O. noted that Naglik relied on the decision
of Wisdom J. in the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, in De
Luna v. United States, 308 F.2d 140 (1962).  In De Luna, the
majority of the court held that the Fifth Amendment and federal statutes
protected the accused from any form of compulsion to testify, even if
that compulsion arose from tactical considerations such as the risk of adverse
comment or the existence of ""harmful presumptions (and inferences) based
on assertion of the right [to silence]"" (p. 151).  Wisdom J. thus held
that the trial judge's implicit participation in allowing counsel for a
co-accused to comment on the accused's failure to testify violated the Fifth
Amendment.  Morden A.C.J.O. rejected De Luna as persuasive in Canada,
because of the decision of Cory J.A. (as he then was) in the Ontario Court of
Appeal in R. v. Boss (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 523, that
""tactical"", as opposed to ""legal"" compulsion to testify was
not prohibited by s. 11 (c).  This holding was in turn based on the
decision of this Court in Vézeau v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277,
holding that it is open to a jury to draw an adverse inference from the
accused's decision not to testify.  Morden A.C.J.O. also noted that the
applicable U.S. federal statute prohibited any presumption based on the
accused's failure to testify, and that after Vézeau the Canadian
position was the opposite.  He also cited the decision of the Newfoundland
Court of Appeal in R. v. Cuff (1989), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 65, in which that
court followed Boss.

 

                   Morden A.C.J.O.
concluded his reasons on this ground by warning that counsel for a co-accused
did not have ""free rein"" in making comments on the accused's failure
to testify, and would not be allowed to ""encourage the jury to speculate
or draw unwarranted inferences"" (p. 397).

 

                   (2) Instruction
to the Jury:  Morden A.C.J.O. was of the opinion that, however clear the
initial charge had been on the jury's right to disagree and the requirement of
unanimity, the jury's question indicated that they were confused about these
points.  He argued that if the jury truly understood that they had a right to
disagree, they would not have needed to ask the question.  Furthermore, the
answer given by the trial judge went beyond reiterating the need for unanimity
to emphasize the obligation to bring in a verdict ""one way or the
other"".  Citing Cory J.'s remarks in R. v. W.(D), [1991] 1 S.C.R.
742, to the effect that answers to questions from the jury will be more closely
scrutinized, Morden A.C.J.O. would have ordered a new trial on this ground.

 

                   (3) Definition
of ""Necessaries"":  Naglik claimed that the trial judge gave the
word ""necessaries"" a wider definition than the matters referred to in
the indictment.  Morden A.C.J.O. concluded that any deficiencies in the trial
judge's original charge were fully clarified in his recharge.  This holding is
not a ground of appeal in this Court.

 

                   (4) Mens Rea
Under s. 215:  On the question of the intent required for the failure to
provide necessaries of life charge, Morden A.C.J.O. held, at pp. 402-3, that
""as a matter of authoritative precedent, this ground of appeal should
succeed"":

 

In
other words, the offence in question requires actual knowledge of (which would
include wilful blindness with respect to) the circumstances which make the
failure to perform the duty to provide necessaries an offence.  It is an
offence which may be committed intentionally or recklessly.  It is not an
offence of mere negligence, where an honest belief in circumstances which do
not require the performance of the duty must be based on reasonable grounds.

 

He then examined the relevant
authorities:  R. v. Lewis (1903), 7 C.C.C. 261 (Ont. C.A.); R. v.
Steele (1952), 102 C.C.C. 273 (Ont. C.A.); and R. v. Atikian (1990),
62 C.C.C. (3d) 357 (Ont. C.A.).  Morden A.C.J.O. stated that these authorities
made it clear that lack of subjective knowledge, or honest belief (whether
reasonable or not) were sufficient to negate the mens rea for the
offence.  However, he also acknowledged weaknesses in the precedential force of
Lewis, and that the appellant and respondent in Atikian took the
common position that the mens rea for the offence was subjective, so
that the point was accepted by the court without argument.

 

                   (5) Reverse Onus
of s. 215(2):  Because Naglik took the position that her lawful excuse was
a lack of subjective awareness, a matter in which Morden A.C.J.O. held the Crown
bore the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, he did not consider this
ground of appeal further.

 

                   Given his
conclusions on the second ground (the charge to the jury) and fourth ground (mens
rea under s. 215), Morden A.C.J.O. would have allowed the appeal, set aside
the convictions and ordered a new trial on both counts.

 

B.                Galligan
J.A. (McKinlay J.A. concurring)

 

                   Galligan J.A.
agreed with Morden A.C.J.O. in his disposition of all but the second ground of
appeal (the charge to the jury).  He noted that the correct instruction was
""almost the last thing which the jury heard before retiring to
deliberate"" (p. 406), and was of the view that the question related only
to the need for unanimity in reaching a verdict, to which the trial judge gave
a proper answer, and not to the right of jurors to disagree.  Therefore,
Galligan J.A. was of the view that there was no error in the trial judge's
charge to the jury.

 

                   Because he agreed
with Morden A.C.J.O. with respect to the test under s. 215, Galligan J.A.
allowed the appeal and directed a new trial with respect to the conviction on
count 2 (failure to provide necessaries), but dismissed the appeal from the
conviction on count 1 (aggravated assault). 

 

IV.              Issues

 

                   Grounds of appeal
(1) and (2) were raised in Naglik's appeal; (1) by leave and (2) as of right. 
Ground (3) was raised in the Attorney General for Ontario's cross-appeal by
leave.

 

(1)(a)
Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in failing to hold that the
trial judge erred in law in permitting counsel for the co-accused, Peter
Geoffrey Pople, to comment in his address to the jury on the appellant's
failure to testify on her own behalf?

 

(b)
Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in failing to hold that such
comment amounted to a breach of the protection afforded to the appellant by ss.
7 , 11 (c) and 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  in that ""she not be compelled to be a witness in proceedings
against her in respect of the offence""?

 

(2)Did
the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that the
learned trial judge did not err in instructing the jury in such a way that left
no room for them to disagree?

 

(3)Did
the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in concluding that the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury that on a charge of failing to provide the necessaries of
life, the test for determining whether the respondent breached her duty to
provide necessaries was to a reasonable person or objective standard?

 

                   If so, on the issue
of the constitutionality of an objective basis of liability for s. 215, I
stated the following constitutional questions by order dated May 1, 1992:

 

1.Does
an objective basis of liability for s. 215  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada offend s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is yes, is an objective basis of liability for s. 215 
a reasonable limit on the s. 7  Charter  right pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

V. Analysis

 

A. Comment by Counsel for
Co-Accused

 

                   Given my
disposition of the ground of appeal relating to the charge to the jury, a new
trial must be held on both counts, and it is not necessary to address the issue
relating to comment by counsel for a co-accused on the accused's failure to
testify.  As Pople has not appealed his conviction, there will be no
opportunity for comment by counsel for a co-accused at Naglik's new trial, and
the issue will not arise.  This question should be examined having regard to
the constitutionality of s. 4(6)  of the Canada Evidence Act .  While s.
4(6) of the Canada Evidence Act  may well be open to Charter 
challenge, in so far as it prevents the trial judge from granting a remedy
under s. 24(1)  in the form of a remedial comment or instruction where something
has occurred which affects the fairness of the trial, there was no challenge to
the constitutionality of this aspect of s. 4(6)  in this case.  Therefore, I
will deal only with the charge to the jury, and the constitutionality of objective
liability for s. 215 .  The latter issue must be decided in this appeal because
it will clearly be an important part of the trial judge's charge to the jury in
the new trial.

 

B. Charge to the Jury

 

                   The common problem
raised by the facts of this case is an alleged conflict between an initial
instruction and a later instruction in response to a question from the jury. 
While this Court has stressed the importance of examining charges to the jury
as a whole, rather than scrutinizing impugned passages in isolation, I think
that it is also important to recognize the oftentimes particular effect of
instructions which are given in response to a question from the jury.

 

                   It must first be
decided whether there was in fact a conflict between the initial charge and the
recharge.  No one takes issue with the initial charge, which was generous to
Naglik in stating the jury's right to disagree, but nevertheless urged the jury
to reach a verdict, which had to be unanimous.  The Attorney General for
Ontario submits that the jury's later question (""Do we have to agree on
guilty or not guilty?"") indicated not ""Do we have to reach a
verdict?"", but rather ""Does the verdict we reach have to be
unanimous?""  Thus, the Attorney General for Ontario submits that there was
no inconsistency between the initial charge and the answer to the question,
since it did not address the right to disagree, but only the requirement of
unanimity.

 

                   Like Morden
A.C.J.O., I do not interpret the question and the trial judge's answer so
benignly.  The jury asked, primarily, ""do we have to agree?"", and
then enumerated the two possible verdicts which had been left to them.  I would
agree with Morden A.C.J.O. that ""if the jury clearly understood that they
had the right to disagree, and hence not to return a verdict, they would not
have needed to ask the question"" (p. 399).  If the jury wondered whether a
majority vote would be sufficient for a verdict, this reveals that there was
disagreement, and that they were having difficulty reaching a unanimous
verdict.  Therefore, I would conclude that the question from the jury concerned
their right to disagree, and that the answer given by the trial judge was
clearly within the terms of Latour v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 19, in
which Fauteux J. (as he then was) commented (at p. 30):  ""If one of the
jurors could have reasonably understood from this direction -- and it may be
open to such construction -- that there was an obligation to agree upon a
verdict, the direction would be bad in law.""

 

                   Given this
conflict, the further question arises as to whether the instructions the jury
received, as a whole (i.e., including the incorrect answer to the
question), were in error.  Did the initial correct instruction save the later
incorrect instruction?

 

                   Morden A.C.J.O.
relied upon W.(D.), supra, in which Cory J. noted a difference between
instructions given in the main charge and instructions given in response to
questions from the jury (at pp. 759-60):  ""When a jury submits a question,
it gives a clear indication of the problem the jury is having with a case. 
Those questions merit a full, careful and correct response.""  Answers to
questions from the jury are extremely important, and carry influence far
exceeding instructions given in the main charge.  If the jury asks a question
about an issue addressed in the main charge, it is clear that they did not
understand or remember that part of the main charge, and it is also clear that
they must exclusively rely on the answer given by the trial judge to resolve
any confusion or debate on the point which may have taken place in the jury
room during their deliberations up to that point.

 

                   The trial judge's
answer to the jury's question, which gave the jury the impression that they had
no right to disagree, superseded the initial instruction in the minds of the
jury.  Accordingly, it is possible, if not likely, that the jury members
resumed their deliberations with the mistaken impression that they were
required to reach a verdict, and that they had misunderstood the earlier
reference to their right to disagree.  Given this error, a new trial must be
ordered on both counts.

 

C. Mens Rea for Section 215

 

                   Unlike the first
ground of appeal, this issue must be resolved, since it will be a crucial
element of the judge's charge to the jury in Naglik's new trial.  Before
answering the constitutional questions, it is necessary to decide whether s.
215(2)(a)(ii) enacts an offence for which Parliament has indicated that
objective fault is appropriate, or whether Parliament has enacted an offence
for which subjective fault must be proven.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
decided this case on the basis of what it considered to be binding precedents (Lewis,
Steele and Atikian) holding that subjective fault was required
under s. 215 .  However, as noted above, Morden A.C.J.O. admitted that the
precedential force of these prior decisions is less than compelling; indeed,
the precise issue was never clearly addressed or decided in Lewis or Steele,
and the point was conceded by the Crown in Atikian.  A subjective
standard of fault for s. 215  has also found support in provincial court
decisions.

 

                   In R. v. Leveque,
[1992] 5 W.W.R. 391 (Man. Prov. Ct.), the Provincial Court judge relied on the
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in this appeal, and the decision in R.
v. Degg (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 387 (Ont. Prov. Ct.), to hold that s. 215 
was not what he termed an ""absolute liability"" offence but rather
required the Crown to ""prove mens rea . . . beyond a reasonable
doubt.""  The learned judge also cited Wilson J.'s reasons in R. v.
Tutton, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392 (which did not represent the views of a
majority of this Court, as the Court was divided on this issue 3:3), and
referred to R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, as authority for
the proposition that ""proof of mens rea [is] a constitutionally mandated
element of every criminal offence"".  I think it is clear that the ratio
of Vaillancourt was not that proof of subjective mens rea
is required for all criminal offences, which is the import of the Provincial
Court judge's reasoning in Leveque.  Furthermore, as I discuss below,
subsequent decisions of this Court have made it clear that an objective basis
of liability for criminal offences can be constitutionally sufficient.

 

                   In Degg, the
Provincial Court judge cited Lewis and Steele to hold that the
wording of s. 215  did not evidence a sufficiently clear Parliamentary intention
to enact an offence of what he termed ""strict liability"".

 

                   Because of their
limitations, I do not consider any of these decisions persuasive, but would
consider the basis of liability under s. 215  afresh and on first principles. 
With respect to the wording of s. 215 , while there is no language in s. 215 
such as ""ought to have known"" indicating that Parliament intended an
objective standard of fault, the language of s. 215  referring to the failure to
perform a ""duty"" suggests that the accused's conduct in a particular
circumstance is to be determined on an objective, or community, standard.  The
concept of a duty indicates a societal minimum which has been established for
conduct:  as in the law of civil negligence, a duty would be meaningless if
every individual defined its content for him or herself according to his or her
subjective beliefs and priorities.  Therefore, the conduct of the accused
should be measured against an objective, societal standard to give effect to
the concept of ""duty"" employed by Parliament.

 

                   The policy goals of
the provision support this interpretation.  Section 215  is aimed at
establishing a uniform minimum level of care to be provided for those to
whom it applies, and this can only be achieved if those under the duty are held
to a societal, rather than a personal, standard of conduct.  While the section
does not purport to prescribe parenting or care-giving techniques, it does
serve to set the floor for the provision of necessaries, at the level indicated
by, for example, the circumstances described in subs. (2)(a)(ii).  The
effects of a negligent failure to perform the duty will be as serious as an
intentional refusal to perform the duty.     

 

                   Since s. 215 enacts
an offence for which objective fault is appropriate to sustain a conviction, it
remains to be considered what the nature of that objective liability is, and,
under the terms of the constitutional questions, whether that standard of
liability offends s. 7  of the Charter  in such a way that it may not be
saved by resort to s. 1 .

 

                   In R. v. Gosset,
[1993] 3. S.C.R. 76 (judgment rendered concurrently), I discuss the nature of
objective liability in the criminal law, which I term ""penal
negligence.""  Briefly, Gosset establishes that penal negligence
punishes a marked departure from an objectively reasonable standard of
care, in accord with Cory J.'s reasons in R. v. Hundal, [1993] 1 S.C.R.
867.  However, I also make it clear in Gosset that the reasonableness of
the accused's conduct is not to be assessed in the abstract, but with reference
to the circumstances of the accused and the offence, to avoid punishing the
morally innocent who could not have acted other than they did in the
circumstances; specifically, in Gosset I summarize the operation of
penal negligence as follows, at pp. 95-96:

 

                   Once
a marked departure from the standard of care is established, the focus of the
investigation under penal negligence must shift, therefore, to the question of
whether the accused was capable of recognizing that he or she had fallen short
of the standard of care required in the circumstances by the charging section.

 

Another crucial consideration would be
whether it was possible for Naglik to control or compensate for her
incapacities in the circumstances.  For example, the evidence indicates that
the services of a Public Health Nurse were made available to Naglik to help her
with the adjustment to caring for the child, given her age, education and lack
of experience with children.  Naglik apparently resisted these attempts to
assist her with the care of the baby.  Furthermore, s. 215(2)(a)(ii)
covers a failure to provide necessaries in an ongoing relationship and over a
period of time, as well as the failure to perform a specific act as part of a
discrete transaction, suggesting that the nature of the failure alleged by the
Crown would also affect the jury's assessment of Naglik's actions.  The test
for penal negligence outlined in Gosset will direct the trier of fact's
attention to all of these considerations.

 

                   What parts of the
offence must be objectively foreseeable?  In this appeal, Naglik was charged
under ss. 197(2)(a)(ii) and 197(3) (now ss. 215(2)(a)(ii) and
215(3)) of the Criminal Code , which make the failure to fulfil the duty
to provide necessaries an offence where ""the failure to perform the duty
endangers the life of the person to whom the duty is owed, or causes or is
likely to cause the health of that person to be endangered permanently"". 
I would hold that s. 215(2) (a)(ii) punishes a marked departure from the
conduct of a reasonably prudent parent in circumstances where it was
objectively foreseeable that the failure to provide the necessaries of life
would lead to a risk of danger to the life, or a risk of permanent endangerment
to the health, of the child.  This is not one of the few offences, described in
R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3 (judgment rendered concurrently), in
which the nature of an underlying act, unlawful in itself, is so risky that it
is presumed to involve objective foresight of the risk of the consequences
which follow and which give rise to a separate offence.  The circumstances
described in subs. (2)(a)(ii) are not just aggravating consequences, but
are essential elements of the actus reus of the offence.  Thus, the
Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt both that the circumstances listed
in subs. (2)(a)(ii) were objectively foreseeable in the circumstances,
and that the conduct of the accused represented a marked departure from the
standard of care required by those circumstances.

 

                   As this Court's
decisions in Hundal and in R. v. DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944,
made clear, this objective basis of criminal liability does not, per se,
violate the Charter .  That is, there is no principle of fundamental
justice requiring subjective foresight for criminal offences.  In Hundal,
Cory J. wrote (at p. 882):  ""In the appropriate context, negligence can be
an acceptable basis of liability which meets the fault requirement of s. 7  of
the Charter .""

 

                   However, it remains
to be decided whether a conviction under s. 215 carries with it such social
stigma and such a severe penalty that a conviction based on penal negligence
would violate s. 7  of the Charter , under the test developed in Vaillancourt. 
I do not think that it does.

 

                   While the conduct
proscribed by s. 215(2)(a)(ii) is undoubtedly serious, involving as it
does a breach of a parent's duty to his or her child, this is not a situation
as existed in the case of constructive murder, under which an accused who had
no subjective foresight of the risk of death was nevertheless branded with the
stigma attendant on a conviction for murder.  While a conviction under s.
215(2)(a)(ii) will no doubt result in the stigmatization, or even, as
Naglik submitted, vilification, of the accused, this stigmatization is neither
unfairly disproportionate nor unrelated to the culpable conduct of which the
accused was found guilty.  Where a person is convicted of an offence under s.
215(2)(a)(ii) only, the stigma which attaches to the conviction is only
that described by the offence:  if an objective standard is accepted, the
accused is stigmatized as someone who failed to provide for his or her child in
circumstances where the reasonably prudent parent clearly would have so
provided.

 

                   There is no minimum
penalty for this hybrid offence, and a maximum prison term of two years if the
Crown proceeds successfully by indictment.  The lack of a minimum penalty means
that the sentencing judge can tailor the sentence to the circumstances of the
particular offence and offender, eliminating the danger of the accused being
punished to a degree out of proportion to the level of fault actually found to
exist.

 

                   The availability of
a defence of lawful excuse in s. 215(2) also serves to prevent the punishment
of the morally innocent, even where the accused fails to meet the standard of
care imposed by the objective test of penal negligence.

 

                   Because of my
conclusion that no violation of the Charter  is indicated, it is not
necessary to answer the second constitutional question.

 

                   Also, because I
would order a new trial on the second ground of appeal (relating to the charge
to the jury), it is not necessary to examine the trial judge's charge to the
jury for conformity to the objective test for penal negligence I have set out
above.  At Naglik's new trial, the trial judge must charge the jury on this
objective basis of liability, with specific reference to Naglik's particular
personal capacities and the circumstances of the offence relevant to the
charges on which that trial proceeds.

 

                   Finally, Naglik
also argued that the requirement in s. 215(2) that the accused prove the
presence of a lawful excuse for his or her failure to provide necessaries
violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  However, no constitutional
question was stated in this respect, so that the provincial attorneys general
have not had an opportunity to intervene on this issue.  Furthermore, I would
be reluctant to decide the issue in this appeal, as there is no allegation in
the record that Naglik in fact had or alleged that she had a lawful excuse
other than her lack of subjective awareness.  Under the penal negligence
standard, this is not a lawful excuse, and as I have discussed above, her
youth, experience, education, and the circumstances of the offence will be
fully accounted for, in so far as they are determined to be relevant. 
Accordingly, I express no opinion on the constitutionality of the reverse onus
aspect of s. 215(2) .

 

VI.              Disposition

 

                   I would therefore
allow Naglik's appeal as of right on the second ground of appeal, set aside the
convictions on both counts, and order a new trial on each of these counts.

 

                   I would also allow
the Attorney General for Ontario's cross-appeal and answer the constitutional
questions as follows:

 

1.Does
an objective basis of liability for s. 215  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada offend s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.No.

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is yes, is an objective basis of liability for s. 215 
a reasonable limit on the s. 7  Charter  right pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

A.It
is not necessary to answer this question.

 

 

The
judgment of La Forest, Cory and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. -- This appeal raises
constitutional issues in the context of a trial where both parents of an infant
were charged with bringing about permanent injuries against their own child. 
In 1987, Christine Naglik (the appellant and respondent on cross-appeal) and
her common law husband, Peter Geoffrey Pople, were charged with aggravated
assault of, and failure to provide necessaries of life to, their infant son,
Peter.  The facts and judgments below are set out by the Chief Justice.  

 

                   The appeal and
cross-appeal raise two constitutional issues.  The first is the scope of the
right to not testify in a proceeding against oneself as provided for in the Canada
Evidence Act , and guaranteed under s. 11 (c) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Section 4(6)  of the Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 , provides:

                   

                          4. ...

 

                   (6)
The failure of the person charged, or of the wife or husband of that person, to
testify shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge or by counsel for
the prosecution.

 

The second constitutional issue,
raised by cross-appeal, is the validity of s. 215  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,  under s. 7  of the Charter .  Section 215  reads: 

 

                   215. (1) Every one is under a legal duty

 

(a)
as a parent, foster parent, guardian or head of a family, to provide
necessaries of life for a child under the age of sixteen years; 

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (2)   Every
one commits an offence who, being under a legal duty within the meaning of
subsection (1), fails without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies on him, to
perform that duty, if

 

(a)
with respect to a duty imposed by paragraph (1)(a) or (b),

 

                                                                    ...

 

(ii)
the failure to perform the duty endangers the life of the person to whom the
duty is owed, or causes or is likely to cause the health of that person to be
endangered permanently; 

 

                   On the first issue,
I agree with the Chief Justice.  

 

                   On the
cross-appeal, I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice, save for his
comments at pp. 000 and 000, which adopt his view of the objective test for
penal negligence discussed in R. v. Gosset, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 76, released
concurrently.  I respectfully disagree with the Chief Justice's conclusion that
when considering what the accused ""ought to have known"" under an
objective standard, one should have regard to Ms. Naglik's ""youth,
experience, [and] education"", as advocated by the Chief Justice at p. 000. 
For the reasons discussed in R. v Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3 (released
concurrently), it is my view that in determining what Ms. Naglik ""ought to
have known"", the trier of fact must determine the conduct of the
reasonable person when engaging in the particular activity of the accused in
the specific circumstances that prevailed.  These circumstances do not include
the personal characteristics of the accused, short of characteristics which
deprived her of the capacity to appreciate the risk.  Youth, inexperience, and
lack of education were not suggested on the evidence to deprive Ms. Naglik of
the capacity to appreciate the risk associated with neglecting her child. 
Therefore, she must be held to the standard of the reasonably prudent person.

 

                   I agree
with the Chief Justice that the appeal should be allowed, the convictions set
aside on both counts, and a new trial ordered.  I would allow the cross-appeal
and answer the constitutional questions as does the Chief Justice.

 

 

                   The
reasons of L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ. were delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting in part)
-- As my colleagues point out, this appeal raises constitutional issues in the
context of a criminal charge laid against Christine Naglik and her common law
husband of one count of aggravated assault and a second count of failure to
provide necessaries of life to their infant son, Peter.  Both were found guilty
after a trial before judge and jury.  The Ontario Court of Appeal allowed
Christine Naglik's appeal on the second count and ordered a new trial on that
count:  (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 385, 65 C.C.C. (3d) 272, 46 O.A.C. 81.  Christine
Naglik's appeal before us raises two issues and the Attorney General for
Ontario, in his cross‑appeal, raises the constitutionality of mens rea
under s. 215  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .

 

                   On that last issue,
I agree entirely with Justice McLachlin's reasons more fully set out in her
reasons in R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3, released concurrently, in
which I have concurred.  Consequently, I would allow the cross‑appeal.

 

                   On the issues
raised by the main appeal, I will first deal briefly with the question of
whether counsel for the co‑accused was entitled to comment on the failure
of the appellant to testify at trial, a question to which the Chief Justice, in
his reasons, has briefly alluded without further comment.

 

                   That question
arises our of s. 4(6)  of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C‑5 :

 

                   4.  . . .

 

                   (6)  The
failure of the person charged, or of the wife or husband of that person, to
testify shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge or by counsel for
the prosecution.

 

                   Since there was no
challenge to the constitutionality of s. 4(6) of the Act and given that
the majority orders a new trial, I will say only that, in my view, such comment
is permitted as part and parcel of the right of an accused to make full answer
and defence.  Whether one relies on the common law, the Canada Evidence Act 
or the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , there exists no rule of
law prohibiting such comment.  In particular, there is no unfairness if, like
here, a voir dire is held and the issue is fully aired before the trial
judge.

 

                   The second issue
raised by the appellant concerns one aspect of the judge's charge to the jury,
namely his response to the following question from the jury:  ""Do we have
to agree on guilty or not guilty?""  The trial judge answered:

 

Your
question is ""do we have to agree on guilty or not guilty"".  Well, the
12 of you have to agree on a verdict of guilty or not guilty with respect to
count one and with respect to each accused.  In other words, you must be
unanimous one way or the other with respect to each accused and with respect to
each count.  Is that confusing?

 

In
other words, you have to look at count one and you have to consider the
evidence with respect to each accused and bring in your verdict one way or the
other.  The 12 of you have to come to a decision one way or the other.

 

                   On that point, I
share the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the
trial judge's charge to the jury contained no error.

 

                   On the basis of
this Court's decision in Latour v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 19, and an
earlier decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, R. v. DeMarco (1973),
13 C.C.C. (2d) 369, Galligan J.A., for the majority of the Ontario Court of
Appeal, held (at p. 406 O.R.) that it is incumbent upon a trial judge to
instruct a jury:

 

(1)that
the jury must agree unanimously before it can return a verdict, and

 

(2)that
each juror has the right to disagree.

 

                   At the end of his
address just prior to the jury retiring to begin their deliberations, the trial
judge instructed the jury as follows:

 

Since
this is a criminal trial, you must be unanimous in your verdict.  In
other words, each and all of you must agree on each verdict that you see fit to
return with respect to each accused.  It is your right to disagree but I
know you will do your best to come to an agreement.  This trial has involved
considerable time and expense and there have been the lives of people, your
lives, the lives of witnesses, have been disrupted and I am certain that no
other jury can deal with this matter better than you.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   No objection was
taken by counsel to this aspect of the charge, and both the majority and the
minority of the Court of Appeal were in agreement that these instructions
represent an accurate statement of the law.  The jury subsequently returned
with the following question which I reproduce for ease of convenience: 
""Do we have to agree on guilty or not guilty?""  It is at this point
that the alleged error in the charge arose.  The trial judge answered as
follows:

 

THE
COURT: . . .  Well, the 12 of you have to agree on a verdict of
guilty or not guilty with respect to count one and with respect to each
accused.  In other words, you must be unanimous one way or the other with
respect to each accused and with respect to each court.  Is that confusing?

 

In
other words, you have to look at count one and you have to consider the
evidence with respect to each accused and bring in your verdict one way or the
other.  The 12 of you have to come to a decision one way or the other.  Okay. 
Any problems?

 

FOREMAN
OF THE JURY:  No.

 

                   As is evident from
the foreman's answer, there is no suggestion that the response to the jury's
query failed to satisfy their concerns or that it raised further doubts as to
the previous instructions.  Again, no objection was taken by counsel to those
directions of the trial judge.  As this Court has held on previous occasions,
it is crucial to have regard to the charge as a whole, and the recharge cannot
be read in isolation from the trial judge's earlier instructions. In Laforet
v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 869, an earlier case in which this Court
considered a recharge regarding the need for a unanimous verdict, Martland J.
held at pp. 878-79:

 

                   Another
ground of appeal raised on behalf of the appellant is that the recharge of the
trial judge on the question of a unanimous verdict could have caused a juror
reasonably to conclude that the jury did not have a right to disagree.

 

                   In
my opinion the trial judge's recharge as to unanimity cannot be said to have
that effect.  Considered in the context of the events which led up to this
recharge, and in light of the trial judge's comments in his initial charge, the
re‑instruction can be seen as no more than a request that the jury again
consider the issue as to whether or not they were unanimous in their verdict in
order to ensure that the verdict rendered was a true verdict in accordance with
their duty as jurors.  The trial judge had already made it clear to the
jury, in his initial comments to them, that they had the right to disagree. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

Here, the jury was clearly instructed
that it was entitled to disagree in the judge's initial instructions, and, as
the Court of Appeal rightly held, an appellate court should assume that such
instructions are understood.

 

                   The question as
formulated by the jury shows that the members of the jury were not under any
misapprehension about their ability to disagree, but rather that they were
uncertain as to whether or not they needed to be unanimous in reaching a
verdict.  To that specific interrogation, the trial judge gave a ""full,
careful and correct response"", as this Court has held is appropriate when
a question is asked by a jury (R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at
pp. 759‑60).

 

                   As the Court of
Appeal concluded, there is no further obligation to provide answers to
questions that were not asked.  This, in my view, settles this matter.

 

                   If, however, there
were any doubt, here, as to whether the verdict rendered represented the
verdict of each individual juror, it was completely laid to rest by the fact
that the jurors were individually polled at the request of counsel for the
appellant after the result had been announced by the foreman of the jury.

 

                   The charges in this
case are very serious and I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that
the accused had a fair trial and the conviction should stand.

 

                   In the result, I
would dismiss the principal appeal, allow the cross‑appeal and restore
the conviction on the second count.

                   The accused, a
police officer, responded to a call from a taxi driver complaining of a
customer who refused to pay his fare.  Suspecting that the 150 packs of
cigarettes in the taxi had come into the customer's possession illegally, and
as there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest, the officer arrested him
and took him to the police station.  When he opened the rear door of the car at
the station to let the suspect out, the latter attempted to flee.  The accused
chased after him, taking his gun out of its holster as he ran.  He yelled
""Stop or I'll shoot"", and then pointed the gun at the suspect with
his finger on the trigger.  A shot went off, fatally striking the suspect in
the head.  The accused was charged with manslaughter.  Under s. 222(5)(a)
of the Criminal Code , a person commits culpable homicide when he causes
the death of a human being by means of an unlawful act.  The Crown contended
that the accused's careless use of a firearm contrary to s. 86(2) 
constituted the unlawful act.  At trial the accused acknowledged that the gun
must have been cocked at the time he pointed it at the suspect.  He further
indicated that he never intended to shoot and that the gun went off
accidentally.  The accused was acquitted by a jury.  The Court of Appeal set
aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.  This appeal raises the issues of
the proper test for determining carelessness in the context of s. 86(2) of
the Code where it is the predicate offence of unlawful act manslaughter,
and whether, if the trial judge erred on this question, the Court of Appeal was
correct in overturning the acquittal.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier, Cory and McLachlin JJ.:  The proper test for the careless
handling of a firearm is set out in R. v. Creighton.  It was open to the
jury to find that the conduct of the accused police officer constituted a
marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent person in
the circumstances.  This was sufficient to permit a finding of the necessary actus
reus and mens rea, absent evidence of incapacity to appreciate the
risk involved in the conduct.  The misdirection to the jury requires that a new
trial be directed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka and
Iacobucci JJ.:  The determination of what constitutes ""in a careless
manner"" or ""without reasonable precautions for the safety of other
persons"" for purposes of s. 86(2) of the Code must be assessed
on an objective standard, requiring a marked departure from the standard of
care of a reasonable person.  Penal negligence, or negligence in a criminal
setting, is to be distinguished from negligence under civil law and
incorporates the particular frailties of the accused, if any, because he or she
could not have acted otherwise in the circumstances.  In the determination of
fault under s. 86(2) of the Code, it would be necessary for the
jury to be instructed to consider whether the conduct of the accused was a
marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonable person in the
circumstances of the offence.  If the answer is no, then the accused must be acquitted,
since his or her conduct was not objectively negligent.  If the answer is yes,
however, then the jury must be instructed to consider whether the conduct of
the accused was a marked departure from the required standard of care because
(a) he or she did not turn his or her mind to the duty of care and thus to
the risk likely to result from the conduct, or (b) he or she lacked the
capacity to turn his or her mind to the duty of care, due to human frailties. 
If the answer is (a), the accused must be convicted, since the criminal law
cannot allow the absence of actual awareness to be an excuse to criminal
liability for negligence.  If the answer is (b), the third stage of the inquiry
is needed, under which the jury should be instructed to consider whether in the
context of the particular offence, the reasonable person with the capacities of
the accused would have made him or herself aware of the required duty of care.

 

                   If a jury should
find the accused's use of the firearm in this case met the threshold of a
marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent police
officer in the circumstances, and no evidence is tendered to suggest that the
accused, due to any particular human frailty, was unable to exercise his duty
of care in the circumstances, then the accused must be convicted under
s. 86(2) of the Code.  In order to convict an accused of unlawful
act manslaughter under s. 222(5)(a), however, it is necessary to
prove (1) that the unlawful act caused the death of the victim; (2) that
the accused has satisfied the fault requirement of that unlawful act (which
cannot be one of absolute liability); (3) that the unlawful act is
objectively dangerous; and (4) that the unlawful act was one from which a
reasonable person, in the circumstances of the accused, would have foreseen the
risk of death.  Should a new trial be ordered, the jury would have to be
instructed to consider the capacity of the accused again in the context of the
fourth element of the offence, to determine whether the accused was capable of
foreseeing the risk of death arising from the unlawful act.

 

                   In directing the
jury to inquire into the mind of the accused in this case, in order to
determine if he possessed ""criminal"" intent, the trial judge
committed an error in law.  Given the seriousness of the error in the charge,
which went to the very heart of the elements of the offence that the Crown had
to establish, the outcome may well have been affected, and therefore a new
trial is required.

I.                 Facts

 

                   On the morning of
November 11, 1987, the appellant, a 16-year veteran of the Montreal police
force, and his partner, Kimberley Campbell, responded to a call from a taxi
driver complaining of a customer who refused to pay his fare.  The customer
identified himself as Tony Bowers.  The appellant learned over the police radio
that this information was false.  Based on papers that he was carrying, the
individual was identified as Tony Griffin, for whom there was an arrest warrant
outstanding.  The appellant then arrested Mr. Griffin and brought him to the
police station.  The officers also received from the cab driver a bag belonging
to Mr. Griffin which contained approximately 150 packs of cigarettes.  The
officers suspected that these cigarettes had come into the possession of Mr.
Griffin illegally.

 

                   Upon arriving at
the station, Ms. Campbell went to retrieve the cigarettes from the trunk of the
car, the appellant opened the rear door to let Mr. Griffin out, and at that
moment, Mr. Griffin attempted to flee.  The appellant chased after him, taking
his gun out of its holster as he ran.  The gun was held at the side of his
right leg, pointing at the ground.  The appellant yelled in the direction of
Mr. Griffin, ""Stop or I'll shoot.""  The appellant then pointed his
gun at Mr. Griffin with his index finger on the trigger.  He claimed that he
did this in order to intimidate Mr. Griffin because he was not responding to
the order to stop.  The Crown's position, however, is that Mr. Griffin had
already stopped running forward and had begun running on the spot ""dodging
like a boxer"", when he turned to face the appellant.  At that moment, a
shot went off, fatally striking Mr. Griffin in the head.  These events all took
place in the police station parking lot.

 

                   The gun used by the
appellant can be fired either by ""single action"", where the gun is
already cocked and only slight pressure on the trigger is required, or by
""double action"", requiring very strong pressure on the trigger so as
to raise the hammer and then fire a shot. 

 

                   The appellant was
charged with manslaughter under ss. 234  and 236   of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly ss. 217  and 219 ).  At trial, he testified that
he was not aware of cocking the gun and never made a decision to do so;
however, the appellant acknowledged that the gun must have been cocked at the
time he pointed it at Mr. Griffin.  He further indicated that he never intended
to shoot and that the gun went off accidentally.  The appellant was acquitted
by a jury.  On appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal, the acquittal was set aside
and a new trial was ordered: [1991] R.J.Q. 1567, 67 C.C.C. (3d) 156, 6 C.R.
(4th) 239, 37 Q.A.C. 161.  The appellant appeals to this Court as of right
under s. 691(2)(a) of the Code.

III.               Judgments Below

 

Superior Court

 

                   Trottier J.
reviewed the text of s. 86(2)  (formerly s. 84(2)) of the Code, and
proceeded to make the following statement:

 

                   [translation]  Remember that all the
words in a section of a statute have meaning.  In this definition of the
criminal offence found in [86(2)], there are two essential elements that you
must consider:  1.  the element ""without lawful excuse"", and 2. 
""in a careless manner or without reasonable precautions for the safety of
other persons"".

 

                   Therefore,
in order for an accused to be found guilty of having committed the criminal
offence prohibited by section [86(2)] of the Criminal Code , the Crown, or the
prosecution if you prefer, must establish for you that the accused acted
without lawful excuse and in a careless manner, or without reasonable
precautions for the safety of other persons.

 

                   If
you have a reasonable doubt that the Crown has not established each of these
elements, the accused must not be found guilty of manslaughter, by means of an
unlawful act.

 

 

Trottier J. summarized the offence
under s. 86(2) of the Code in the following passage: 

 

[translation] . . . I should point out
that for an action to constitute a criminal act, there must be a criminal state
of mind, and that mere civil negligence, which happens to all of us, does not
make us criminally liable.

 

 

                   Following his
charge on the relevant law for manslaughter under s. 222(5)  (formerly s.
205(5)), both on the basis of an unlawful act and on the basis of criminal
negligence, the trial judge put the following five questions to the jury:

 

- [translation] First, at the beginning of
the incident, was there anything in the evidence which indicated to you a
criminal state of mind on the part of the accused?

 

-
Second, during the trip to the station, even after having learned other
information such as the existence of a warrant for his arrest, and the fact
that the young man was considered violent, are you of the view that the
evidence showed on the part of the accused this criminal state of mind?

 

-
Third, upon their arrival at the station, before the attempted escape, do you
find, there again in the evidence, anything indicating a criminal state of mind
on the part of the accused?

 

-
Fourth, during the attempted escape, when the shot was fired, do you see in the
evidence, and solely in the evidence, facts which could lead you to conclude
that the accused had, there again, a guilty state of mind, in the sense that I
previously indicated to you?

 

-
Fifth, immediately after the shot was fired, was the accused's attitude that of
a person who showed a guilty state of mind or wanton or reckless disregard for
the life of another person?

 

 

                   At the conclusion
of the trial judge's charge, after the jury had retired, a discussion ensued
between the trial judge and counsel for the Crown.  Counsel for the Crown
expressed serious concern about the manner in which Trottier J. had defined the
negligence (carelessness) set out in s. 86(2) , and, according to the Crown, had
left the jury with the impression that s. 86(2)  required the same degree of
moral culpability as criminal negligence under s. 219  (formerly s. 202).  This
impression was affirmed, the Crown submitted, by the five questions stated by
the trial judge reproduced above.  

 

                   Trottier J. ruled
that he had adequately distinguished between the two offences and their
respective elements, and further, that recalling the jury for clarification might
unfairly prejudice the accused.  Two days later, the jury returned a verdict of
acquittal.

 

 

Court of Appeal, [1991] R.J.Q. 1567, 67 C.C.C. (3d)
156

 

Beauregard J.A.

 

                   Beauregard J.A., at
p. 161 C.C.C., stated that, in order to correctly explain s. 86 of the Code
in relation to s. 222(5) (a) (formerly s. 205(5)(a)) of the Code,
Trottier J. should have told the jury they had to be convinced of [translation] ""the existence of the
following essential elements"" in order to find the appellant guilty:

 

                   (1) the handling of
the gun must have been done knowingly;

(2)
[the appellant] [must] also have been aware of the circumstances in which he
handled the gun;

 

(3)
his handling of the gun must have been done with less care than a good police
officer would have taken in the same circumstances;

 

                   (4) there was no
lawful excuse for [the appellant's] conduct;

 

                   (5) Griffin's death
resulted from [the appellant's] conduct.

 

Beauregard J.A. added that Trottier J.
should have explained the meaning of the phrase ""without lawful
excuse"" in s. 86(2) of the Code.

 

                   Beauregard J.A.
concluded, at p. 162 C.C.C., that Trottier J. had not caused prejudice to the
respondent by telling the jury that the appellant could not be found guilty
under ss. 86(2) and 222(5)(a) of the Code [translation] ""if he only committed
an act of simple negligence"".  However, [translation]
""instead of saying that such a finding of guilt necessitated `a criminal
state of mind'"", Trottier J. should have said [translation] ""that there was guilt if the negligence was
gross negligence"".

 

                   Beauregard J.A.
concluded that Trottier J. had correctly explained s. 222(5)(b) of the Code
by telling the jury that they should find the appellant guilty [translation] ""if they came to the
conclusion that [the appellant] had caused the death of Griffin by showing
wanton or reckless disregard for the latter's life or safety"" (p. 163
C.C.C.).  However, Beauregard J.A. noted that Trottier J. [translation] ""did not clearly
explain to the jury what he understood by the expression `guilty state of
mind'"" or ""criminal state of mind"".  Accordingly, in Beauregard
J.A.'s opinion, the jury could only [translation]
""have understood that, if, at the time of the shooting, [the appellant's]
mind was not animated by malice, he should be found not guilty"". 
Beauregard J.A. therefore concluded, at p. 164 C.C.C., that the jury had not
considered the essential question, namely:

 

[translation] Considering all the
circumstances, did [the appellant], in the use of his firearm, cause Griffin's
death as a result of wanton or reckless disregard for Griffin's life?

 

 

Rothman J.A.

 

                   After reviewing the
facts of the case, Rothman J.A. discussed the issues that would have to be
determined by the jury; first, whether, when the accused pointed his gun at Mr.
Griffin, the accused knew his gun was loaded and cocked or, alternatively, was
indifferent to whether or not it was loaded and cocked; and second, whether the
action of the accused amounted to ""carelessness"" within the
definition of s. 86(2) .  Rothman J.A., however, noted, at p. 1576 R.J.Q., that
the jury never had the opportunity to address these critical determinations:

 

                   Unfortunately,
the jury had no opportunity to consider these questions.  Instead, they were
invited to consider the definition of criminal negligence, and the requirement
of a criminal intent (""esprit criminel"") the meaning of which
was not explained to them.  The judge's directions in this regard suggested
that the Crown had the burden of proving malice, a burden that was too high
whether the Crown had relied on criminal negligence under Sec. 219  or the
careless handling of a firearm under Sec. 86(2) .

 

                   With
great respect for the trial judge, I do not believe the jury was properly
instructed on the essential elements required to establish that Griffin's death
was caused by the careless use, or handling of a firearm or how the law under
Sec. 86(2)  related to the evidence.  Certainly, there was evidence on which a
jury, properly instructed, could have concluded that [the] respondent was
careless in the use and handling of his revolver.  The jury should have been
directed as to how the law related to that evidence.

 

 

Rothman J.A. concluded that it would
have been ""exceedingly difficult, if not impossible"" to say that the
outcome would have been the same if the jury had been properly instructed on
the issue.  A new trial, therefore, was ordered.

 

 

Brossard J.A. (dissenting)

 

                   Brossard J.A., at
p. 175 C.C.C., stated that negligence under s. 86(2) of the Code [translation] ""in order to justify
a verdict of guilty does not require the same degree of recklessness or
disregard that criminal negligence does"".  Brossard J.A., at p. 177
C.C.C., added that the degree of fault or negligence required for that
subsection to apply involved a measure of objectivity bringing it very close to
civil fault or negligence [translation]
""which uncontestably is lesser in degree than that required in order to
find criminal negligence and which was the [only one commented on or
explained]"" by Trottier J.  Brossard J.A. then observed, at p. 177 C.C.C.,
that proof of negligence within the meaning of s. 86(2) of the Code [translation] ""remains subject to
the criminal law rules"", namely that it is for the respondent to prove
""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that there was negligence in the handling
of the firearm.

 

                   Brossard J.A.
concluded, at p. 175 C.C.C., that Trottier J. erred in his charge to the jury
because he did not [translation]
""sufficiently explain the constituent elements of `carelessness' under [s.
86(2) ] of the Criminal Code , and explained even less the distinction
between carelessness under [s. 86(2) ] and criminal negligence under [s.
219 ]"".  Brossard J.A. concluded, at p. 177 C.C.C.:

 

[translation] . . . [Trottier J.] should
have emphasized that carelessness under [s. 86(2) ] did not require any criminal
state of mind, any criminal intent, nor any wanton or reckless behaviour on the
part of the [appellant], no more than did it require proof that the latter had
foreseen the unreasonable consequences of his act.  It was also incumbent on
[Trottier J.] . . . in concluding his charge, to pose the question clearly to
the jury, in respect of [s. 86(2) ] in terms analogous to those that he used in
respect of criminal negligence....

 

 

                   Unlike the majority
of the Court of Appeal, Brossard J.A. concluded that Trottier J.'s error in his
charge to the jury did not warrant an order for a new trial.  Brossard J.A.
asked himself the following question, at p. 178 C.C.C.:

 

                   [translation] We must, therefore, ask
ourselves whether the facts in evidence, interpreted by a jury properly
charged, were such, with a reasonable degree of certainty, as would result in a
different verdict.

 

 

 

Brossard J.A. stated, at p. 178
C.C.C., that [translation]
""one cannot necessarily and ipso facto infer from the verdict of
not guilty that the jury necessarily believed and accepted the [appellant's]
story"".  Moreover, the respondent was required to prove [translation] ""the voluntariness of
the acts with which [the appellant] is reproached"" (p. 179 C.C.C.). 
Brossard J.A. considered the evidence relating to the five steps in the actus
reus, namely:

 

(1)  The fact of having taken the gun
out of the holster;

 

(2) The fact [that the gun was
cocked];

 

(3) The fact of running with the gun
out of the holster, pointed towards the ground;

(4) The fact of pointing the gun; 

 

(5) The fact of pressing on the trigger
and firing the gun.

 

Brossard J.A. stated that the
deliberate and voluntary nature of the act was an essential element of the actus
reus.  He concluded that the involuntary and unconscious nature of the
appellant's act prevented a verdict of guilty, despite the fact that Trottier
J.'s charge to the jury was inadequate as to the degree of negligence required
under s. 86(2) of the Code.

 

                   Brossard J.A.
dismissed the other grounds of appeal relating to lawful excuse, necessary
force and the admissibility of evidence of the police force directives, that is
administrative standards.  Brossard J.A. accordingly would have dismissed the
appeal.

 

IV.              Analysis

 

A.                The Issues

 

                   There are two
central issues before the Court in this appeal: first, what is the proper test
to determine ""carelessness"" in the context of s. 86(2)  of the Criminal
Code  where it is the predicate offence of unlawful act manslaughter?   This
is the question on which the trial judge was found to have erred by the Quebec
Court of Appeal.  The second issue is whether, if the trial judge erred, the
Crown discharged its burden of demonstrating the error was such that the Court
of Appeal could say, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the verdict
would not necessarily have been the same if the jury had been properly
instructed.

 

                   Although the
appellant was charged under s. 222(5)  without distinguishing between the two
grounds, (a) unlawful act manslaughter and (b) manslaughter by criminal
negligence, the Crown principally relied on s. 222(5) (a) in its
submissions, contending that the appellant's careless use of a firearm contrary
to s. 86(2)  comprised the predicate offence for unlawful act manslaughter.  The
trial judge instructed the jury both with respect to s. 222(5) (a)
(unlawful act manslaughter) and s. 222(5) (b) (manslaughter by criminal
negligence).  The correctness of the charge for the offence under s. 222(5) (b)
manslaughter by criminal negligence, however, was not pursued as a ground of
the appeal before this Court and is not considered herein.  

 

                   Finally, although
the appellant raised the constitutionality of s. 222(5) (a) (unlawful act
manslaughter) in his written submissions as a ground of appeal, this issue was
not addressed by the Court of Appeal, nor was any constitutional question
stated or conveyed to the provincial Attorneys General so as to allow them to
intervene.  Therefore, as the Court indicated at the time of the hearing, this
issue will not be addressed herein.  The constitutionality of s. 222(5) (a)
is addressed, however, in R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 000, released
this same day, where the matter was properly before this Court, in which s.
222(5) (a) is upheld as constitutional under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms .  

 

B.                Section 86(2) of
the Code:  Careless Use of a Firearm

 

                   The question in
this case is the proper interpretation of the elements of s. 86(2) of the Code,
where it forms the predicate unlawful act for the offence of unlawful act
manslaughter under s. 222(5)(a) of the Code.  In this determination,
the Court must discern the intent of Parliament, having regard to the purpose
of the section and the applicable principles of statutory construction. 

 

                   Though there are no
other references to ""careless[ness]"" in the Criminal Code ,
there are a number of analogous provisions to s. 86(2) .  Sections 79  and 80 ,
for instance, create an offence which punishes persons for failing to discharge
a duty of care to prevent bodily harm and property damage with respect to the
care and control of explosive substances.  Section 436  creates an offence which
punishes a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonably prudent
person would use to prevent or control the spread of fires or to prevent
explosions, where the fires or explosions cause bodily harm to a person or
damage to property.  These provisions indicate Parliament's intent that where
people take care or control of inherently dangerous materials, they are put on
notice that society has placed on them a specific duty of care.   

 

                   In Canadian
Firearms Law (1988), at p. 46, D. Hawley outlines what, in her view,
provides the rationale for this provision:

 

                   This
section is aimed at protecting people from the careless acts of others that may
result in injury caused by this carelessness.  Because firearms and ammunition
have a potential for causing serious injury or death, Parliament has recognized
that it is important that persons in possession of such items have a duty to
use, carry, handle, ship and store them in a careful and safe manner.

 

 

                   In its Working
Paper 46, Omissions, Negligence and Endangering (1985), the Law Reform
Commission of Canada presented a further justification for rendering criminal
the consequences of careless conduct (at p. 23):

 

                   The
other misconception sees deterrence as the sole function of the criminal law. 
But is there not also room for reformation, prevention and support for values? 
Even if punishing carelessness did not deter, could it still not reform and
teach offenders to take more care in future, prevent further carelessness and
publicly affirm the value set on carefulness?

 

I agree with these descriptions of
Parliament's intent in enacting s. 86(2) .  

 

                   What, then, is the
basis of fault under s. 86(2) ?  In R. v. Hundal, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, at
p. 883, this Court unanimously found that the test for dangerous driving under
s. 249 of the Code is an objective one, requiring ""a marked
departure from the standard of care of a reasonable person"".  In my
opinion, the determination of what constitutes ""in a careless manner""
or ""without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons""
is, following Hundal, to be assessed on an objective standard.  I am
supported in this view by the plain meaning of the words chosen by Parliament. 
Neither phrase connotes any subjective knowledge of the standard of care in the
circumstances, nor any subjective awareness of the risks arising out of a
marked departure from the standard of care.   

 

                   I draw further
support for this approach from  a series of appellate court decisions in Canada
which have squarely addressed the fault requirement under s. 86(2) .  Most have
found that whether or not carelessness has been established is to be determined
objectively.  While I would not, in every case, adopt the phraseology of these
courts in their elucidation of the requirements of the section, I do agree with
their conclusion in this regard. 

 

                   In R. v.
Derkosh (1979), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 252 (Alta. C.A.), the acquittal of a man
charged with storing firearms in a careless manner was upheld, on the basis
that the evidence of the precautions taken by the accused negated the
allegations of negligence.  Speaking for the Court, Haddad J.A. adopted an
objective test for the assessment of carelessness (at p. 254):

 

A
duty is imposed on the possessor of firearms and ammunition, to ensure he is
not careless in the manner in which he causes them to be stored, having regard
to all of the circumstances.  In positive words, there is a duty to take due
care because these are potentially dangerous articles and a measure of safety
is necessary.

 

 

                   In R. v.
Batalha (1982), 70 C.C.C. (2d) 190 (B.C.C.A.), a man was acquitted of a
summary offence under s. 86(2)  (formerly s. 84(2)) of the Code, after an
unloaded gun was found, with ammunition nearby, in a parked truck.  The
acquittal was set aside by the County Court judge.  On appeal to the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, Nemetz C.J.B.C. adopted the reasoning in Derkosh,
supra, and then reached the following conclusion in dismissing the appeal
(at pp. 191-92):

 

                   Counsel
for the appellant in his able submission contended that without proof of
advertence on the part of the accused there can be no conviction here.  In
making that submission he relied on such cases as Mann v. The Queen,
[1966] 2 C.C.C. 273, 56 D.L.R. (2d) 1, [1966] S.C.R. 238, and Peda v. The
Queen, [1969] 4 C.C.C. 245, 6 D.L.R. (3d) 177, 7 C.R.N.S. 243.

 

                   In
those cases Parliament used the word ""dangerous"" as setting the
standard of care.  These were mostly driving cases.  In this case Parliament
has used the word ""careless"" as being the standard.

 

                   As
Mr. Justice Judson said in O'Grady v. Sparling (1960), 128 C.C.C. 1 at
pp.14-5, 25 D.L.R. (2d) 145, [1960] S.C.R. 804 at p. 809:

 

                   What
the Parliament of Canada has done is to define ""advertent negligence""
as a crime under ss. 191(1) and 221(1) [now ss. 219(1) and 249(1)].  It has not
touched ""inadvertent negligence"" . . . and until Parliament chooses
to define it in the Criminal Code  as ""crime"", it is not crime.

 

                   zHowever,
here in order to protect the public from the improper carrying, handling,
shipping, and storing of firearms, Parliament has imposed a duty of care. If
the accused failed in his duty, he is liable, because the Code says so,
even if he is no more than civilly or inadvertently liable. 

 

 

 

                   Thus, s. 86(2) of
the Criminal Code  cannot be said to punish a state of mind; rather, this
section establishes an offence of negligence, which, like intention and
recklessness, may provide a valid basis of fault in criminal law.  What need be
proven in order to convict under this provision is conduct that constitutes a
marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent person in
the circumstances.  If a reasonable doubt exists either that the conduct in
question did not constitute a marked departure from that standard of care, or
that reasonable precautions were taken to discharge the duty of care in the
circumstances, a verdict of acquittal must follow.  

 

                   As I find the fault
element under s. 86(2) of the Code to be objective, what remains is to
outline what factors that assessment of fault should consider.  It is this
question that I shall now address.

 

C.                The Objective
Test 

 

                   While identifying
the objective basis for the determination of fault under s. 86(2), the cases
noted above tend to conflate the civil standard of negligence with the test for
negligence in criminal law.  Negligence in a criminal setting, or what I shall
hereinafter refer to as ""penal negligence"" to distinguish it from
offences involving a fault element of criminal negligence under s. 219 of the Code,
subjects those convicted to the possibility of imprisonment.  Unlike negligence
under civil law, which is concerned with the apportionment of loss, penal
negligence is concerned with the punishment of moral blameworthiness.  The
practical implication of the distinction is that a finding of negligence under
the Code, whatever degree or species of negligence is contemplated by
the charging section, is made somewhat differently than a finding of civil
negligence.  Penal negligence incorporates the particular frailties of the
accused, if any, because he or she could not have acted other than they did in
the circumstances.  As I state in R. v. Finlay, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 000,
released this same day, at p. 000, this approach is necessary if the principle
of fundamental justice that prohibits punishing the morally innocent is to be
respected.

                   

                   In his book Intention,
Agency and Criminal Liability:  Philosophy of Action and the Criminal Law
(1990), at p. 155, R. Duff contends that inadvertence may properly be construed
as a morally blameworthy basis of fault:

 

                   One
obvious objection to [orthodox subjectivism] is that it has no room for
negligence as a species of fault, since the negligent agent does not choose to
cause, or to risk causing, harm.  But negligence surely is a species of
fault, albeit less serious than recklessness:  we properly blame people
for their negligence. [Emphasis in original.]

 

                    In my view, this
reasoning is sound.  Section 86(2) punishes a marked departure from the
standard of care as a species of criminal fault.  This is not a case, however,
of a person seeing a risk and recklessly disregarding that risk in his or her
conduct, but rather of a person who fails to take reasonable precautions in
response to the duty that has been placed upon him or her, and should have
taken; the breach of this duty is demonstrated by the risk of harm to which
their conduct gives rise.  This provision, therefore, punishes those who have
not acted reasonably.

 

                   Reasonableness
cannot, however, be assessed in the abstract, but must relate to the
circumstances of the accused and of the offence.  In R. v. Tutton,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392, at p. 1434, I stated that in applying the objective norm
set out in the definition of criminal negligence in s. 202  of the Criminal
Code  (now s. 219 ), there ""must be made `a generous allowance' for
factors which are particular to the accused, such as youth, mental development,
education . . ."".  This position has since been described (by Eric Colvin
in Principles of Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1991), at p. 151), as ""a
highly personalized approach to assessing negligence"".

 

                   Most recently, in R.
v. Hundal, supra, a case considering the test for dangerous driving,
Cory J. describes the objective basis for a finding of negligence in the
following terms (at p. 883):

 

. .
. the test for negligence is an objective one requiring a marked departure from
the standard of care of a reasonable person.  There is no need to establish the
intention of the particular accused.  The question to be answered under the
objective test concerns what the accused ""should"" have known.  The
potential harshness of the objective standard may be lessened by the consideration
of certain personal factors as well as the consideration of a defence of
mistake of fact.

 

 

 

                   This approach is
consistent with recent judicial pronouncements with respect to the law
regarding dangerous driving in England.  In R. v. Reid,
[1992] 3 All E.R. 673 (H.L.), there is a general recognition that the capacity
of the accused to appreciate risk is relevant to a determination of fault. 
Lord Keith, for example (at p. 675), found that the assessment of fault on the
basis of inadvertence may have to be ""modified . . . for example, where
the driver acted under some understandable and excusable mistake or where his
capacity to appreciate risks was adversely affected by some condition not
involving fault on his part"".

 

                   The principles
underlying the consideration of the capacity of the accused are discussed in
detail in R. v. Creighton, supra.  I wish to emphasize, however,
that having regard for the human frailties of a particular accused to the
extent they might affect his or her ability to meet the standard of care
required in the circumstances is not tantamount to adopting a subjective test
for assessing fault.  The objective test can clearly be distinguished from a
subjective test in which the accused must be proven to have actual awareness that
his or her conduct is creating a risk of harm.  Under a subjective test, all
characteristics of the accused are relevant, since the inquiry concerns what
this particular accused knew and intended.  The objective test, by contrast,
holds an accused liable even in the absence of actual awareness, provided that
awareness would have been present in the reasonable person.

 

                   Once a marked
departure from the standard of care is established, the focus of the
investigation under penal negligence must shift, therefore, to the question of
whether the accused was capable of recognizing that he or she had fallen short
of the standard of care required in the circumstances by the charging section. 


 

                   It is important to
distinguish, however, between the relevance of personal factors to the question
of whether the accused's conduct constituted a marked departure from the
standard of care of a reasonable person, and the relevance of personal factors
to the question of whether the accused was capable of meeting that standard of
care.  I note initially that some factors particular to the offence will not
be personal to the accused:  the standard of care must obviously be determined
with reference to the external, physical circumstances of the offence (e.g.,
prevailing road conditions where a driving offence is at issue).  Rather a personal
factor relevant to defining the standard of care is the accused's membership in
a group characterized by training or specially superior knowledge which
indicates that a higher standard of care than that which would be
expected of the untrained or non-specialist reasonable person is appropriate. 
Just as in the law of civil negligence, the defendant with special knowledge or
experience is held to a higher standard commensurate with that knowledge or
experience, so in penal negligence a police officer trained and experienced in
the use of firearms should be held to a higher standard of care in the handling
of firearms than the non-police officer.  The standard of care in the law of
professional negligence provides another example of this approach.

 

                   Common sense
dictates that the nature of the activity in question will determine whether any
special knowledge, training or experience of the group is relevant at this
stage of the inquiry:  while training and experience as an ambulance driver
will affect the standard of care in a driving offence, but not in an offence
involving the use of firearms, the appellant's training and experience as a
police officer most certainly will be relevant to the standard of care under s.
86(2) in this case.

 

                   This attention to
characteristics of the group to which the accused belongs does not make the
definition of the standard of care any more subjective than it is in the law of
civil negligence:  the threshold question remains whether the accused's actions
constituted a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonable
member of the experienced or specialist group.

 

                   In contrast, the
factors which will be relevant to capacity in the context of penal
negligence will be those which may have impaired, rather than enhanced,
the accused's personal ability to know the facts necessary to have acted
reasonably, and thus serve to excuse the accused from liability.  

 

                   The analytical
distinction between these types of personal factors is best illustrated in a
checklist of questions for the trier of fact.  In the determination of fault
under s. 86(2) of the Code, it would be necessary for the jury to be instructed
to consider the following questions:

 

(1) 
Was the conduct of the accused a marked departure from the standard of care of
a reasonable person in the circumstances of the offence?

 

If the answer to this question is no,
then the accused must be acquitted, since his or her conduct was not
objectively negligent.  If the answer is yes, however, then the jury must be
instructed to consider the second question:

 

(2) 
Was the conduct of the accused a marked departure from the required standard of
care because

 

(a)
he or she did not turn his or her mind to the duty of care and thus to the risk
likely to result from the conduct; or

 

(b)
he or she lacked the capacity to turn his or her mind to the duty of care, due
to human frailties?

 

If the answer is (a), the accused must
be convicted, since the criminal law cannot allow the absence of actual
awareness to be an excuse to criminal liability for negligence.  If the answer
is (b), the third stage of the inquiry is needed, under which the jury should
be instructed to consider the third question:

 

(3) 
In the context of the particular offence, would the reasonable person with the
capacities of the accused have made him or herself aware of the required duty
of care?

 

                   If a jury should
find the appellant's use of the firearm in this case met the threshold of a
marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent police
officer in the circumstances, and no evidence is tendered to suggest that the
appellant, due to any particular human frailty, was unable to exercise his duty
of care in the circumstances, then the appellant must be convicted under s.
86(2) of the Code. 

 

                   While it was clear
that the firing of the appellant's gun caused the death of Mr. Griffin, a
finding of fault under s. 86(2) is not sufficient to find the appellant guilty
of unlawful act manslaughter.  In R. v. Creighton, supra, I set
out the following elements which must be proven in order to convict an accused
of unlawful act manslaughter under s. 222(5) (a): (1) that the unlawful
act caused the death of the victim; (2) that the accused has satisfied the
fault requirement of that unlawful act (which cannot be one of absolute
liability); (3) that the unlawful act is objectively dangerous; and (4) that
the unlawful act was one from which a reasonable person, in the circumstances
of the accused, would have foreseen the risk of death.    

 

                   Should a new trial
be ordered, the jury would have to be instructed to consider the capacity of
the accused again in the context of the fourth element of the offence, to
determine whether the accused was capable of foreseeing the risk of death
arising from the unlawful act.  In R. v. Creighton, I outline the
objective test to be applied in order to establish fault for unlawful act manslaughter
under s. 222(5)(a) of the Code.

 

                   I shall now turn to
the task of evaluating the trial judge's charge to the jury.

 

D.                The Charge to the
Jury and s. 686(4)(b)(i) of the Criminal Code

 

                   In his charge to
the jury, the trial judge stated that, in order to convict the appellant under
s. 86(2) as the predicate unlawful act for s. 222(5)(a) of the Code,
the prosecution had to establish that the appellant possessed [translation] ""a criminal state of
mind"" and that a finding of simple negligence was insufficient to satisfy
this standard.  The meaning of ""criminal state of mind"" was not
discussed anywhere in the charge to the jury.  Subsequently, at the close of
his address on the relevant law, the trial judge put five questions to the
jury, all of which reiterated that, in order to convict, the jury had to be
satisfied that the appellant had ""a criminal state of mind"".  In
directing the jury to address these questions, and inquire into the mind of the
accused, in order to determine if he possessed ""criminal"" intent, the
learned trial judge, with respect, committed an error in law.  

 

                   All the members of
the Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had erred in his charge to the jury
on the assessment of carelessness under s. 86(2); Brossard J.A., however,
dissented on the question of the implications of this error.  Brossard J.A. was
not convinced with a reasonable degree of certainty that the verdict of not
guilty would have been different if the error had not been committed. 
Therefore, Brossard J.A. saw no need for a new trial.  

 

                   Having concluded
that the Court of Appeal was correct in finding that the trial judge erred in
his charge to the jury, it is necessary to determine if the majority of the
Court of Appeal was also correct in setting aside the acquittal and ordering a
new trial under s. 686(4)(b)(i) of the Code.

 

                   In R. v. Morin,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 374, Sopinka J. stated the threshold to be met for
setting aside an acquittal and ordering a new trial under the section in the
following manner:

 

                   The
onus resting on the Crown when it appeals an acquittal was settled in Vézeau
v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.  It is the duty of the Crown to satisfy
the court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the jury
had been properly instructed.

 

                   I
am prepared to accept that the onus is a heavy one and that the Crown must
satisfy the court with a reasonable degree of certainty.  An accused who has
been acquitted once should not be sent back to be tried again unless it appears
that the error at the first trial was such that there is a reasonable degree of
certainty that the outcome may well have been affected by it.  Any more
stringent test would require an appellate court to predict with certainty what
happened in the jury room.  That it cannot do.

 

 

                   Brossard J.A., in
departing from the majority on the question of whether a properly instructed
jury, acting reasonably, could have come to a different conclusion, makes an
important inference based on the jury's verdict of an acquittal.  In his view,
the acquittal of the appellant implied that the jury had accepted the
appellant's defence that the discharge of the gun had been accidental,
involuntary and of an unconscious nature.

 

                   With respect, I do
not think this inference necessarily follows from the acquittal.  The jury was
instructed to determine if criminal negligence had been established, and may
even have been misdirected to look for ""malice"".  The jury could well
have accepted that the discharge of the weapon had not been involuntary or
unconscious, and still found that the elements of criminal negligence had not
been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  

 

                   More importantly,
given the seriousness of the error in the charge, which went to the very heart
of the elements of the offence that the Crown had to establish, I would say
with more than a reasonable degree of certainty that the outcome may well have
been affected by the error in the trial judge's charge.  Consequently, a new
trial is required.

 

V.                Disposition

 

                   I would dismiss the
appeal, and affirm the decision of the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal
ordering a new trial.

 

                   The judgment of La
Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, Cory and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. -- The appellant, a
police officer, is charged with manslaughter.  A suspect was attempting to
escape.  The appellant yelled ""Stop or I'll shoot"", and pointed his
gun in the direction of the suspect. A shot went off.  It hit the suspect in
the head and killed him. The appellant was charged with ""unlawful act
manslaughter"", on the basis that he had killed someone while handling a
firearm in a careless manner contrary to s. 86(2)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly s. 84(2) ).  At trial the appellant testified
that he never intended to shoot and that the gun went off accidentally.  The
jury acquitted him.  The Court of Appeal set the acquittal aside on the ground
that the judge had misdirected the jury and ordered a new trial. 

 

                   The appeal to this
Court  raises the question of the proper test for the careless handling of a
firearm. Depending on the answer to this question, a further question may arise
of whether the verdict would have necessarily been the same had the jury been
told to apply the correct test.  My view on the applicable legal principles is
set out in R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 000.

 

                   I agree with the
Chief Justice that it was open to the jury to find that the conduct of the
police officer constituted a marked departure from the standard of care of a
reasonably prudent person in the circumstances.  This was sufficient to permit
a finding of the necessary actus reus and mens rea, absent
evidence of incapacity to appreciate the risk involved in the conduct.  The
Court of Appeal below, [1991] R.J.Q. 1567, found that ""in this case, there
is nothing in the evidence to suggest that [Mr. Gosset] would not have been
able to recognize a risk of danger that all reasonable people would inevitably
recognize as a risk of danger in the use or handling of a firearm""
(reasons of Rothman J.A., at p. 1574).  In short, there was no incapacity which
prevented the accused from taking the care a reasonable person would have taken
in the circumstances.  This was precisely the test I have attempted to
enunciate more fully in R. v. Creighton.

 

                   I agree, however,
with the Chief Justice that the misdirection to the jury he refers to requires
that a new trial be directed.

 

                   I would dismiss the
appeal, and affirm the decision of the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal
ordering a new trial.

 

                   Appeal dismissed.

manner"" ‑‑ Whether offence satisfies minimum fault
requirements under s. 7 of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ‑‑

Mens rea ‑‑ Criminal Code prohibiting storing of firearms or
ammunition ""in a careless manner"" ‑‑ Whether offence
satisfies minimum fault requirements under s. 7 of Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
s. 86(2) .

 

                   The accused was
charged with storing firearms and ammunition in a careless manner, contrary to
s. 86(2)  of the Criminal Code .  He was granted a stay of
proceedings in Provincial Court, on the basis that s. 86(2)  violated
s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  in a manner
that could not be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .  The Court
of Queen's Bench reversed this judgment and ordered that the matter proceed to
trial.  It found that since the defence of due diligence was available,
s. 7  of the Charter  did not affect the validity of s. 86(2) . 
The Court of Appeal allowed the accused's appeal and restored the stay of
proceedings.  It found that ""mere negligence"" did not meet the
constitutional fault requirement found in s. 7  of the Charter  and
that the section was not saved by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé, Cory and
McLachlin JJ.:  Lamer C.J.'s reasons were agreed with, except with respect
to the objective test for penal negligence discussed in R. v. Gosset.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J.: 
In conducting a substantive review of criminal legislation under s. 7  of
the Charter , courts must ensure that an element of fault allowing at
least for a defence of due diligence is contained in all offences for which an
accused is liable to imprisonment.  Where the offence is one which carries
sufficient social stigma coupled with potentially severe penal sanctions, the
principles of fundamental justice may require a higher level of mens rea. 
Based on the interpretation of the section in R. v. Gosset,
s. 86(2) of the Code satisfies these requirements.  The fault
requirement of the provision is to be assessed objectively and consists of
conduct that is a marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonable
person in the circumstances.  If a reasonable doubt exists either that the
conduct in question did not constitute a marked departure from that standard of
care, or that reasonable precautions were taken to discharge the duty of care
in the circumstances, a verdict of acquittal must follow.  The objective assessment
of fault also has to consider the capacity of an accused to meet the standard
of care required in the circumstances.  Given the nature of the offence, the
absence of any proof of advertence in the imposition of a conviction, and the
range of punishment upon conviction, there is not sufficient stigma arising
from a conviction under s. 86(2)  to require a subjective mens rea.

 

                   Even though
s. 86(2) of the Code will shortly be repealed and replaced, the
accused remains in jeopardy, and the issue in this case is therefore not moot.

C.J. -- This case
concerns a challenge to the constitutionality of s. 86(2)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .

 

I.                 Facts

 

                   The respondent was
charged that on or about February 27, 1989, he did without lawful excuse store
firearms and ammunition in a careless manner, contrary to s. 86(2) of the Code. 
Prior to trial, the respondent made an application for a stay of proceedings,
on the basis that s. 86(2) of the Code violated s. 7  of the Charter  in
a manner that could not be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   Finley Prov. Ct. J.
allowed the respondent's application and ordered a stay of proceedings: (1989),
53 C.C.C. (3d) 417.  The appellant appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench for
Saskatchewan.  Kyle J. allowed the appeal, set aside Finley Prov. Ct. J.'s judgment
and ordered that the matter proceed to trial: (1990), 83 Sask. R. 191, 55
C.C.C. (3d) 548, 50 C.R.R. 381.  The respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal
for Saskatchewan which allowed the appeal and restored the stay of proceedings:

III.               Judgments Below

 

Provincial Court (1989), 53 C.C.C. (3d) 417

 

                   Finley Prov. Ct.
J., following the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in R. v.
Bovill (1986), 78 Sask. R. 14, stated, at p. 419, that:

 

                   It
is apparent then that a conviction could occur under the present s. 86(2) 
despite there being a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused knew or ought
to have known or intended that his carelessness might have harmful results.

 

 

                   Finley Prov. Ct. J.
examined the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Vaillancourt,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, and R. v. Tutton, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392, and
concluded, at p. 422, that s. 86(2) of the Code violated s. 7  of the  Charter :

 

Parliament
has, through the Criminal Code , purported to create a criminal offence
with penalties that may result in a deprivation of life, liberty or security of
the person of the accused.  Parliament must respect the principles of
fundamental justice as set out in s. 7  of the Charter .  The creation of
a crime not requiring mens rea is prima facie a violation of s. 7 
in that a person may be convicted other than in accordance with the principles
of fundamental justice.

 

 

                   Finley Prov. Ct. J.
found that s. 86(2) of the Code, which created an offence allowing for a
conviction notwithstanding the existence of reasonable doubt on any essential
element, could not be saved by s. 1  of the Charter  since it would be
necessary to convict persons who did not intend or foresee that harm would
result from their behaviour or actions.  Finley Prov. Ct. J. declared that s.
86(2) of the Code was inoperative and unconstitutional pursuant to s. 24 
of the Charter  and s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .

 

Court of Queen's Bench (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 548

 

                   Kyle J. stated that
the issue concerned the right of Parliament, in view of s. 7  of the Charter ,
to impose a penalty of imprisonment in respect to behaviour involving a level
of negligence described as ""careless"".  Kyle J. noted that some
mental element must be present in an offence when an accused faces a risk of
imprisonment.  However, Kyle J. disagreed with the view that ""since
carelessness is the antithesis of thoughtful behaviour, no imprisonment can
result from it"" (at p. 550).  Kyle J. reached the following conclusion (at
p. 550):

 

                   Section
86(2)  is enacted in response to a perceived need that owners of firearms must
be encouraged and motivated to exercise the capacity to foresee hazards and in
so doing to think about and control their firearms and to minimize the risks
that the ownership involves.

 

 

                   Kyle J. stated that
the defence of due diligence was available under s. 86(2) of the Code. 
He concluded that the failure to exercise due diligence would be evidence of
the mental element, the failure to exercise control, which was what the statute
sought to penalize.  Since the defence of due diligence was available, Kyle J.
found that s. 7  of the Charter  did not affect the validity of s. 86(2)
of the Code.

 

Court of Appeal (1991), 64
C.C.C. (3d) 557

 

                   The court, relying
on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v.
Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices
Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, stated that the distinction between
criminal and regulatory statutes should be kept in mind in this case.

 

                   The court reviewed
the history of s. 86(2)  of the Criminal Code  and found that ""[t]he
express language of the predecessor section made it clear that fault or
culpability rested on a standard higher than mere negligence"" (at p.
561).  The court was referring to s. 86 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, which stated that an accused was guilty when, without lawful
excuse, he used, carried or possessed a firearm or ammunition in a manner that
was ""dangerous to the safety of other persons"".  The court observed
that the section had been amended in 1978 to read ""in a careless manner or
without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons"".  The
court believed that the expression ""careless manner"" suggested
something of a lower order, that is of mere negligence in the civil sense
rather than in the criminal sense.

 

                   Relying on its
decision in R. v. Bovill, supra, the court stated (at p. 564) that:

 

                   Under
the standard articulated by this court in Bovill, conduct exhibiting a
want of care, regardless of the state of mind underlying the conduct or its
potential consequences constitutes a crime which may result in imprisonment.  A
person found guilty of an offence under s. 86(2)  is liable to the discretionary
prohibition order prescribed by s. 100(2) for the possession of firearms,
ammunition and explosives.  Forfeiture of weapons under s. 491 is also a
possible consequence.

 

 

The court pointed out, however, that
the constitutional validity of s. 86(2) of the Code was not before the
court in that case.

 

                   The court also took
note of the fact that when s. 86(2)  was enacted in its present form, Parliament
was empowered to declare that an act was ""criminal"" irrespective of
intent, knowledge or degree of fault, provided the prohibition served a public
purpose in relation to criminal law.  Furthermore, no constitutional limits
existed on Parliament's power to define the elements of a ""crime,""
although, as the court emphasized, ""the notion that conduct should pass a
certain threshold before it is branded as crime finds support in R. v. City
of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299"" (at pp. 564-65).

 

                   The court referred
to the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, and R. v. Vaillancourt, supra, and stated
that with the advent of the Charter , it was ""obliged to consider
the constitutional requirement of fault when passing upon the validity of a
""criminal"" offence (at p. 565-66).

 

                   The court proceeded
to affirm that the fault element in a ""crime"" had to be appropriate
to the stigma which was attached to it.  According to the court, although the
stigma attached to s. 86(2) of the Code was ""at the lower end of
the scale"" (at p. 568), the stigma of any criminal conviction was
significant.  The court also noted that it was generally assumed that a person
convicted of a criminal offence ""has been so convicted because he
possessed a degree of fault greater than mere negligence"" (at p. 568),
this because society had long recognized a fundamental distinction between a
civil tort and a ""crime"".  The court held that ""mere
negligence"" did not meet the constitutional fault requirement found in s.
7  of the Charter .  Therefore, considering the consequences of a
conviction and the possible punishment under s. 86(2) of the Code, the
court concluded that the section was inconsistent with s. 7  of the Charter .

 

                   The court then
found that s. 86(2) of the Code was not saved by s. 1  of the Charter . 
The court summarized its finding in the following passage, at p. 572:

 

Is
it necessary to aim the full force of the criminal law at the minimum degree of
fault -- civil negligence -- enshrined in s. 86(2) .  We conclude that the means
employed and their effects are disproportionate to the objective sought to be
achieved.

 

IV.              Issues

 

                   I stated the
following constitutional questions by an order dated January 17, 1992:

 

1.Does
s. 86(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , infringe or deny
the right to life, liberty and security of the person, and the right not to be
deprived of that right, except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice, as guaranteed by s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is yes, is the infringement of s. 7  a reasonable limit
that can be demonstrably justified under s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

V.                Analysis

 

A.                Is the Issue
Moot?

 

                   Since the
legislation under appeal will shortly be repealed, there is some question as to
whether this case may be moot.  As the word ""careless"" will appear
nowhere in the Code after the repeal of this section, the respondent
suggests that consideration of a standard of carelessness is purely academic. 
This approach, however, overlooks the fact that the respondent remains in
jeopardy; allowing the appeal may result in his conviction and possible
incarceration.  Therefore, the ""concrete dispute"" has not disappeared
and an adversarial element remains alive.  In my view, this appeal meets the
threshold established in Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General),
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 342.

 

B.                Is s. 86 Contrary
to s. 7 of the Charter?

 

                   Section 7  of the Charter 
mandates courts to conduct a substantive review of criminal legislation. 
Courts are not entitled, however, to strike down legislation merely because
they disagree with the criminal law policy contained therein.  The limits of
constitutional scrutiny have been developed by this Court as follows:

 

1.The
courts must ensure that an element of fault allowing at least for a defence of
due diligence is contained in all offences for which an accused is liable to
imprisonment.

 

2.Where
the offence is one which carries sufficient social stigma coupled with
potentially severe penal sanctions, the principles of fundamental justice may
require a higher level of mens rea.  The ""very few"" offences
which merit this analysis have thus far included murder, attempted murder and
theft.

 

 

 

                    I shall now
consider whether s. 86(2) of the Code satisfies these requirements.  

 

(1)  Minimum Fault Requirement 

 

                   The present state
of the law with respect to the minimum fault requirement contained in s. 7  has
been recently summarized by Gonthier J. in R. v. Nova Scotia
Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, at p. 659:

 

                   From
the reasons of this Court in R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, it can be seen that a minimum fault requirements with
respect to every criminal or regulatory offence satisfies the requirements of
s. 7 .  That same case indicates, at p. 238:

                   

That
fault may be demonstrated by proof of intent, whether subjective or objective,
or by proof of negligent conduct, depending on the nature of the offence. 

 

 

...
Mens rea focuses on the mental state of the accused and requires proof
of a positive state of mind such as intent, recklessness or wilful blindness. 
Negligence, on the other hand, measures the conduct of the accused on the basis
of an objective standard, irrespective of the accused's subjective mental
state.

 

 

 

 

                   In R. v.
Wholesale Travel Group Inc., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, I emphasized the
following concerns with respect to the difference between an appropriate
minimum standard of fault and a constitutionally sufficient minimum
standard of fault in the context of offences where convictions may result in
imprisonment (at pp. 186-87):

 

While
an aware state of mind may well be the most appropriate minimum standard of
fault for imprisonment or for any offence included in the Criminal Code ,
a matter up on which I refrain from expressing any view, it does not follow
that this standard of fault is entrenched in the Charter .  As I stated
in R. v. Lippé, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 114, at p. 142, ""the
Constitution does not always guarantee the ""ideal"".  ""As this
Court stated in Vaillancourt, supra, the principles of fundamental
justice dictate that negligence is the minimum fault requirement where an
accused faces possible imprisonment upon conviction except for certain offences
such as murder....  Whether a fault requirement higher than this constitutional
minimum ought to be adopted where an accused faces possible imprisonment or
conviction of any offence under the Criminal Code  is a question of
public policy which must be determined by Parliament, and for the courts to
pronounce upon this would be contrary to what this Court has said in Re B.C.
Motor Vehicle Act, supra, at pp. 498-99: that we refrain from
""adjudicating up on the merits or wisdom of enactments"".  It is not
the role of this Court to ""second guess"" the policy decisions made by
elected officials.

 

 

                   The central issue
before this Court is whether it is a basic tenet of the Canadian legal system
that carelessness can never form the fault requirement for a criminal offence. 
Section 86(2) of the Code requires the Crown to establish that an
accused used, carried, handled, shipped or stored a firearm, but did so
""in a careless manner or without reasonable precautions for the safety of
other persons"".   The fault requirement of this provision is, therefore,
to be assessed objectively, which, following this Court's holding in R. v.
Hundal, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, at p. 883, consists of conduct that is a
marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonable person in the
circumstances.  Appellate courts have divided on the constitutional validity of
the fault requirement contained in s. 86(2) of the Code (see most
recently R. v. Durham (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 596 (C.A.) (holding
that s. 86(2) does not violate s. 7 ); and, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal's
decision giving rise to this appeal, (holding that s. 86(2) does violate the Charter )).

 

                   By enacting s.
86(2), Parliament has seen fit to impose on all people owning or using firearms
a specific and rigorous duty of care.  It is a basic tenet of the principles of
fundamental justice that the state not be permitted to punish and deprive of
liberty the morally innocent.  Those who have the capacity to live up to a
standard of care and fail to do so, in circumstances involving inherently
dangerous activities, however, cannot be said to have done nothing wrong.  The
Law Reform Commission of Canada emphasized this point in the following passage
from Workplace Pollution, Working Paper 53 (1986), at pp. 2-73:

 

Certain
kinds of activity involve the control of technology (cars, explosives,
firearms) with the inherent potential to do such serious damage to life and
limb that the law is justified in paying special attention to the individuals
in control.  Failing to act in a way which indicates respect for the inherent
potential for harm of those technologies, after having voluntarily assumed
control of them (no one has to drive, use explosives, or keep guns) is
legitimately regarded as criminal. [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   This Court has, in
the past, acknowledged Parliament's rationale in enacting gun control
offences.  Writing for the majority in R. v. Schwartz, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 443, at p. 483, McIntyre J. stated the following:

 

The Code
has included provisions for the control, use and possession of firearms since
the enactment of the 1892 Criminal Code, S.C. 1892, c. 29, s. 105.  That
section prohibited the possession of pistols and air guns at other than
specific places and, as well, provided for exemptions from the operation of the
section.  Since that time, there have been successive amendments which without
exception have strengthened the controls upon possession and use of firearms.

 

                                                                    ...

 

It
is evident that the strict control of handguns has been and remains an
essential feature of the Canadian gun control laws.

 

                   It
is clear that the overall intent of Parliament in enacting Part II.1 of the Criminal
Code  was to prohibit the acquisition and use of weapons save in accordance
with the strict controls it prescribed.

 

                   In s. 86(2),
Parliament has addressed the threat posed by the use and storage of firearms by
rendering those whose conduct shows a marked departure from the standard of
care of a reasonably prudent person subject to criminal liability and possible
imprisonment.   The nature of the objective standard for the determination of
fault was concisely stated by McLachlin J. in the case of R. v. Hundal,
supra, in which she stated the following (at p. 872):

 

...
the question is not what was in the accused's mind but the absence of the
mental state of care.  This want of due care is inferred from conduct of the
accused.  If that conduct evinces a want of care judged by the standard of a
reasonable person in similar circumstances, the necessary fault is
established.  The relevant circumstances may include circumstances personal to
the accused, relating to whether the accused lacked the capacities or powers
necessary to attain the mental state of care required in the circumstances.

 

In Hundal, this Court was
unanimously of the view that, in the appropriate context, negligence can be an
acceptable basis of liability which meets the fault requirement of s. 7  of the Charter .

                   The objective test
for negligence is discussed in R. v. Gosset, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 000,
released this same day.  In Gosset, I found that the proper
interpretation of the fault element under s. 86(2) is conduct that constitutes
a marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent person. 
If a reasonable doubt exists either that the conduct in question did not
constitute a marked departure from that standard of care, or that reasonable
precautions were taken to discharge the duty of care in the circumstances, a
verdict of acquittal must follow.  In Gosset, I found that the objective
assessment of fault also had to consider the capacity of an accused to meet the
standard of care required in the circumstances, and the accused's ability to
control or compensate for his or her incapacities.  There is, however, no
""reverse onus"" on an accused to establish on the balance of
probabilities that he or she exercised due diligence in order to negate a
finding of fault under s. 86(2).  

 

                   As I indicate in Gosset,
civil negligence and ""penal"" negligence must be distinguished from
one another.  In the context of penal negligence, where a finding of
carelessness may result in imprisonment, the assessment of liability is no
longer directed, as it is in the civil context, to the apportionment of loss;
rather, that assessment has become linked to the punishment of morally
blameworthy conduct, in order to avoid punishing those who could not have acted
other than they did.  

 

                   In order to conform
with the principle of fundamental justice that the morally innocent not be
deprived of liberty, the objective assessment of fault under s. 86(2) must
allow for the existence of a reasonable doubt as to either the sufficiency of
the precautions taken by the accused to avoid the creation of risk, or the
capacity of the accused to meet the standard of care of a reasonably prudent
person in the circumstances to result in an acquittal.  Based on the
interpretation of this section in R. v. Gosset set out above, I find s.
86(2) satisfies the minimum fault requirement under s. 7 .

 

(2)  Stigma Analysis

 

                   The only remaining
question, therefore, is to determine whether the social stigma which attaches
to a conviction under this provision is sufficiently grave to warrant imposing
a subjective fault requirement for s. 86(2) of the Code.  This analysis
must consider both the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of
a person who engages in such conduct.  As a supplemental factor, the penalties
to which the offence gives rise should also be considered.   

 

                   Section 86(2)
renders a person convicted liable to imprisonment for up to two years for a
first offence, and up to five years for a second offence.  In Wholesale
Travel Group Inc., supra, where the Court was considering a statute
which also provided for up to five years' imprisonment, I concluded the
following (at p. 185):

 

A
conviction for false/misleading advertising will rest on a variety of facts,
many of which will not reveal any dishonesty but, rather, carelessness
and the conviction of same does not brand the accused as being dishonest.
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   In my view, applying
this same reasoning to s. 86(2) of the Code, given the nature of the
offence, the absence of any proof of advertence in the imposition of a
conviction, and the range of punishment upon conviction, there is not
sufficient stigma arising from a conviction under s. 86(2) to require a
subjective mens rea.

 

                   The stigma
attaching to a conviction under s. 86(2) has been recently examined by Arbour
J.A. in R. v. Durham, supra, at pp. 611-12.  Arbour J.A.
offered the following observations regarding the importance of the standard of
fault in the analysis of social stigma, at p. 612:

 

A
conviction for careless storage of a firearm, known to comport no subjective
awareness of the risk created by the conduct, and otherwise not associated with
any other form of social deviance, would not carry the same stigma as a
conviction for careless use of a firearm by a person shown to have deliberately
created or undertaken a substantial and unjustifiable risk, with full awareness
of the danger created.  Aside from the basic assertion that every criminal
conviction generates a significant social stigma, which is true as far as it
goes, the more precise appreciation of what distinguishes the stigma attached
to a conviction for fraud, from the stigma of a conviction for sexual assault,
possession of counterfeit money or careless storage of a firearm, depends on a
multitude of factors, including not only the social repugnance of the conduct,
but the degree of fault with which it is committed.

 

After taking into account these factors,
Arbour J.A. concluded that s. 86(2) of the Code does not give rise to
sufficient social stigma to require a subjective mens rea under s. 7  of
the Charter .  I agree with this conclusion.

 

VI.              Disposition

 

                   Based on the above
analysis, I would answer the constitutional questions as follows:

 

 

1.Does
s. 86(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , infringe or deny
the right to life, liberty and security of the person, and the right not to be
deprived of that right, except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice, as guaranteed by s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

Answer:       No.

 

                   It is, therefore,
unnecessary to proceed to the second constitutional question concerning s. 1 .

 

                   The appeal is
allowed, the stay is lifted, and the matter should proceed to trial.

 

                   The judgment of
L'Heureux-Dubé, Cory and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. -- This appeal
considers a pre-trial motion challenging the constitutional status of s. 86(2) 
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , under s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Mr. Finlay was charged with storing
firearms and ammunition in a careless manner, contrary to s. 86(2) .  The facts
and judgments below are set out by the Chief Justice.

 

                   I agree with the
reasons of the Chief Justice, save for his adoption of his reasons for the
objective test for penal negligence discussed in R. v. Gosset, [1993] 3
S.C.R. 000, released concurrently.  I refer to my reasons in R. v. Gosset
in this regard, and would adopt those reasons in this appeal.  I would answer
the constitutional questions as does the Chief Justice.  The appeal is allowed,
the stay is lifted, and the matter should proceed to trial.

Criminal law ‑‑ Evidence ‑‑
Children ‑‑ Accused convicted of sexual offences on basis of
children's testimony ‑‑ Proper approach to evidence of young
children ‑‑ Whether Court of Appeal erred in overturning
convictions.

 

The accused was charged with indecent assault, gross
indecency and sexual assault against three young girls.  The youngest girl, his
niece, was between two and four years old when the incidents occurred, seven
when they were reported to the authorities, and nine at the time of trial.  The
other two girls were his step‑daughters.  The younger one was between
nine and ten at the time of the events, eleven when they were reported, and
twelve at the time of trial, while the oldest girl was ten at the time of the
events, fourteen at the time of reporting and sixteen at the time of trial.  At
the trial the girls described the incidents out of which the charges arose, and
the accused denied the allegations.  The evidence of the oldest child was
uncontradicted, apart from the accused's denial, and internally consistent, but
the evidence of the two younger children revealed a number of inconsistencies
and was contradicted in some respects.  The accused was convicted on all five
counts.  The Court of Appeal set aside the convictions and entered acquittals. 
It found that there was ""really no confirmatory evidence"", that the
evidence of the two younger children was ""fraught with inaccuracy""
and that neither of the older children was ""aware or concerned that
anything untoward occurred"".

 

Held:  The appeal
should be allowed.

 








In determining whether the trier of fact could
reasonably have reached the conclusion that the accused is guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt, a court of appeal must re‑examine and to some extent
reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence.  This applies to verdicts
based on findings of credibility.  The test is whether a jury or judge properly
instructed and acting reasonably could have convicted.  In applying this test
the appeal court should show great deference to findings of credibility made at
trial.  While the Court of Appeal thus did not err in this case in re‑examining
and reweighing the evidence, it did err in setting aside the convictions.  The
law concerning the evidence of children has undergone two major changes in
recent years.  First, the notion, found at common law and codified in
legislation, that the evidence of children was inherently unreliable and
therefore to be treated with special caution has been eliminated.  Thus various
provisions requiring that a child's evidence be corroborated have been
repealed.  Second, there is a new appreciation that it may be wrong to apply
adult tests for credibility to the evidence of children.  While the evidence of
children is still subject to the same standard of proof as the evidence of
adult witnesses in criminal cases, it should be approached not from the
perspective of rigid stereotypes, but on a common sense basis, taking into
account the strengths and weaknesses which characterize the evidence offered in
the particular case.  The Court of Appeal went too far in this case in finding
lacunae in the evidence which did not exist and in applying a stringent,
critical approach to the evidence.  It appears to have been influenced by the
old stereotypes relating to the inherent unreliability of children's evidence
and the ""normal"" behaviour of victims of sexual abuse and to have
placed insufficient weight on the trial judge's findings of credibility.  The
verdicts in this case were ones which a properly instructed jury (or judge),
acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 








McLachlin J. -- This case raises the issue of the proper limits of appellate
jurisdiction to overturn a conviction under s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  It also raises the question of the approach
which should be taken to the evidence of children.

 

Facts

 

The respondent was convicted on three counts of
indecent assault, one count of gross indecency and one count of sexual assault
against three young girls, B.W., M.W. and S.W.  Without going into the rather
complex details of the family relationship, it may be simply stated that the
respondent lived with and assumed a quasi-paternal role vis-à-vis the three
girls, being the uncle of B.W. and having been married to the mother of S.W.
and M.W.  

 

The first three charges (two of indecent assault and
one of gross indecency) concerned B.W.  She was between two and four years old
when the incidents occurred in 1981-82, seven years old when the offences were
reported to the authorities, and nine years old at the time of trial.

 

The fourth charge (of sexual assault) concerned M.W. 
She was between nine and ten at the time of the events in question, eleven when
the offences were reported, and twelve at the time of trial.

 








The fifth charge (of indecent assault) concerned S.W. 
She was ten years old at the time of the events in question, fourteen at the
time of reporting, and sixteen at the time of trial.

 

The substance of the charges is as follows.  B.W.
alleged that while she was living with the respondent and his wife (her uncle
and aunt) in the red brick house in Napanee, the respondent would come and take
her from her bed, which she shared with S.W. and M.W., and lead her upstairs to
his bedroom, where he would take down her pants, drop his pyjamas, and rub his
soft penis over her vagina.  B.W. stated in evidence that this happened two or
three times a week.  On one occasion, the respondent asked B.W. to suck on his
""dink"", which she did (this incident is the basis of the gross
indecency charge).  B.W. also described a further incident which occurred on a
camping trip, when the respondent took her into the family's van, laid her on
the floor, and rubbed his penis over her vagina.

 

S.W. described two incidents in the red brick house in
Napanee.  S.W. and the respondent were fully clothed throughout both
incidents.  The first incident began as play-wrestling, but the respondent
began to breathe heavily and rubbed his erect penis against her buttocks.  In
the second incident, the respondent lay down beside her in bed, and she could
feel his erect penis against her buttocks.

 








M.W. described three incidents involving the
respondent.  Both M.W. and the respondent were fully clothed throughout all
three incidents.  In the first incident, she was sitting on the respondent's
lap while he combed her hair and rubbed his erect penis against her lower
back.  In the second and third incidents, the respondent rolled M.W. onto the
floor, forced her legs apart and rubbed his penis against her vagina.

 

The respondent testified in his own defence. He
admitted to wrestling with M.W. and S.W., and to brushing the girls' hair, but
denied all the allegations that formed the basis of the charges against him.
Aside from the respondent's denial, the evidence of the oldest child, S.W., was
uncontradicted and internally consistent. The evidence of the two younger
children, however, quite apart from the respondent's denial, revealed a number
of inconsistencies and was contradicted in some respects. 

 

Judgments Below

 

A.  Ontario District Court (Judge O'Flynn, June 27, 1988)

 

Judge O'Flynn convicted the respondent on all five
counts.  The trial judge instructed himself (correctly, in my opinion) on the
importance of corroborative evidence in cases of this kind:

 

I am considering allegations of sexual misconduct
where young children are involved and by reason of the fact that such acts were
alleged to have occurred in secret, it is important to look at the evidence to
see if there is other evidence which tends to confirm the evidence of the
particular complainant enhancing the probability that the complainant was
telling the truth on the material issues.  However, the law does not require
the evidence of the particular complainant to be supported in order to convict
the accused and corroboration in law is not necessary.

 

The trial judge then reviewed the evidence, noting the
inconsistencies.

 








The trial judge's conclusion, in its entirety, was as
follows (omitting the re-statement of the five charges against the respondent
and the full names of the girls):

 

I have considered each complainant's intelligence,
memory, power of observation, interest in the outcome and demeanor in the
witness box.  There does not appear to be collusion between the girls.  I have
considered the inconsistencies in the girls' evidence which I have referred to,
as minor and attributable to their youth and the passage of time.

 

I have also considered the fact that B.W. did not
promptly disclose the alleged abuse to anyone, however, I have also considered
the explanation of why by B.W.  [The trial judge may be referring here to
B.W.'s testimony that the respondent had told her not to tell anybody, ""or
you'll be in trouble"" (in-chief, C.O.A. p. 38).]  I have considered the
young age of the children and particularly B.W. when the alleged offences were
to have taken place and the time that has passed since the alleged incidents.

 

                                                                    ...

 

I accept the evidence of the children, B.W., M.W. and
S.W. in regard to the alleged offences and I find the accused guilty as charged
on Count Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (as amended).

 

The respondent was sentenced on September 9, 1988. 
The total sentence was for fifteen months, broken down as follows:

 

Count 1 (indecent assault on B.W.):                                   │

 

Count 2 (gross indecency on B.W.):                                  ├──9
months concurrent

 

Count 3 (indecent assault on B.W.):                                   │

 

Count 4 (sexual assault on M.W.):                                     3
months consecutive

 

Count 5 (indecent assault on
S.W.):                                   3 months consecutive

 








B.                Ontario Court
of Appeal (Brook and Krever JJ.A. and Craig J. (ad hoc), December 21, 1989)

 

The following is the text of the Court of Appeal's
endorsement:

 

This case has caused us very great
concern. The case has been carefully argued. We recognize the advantage of the
trial judge, but also the responsibility of this court. Yebes v. The Queen
(1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 417 at p. 430. Giving the matter our best consideration,
we are all of the opinion that on this evidence these convictions cannot safely
stand. There was really no confirmatory evidence, the evidence of the two
younger children was fraught with inaccuracy and in the case of the older
children [it was] perfectly clear that neither was aware or concerned that
anything untoward occurred which is really the best test of the quality of the
acts. The appeal is allowed, the conviction is set aside and an acquittal is
entered.

 

Issues

 

The central issue is whether the Court of Appeal erred
in setting aside the convictions entered by the trial judge.  This raises a
number of subsidiary issues:

 

(1) What is the standard for review under s. 686(1) (a)(i),
and did the Court of Appeal depart from it?

 

(2) Did the Court of Appeal err in the way it treated
the evidence of the children?  In particular:

 

(a) Did the Court of Appeal err in relying on the
alleged lack of confirmatory evidence?

 








(b) Did the Court of Appeal err in its treatment of
the inaccuracies in the children's evidence?

 

(c) Did the Court of Appeal err in relying on the
alleged fact that neither  of the older children was aware of or concerned
about the nature of the acts?

 

Analysis

 

l.                  What is the
Standard of Review and Did the Court of Appeal Depart From It?

 

The appellant contends for a narrow right of review: a
court of appeal can set aside a conviction based on findings of credibility, in
its submission, only if the trier of fact proceeded on the basis of an error of
law or if evidence is accepted on a central issue which cannot logically be
true given other undisputed facts.  The respondent, on the other hand, argues
that a court of appeal must look at all the evidence, consider its probity and
weight, and set aside the conviction only if it concludes that the trier of
fact could not reasonably have come to the conclusion that the offence was
proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

 








The ambit of the powers of an appellate court under s.
686(1) (a)(i) has been considered by this Court in a number of recent
cases.  The leading case is probably R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168. 
Writing for the Court, McIntyre J. reviewed the earlier case of Corbett v.
The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 275.  McIntyre J. acknowledged that there was
some ambiguity in Corbett as to the test to be applied.  The ambiguity
was between a standard that no jury could possibly have reached the
verdict at trial, and that no jury could reasonably have reached the
verdict.  McIntyre J. resolved the ambiguity in favour of the ""reasonably
reached"" standard (at p. 185):

 

I am in agreement with Hutcheon J.A. that the word
""possibly"" in this context is inappropriate.  In my view, to adopt
literally the proposition that the appellate court could only consider whether
the impugned verdict could possibly have been reached would render
review on appeal under the subsection almost impossible.  ""Reasonably
could have reached"" must be the test, and from a reading of the whole of
Pigeon J.'s judgment [in Corbett] I am of the view that it was what was
intended.  The concept of reasonableness is clearly expressed in the section
which speaks of an unreasonable verdict.  Therefore, curial review is invited
whenever a jury goes beyond a reasonable standard.  In my view, then, Corbett
is the governing case and the test is ""whether the verdict is one that a
properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have
rendered"".  [Emphasis in original.]

 

McIntyre J. acknowledged that in conducting a review
under s. 686(1) (a)(i), a court of appeal must, to some extent at least,
re-examine and reweigh the evidence (at p. 186):

 

The function of the Court of Appeal, under s. 613(1) (a)(i)
of the Criminal Code , goes beyond merely finding that there is evidence
to support a conviction.  The Court must determine on the whole of the evidence
whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially,
could reasonably have rendered.  While the Court of Appeal must not merely
substitute its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the test the Court
must re-examine and to some extent reweigh and consider the effect of the
evidence.  This process will be the same whether the case is based on
circumstantial or direct evidence.  In the Court of Appeal, the majority clearly
found that there was sufficient evidence to justify the verdict and both
Macdonald and Craig JJ.A. rejected all rational inferences offering an
alternative to the conclusion of guilt.  It is therefore clear that the law was
correctly understood and applied.

 








Yebes has been applied
in at least two subsequent decisions of this court: R. v. Howard, [1989]
1 S.C.R. 1337; and R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909.  In Howard,
Lamer J. (as he then was), writing for three of five justices on the panel,
adopted the test of McIntyre J. in Yebes in upholding the conviction (at
p. 1349):

 

I have read evidence and have come
to the conclusion that a verdict of first degree murder ""is one that a
properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered""
(per McIntyre J. for the Court in R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
168, at p. 185).

 

Similarly, in S. (P.L.), Sopinka J., writing
for himself, Lamer C.J., and La Forest and McLachlin JJ., adopted the test set
out in Yebes.  Sopinka J. emphasized that the court of appeal is
properly engaged in a review of the facts pursuant to s. 686(1) (a)(i)
(at p. 915):

 

In an appeal founded on s. 686(1) (a)(i)
the court is engaged in a review of the facts.  The role of the Court of Appeal
is to determine whether on the facts that were before the trier of fact a jury
properly instructed and acting reasonably could convict.  The court reviews the
evidence that was before the trier of fact and after re-examining and, to some
extent, reweighing the evidence, determines whether it meets the test.  See R.
v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168.                                                                      

 








It is thus clear that a court of appeal, in
determining whether the trier of fact could reasonably have reached the
conclusion that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, must
re-examine, and to some extent at least, reweigh and consider the effect of the
evidence.  The only question remaining is whether this rule applies to verdicts
based on findings of credibility.  In my opinion, it does.  The test remains
the same: could a jury or judge properly instructed and acting reasonably have
convicted?  That said, in applying the test the court of appeal should show
great deference to findings of credibility made at trial.  This Court has
repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position
of the trier of fact on matters of credibility: White v. The King,
[1947] S.C.R. 268, at p. 272; R. v. M. (S.H.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 446, at
pp. 465-66. The trial judge has the advantage, denied to the appellate court,
of seeing and hearing the evidence of witnesses.  However, as a matter of law
it remains open to an appellate court to overturn a verdict based on findings
of credibility where, after considering all the evidence and having due regard
to the advantages afforded to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is
unreasonable.

 

I therefore conclude that the Court of Appeal did not
err in re-examining and reweighing the evidence, as the appellant contends. 
That leaves, however, the question of whether, on all the evidence, the Court
of Appeal was entitled to conclude that the judge could not reasonably have
decided that the accused was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 

 

2.                Did
the Court of Appeal Err in the Way it Approached the Evidence of the Children?

 

The appellant contends that the Court of Appeal made
errors of fact and of law in the process of re-examining and reweighing the
evidence of the children which led it wrongly to conclude that the verdicts
were unreasonable.

 








Before turning to the particular errors alleged, I
pause to consider the general question of how courts should approach the
evidence of young children.  The law affecting the evidence of children has
undergone two major changes in recent years.  The first is removal of the
notion, found at common law and codified in legislation, that the evidence of
children was inherently unreliable and therefore to be treated with special
caution. Thus, for example, the requirement that a child's evidence be
corroborated has been removed: s. 586 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, which prohibited the conviction of a person on the uncorroborated
evidence of a child testifying unsworn, was repealed by An Act to amend the
Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act, S.C. 1987, c. 24, s. 15,
effective January 1, 1988. Similar provisions of the Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, and Young Offenders Act, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c.
110, have also been eliminated. The repeal of provisions creating a legal
requirement that children's evidence be corroborated does not prevent the judge
or jury from treating a child’s evidence with caution where such caution is
merited in the circumstances of the case.  But it does revoke the assumption
formerly applied to all evidence of children, often unjustly, that children’s
evidence is always less reliable than the evidence of adults.  So if a court
proceeds to discount a child’s evidence automatically, without regard to the
circumstances of the particular case, it will have fallen into an error.

 








The second change in the attitude of the law toward
the evidence of children in recent years is a new appreciation that it may be
wrong to apply adult tests for credibility to the evidence of children.  One
finds emerging a new sensitivity to the peculiar perspectives of children. 
Since children may experience the world differently from adults, it is hardly
surprising that details important to adults, like time and place, may be
missing from their recollection.  Wilson J. recognized this in R. v. B. (G.),
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 54-55, when, in referring to submissions regarding
the court of appeal judge's treatment of the evidence of the complainant, she
said that 

 

... it seems to me that he was simply suggesting that
the judiciary should take a common sense approach when dealing with the
testimony of young children and not impose the same exacting standard on them
as it does on adults. However, this is not to say that the courts should not
carefully assess the credibility of child witnesses and I do not read his
reasons as suggesting that the standard of proof must be lowered when dealing
with children as the appellants submit.  Rather, he was expressing concern that
a flaw, such as a contradiction, in a child's testimony should not be given the
same effect as a similar flaw in the testimony of an adult. I think his concern
is well founded and his comments entirely appropriate. While children may not
be able to recount precise details and communicate the when and where of an
event with exactitude, this does not mean that they have misconceived what
happened to them and who did it. In recent years we have adopted a much more
benign attitude to children's evidence, lessening the strict standards of oath
taking and corroboration, and I believe that this is a desirable development.
The credibility of every witness who testifies before the courts must, of
course, be carefully assessed but the standard of the ""reasonable
adult"" is not necessarily appropriate in assessing the credibility of
young children.

 

As Wilson J. emphasized in B. (G.), these
changes in the way the courts look at the evidence of children do not mean that
the evidence of children should not be subject to the same standard of proof as
the evidence of adult witnesses in criminal cases.  Protecting the liberty of
the accused and guarding against the injustice of the conviction of an innocent
person require a solid foundation for a verdict of guilt, whether the
complainant be an adult or a child.  What the changes do mean is that we
approach the evidence of children not from the perspective of rigid
stereotypes, but on what Wilson J. called a ""common sense"" basis,
taking into account the strengths and weaknesses which characterize the
evidence offered in the particular case.

 








It is neither desirable nor possible to state hard and
fast rules as to when a witness's evidence should be assessed by reference to
""adult"" or ""child"" standards -- to do so would be to create
anew stereotypes potentially as rigid and unjust as those which the recent developments
in the law's approach to children's evidence have been designed to dispel.
Every person giving testimony in court, of whatever age, is an individual,
whose credibility and evidence must be assessed by reference to criteria
appropriate to her mental development, understanding and ability to
communicate. But I would add this. In general, where an adult is testifying as
to events which occurred when she was a child, her credibility should be
assessed according to criteria applicable to her as an adult witness. Yet with
regard to her evidence pertaining to events which occurred in childhood, the
presence of inconsistencies, particularly as to peripheral matters such as time
and location, should be considered in the context of the age of the witness at
the time of the events to which she is testifying.

 








Against this background, I turn to a more particular
consideration of the Court of Appeal's treatment of the evidence in this case. 
First, the Court referred to the fact that ""there was really no
confirmatory evidence"".  This suggests that the Court may have been
applying the old rule that the evidence of a child could not found a conviction
unless it was confirmed or corroborated by independent evidence.  It may be
that in considering the whole of the evidence in accordance with the Yebes
test, a court of appeal will take into account, along with other factors, the
presence or absence of confirmatory evidence.  So the reference to lack of
confirmatory evidence is not in itself an error of law.  But standing as it
does as a bald proposition unrelated to a detailed examination of the evidence,
it does support the submission that the Court of Appeal was treating the
evidence of the children as being inherently less reliable than adult evidence
might be.

 

In any event, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding
that there was no supporting evidence.  As the trial judge noted, B.W.'s
allegation that the respondent took her into the family's van on a camping
trip, and once inside the van, indecently assaulted her, was confirmed to some
extent by the evidence of her aunt and S.W., both of whom recalled the
respondent taking B.W. to the van on such an outing. In addition, the testimony
of M.W. may be considered to support that of S.W. with respect to the wrestling
incident S.W. alleged. Although M.W.'s description of the respondent's actions
on that occasion differed from S.W.'s, her testimony still confirmed that of
S.W. in a number of particulars.

 








The Court of Appeal next referred to the fact that the
evidence of the younger children was fraught with inaccuracy.  This is true,
particularly with respect to B.W.'s evidence.  Some of the inconsistencies are
minor, for example an error on the distance from a van to a ball game many
years ago.  Others are more significant, relating to the sleeping arrangements
of the three children, the location of bedrooms in the house and possibly the
respondent's nighttime attire.  While it was the proper task of the Court of
Appeal to consider such inconsistencies, one finds no mention of the fact that
the trial judge was alive to them and resolved them to his satisfaction in his
reasons for judgment, nor of the fact that many of the inconsistencies may be
explained by reference to the fact that a young child might not be paying
particular attention to sleeping arrangements or clothing or that the children
had lived in a variety of different arrangements, which might well have given
rise to confusion on such details.

 

Finally, the Court of Appeal relied on the fact that
neither of the older children was ""aware or concerned that anything
untoward occurred which is really the best test of the quality of the
acts.""  This reference reveals reliance on the stereotypical but suspect
view that the victims of sexual aggression are likely to report the acts, a
stereotype which found expression in the now discounted doctrine of recent
complaint.  In fact, the literature suggests the converse may be true; victims
of abuse often in fact do not disclose it, and if they do, it may not be until
a substantial length of time has passed.  In any event, the Court of Appeal
erred in concluding that there was no complaint. In fact the two older girls
did complain to their mother; S.W. about the respondent getting into bed with
her, and both M.W. and S.W., it would seem, about the way in which he wrestled
with them.

 

In summary, the Court of Appeal was right to be
concerned about the quality of the evidence and correct in entering upon a
re-examination and reweighing, to some extent, of the evidence.  It went too
far, however, in finding lacunae in the evidence which did not exist and in
applying too critical an approach to the evidence, an approach which appears to
have placed insufficient weight on the trial judge's findings of credibility,
influenced as the Court of Appeal appears to have been by the old stereotypes
relating to the inherent unreliability of children's evidence and the
""normal"" behaviour of victims of sexual abuse.

 








Placing myself, as I must, in the position of the
Court of Appeal (see Criminal Code  s. 695 , and the comments of McIntyre
J. in Yebes, supra, at p. 186), I conclude that we are here
concerned with verdicts which ""a properly instructed jury [or judge],
acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered"", to repeat the words of
Yebes.  I would allow the appeal and restore the convictions.

acting as financial investment advisor selling housing units to his clients ‑‑

R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 426(1) (a).

 

                   The accused was
charged with four counts of corruptly accepting a reward or benefit contrary to
s. 426(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . He was one of the
principals of a company (""KPA"") which offers, for a fee, financial
planning services, including advice respecting investment in real estate and
tax planning strategies. In 1980, the accused persuaded a property development
company to give KPA the exclusive right to sell the units of its MURB project.
KPA sold all the units, mainly to its clients, within the relatively short time
prescribed in the agreement and received a commission from the development
company for each unit sold. These commissions were the same as those which the
development company would have paid to any salesman. At trial, the evidence
indicated that KPA's clients were unaware of the commissions paid by the
development company to KPA. At their initial meeting with new clients, KPA only
gave vague and general information as to its sources of remuneration on a
""white board"". The accused himself later advised his associates that,
with respect to the MURB project, he did not want further disclosures in
writing. In defence, the accused testified that the clients purchasing the MURB
units should have known of the commissions to be paid to KPA from two small
references in the Offering Memoranda on the ""Issuing and Sales
Costs"". The accused was convicted on all four counts. The trial judge
found that he had an obligation to make full, frank and fair disclosure of the
sales commission. The majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction.
The question raised on this appeal is what the Crown must prove in order to
obtain a conviction pursuant to s. 426(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . In particular, this Court must determine whether s. 426  has any
application where the party making the payments was not part of a corrupt
bargain with the taker.

 

                   Held (Sopinka J. dissenting): The appeal
should be dismissed.

 

                   Per L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, Cory and
Iacobucci JJ.: In preserving the integrity of the agency relationship and
protecting the vulnerable principals, s. 426 of the Code
acknowledges the importance of that relationship in our society. There are
three elements to the actus reus of the offence set out in
s. 426(1) (a)(ii) as they apply to an accused agent/taker with
regard to the acceptance of a commission: (1) the existence of an agency
relationship; (2) the accepting by the agent of a benefit as consideration
for doing or forbearing to do any act in relation to the affairs of the agent's
principal; and (3) the failure by the agent to make adequate and timely
disclosure of the source, amount and nature of the benefit. The word
""corruptly"" adds that third element to the actus reus of the
offence. This word in the context of secret commissions means secretly or
without the requisite disclosure. The Crown is not required to prove the
existence of a corrupt bargain between the giver and the taker of the reward or
benefit. It is thus possible to convict a taker despite the innocence of
the giver. 

 

                   The requisite mens
rea must also be established for each element of the actus reus.
Pursuant to s. 426(1) (a)(ii), an accused agent/taker (1) must be
aware of the agency relationship, (2) must knowingly accept the benefit as
consideration for an act to be undertaken in relation to the affairs of the
principal, and (3) must be aware of the extent of the disclosure to the
principal or lack thereof. When an accused is aware that some disclosure was
made, the court must determine whether, in all the circumstances of the
particular case, the disclosure was in fact adequate and timely. 

                   Here, the
Crown has established all the elements requisite for conviction under
s. 426. It is clear that an agency relationship existed between the
accused and his clients and that he was aware of the existence of that
relationship. It is also clear that the nature of the commission paid by
the development company was to encourage the accused to influence his clients
to purchase the MURB units and that he was aware of this intention. He accepted
the commission secretly and influenced the affairs of his principals. Finally,
the payment of the commission was not disclosed in an adequate and timely
manner. At the time of the sales, KPA's clients were not aware that KPA would receive
a sales commission from the development company for each MURB unit sold to KPA
clients. KPA disclosure of its sources of remuneration was vague and general
and did not meet the objectives of s. 426. The accused himself made a
conscious decision to limit the extent of the disclosure. While the Offering
Memoranda for the MURB units contained two one-line references to ""Issuing
and Sales Costs"" for the projects, there was no specific reference to the
fact that it was the accused who was to receive these costs as a commission. 

 

                   Per McLachlin J.: Lack of disclosure is
an element of the actus reus of the offence of taking a secret
commission under s. 426(1)(a)(ii) of the Code, and awareness of
that lack of disclosure is an element of its mens rea. No corrupt
bargain is required. However, since criminal law must be certain and
definitive, the time and the degree of disclosure must be clearly defined.
Agents must be given fair notice in advance whether a proposed course of
conduct is criminal. With respect to the timing of disclosure, certainty
requires that where the gravamen of the offence is the taking of a secret
commission disclosure to the principal must be made by the time the commission
is accepted. If the agent accepts a commission without beforehand (or
simultaneously) advising the principal of the fact, the offence is established.
With respect to the degree of disclosure, it is not enough to state at the
beginning of a relationship between an agent and his principal that commissions
may from time to time be taken. The requirements of s. 426(1) (a)(ii)
will only be satisfied if the agent discloses to the principal that he will
receive a commission with respect to the transaction in question. The amount of
the commission is secondary and need not be disclosed in order to escape
liability. The communication that the agent will receive a commission with
respect to the particular transaction in issue will put the principal on notice
that the agent is in a potential conflict of interest. Here, since there was no
disclosure of the particular commission to the principals involved, the offence
is made out. 

 

                   Per Sopinka J. (dissenting): When an
agent is charged with accepting a benefit under s. 426(1)(a)(ii) of the Code,
it must be established that he accepted the benefit as a quid pro quo to
influence him. To secure a conviction, the Crown must prove two essentials of
the mental element of the offence: (1) that the benefit was so accepted with
the agent's knowledge or belief that it was given for the purpose of
influencing him; and (2) that the agent entered into the transaction mala
fide. The first requirement looks to the state of mind of the agent at the
time of the transaction. The corruption in this action is the belief that the
valuable consideration is intended to influence the agent to show favour to
some person in relation to the affairs of his principal. The taker is thus
caught even if he was mistaken as to the true intention of the giver. The
offence is complete without the necessity of showing that the agent was in fact
influenced in his actions. It is his state of mind in accepting the
consideration that is crucial. The second requirement is most easily satisfied
through proof of dishonesty.  Non-disclosure by the taker is not synonymous
with the terms ""corruptly"" or mala fides, although it may be a
strong indicator that the agent has acted in bad faith. In some situations
disclosure or the intent to disclose will be highly relevant.  

 

                   In this case, the
accused should be acquitted. While he sold most of the units to his
clients, that was not because he was influenced by the development company to
do so nor because he believed that this was the intended purpose of either the
agreement with that company or the payments. The agreement was entered into at
arm's length, the commissions were the same amount as was paid to any other
salesmen and they were to be paid regardless of to whom the units were sold.
The decision to sell to his clients was one that the accused made unilaterally.
His failure to make full disclosure amounted to a breach of his duty but he is
not guilty of the offence charged.

                   Cory
J. -- The question raised
on this appeal is what the Crown must prove in order to obtain a conviction
pursuant to s. 426(1) (a) (formerly s. 383(1)(a)) of the
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .  Particularly, it must
be determined whether the section requires that there be a ""corrupt
bargain"" between the ""giver"" and ""taker"" of the reward
or benefit.

 

Factual Background

 

                   The appellant
William Kelly was one of the principals of Kelly, Peters and Associates
Ltd. (""KPA"").  This was the central company of a group of companies
which offered financial planning services to the general public.  KPA and its
related companies offered investment counselling to their clients and provided
services to implement their planning advice.  Clients of KPA were generally
successful business people and professionals who earned a good income and
required financial advice.

 

                   New clients were,
as a rule, charged an advisory fee of $2,500 for a personalized ""Base
Plan"".  The Plan set out the client's financial situation and made certain
basic recommendations regarding the organization of the client's financial
affairs.  These basic recommendations related to matters such as having a will drawn,
purchasing life insurance and investing in registered retirement savings plans.

 

                   Clients of KPA paid
additional advisory or counselling fees for advice respecting investments in
real estate and tax planning strategies.  These fees ranged between $2,000 and
$30,000 annually depending on the nature of the advice.

 

                   Kelly was convicted
of charges arising out of his dealings with Qualico Developments Ltd.
(""Qualico""), a property development company.  Each count related to a
specific apartment building development marketed by Qualico.  Units in these
buildings were sold pursuant to the provisions of Canadian tax law respecting
Multiple Use Residential Buildings, commonly referred to as MURBs.  There is no
question that MURBs were often purchased as tax shelters.

 

                   Prior to the fall
of 1980, KPA had never recommended the purchase of MURBs to its clients.  In
October of that year, Kelly approached Qualico with regard to a MURB project
being built in Vancouver and referred to as Mirror Development.  Kelly told the
Vancouver branch manager of Qualico that KPA provided financial advice to
""good solid"" clients who would be interested in investing in the
MURBs of the Mirror Development.  He persuaded Qualico to give KPA the
exclusive right to sell the 112 units of this development.

 

                   Qualico had never
before dealt with Kelly.  As a result KPA was required to post a performance
bond of $112,000.  The terms of the agreement required KPA to sell all the
units within a relatively short time.  The agreement was signed on November 7,
1980.  By the 24th of November, all the units were sold.  KPA received $262,000
for the sale of the units and the performance bond was refunded.  The majority
of the units were sold to KPA clients, although Kelly, his wife, and some of
the associates of KPA bought units as well.

 

                   KPA marketed three
more Qualico projects in the same manner.  It received total commissions from
the four projects of $925,586.  The fees paid by Qualico to KPA were the same
as those which Qualico would have paid to any agent engaged to sell the units.

 

Evidence at Trial

 

                   A cross‑section
of KPA clients testified.  Each one of them had bought units in the Qualico
MURBs.  They all purchased the MURBs upon the recommendation of Kelly or one of
his associates.  They all testified that they were unaware that Qualico paid
KPA a sales commission for each Qualico MURB unit sold to KPA clients.

 

                   At their initial
meeting with new clients, KPA personnel outlined the history of the firm, the
various professional backgrounds of members of the firm, the investment
philosophy of the firm, the services the firm could provide, and the various
sources of compensation that KPA received either directly, or indirectly
through related companies.  The presentation took as a rule from one to one and
half hours.  The explanation of KPA sources of remuneration took less than five
minutes.  Disclosure of the sources of KPA remuneration was never put in
writing to be given to the clients, nor was it raised as a matter of discussion
in the initial meeting with the client.  Kelly testified that his practice was
to write the general sources of KPA remuneration on a ""white board""
during the first meeting with a new client.  Kelly advised associates in his
firm that he did not want to put further disclosures with regard to the MURB
project in writing.

 

                   Kelly, in his
evidence, expressed the opinion that clients purchasing the MURBs should have
known, from the Offering Memoranda, of the commissions to be paid to KPA.  The
Offering Memoranda for each of the four projects were lengthy, somewhat
complicated booklets.  They contained two one‑line references to
""Issuing and Sales Costs"" for the projects.  It is not without
significance that the accused in cross‑examination had great difficulty
finding these references in the booklets despite his reliance upon them as
providing disclosure of the commissions.  The clients of KPA, on the other
hand, indicated that they did not read the Offering Memoranda carefully because
they relied upon the advice for which they were paying KPA.  Significantly, no
MURB projects other than Qualico projects were recommended to clients of KPA.

 

                   In 1982, the
Canadian economy was beset by recession.  Those who had invested in real estate
could neither find buyers for their property nor make payments on their debt
load.  KPA's clients were thoroughly dissatisfied with their investments and
were shocked when they found that the appellant had received substantial
commissions for selling the MURBs.  The appellant was charged with four counts
of corruptly accepting a reward or benefit contrary to s. 383(1)(a)
(now s. 426(1) (a)) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C‑34.  He was convicted on all four counts:  (1987), 1 W.C.B.
(2d) 173.  A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal from
conviction:  (1989), 41 B.C.L.R. (2d) 9, 52 C.C.C. (3d) 137, 73 C.R. (3d) 355. 
He now appeals as of right to this Court based on the dissenting judgment of
Hutcheon J.A.

 

The Judgments Below

 

Provincial Court of British Columbia

 

                   The trial judge
found that the timing of the demand from the clients at KPA for MURBs coincided
precisely with the two‑week period set out in the Qualico agreement for
the sale of the units on the Mirror Development.  Further, he noted that no
other MURBs were recommended to KPA clients until the next Qualico project was
ready.

 

                   The trial judge
then considered the extent of the disclosure of compensation made to the
clients with respect to the Qualico transactions.  He found that most of KPA's
clients were advised verbally that KPA received income from ""real estate
transactions"".  With regard to the terms contained in the Offering
Memoranda pertaining to ""sales costs"" and ""marketing
costs""  he observed that, although some experienced clients might have
assumed from reading them that commission fees were being paid to KPA for the
sale of the MURBs, not one of the clients testified that there was explicit
disclosure with regard to the commissions to be received from Qualico.

 

                   The trial judge was
satisfied that the appellant Kelly was indeed an agent for his clients.  Kelly
held himself out as a professional financial planner with special skills.  He
gave advice on significant and confidential matters.  He specifically set out
to establish a long‑term fiduciary relationship with his clients.  He was
both an advisor and the implementor of the advice for his clients who were, in
that regard, his principals.

 

                   The trial judge
emphasized that the appellant conducted himself ""in a manner that was
calculated to result in enjoying his clients' fullest confidence and
trust"".  He also observed that ""the Accused went a long way out of
his way to deliberately close his clients' eyes to the possibility of
corruption"".  It was his opinion that the appellant did not disclose the
Qualico commissions to his clients.  The essence of the judgment is set out in
these words:

 

. .
. he had an obligation to make full, frank and fair disclosure of the
Qualico fees.  At best on the evidence he deliberately made disclosure of those
fees a remote possibility and not even a probability.  In failing to
make adequate disclosure, I find that the Accused acted dishonestly,
unfaithfully, without integrity and therefore corruptly in accepting the
Qualico fees.

 

                   If
his clients had been provided full, frank and fair disclosure some of them
probably would not have acted any differently.  But some of them might have
been in a better position to negotiate down the amount of advisory fees they
were paying.  Some of them might have questioned both the quality and quantity
of M.U.R.B.s they were told to buy.  Some of them might have invested in other
M.U.R.B.s, the purchase of which would not have resulted in commissions being
paid to the Accused.

 

                   By
contracting secretly with Qualico, the Accused knowingly fettered what he held
out to be his professional judgment and put himself in a criminal conflict of
interest.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

The trial judge therefore found the
appellant guilty as charged on all four counts of the indictment.

 

Court of Appeal (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 137

 

                   Locke J.A., writing
for the majority, quoted from the reasons of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal,
in R. v. Morris (1988), 64 Sask. R. 98, at p. 118, where that court
found that the provisions of s. 383 (now s. 426) are directed toward
the preservation of the integrity of employees and agents of a principal and
those who deal with them.  To that end society has decreed that secret
commissions are not acceptable as they compromise the integrity of our
commercial life.  The essence of this offence involves the taking of a
""secret commission"".  However, if the agent takes a commission with
the full knowledge and consent of his principal then no offence is made out.

 

                   In the opinion of
Locke J.A. the section is designed to prevent agents from being put in a
position of temptation.  He cited R. v. Brown (1956),
116 C.C.C. 287, at p. 289, for the proposition that ""the
act of doing the very thing which the statute forbids is a corrupt act within
the meaning of the word ""corruptly"" used in the section under
consideration"" (p. 154).

 

                   He also determined
that this section does not require a ""corrupt bargain"".  He put his
position in this way (at p. 155):

 

. .
. the statute requires a transaction, but that transaction need be no
more than the giver paying the taker to do something in relation to his
client's affairs, and the taker knowing this.  Such a transaction can be
completely blameless in so far as the giver is concerned, and in the ordinary
course of business.  But the crime is committed by the taker who receives the
money knowing the reason it is paid.  That, in my view, is this case.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   As
I have said, in my opinion the ""corruption"" can be one‑sided
only.  The precise words of the section do not literally require that the other
party to the transaction also be guilty of an offence.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   He was of the view
that the acceptance by Kelly of the commission from Qualico was ""corrupt""
unless sufficient disclosure was made to the clients of KPA.

 

                   He said ""it
cannot be successfully contended that there is no basis for the trial judge's
finding that there had not been sufficient disclosure of the Qualico
commissions"" (p. 159).  In his view, ""[t]he disclosure must be
adequate and full in the sense that the principal must be specifically advised,
or it be otherwise made so crystal clear that he could not deny he ought to
have known.  That was not done in this case"" (p. 160).  As a result
the majority dismissed the appeal.

 

                   Hutcheon J.A.
dissenting found that this section required proof of a ""corrupt
bargain"" between the agent and the third party.  He concluded that this
section had no application in the absence of a corrupt bargain between the
taker and the giver.  He then applied his conclusion to the facts of this case
in these words (at p. 146):

 

. .
. Qualico was not a party to a corrupt bargain.  The commissions were paid at
the ordinary rate and in the ordinary course of business.  Qualico knew nothing
of the relations between Kelly/Peters and its clients.  As I view s. 383 ,
in every case of a completed offence, there must be a giver of the benefit
""in consideration of ..."" and a taker of the benefit ""in consideration
of ..."".  Qualico did not ""give"" anything; it paid
the ordinary commission paid other agents.  In these circumstances s. 383 
of the Criminal Code  has no application.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

Hutcheon J.A. would have allowed the
appeal and set aside the convictions.

 

The Issue

 

                   The issue on appeal
is relatively narrow.  It must be based upon the question of law on which
Hutcheon J.A. dissented from the majority.  The formal order of the Court
of Appeal was carefully drawn and settled by that court.  The portion pertaining
to the dissenting reasons of Hutcheon J.A. is as follows:

 

                   And be it further recorded that The Honourable Mr. Justice
Hutcheon dissented and would have dismissed the appeal, and his dissent was
grounded in whole upon the following questions of law:

 

1.The
essence of the case for the Crown was that the commissions were accepted by
Kelly/Peters secretly and contrary to Section 383(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . 
The main issue on this appeal is whether s. 383  has any application where
the person making the payments was not part of a corrupt bargain with Kelly. 
My conclusion is that s. 383  (now s. 426(1) (a)) has no application in
such circumstances and the conviction must be quashed.

 

                   Thus, it is
apparent that the dissenting reasons give rise to only one question of law. 
Namely, it must be determined whether s. 383  (now s. 426) has any
application where the party making the payments, Qualico, was not part of a
corrupt bargain with the taker, Kelly.  In answering the ""corrupt
bargain"" question, it is necessary to examine this issue in the context of
the elements of the offence and the meaning of ""corruptly"".

 

The Relevant Statutory Provision

 

                   Section 426(1)  of
the Criminal Code  provides:

 

                   426. (1)  Every one commits an
offence who

 

(a)  corruptly

 

(i)gives,
offers or agrees to give or offer to an agent, or

 

(ii)being
an agent, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept from any person,

 

any
reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for doing or
forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act relating to the
affairs or business of his principal or for showing or forbearing to show
favour or disfavour to any person with relation to the affairs or business of
his principal;

 

The Importance of the Agency
Relationship

 

                   Before considering
the purpose of s. 426, something must be said of the importance of the
agency relationship in today's society.  Society today simply could not
function without the services of agents.  The number of the principal/agent
relationships is legion.  It is difficult to sell a house or commercial
property without relying upon a real estate agent.  It is difficult to place
insurance of any kind without consulting an insurance agent.  Holidays are
arranged through a travel agent.  Brokers act as agents in the most complex and
difficult financial transactions.  Solicitors act as agents for their clients.

 

                   With increasing
frequency financial advisors are acting as agents for their clients.  Very
often business and professional people earning a good income are too busy
earning that income to properly arrange their financial affairs.  They turn to
financial advisors for assistance.  The principal/agent relationship is almost
invariably based upon the disclosure by the principal to the agent of
confidential information.  The relationship is founded upon the trust and
confidence that the principal can repose in the advice given and the services performed
by the agent.

 

The Nature of Agency

 

                   In The Law of
Agency (5th ed. 1983), Fridman suggests at p. 9 the following
definition of agency:

 

Agency
is the relationship that exists between two persons when one, called the agent,
is considered in law to represent the other, called the principal, in
such a way as to be able to affect the principal's legal position in respect of
strangers to the relationship by the making of contracts or the disposition of
property.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   The principal must
be able to place trust and confidence in the agent since the agent has the
authority to affect the legal position of the principal.  This is perhaps the
focus of the relationship.  In essence the agent acts to achieve the same
results that would have been obtained if the principal had acted on his or her
own account.  The influence the agent can have on the affairs of the principal
and the power to take action on behalf of the principal are significant.  They
are of such great significance that it follows as the night the day that the
agent must always act in the best interests of the principal.

 

The Duties of an Agent

 

                   The agent is
obliged to perform those duties which he or she has undertaken to perform.  The
primary consideration in performing the duties of the agent must be to always
act in the best interests of the principal. However, in performing them the
agent must not exceed the authority which was delegated by the principal.

 

                   In the context of
the ""Secret Commission"" cases, the fundamental duties of the agent
are those arising from the fiduciary nature of the agency relationship.  The
relationship of trust focuses on the principal with the result that agents must
not let their own personal interests conflict with the obligations owing to
their principals.  A conflict of interest exists when an agent is faced with a
choice between the agent's personal interest and the agent's duty to the
principal.  Fridman, supra, put it in this way (at p. 153):

 

Where
the agent is in a position in which his own interest may affect the performance
of his duty to the principal, the agent is obliged to make a full disclosure of
all the material circumstances, so that the principal, with such full
knowledge, can choose whether to consent to the agent's acting.

 

                   The policy of the
courts has been stringent in seeking to prohibit not just actual fraud
perpetrated by agents on their principals but also in prohibiting the creation
of a situation where agents could be tempted into fraud.  The text, Bowstead
on Agency (14th ed. 1976), provides several examples where the agent has a
personal interest and, therefore, must make full disclosure (at p. 130):

 

. .
. an agent may not buy his principal's property or sell his property to his
principal because in such a case his interest will be in conflict with his
duty.  He is not allowed to receive a commission from both parties to a
transaction; he may not make any secret profits by exploiting his position or
the property of his principal; he may not acquire a benefit for himself by
dealing with a third party in breach of his relationship with his principal,
nor may he compete with his principal.

 

                   The agency
relationship is extremely important to the functioning of our society.  It is a
relationship based on trust and it is fiduciary in nature.  It is essential
that the integrity of that relationship be preserved.

 

The Purpose of Section 426

 

                   There can be no
doubt that s. 426 acknowledges both the importance of the agency relationship
and the necessity of preserving the integrity of that relationship.  It
confirms that an agent should not be placed in a position which is in conflict
with that of the principal.  It recognizes that a benefit taken by an agent
from a third party will place that agent in a conflict of interest position
with the principal unless the benefit is promptly and adequately disclosed.  No
one should provide an agent with a benefit, knowing the benefit to be secret,
in order to influence the agent with regard to the affairs of the principal. 
To do so corrupts and destroys the agency relationship.  The secret benefit
renders the advice and services of an agent so suspect that they cannot be
accepted.

 

                   The position was
correctly stated in R. v. Morris, supra, where at pp. 112
and 116 the following appears:

 

The
intent of the section is that no one shall make secret use of an agent's
position and services by means of giving him any kind of consideration for
it. . . . [T]he intent in passing this section was and is to
protect the principal, the employer, in the conduct of his affairs and business
against people who might make use or attempt to make use of his agent.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

                   The
legislative history of this section demonstrates that the purpose and intent of
it is to criminalize an agent's or employee's act of accepting ""secret
commissions"" for showing favour or disfavour to any person with relation
to the affairs or business of his principal.

 

                   There can be no
doubt that the commendable aim of s. 426 is to protect the agency
relationship, to preserve its integrity and to protect the principal.

 

Is Section 426 Applicable to the
Facts of this Case?

 

(a)  Agency Relationship ‑‑
The First Element

 

                   First the Crown
must establish that Kelly was acting, and knew he was acting, as an agent for
the clients of his company KPA.  There can be no doubt in this case that an
agency relationship existed between Kelly and his  clients and that Kelly was
aware of the existence of that relationship.  Indeed this element of the
offence was not an issue on this appeal or at the trial.

 

(b)  Accepting a Benefit
to Influence One's Principal ‑‑ The Second Element

 

                   The second element
the Crown must prove is that the agent took the benefit as consideration for
acting in relation to the affairs of the agent's principal.  There can be no
doubt that Kelly accepted a commission from a third party.  It goes without
saying that this commission comes within the category of a ""reward,
advantage, or benefit"" required by s. 426.  Nor can there be any
question that the commissions were accepted as consideration for doing an act
in relation to the affairs of the principals.  Clearly, Kelly accepted the
payment for recommending and eventually selling the MURBs to his clients.

 

                   To establish the
requisite mens rea for this second element, the Crown must prove that
the taker, knowingly accepted the commission as consideration for acting in
relation to the affairs of his clients or principals. It must be remembered
that offences involving ""secret commissions"" are by their very nature
secretive.  They arise from operations that are inherently covert.  It follows
that courts should in these cases apply common sense and draw the reasonable
and appropriate inferences from the proven facts.

 

                   Certainly Qualico's
purpose in paying commissions to Kelly would be to encourage Kelly to influence
his clients to purchase Qualico MURBs.  Here it was Kelly who sought out
Qualico to negotiate an agreement for selling MURBs and for receiving
commissions on those sales.  It was Kelly who advised the resident manager of
Qualico that he had ""good solid"" clients to whom he could sell the
MURBs.  On the first development, Kelly was prepared to incur the risks of a
performance bond with a strict time limit as part of the agreement for selling
the entire development.  The only time that Kelly advised any of his clients to
purchase MURBs was when the Qualico developments were put on the market.  Thus,
it is clear from the inherent nature of commissions and from Kelly's actions
that Kelly knowingly accepted the Qualico payments as consideration for
influencing his principals (that is to say his clients) to purchase MURBs.  He
was eminently successful in doing just that.

 

(c)Non‑Disclosure
and the Meaning to be Attributed to ""Corruptly"" ‑‑  The
Third Element

 

                   (i)  Meaning
of ""Corruptly"" in Section 426

 

                   It will be
remembered that s. 426 covers everyone who corruptly

 

                   1.gives,
offers or agrees to give or offer to an agent, or

 

                   2.being
an agent, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept from any person, any
reward, etc. 

 

                   What meaning should
be given to the word ""corruptly"" in the context of this section?  It
is argued that the offence is complete as soon as the agent takes the benefit
as consideration for influencing the affairs of the principal.  This is based
upon decisions such as Cooper v. Slade (1858), 6 H.L.C. 746, 10 E.R.
1488, and R. v. Gallagher (1985), 16 A. Crim. R. 215 (Vict.
C.C.A.).  I cannot accept this position.  It stems from the old jurisprudence
on the corruption of voters.  It is true these cases together with those which
deal with the bribery of officials are concerned with the interpretation of
""corruption"".  However, they are readily distinguishable from the
secret commissions cases.  In bribery cases there is no prerequisite that an
agency relationship exists.  Yet the whole aim and object of s. 426 is the
protection of the vulnerable principal and the preservation of the integrity of
the agent/principal relationship.  Furthermore, the nature of a commission is
very different from that of a bribe.

 

                   The interpretation
of the word ""corruptly"" must take place within the context of
s. 426 itself.  It is a trite rule of statutory interpretation that every
word in the statute must be given a meaning.  It would be superfluous to
include ""corruptly"" in the section if the offence were complete upon
the taking of the benefit in the circumstances described by the section.  The
word must add something to the offence.

 

                   In my view,
corruptly, as used in the section, designates secrecy as the corrupting element
of the offence.  It is the failure to disclose that makes it impossible for the
principal to determine whether to act upon the advice of the agent or accept
the actions of the agent.  It is the non‑disclosure which makes the
receipt of the commission or reward corrupt.  The word corruptly, in this
context, adds the element of non‑disclosure to the actus reus of
the offence.

 

                   The recognition of
secrecy as the corrupting element of s. 426 is consistent with the
analysis in R. v. Brown, supra.  There Laidlaw J.A. discussed the
meaning of ""corruptly"" in the context of s. 368 (now
s. 426).  He found that the ""evil against which that provision in the
Criminal Code  is directed is secret transactions or dealings with a
person in the position of agent concerning the affairs or business of the
agent's principal"" (p. 289). (Emphasis added.)

 

                   The interpretation
of corruptly as secretly or without disclosure reinforces the aim of
s. 426 to preserve the integrity of the agent/principal relationship.  It
is as well supported by the heading ""Secret Commission"" which
precedes this section.  It is the secrecy of the benefit and not the benefit
itself which constitutes the essence of the offence.  The appellant Kelly
argued that the words in the heading are merely marginal notes, and as such
should not be considered when interpreting the words in the section.  I cannot
agree with that contention.  R. v. Wigglesworth, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 541, makes it clear that it is appropriate to consider the
statutory heading and the history of a section as an aid in interpreting the
aim of a section.  

 

                   In sum, corruptly,
in the context of secret commissions, means without disclosure.  This
definition provides some symmetry between the two offences created by
s. 426(1) (a).  Corruptly, with respect to the taker/agent, refers
to the agent's failure to disclose the payment to the principal in an adequate
and timely manner.  With respect to the giver, corruptly means the reward was
given with the expectation and intention that the agent would not
disclose it to the principal in an adequate and timely manner.

 

                   (ii) What is the
Appropriate Standard for Disclosure?

 

                   What then is the
extent of disclosure that is required of an agent?  To put it in another way,
what degree of non‑disclosure is the Crown required to prove in order to
establish the guilt of an agent under s. 426?  The majority of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal in Kelly held that the disclosure ""must be
adequate and full in the sense that the principal must be specifically advised,
or it be otherwise made so crystal clear that he could not deny he ought to
have known"" (p. 160).  The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal
Division in R. v. Arnold (1991), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 171 agreed with this
standard.  These courts held that there must be full, frank and fair disclosure
made by the agent.  On the other hand, Hutcheon J.A. dissenting in Kelly
stated in obiter, that a standard of ""full, frank and fair
disclosure"" would be too high for criminal law and that ""partial
disclosure may be sufficient"". 

 

                   Once again a
consideration of the aim of s. 426 may be of assistance in determining the
requisite standard of disclosure.  The policy motivating the prohibition of
secret commissions is the protection of vulnerable principals and the
preservation of the integrity of the agency relationship.  A requirement that
disclosure of a commission be made by the agent promotes the objective of this
section.  Indeed, disclosure is essential to alert the principal to the
existence of conflict of interest situations.  In the absence of disclosure,
the principal has no way of knowing if the agent is truly acting in the
principal's best interests and cannot determine whether the advice of the agent
should be accepted.

 

                   If the object of
the section is to be attained, then adequate and timely disclosure must be
required of the agent.  A general and vague disclosure that the agent is
receiving commissions will not meet the objective of this section.  The agent
must disclose the nature of the benefit which is being received, the amount of
that benefit calculated to the best of the agent's ability and the source of
the benefit.  It may not be possible for the agent to be exact as to the amount
of commission which will be received.  It will suffice if a reasonable effort
is made to alert the principal as to the approximate amount and source of
commission to be received.  Obviously, the principal will be influenced by the
amount of benefit the agent is receiving.  The greater the benefit to the
agent, the greater the agent's conflict of interest, and commensurately the
greater the risk for the principal.  The disclosure must be timely in the sense
that the principal must be made aware of the benefit as soon as possible. 
Certainly the disclosure must be made at the point when the reward may
influence the agent in relation to the principal's affairs.  It is essential
then that the agent clearly disclose to the principal as promptly as possible
the source and amount or approximate amount of the benefit.

 

                   It is only if the
disclosure is both adequate and timely that the agency relationship would be
protected.  With this knowledge, the principal would then be able to determine
whether, and to what extent, to rely upon the advice given by the agent.  It
would be preferable if the disclosure were made in writing.

 

                   It is clear that
KPA's clients were not aware that KPA accepted a sales commission from Qualico
for each Qualico MURB sold to KPA clients.  At their initial meeting with new
clients, KPA personnel described the history of the firm, the services that the
firm could provide and the various sources of compensation that KPA received. 
While the entire presentation took approximately one and a half hours, the
explanation of sources of remuneration took less than five minutes.  Such a
vague and general disclosure is not sufficient to meet the objectives of
s. 426.

 

                   At the time of the
Qualico sales, there was no evidence that the clients were told that KPA was to
receive commissions from Qualico.  Kelly himself advised KPA associates that he
did not want to put in writing any further disclosure concerning sources of remuneration
for the MURB project.  While the Offering Memoranda for the Qualico MURBs
contained two one‑line references to ""Issuing and Sales Costs""
for the projects, there was no specific reference to the fact that it was the
appellant who was to receive these costs as a commission.  Thus, in this case,
it certainly could not be said that the disclosure was adequate and timely.  As
well it can be seen that Kelly was aware of the extent of the disclosure and
made a conscious decision to limit and restrict it.  There was then cogent
evidence upon which the convictions of the appellant could properly be based.

 

                   (iii) Corrupt
Bargain

 

                   Is the Crown
required to prove that there was a corrupt bargain between the giver and taker
of the benefit?  I think not.  That was the basis of Hutcheon J.A.'s dissent. 
He held that the existence of a ""corrupt bargain"" is a pre‑requisite
to the commission of the offence described in s. 426.  Hutcheon J.A.'s
position is that there must be a guilty giver and a guilty taker in
order for the Crown to secure a conviction under s. 426.  The corrupt bargain
approach focuses on the relationship between the agent and the third party
rather than on the critical relationship which exists between the agent and
principal.

 

                   The requirement of
both a corrupt giver and a corrupt taker collapses the two independent
provisions of s. 426(1) (a).  The use of the disjunctive ""or""
in s. 426(1) (a) must mean that the section applies to either the
giver or the taker.  The provision need not apply to both at the same
time.  This interpretation I believe is supported by the obvious intent and aim
of the section itself.

 

                   To repeat, the aim
of s. 426 is to protect the principal in the conduct of the principal's affairs
against people who might use or attempt to make use of the principal's agent. 
The section is concerned with the integrity of the agent and the right of the
principal to rely upon the agent's integrity.  Thus, if the agent/taker
secretly accepts a commission to influence the principal's affairs there ought
to be a finding of guilt whether or not the expectation and intention of the
giver was that the taker would not disclose the benefit to the principal in an
adequate and timely manner.

 

                   The question of the
corrupt bargain requirement is resolved by the definition of the offence
contained in the section.  Section 426(1) (a)(ii) provides that a crime
is committed when the agent/taker knowingly accepts a benefit as consideration
for influencing the affairs of the agent's principal without sufficient
disclosure.  In the case of a prosecution of an agent/taker under this section,
the giver of the benefit must have paid the benefit to the taker as
consideration for influencing the taker's principal.  However, there is no
requirement under s. 426(1) (a)(ii) for the Crown to prove that the
giver was corrupt in the sense that the giver knew, expected or intended that
the agent/taker would not disclose the benefit to the principal in an adequate
and timely manner.  Section 426 provides for the conviction of a guilty taker
regardless of the guilt or innocence of the giver.  A corrupt bargain is not
required by the section.  

 

Summary

 

                   There are then
three elements to the actus reus of the offence set out in
s. 426(1) (a)(ii) as they apply to an accused agent/taker with
regard to the acceptance of a commission:

 

(1)
the existence of an agency relationship;

 

(2)
the accepting by an agent of a benefit as consideration for doing or forbearing
to do any act in relation to the affairs of the agent's principal; and

 

(3)
the failure by the agent to make adequate and timely disclosure of the source,
amount and nature of the benefit.

 

                   The requisite mens
rea must be established for each element of the actus reus. 
Pursuant to s. 426(1) (a)(ii), an accused agent/taker:

 

(1)
must be aware of the agency relationship;

 

(2)
must knowingly accept the benefit as consideration for an act to be undertaken
in relation to the affairs of the principal; and

 

(3)
must be aware of the extent of the disclosure to the principal or lack thereof.

 

                   If the accused was
aware that some disclosure was made then it will be for the court to determine
whether, in all the circumstances of the particular case, it was in fact
adequate and timely.

 

                   The word
""corruptly"" in the context of secret commissions means secretly or
without the requisite disclosure.  There is no ""corrupt bargain""
requirement.  Thus, it is possible to convict a taker of a reward or benefit
despite the innocence of the giver of the reward or benefit.  Non‑disclosure
will be established for the purposes of the section if the Crown demonstrates
that adequate and timely disclosure of the source, amount and nature of the
benefit has not been made by the agent to the principal.

 

                   In the case at bar,
Qualico paid the standard commission to Kelly.  It is clear that the nature of
the commission was to encourage Kelly to influence his clients.  Kelly was
aware of this intention.  He accepted the commission secretly and influenced
the affairs of his principals.  The payment of the commission was not disclosed
in an adequate and timely manner.  The Crown was not required to prove that
Qualico's actions in paying the commissions were corrupt or part of a corrupt
bargain with Kelly.  

 

                   The Crown therefore
has established all the elements requisite for conviction under s. 426. 

 

Disposition

 

                   In the result the
appeal must be dismissed.

 

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

                   Sopinka
J. (dissenting) -- I have
had the opportunity of reading the reasons of Cory J. herein but unfortunately
I cannot agree with the result that he has reached.  I agree with him that the
relationship of principal and agent is an important one and that the trust on
which it is dependent should be fostered by the law.  I do not agree that this
should be done by criminalizing breaches of duty unless Parliament has clearly
indicated its intention to do so.  More specifically, I cannot accept that the
unilateral act of the appellant in failing to make full disclosure converts a
breach of duty into criminal conduct. 

The Purpose and Meaning of Section 426

 

                   A review of the
history of the section shows that it deals with the giving of secret
commissions or bribes to or by an agent.  These benefits or rewards must have
as their purpose the influencing of the agent in the exercise of his or her
duty to the principal.  I adopt the following statement of Laidlaw J.A. in R.
v. Brown (1956), 116 C.C.C. 287 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 239, as a definitive
statement of the purpose of the legislation:

 

                   The
evil against which that provision in the Criminal Code  is directed is secret
transactions or dealings with a person in the position of agent concerning the
affairs or business of the agent's principal.  It is intended that no one
shall make secret use of the agent's position and services by means of giving
him any kind of consideration for them.  The agent is prohibited from accepting
or offering or agreeing to accept any consideration from anyone other than his
principal for any service rendered with relation to the affairs or business of
his principal.  It is intended to protect the principal in the conduct of
his affairs and business against persons who might make secret use, or attempt
to make such use, of the services of his agent.  He is to be free at all times
and under all circumstances from such mischievous influence.  Likewise, it
is intended that the agent shall be protected against any person who is willing
to make use secretly of his position and services.  Everyone is prohibited from
entering into secret transactions under which he ""gives, offers or agrees
to give or offer"" consideration to an agent for services with relation to
the affairs or business of his principal. [Emphasis added.] 

 

                   What the section
proscribes are transactions or dealings designed to influence an agent in his
conduct of the principals' affairs.  It seeks to proscribe the various stages
of such transactions or dealings.  It applies at the formative stage by
prohibiting an offer or demand.  It applies to an agreement and it applies to
dealings that are completed by the exchange of benefits or rewards.

 

                   What the section
seeks to achieve is to keep the agent free of the influence of third parties
who seek to reward the agent in return for some act affecting the affairs of
the principal.  In R. v. Morris (1988), 64 Sask. R. 98 (C.A.), it was
stated (at p. 112):

 

He
must be free at all times and under all circumstances from such an influence. 
Likewise, the intent is to protect the employee from being approached by people
who are willing to make use secretly of his position and services and who are
willing to reward him or pay him for doing so. 

 

                   Accordingly, when
an agent is charged as the person receiving a benefit or reward, it must be
established that he or she accepted it as a quid pro quo to influence
him or her.  This requires proof that it was offered, promised or given for
this purpose and that it was within the agent's knowledge or belief that it was
given for this purpose.

 

                   Considerable
reliance was placed by the majority of the Court of Appeal on the judgments of
the Court of Criminal Appeal of Victoria in R. v. Gallagher, infra. 
In that case an agent was prosecuted for receipt of gifts in contravention of
the Victoria version of the corruption law.  Section 176(1)(b) of the Crimes
Act 1958 (Vict.) provided:

 

Whosoever
being an agent corruptly receives or solicits from any person for himself or
for any other person any valuable consideration --

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   (b)the
receipt or any expectation of which would in any way tend to influence him to
show or to forbear to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his
principal's affairs or business;

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

shall
be guilty of an indictable offence. . . .

 

In the first appeal (1985), 16 A.
Crim. R. 215, the following charge to the jury was approved (at p. 222):

 

The
fourth and final element of the crime alleged in each of the counts is that the
agent corruptly received a valuable consideration.  This looks to the state
of mind of the agent at the time he received the valuable consideration.  He
acted corruptly if he then believed that the person giving him the valuable
consideration intended that it should influence him to show favour or to
forbear to show disfavour to some person in relation to his principal's affairs
or business.  It is irrelevant whether the agent himself intended by the
receipt of the valuable consideration to show favour or forbear to show
disfavour or not.  Indeed, it is irrelevant as to whether or not he did show
favour or forbear to show disfavour.  If he believed that the person giving him
the valuable consideration so intended to influence him, that is enough,
because by accepting it he thereby had his loyalty divided. [Emphasis added.]

 

A new trial was, however, ordered on
other grounds.  The accused was convicted at the new trial and appealed again. 
See R. v. Gallagher (1987), 29 A. Crim. R. 33.  The Court of
Appeal confirmed in the latter appeal that the recipient must believe that the
giver intends that the benefit should influence the taker to show favour to the
giver in the taker's dealings with the affairs of the principal.  It was on
this basis that the taker could be found guilty but the giver not.  At page 35
the court stated: ""... if the recipient mistakenly believed that the giver
intended to influence him the giver would not be acting corruptly but the
recipient would be.""

 

                   Section 426 is more
emphatic than the Victoria statute that the purpose of the payment must be to
influence the agent to do or forbear from doing some act relating to the
affairs of the principal.  The agent is guilty only if the benefit or reward is
""as consideration for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or
forborne to do, any act relating to the affairs or business of his principal. . . "".  
This requires either that the benefit is in fact offered for this purpose or
that the recipient believes that it is.  A benefit cannot be received in
consideration for doing such an act if it is neither intended for that purpose
by the giver nor believed to be so by the taker.  Ordinarily, in any
transaction the ""consideration for"" is the quid pro quo for
each party's obligation.  The recipient of a promise or a benefit as a result
of a promise does not determine its character unilaterally.  Its character is
determined by the promisor with the agreement of the promisee.  

 

                   In most cases,
therefore, the offence against the agent will be made out by establishing that
he or she accepted a reward offered, promised or given for the purpose of
influencing the agent.  The offence is complete without the necessity of
showing that the agent was in fact influenced in his or her actions.  As
pointed out by the Court of Appeal in Gallagher, it is the state of mind
of the agent in accepting the consideration that is crucial.  If the agent's
state of mind is affected by the temptation to affect the manner in which his
duty is carried out by the expectation of a benefit or reward the evil against
which the provision is aimed is engaged.  For the same reason if the agent
demands a benefit in return for some act or forbearance vis-à-vis the principal
the section applies.  The agent's loyalty has been compromised by the
expectation of reward.  It is for this reason that an agent who believes that a
benefit is being offered as consideration for affecting the affairs of his
principal is guilty even if it was not in fact offered for this purpose.

 

                   The use of the word
""corruptly"" serves to emphasize the requirement that the acts of the
giver or taker are not innocently done but mala fide in the sense of
intentionally doing what the section otherwise forbids.  In R. v. Brown,
supra, at p. 289, ""corruptly"" was stated to mean ""the act
of doing the very thing which the statute forbids"".  In R. v. Gross
(1945), 86 C.C.C. 68 (Ont. C.A.), Roach J.A., while emphasizing the purpose of
the gift or consideration, added that it must be mala fide.  He stated
(at p. 75):

 

                   The
word ""corruptly"" in the section sounds the keynote to the conduct at
which the section is aimed.  The evil is the giving of a gift or consideration,
not bona fide but mala fide, and designedly, wholly or partially,
for the purpose of bringing about the effect forbidden by the section.

 

                   I do not agree that
non-disclosure by the offeree is synonymous with the term
""corruptly"".  While in some situations to which the section applies
disclosure or the intention to disclose on the part of the offeree may negative
mala fides, in others the fact of disclosure or intention to disclose is
irrelevant.  For example, when the giver is accused he or she may be guilty if
he or she simply makes an offer as consideration for affecting the affairs of
the principal.  Provided that the intention of the giver is that the benefit
not be disclosed to the principal, the offence is complete when the offer is
made.  The intention on the part of the offeree to disclose or indeed actual
disclosure on his or her part is irrelevant.  Inasmuch as the giver would still
have acted corruptly, it cannot be treated as if the two terms were
interchangeable.  I regard disclosure and non-disclosure as one factor which in
some applications of the section may be relevant in respect of the mental
element of the offence.  In cases in which the giver is charged, the offence is
complete when the offer is made, accepted or the benefit or reward taken with
the requisite state of mind.  The cases to which I have referred make it plain
that the gravamen of the offence as regards the recipient is the influence on
the mind of the agent at the time at which one of these events takes place.  If
subsequent conduct is not relevant to show that the agent actually was or was
not influenced, subsequent disclosure is also not relevant to excuse an offence
which is complete. 

 

Application to this Case

 

                   The words of the
charges in this case make it clear that the offences charged are in relation to
a transaction with Qualico pursuant to which the appellant accepted
consideration for inducing his clients to invest in Mirror Development. 
Count 1 which is typical reads as follows:

 

Between
the 1st day of June, A.D. 1980, and the 31st day of March, A.D. 1983, at the
City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, being an agent for Janet BIGA,
Michael DRISCOLL, Bruce HARRISON, Garry HENRY, and other clients of KELLY
PETERS & ASSOCIATES LTD., did corruptly accept from QUALICO
DEVELOPMENTS LTD. a reward or benefit, to wit, Two Hundred Sixty-Two
Thousand Dollars ($262,000), as consideration for doing or having done an
act relating to the affairs of Janet BIGA, Michael DRISCOLL, Bruce
HARRISON, Garry HENRY, and other clients of KELLY PETERS & ASSOCIATES LTD.,
concerning the investments by the aforesaid persons in Mirror Developments,
contrary to Section 383(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

                   The payments by
Qualico were made to the appellant pursuant to an agreement that could not be
said to be in consideration of the sale to clients of the appellant.  The
commissions were to be paid in consideration of a sale to whomever it was
made.  The agreement was entered into at arm's length and the commissions were
the same amount as was paid to any other salesmen.  While in many instances the
appellant sold to his clients that was not because he was influenced by Qualico
to do so nor because he believed that this was the intended purpose of either
the agreement with Qualico or of the payments.  The decision to sell to his
clients was one that he made unilaterally.  His failure to make full disclosure
amounted to a breach of his duty but he is not guilty of the offence charged.  

 

                   The majority of the
Court of Appeal summed up the case against the appellant as follows:

 

I
think the statute requires a transaction, but that transaction need be
no more than the giver paying the taker to do something in relation to his
client's affairs, and the taker knowing this.  Such a transaction can be
completely blameless in so far as the giver is concerned, and in the ordinary
course of business.  But the crime is committed by the taker who receives the
money knowing the reason it is paid.  That, in my view, is this case. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

((1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 137, at p.
155.)

 

With respect, applying this test to
the facts of the case, the appellant ought to have been acquitted.  The
appellant did not know nor believe that Qualico was paying him to sell to his
clients.  This element is one that is stressed in the cases to which I have
referred and which is totally absent in this case.

 

                   In the result I
would allow the appeal and direct that an acquittal be entered in regard to
each of the charges.

 

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

//McLachlin J.//

 

                   McLachlin
J. -- I have read the
reasons of Sopinka J. and Cory J. and agree with Cory J. that the appeal should
be dismissed.  However, I have two concerns with respect to the reasons of Cory
J. which require comment.  Both are related to the lack of disclosure which
constitutes an element of the actus reus of the offence, and an
awareness of which constitutes an element of its mens rea. 

 

                   I am satisfied that
the aspect of the mens rea of the offence of taking a secret commission
which is imported by the adverb ""corruptly"" may lie in awareness of
the fact of non-disclosure.  No corrupt bargain is required, for the reasons
given by the majority below and Cory J. in this Court.  Indeed, on the clear
language of s. 426(1) (a)(ii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 , the offence may be committed simply by making a ""demand"" for
or ""agreeing to accept"" a reward, which alone is sufficient to negate
the alleged concluded corrupt bargain requirement.

 

                   My difficulty
relates to the time and nature of the disclosure necessary to negate this
element of the mens rea of the offence.  Cory J. states that there must
be ""timely"" and ""adequate"" disclosure.  In my view, the way
he goes on to define these terms extends the ambit of the offence in a way
which is inconsistent with the basic principles of criminal law.

 

                   The first problem
is that of timeliness.  Cory J. states that ""[i]t is
essential . . . that the agent clearly disclose to the principal
as promptly as possible the source and amount or approximate amount of
the benefit"" (emphasis added).  He elaborates as follows (at p. 000):

 

The
disclosure must be timely in the sense that the principal must be made aware of
the benefit as soon as possible.  Certainly the disclosure must be made at the
point when the reward may influence the agent in relation to the principal's
affairs.

 

This passage begs a number of
questions.  When is the crime complete?  What is meant by ""as soon as
possible""?  Is it a defence for the agent to say that the point had not
yet been reached when he or she might be influenced?  If so, when is that
point?  To pose these questions is to admit of the possibility of a variety of
different answers.

 

                   As analyzed by Cory
J. this offence is quite different from the general run of criminal offences.
An offence is complete upon commission of a particular act or acts, the actus
reus, accompanied by the requisite blameworthy mental state, the mens
rea. Thus, for example, the offence of assault is complete when a person
without the consent of another applies force to that other person, the actus
reus, and does so with the intention of applying force to that other person
without that other person's consent. The act is committed with the necessary
intent and the offence is complete in a single, unified transaction. Under Cory
J.'s analysis of the offence of taking secret commissions the agent may commit
part of the actus reus, the taking of the commission in the requisite
circumstances, and do so with part of the mens rea, namely knowledge of
the circumstances constituting the actus reus to that point. But his
ultimate guilt is at that point uncertain, dependent upon whether he fails
""to make adequate and timely disclosure of the source, amount and nature
of the benefit"", the remainder of the actus reus, with an awareness
of ""the extent of the disclosure to the principal or lack thereof"",
the remainder of the mens rea.  Under Cory J.'s analysis the commission
of part of this offence can be deferred in accordance with the prevailing
circumstances.  If at that point in time which a trial judge with the benefit
of hindsight determines to have been ""timely"" the agent has not made
full disclosure and is aware of the lack of disclosure, the actus reus
and  mens rea appear, transforming non-criminal conduct into criminal
conduct. It is as if the offence lies dormant, waiting to be brought to
germination by the bright light of judicial contemplation.

 

                   It is a fundamental
proposition of the criminal law that the law be certain and definitive.  This
is essential, given the fact that what is at stake is the potential deprivation
of a person of his or her liberty and his or her subjection to the sanction and
opprobrium of criminal conviction.  This principle has been enshrined in the
common law for centuries, encapsulated in the maxim nullum crimen sine lege,
nulla poena sine lege -- there must be no crime or punishment except in
accordance with law which is fixed and certain. A crime which offends this
fundamental principle may for that reason be unconstitutional. As Lamer J., as
he then was, said in Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, at p. 1155:

 

                   It
would seem to me that since the advent of the Charter, the doctrine of
vagueness or overbreadth has been the source of attack on laws on two grounds.
First, a law that does not give fair notice to a person of the conduct that is
contemplated as criminal, is subject to a s. 7 challenge to the extent that
such a law may deprive a person of liberty and security of the person in a
manner that does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.
Clearly, it seems to me that if a person is placed at risk of being deprived of
his liberty when he has not been given fair notice that his conduct falls
within the scope of the offence as defined by Parliament, then surely this
would offend the principles of fundamental justice. Second, where a separate Charter
right or freedom has been limited by legislation, the doctrine of vagueness or
overbreadth may be considered in determining whether the limit is
""prescribed by law"" within the meaning of s. 1 of the Charter.

 

It is vagueness in the first sense
mentioned by Lamer J. which is raised by the ""after-the-fact""
approach to the determination of when disclosure is timely that is advocated by
Cory J.

 

                   Dickson C.J., La
Forest and Sopinka JJ. concurring, agreed that it would be contrary to the
principles of fundamental justice to permit a person to be deprived of his or
her liberty for the violation of a vague law.  As Dickson C.J. put it (at p.
1141):

 

Certainly
in the criminal context where a person's liberty is at stake, it is imperative
that persons be capable of knowing in advance with a high degree of certainty
what conduct is prohibited and what is not. It would be contrary to the basic
principles of our legal system to allow individuals to be imprisoned for
transgression of a vague law. 

 

                   A hovering
possibility of criminality, which may come into being when in the circumstances
it is deemed (after the fact) to have been timely to disclose, offends the
fundamental requirement that the criminal law be certain. Simply put, agents
will not thereby be given fair notice in advance whether a proposed course of
conduct is criminal. Not only is this lack of predictability potentially
unfair, it is also calculated to lessen the deterrent effect of the existence
of the criminal prohibition, since people may put off disclosure which they
ought to make because, as they see the circumstances at the time, no disclosure
is necessary.  Finally, it raises the question of whether an agent, who, at a
certain time ought in all the circumstances to have disclosed a reward, is
entitled to be acquitted because he did not realize that it was time to
disclose.  

 

                   In my view, if lack
of disclosure is an element of the offence, then the time for disclosure must
be clear and certain in law.  Rather than holding the offence in suspended
animation pending some future event which will determine the timeliness of
disclosure, I would fix the time at which disclosure must be made.  Where the actus
reus is the taking of a secret commission, then the relevant time to
see whether there has been a failure to disclose is the time the commission is taken. 
For practical purposes, this means that if the agent accepts a commission
without beforehand (or simultaneously, if that can be conceived) advising the
principal of the fact, the offence is established.  It is up to the agent to
refuse the commission unless he or she has first advised the principal of his
or her intention to take it.  

 

                   This, in my view,
makes practical sense.  To allow an agent to accept a secret commission on the
basis that he or she will tell the principal ""as soon as possible"" is
to encourage the acceptance of such commissions: the road to crime, as to hell,
may be paved with good intentions.  On the other hand, to require the agent to
clear the matter with his or her principal before accepting the commission
imposes no undue hardship.  Assume, for example, the arrival in the mail of an
unsolicited commission.  The agent cannot accept the cash or cash the cheque,
as the case may be, until he or she has advised the principal of the commission.
I see only good coming from such a requirement.

 

                   I turn from the
timing of disclosure to the question of degree of disclosure.  Here again the
governing consideration is that the criminal law must be clear and certain. 
Cory J. states that the amount of the commission must be stated to the
""best of the agent's ability"", and concludes (at p. 000):

 

                   If
the accused was aware that some disclosure was made then it will be for the
court to determine whether, in all the circumstances of the particular case, it
was in fact adequate. . . .

 

This ""after-the-fact""
standard is, in my opinion, too vague to meet the requirements of the criminal
law.  

 

                   I agree with Cory
J. that the extent of disclosure required depends on the purpose which the
disclosure requirement is intended to further.  I agree with Cory J. as well
that ""disclosure is essential to alert the principal to the existence of
conflict of interest situations"" (p. 23).  It is to the avoidance of
conflicts of interest and the consequent danger that the agent may not act
exclusively in the best interests of his or her principals that the disclosure
requirement is directed.  The amount of the commission is purely
secondary.  A large commission might tempt one agent; a small one might suffice
for another.  Moreover, a requirement that the amount of the commission be
disclosed poses practical difficulties of calculation, as Cory J. recognizes.
These are exacerbated if disclosure is to be made either simultaneously with
acceptance of the commission, or, as would be practically necessary under my
reasoning, in advance.

 

                   In my view, all
that is required by the criminal law is that if an agent is contemplating
taking a commission from a third party with respect to a transaction with his
principal, then the agent must disclose the fact that he will receive the
commission to the principal, specifically advising the principal of the
transaction to which the commission will relate.  Such a communication will put
the principal on notice that the agent is in a potential conflict of interest. 
It will then be open to the principal to decline to enter the transaction, to
ask for further details or amounts, or to take such other steps as he or she
may choose. The objective of the section will be achieved, and the question as
to whether the agent's conduct is criminal will not hang on arguments over
whether the agent has made a ""reasonable effort"" to state the amount
of the commission to the ""best of [his or her] ability"" ""in all
the circumstances of the particular case"".  I add that it cannot be enough
to state at the beginning of a relationship that commissions may from time to
time be taken.  The offence relates to a particular taking, and so, it follows,
must disclosure.

 

                   On the facts of
this case it is clear that there was no disclosure of the particular
commissions to the principals involved.  Therefore the offence is made out.

 

                   I would dismiss the
appeal.

                   The accused, who
were financial planners, recommended to a substantial number of their
clients that they should invest in two development projects.  For the sale of
each unit in these projects, the accused received from the promoters a
10 percent commission together with a percentage of the profits derived
from the sale. The majority of the clients who invested in these projects
testified that the accused never mentioned the commissions that were to be paid
to them. While the accused did disclose to their clients in the initial
interview some general information as to commissions, there was no disclosure
of commissions that would be payable to the accused from the projects unless a
request for that information was specifically made by a client. In the Offering
Memoranda shown to the clients, the commissions payable were included in the
global figure for the ""initial service cost"" of the projects and
there was no indication that it was the accused who, as agents for the
projects, were to receive the commissions. In 1987, a statement was made
by one of the accused to a plain-clothes RCMP officer investigating the general
partner involved in the projects. Two years later, the accused were charged
with accepting secret commissions contrary to s. 426(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . They were acquitted. The trial judge found that although there was no
specific disclosure to the clients of amounts of commissions payable to the
accused, the clients knew that the initial fees they paid to the accused would
not be their sole source of income. He concluded that proof of a corrupt
bargain was an essential part of the offence and, since there was no corrupt
bargain in this case, the accused could not be found guilty. The Court of
Appeal set aside the acquittals and ordered a new trial. This appeal raised
substantially the same issues as those before this Court in R. v. Kelly,
[1992] 2 S.C.R. 000. The primary issue in this case is whether the accused as
agents made timely and adequate disclosure to their principals of the
commissions they received from a third party.

 

                   Held (Sopinka J. dissenting):  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé, Cory and
Iacobucci JJ.: The Court of Appeal correctly concluded that the trial
judge's finding that the Crown had failed to prove the requisite intent was
based on a misapprehension as to the intent required under s. 426(1)(a)
of the Code. For the reasons set out in R. v. Kelly, it was not
necessary for the Crown to establish that there was a corrupt bargain between
the giver and the taker. The trial judge also erred as to the standard of
disclosure that was required. His finding that there was no secrecy on the
part of the accused was made only in relation to their books which
disclosed all the transactions. The testimony given by clients of the accused
was overwhelmingly to the effect that there had been no disclosure to them of
the commissions to be paid to the accused by the promoters of the projects. It
will be for the judge presiding at the new trial to determine whether, in the
circumstances of the case, the disclosure made by the accused to their clients
was adequate and timely. Finally, the Court of Appeal correctly determined
that the accused who made the statement was not in detention at the time of the
statement, that his rights had not been violated by the police and that the
statement was therefore admissible. The Court of Appeal's conclusion that an
error had been made with regard to the statement did no more than supplement
its decision to grant a new trial.

 

                   Per McLachlin J.: For the reasons
given in R. v. Kelly, the trial judge's findings in this case were not
adequate to resolve the disclosure issue. His reasons do not make clear whether
the disclosure by the accused, which he found had been given, was limited to
general statements that they would receive commissions with respect to
transactions entered into by their clients, or whether there was also specific
disclosure of the fact that they would receive commissions with respect to the
transactions at issue. The fact that the accused did not make specific
disclosure of the amounts to be received is purely secondary. The Court of
Appeal's decision setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new trial must be
affirmed.

 

                   Per Sopinka J.
(dissenting): For the reasons given in R. v. Kelly, the acquittals
of the accused should be restored. The offences charged are in relation to
a transaction with certain management companies pursuant to which the accused
accepted consideration for inducing their clients to invest in certain
development projects.  While in many instances the accused sold units to their
clients, that was not because they were influenced to do so by the management
companies nor because they believed that this was the intended purpose of
either the agreement or the payments. The agreement was entered into at arm's
length, the commissions were the same amount as was paid to any other salesmen
and they  were to be paid regardless of to whom the units were sold. The
decision to sell to their clients was one made unilaterally by the accused.
Failure to make full disclosure to the clients may have amounted to a breach of
duty but the accused are not guilty of the offence charged. The trial judge
made a finding that they had not acted mala fide in the dealings giving
rise to the charges. This finding was amply supported by the evidence.

//Cory J.//

 

                   The judgment of
L'Heureux-Dubé, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Cory J. -- The issues raised in this
appeal are substantially the same as those that were before the Court in R.
v. Kelly, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 000.  The primary issue is whether the accused as
agents made timely and adequate disclosure to their principals of the
commissions they received from a third party.

 

Factual Background

 

                   The appellants were
financial planners who gave advice regarding tax planning, tax shelters,
investments and RRSPs to doctors and dentists.  Peter Arnold operated his
business under the name of P.R. Arnold and Associates Ltd. while
Carl Boswick carried on his business under the name
Carl T. Boswick and Associates Ltd.

 

                   When clients first
came to the appellants, they were informed in a general way about the sources
of compensation that the appellants received.  In this first interview, a
reference was made to a ""black binder"" which contained a section
entitled ""How We're Compensated"".  In it the clients were advised
that the appellants would be receiving commissions and fees.  In discussions
with their clients the accused seem to have used terms such as bonuses,
overrides and bonus incentives when referring to their commissions.

 

                   There can be no
doubt that the appellants recommended to a substantial number of their clients
that they should invest in two limited partnerships:  Lakewood Manor Ltd. and
Oak Street Ltd.  The Lakewood offering was composed of 100 units at
$ 10,000 per unit with a guaranteed return of $ 15,000 to investors
within two years.  That guarantee was met.  The Oak Street offering was
200 units at $ 10,000 each with a guaranteed return of $ 16,000 per
unit within two years.  This guarantee was not met, although the investors
eventually did receive some tax write offs.

 

                   For the sale of the
units, the appellants received 10 percent commission together with a percentage
of the profits derived from the sale from J. & J. Management Limited,
Woodrock Management Limited and Rockwood Real Estate Limited.  On the two
projects, the appellants received in excess of $450,000 in commissions.  In the
Offering Memoranda shown to the clients, the commissions payable were included
in the global figure for the ""initial service cost"" of the project. 
These Offering Memoranda had been reviewed by a law firm and approved by the
Nova Scotia Securities Commission before they were distributed to the investors. 
However, it is significant that there was no reference in the Memoranda to the
fact that it was the appellants who, as agents for the project, were to receive
the commissions.

 

                   The majority of the
clients who invested in the projects testified that the appellants never
mentioned the commissions that were to be paid to Arnold and Boswick.  The
appellants did disclose to their clients in the initial interview some general
information as to commissions.  However, there was certainly no disclosure of
commissions that would be payable to the appellants from the Lakewood or
Oak Street projects unless a request for that information was specifically
made by a client.

 

                   In 1987, the
appellant Arnold made a statement to a plain-clothes RCMP officer investigating
the general partner involved in Lakewood and Oak Street projects.  Some two
years later, the appellants were charged with two counts of contravening
s. 426(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 
(formerly s. 383 ).  The trial judge acquitted the appellants on both
counts.  On the Crown appeal, the acquittals were set aside and a new trial was
ordered:  (1991), 102 N.S.R. (2d) 207, 279 A.P.R. 207, 65 C.C.C. (3d) 171.  The
appellants have brought this appeal as of right pursuant to s. 691(2)  of
the Criminal Code .

 

Judgments Below

 

County Court Judge's Criminal Court

 

                   The trial judge
observed that ""the crooks in this case are probably Rockwood [the general
partner of the project, who was later convicted for fraud] and Christopherson
[the accountant for Rockwood]"".  He found that, although clients knew the
initial fees which they paid would not be the sole source of income for the
appellants, there was no specific disclosure to the clients of amounts of
commissions payable to the appellants.

 

                   The trial judge,
relying on the dissenting reasons of Hutcheon J.A. in R. v. Kelly
(1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 137 (B.C.C.A.), concluded that proof of a corrupt
bargain was an essential part of the offence.  He determined that as there was
no corrupt bargain in this case, the accused could not be found guilty.

 

Nova Scotia Court of Appeal (1991), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 171

 

                   Macdonald J.A.,
writing for the unanimous court, noted that there was no disclosure by Arnold
or Boswick that they would receive commissions from the sale of units in the
Lakewood or Oak Street projects unless that question was specifically
asked of them.  When the question was presented the replies they gave were
vague and could not be categorized as full, frank and fair.  In effect, they
did not advise their clients as to the financial arrangements they had with the
promoters of the two projects.

 

                   He then considered
s. 426(1) (a)(ii) and determined that ""[t]he element of
corruption is simply doing the act enjoined by the section without having first
made full disclosure to the principal"" (p. 177).  He found that it
was the agent's non‑disclosure to his principal of the reward or benefit
in relation to the principal's business that made his conduct corrupt.  He
adopted the standard of disclosure put forward by the majority of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal in the Kelly case and determined that the
disclosure must be crystal clear.  That is to say it must be full, frank and
fair.

 

                   He found that the
trial judge had erred in excluding the statement made by Arnold and determined
that it should have been admitted.  He found that the trial judge, in relying
on Hutcheon J.A.'s dissent in Kelly, erroneously focused on the
requirement of a corrupt bargain.  He concluded that the trial judge had
misapprehended the evidence as a result of misdirecting himself as to the mens
rea required by the offence and by the trial judge's misconception of the
word ""corruptly"".  In the result, a new trial was ordered.

 

The Elements of Section 426 

 

                   The elements of
s. 426  have been considered in my reasons in R. v. Kelly and need
not be repeated.  It is sufficient to set out the summary of the conclusions in
Kelly (at p. 000):

 

Summary

 

                   There
are then three elements to the actus reus of the offence set out in
s. 426(1) (a)(ii) as they apply to an accused agent/taker with
regard to the acceptance of a commission:

 

                   (1)  the
existence of an agency relationship;

 

(2)  the
accepting by an agent of a benefit as consideration for doing or forbearing to
do any act in relation to the affairs of the agent's principal; and

 

(3)  the
failure by the agent to make adequate and timely disclosure of the source,
amount and nature of the benefit.

 

                   The
requisite mens rea must be established for each element of the actus
reus.  Pursuant to s. 426(1) (a)(ii), an accused agent/taker: 

(1)  must
be aware of the agency relationship;

 

(2)  must
knowingly accept the benefit as consideration for an act to be undertaken in
relation to the affairs of the principal; and

 

(3)  must
be aware of the extent of the disclosure to the principal or lack thereof.

 

                   If
the accused was aware that some disclosure was made then it will be for the
court to determine whether, in all the circumstances of the particular case, it
was in fact adequate and timely.

 

                   The
word ""corruptly"" in the context of secret commissions means secretly
or without the requisite disclosure.  There is no ""corrupt bargain""
requirement.  Thus, it is possible to convict a taker of a reward or benefit
despite the innocence of the giver of the reward or benefit.  Non-disclosure
will be established for the purposes of the section if the Crown demonstrates
that adequate and timely disclosure of the source, amount and nature of the
benefit has not been made by the agent to the principal.

 

Application of Principles to the Facts
of this Case

 

                   There is no doubt
that the facts in this case arouse more sympathy for the appellants than did
those in Kelly.  Nevertheless, the question as to whether the disclosure
was adequate in all the circumstances must still be determined.  I cannot
accept the contention that the findings made at the trial are adequate to
resolve the issue.  The Court of Appeal was correct in its conclusion that the
trial judge's finding that the Crown had failed to prove the requisite intent
was based on a misapprehension as to the intent required. For the reasons set
out in Kelly, it was not necessary for the Crown to establish that there
was a corrupt bargain.

 

                   Nor was the trial
judge correct as to the standard of disclosure that was required.  The argument
that there was a finding made at trial that there was no secrecy on the part of
the appellants cannot be accepted.  That finding was made only in relation to
the appellants' books which disclosed all the transactions.  The testimony
given by clients of the appellants was overwhelmingly to the effect that no
disclosure was made to them that commissions would be received by the appellants
from the promoters of the developments for the sale of the units.  It will be
for the judge presiding at the new trial to determine whether, in the
circumstances of the case, the disclosure made by the appellants to their
clients was adequate and timely.  The Court of Appeal correctly determined that
there must be a new trial with regard to that issue.

 

The Admissibility of the Statement of
Arnold

 

                   Arnold had made a
statement to the police two years before the charges were laid.  The trial
judge had ruled on a voir dire that the statement was voluntary but
inadmissible under s. 24(2)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  because Arnold was a suspect at the time the statement was made. 
The Court of Appeal determined, correctly in my view, that Arnold was not in
detention at the time the statement was made, that his rights had not been
violated by the police and that the statement was therefore admissible.

 

                   In any event, the
appellants have not put in issue the correctness of the Court of Appeal's
ruling with regard to the admissibility of the statement.  Rather the
appellants contested the position of the Court of Appeal that the exclusion of
the statement constituted a sufficient error to warrant a new trial.  I agree
that this error alone would not have been sufficient to warrant a new trial. 
However, it is quite clear that the Court of Appeal's order granting a new
trial was based primarily on the trial judge's misconception of the mens rea
required by s. 426  and of the meaning which he gave to the word
""corruptly"".  The conclusion that an error had been made with regard
to the statement did no more than supplement the decision to grant a new trial.

 

Disposition

 

                   In the result, the
appeal must be dismissed.  The order of the Court of Appeal setting aside the
acquittals and ordering a new trial will be affirmed.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Sopinka J. (dissenting) -- I have had
the advantage of reviewing the reasons of Cory J. herein but unfortunately I
cannot agree with his disposition of this matter.  As I have outlined in my
reasons in R. v. Kelly, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 000, which are being released
concurrently, in my view s. 426(1) (a) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , requires that the Crown prove two essentials of the
mental element of the offence before being able to secure a conviction.  The
first concerns the knowledge or belief of the accused as to the purpose of the
transaction.  When an agent is charged, it must be established that he or she
demanded, accepted or offered or agreed to accept the benefit as a quid pro
quo to influence him or her.  A benefit cannot be demanded or received in
consideration for doing an act if the taker did not believe that it was being
demanded, offered or given for that purpose.  Thus the Crown must prove that
the benefit was so demanded, offered or accepted with the agent's knowledge or
belief that it was given for that purpose.  This requirement looks to the state
of mind of the agent at the time of the transaction.  The corruption in this
action is the belief that the valuable consideration is intended to influence
the agent to show favour to some person in relation to the affairs of his or
her principal.  The taker is thus caught even if he or she was mistaken as to
the true intention of the giver.

 

                          If the giver
is charged, it must be shown that he or she gave, offered or agreed to give or
offer a benefit intending that it would influence an agent to show favour to
some person in relation to the affairs of the agent's principal.  As with the
taker, it is the state of mind of the giver at the time of the transaction that
is crucial. 

 

                   The second
requirement of the mental element of this offence is that the accused entered
into the transaction mala fide.  This is most easily satisfied through
proof of dishonesty.  As I indicated in Kelly, non-disclosure is not
synonymous with the terms ""corruptly"" or mala fides, although
it may be a strong indicator that the accused has acted in bad faith.  In some
situations disclosure or the intent to disclose will be highly relevant.  For
example, if an agent is offered valuable consideration to influence his or her
principal but at all times intended to disclose this fact to his or her
principal, such an intention will foreclose a finding of bad faith against the
agent.  Conversely, if a giver offers valuable consideration to influence an
agent with the belief that the agent will not disclose the consideration to the
agent's principal, any actual disclosure or non-disclosure on the part of the
agent is irrelevant vis-à-vis the giver.  The offence is complete when
the giver makes the offer with the belief that it will not be disclosed.

 

                   The words of the
charges in this case make it clear that the offences charged are in relation to
a transaction with certain management companies pursuant to which the
appellants accepted consideration for inducing their clients to invest
in certain development projects.  As was the case in Kelly, the
commissions were to be paid regardless of to whom the investments were sold. 
The payments were made to the appellants pursuant to an agreement that could
not be said to be in consideration of the sale to clients of the appellants.  The
agreement was entered into at arm's length and the commissions were the same
amount as was paid to any other salesmen.  While in many instances the
appellants sold to their clients that was not because they were influenced to
do so by the management companies nor because they believed that this was the
intended purpose of either the agreement or of the payments.  The decision to
sell to their clients was one made unilaterally by the appellants.  Failure to
make full disclosure to the clients may have amounted to a breach of duty but
the appellants are not guilty of the offence charged.

 

                   It is clear from a
review of the record before the Court that the trial judge made a finding that
the appellants had not acted mala fide in the dealings giving rise to the
charges before the Court.  This finding was amply supported by the evidence. 
As noted by Cory J. in his reasons, the trial judge found ""that unlike the
Kelly case . . . the crooks in this case are probably Rockwood and
Christopherson"".  The trial judge implicitly concluded that the appellants
had acted in good faith and had not intentionally failed to adequately disclose
the commissions they received.  In view of this finding the accused cannot be
convicted of the charges as framed.

 

                   Accordingly, I would
allow the appeal and restore the acquittals.

 

//McLachlin J.//

 

                   The folowing are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. -- I have read the reasons of Sopinka J. and Cory J. and agree with Cory J.
that the appeal must be dismissed. As I have outlined in my reasons in R. v.
Kelly, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 000, which are being released concurrently, I agree
with Cory J. that lack of disclosure is an element of the actus reus of
the offence under s. 426(1) (a)(ii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , and that an awareness of that lack of disclosure is an element
of its mens rea. I depart from Cory J. on two points, however. First,
with respect to the timing of disclosure, certainty requires that where the
gravamen of the offence is the taking of a secret commission disclosure
to the principal must be made by the time the commission is accepted. Second,
with respect to the degree of disclosure required, the requirements of s.
426(1) (a)(ii) will, in my view, be satisfied if the agent discloses to
the principal that he will receive a commission with respect to the transaction
in question. Thus, an agent who advises his principal in advance that he will
be receiving a commission with respect to a particular transaction will be
innocent of any offence under s. 426(1) (a)(ii).

 

                   The trial judge in
the present appeal found that ""there was no specific disclosure of amounts
to the clients. But there was disclosure that fees would be received"".
Given my interpretation of the requirements imposed by the section the fact that
the appellants did not make specific disclosure of the amounts to be
received need not concern us. But unfortunately the trial judge's reasons do
not make clear whether the disclosure which he found the appellants to have
given was limited to general statements that they would receive commissions
with respect to transactions entered into by their clients, or whether there
was also specific disclosure of the fact that they would receive commissions
with respect to the transactions at issue in this appeal.

 

                   The Nova Scotia
Court of Appeal (1991), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 171 (per Macdonald J.A.), held
that the evidence was clear that the appellants did not tell their clients they
would receive commissions with respect to these transactions unless
specifically asked, and that the replies they gave in response were ""vague
to say the least"" and ""could not be categorized as full and frank and
fair"" (p. 174).

 

                   Unlike the Court of
Appeal, I would not enter into a re-examination of the evidence in an attempt
to determine what disclosure was made by the appellants and when. Although we
come to different conclusions with respect to the standard of disclosure to
which the appellants should be held, I agree with Cory J. that the findings of
the trial judge are not adequate to resolve the disclosure issue. As a result
the Court of Appeal's decision setting aside the acquittals and ordering a new
trial must be affirmed and the appeal dismissed.

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Sentencing ‑‑ Dangerous driving ‑‑
Motor accident involving bodily injury and death ‑‑ Jury verdict: 
not guilty of causing death or bodily injury by dangerous driving but guilty of
included offence of dangerous driving simpliciter ‑‑ Whether judge
on sentencing entitled to adopt as facts matters expressly or implicitly
rejected by jury.

 

                   The accused appealed
his sentence for dangerous driving imposed at trial and affirmed on appeal by a
divided Court of Appeal.  The issue is whether the consequences of death and
bodily injury should have been considered when the jury had acquitted the
accused of dangerous driving causing death and bodily injury.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   The sentencer is
bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury's verdict. 
Here, the finding of dangerous driving, simpliciter, in the face of the more serious
charges left no room for speculation.  The jury unambiguously negated the
factor of causation and both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal were bound
by it.  Since Parliament chose to make dangerous driving a consequence related
crime, the consequence of death or bodily injury must be taken to be excluded
under a determination of guilt of dangerous driving.

 

                   The determination
of a fit sentence for an offence is generally to be determined by the
provincial appellate courts.  The dissenting judge on the Court of Appeal fully
considered the matter and determined the fit sentence; his conclusion was
adopted.

//Stevenson J.//

 

          The judgment of the Court
was delivered by

 

          Stevenson J. -- The accused appeals, by leave, a sentence of
twelve months imprisonment for dangerous driving imposed at trial and affirmed
on appeal by a divided Court of Appeal.  The issue is whether the trial judge
and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in considering the consequences
of death and bodily injury when the jury had acquitted the accused of dangerous
driving causing death and bodily injury.

 

          The accused was the driver
of a motor vehicle involved in a collision with another motor vehicle.  As a
result of the collision two passengers in the other vehicle died and two others
were injured.

 

          The accused was initially
charged with two counts of causing death by criminal negligence.  This was
reduced by the preliminary inquiry judge to dangerous driving causing death. 
Shortly before the trial a new indictment was filed, adding two additional
counts of dangerous driving causing bodily injury.

 

          At the trial, the Crown
argued that the accused was speeding and had driven through a red light, that
this manner of driving was dangerous, and that the dangerous driving had caused
the collision and resulted in death and injuries.  The defence argued that the appellant
was not exceeding the speed limit by an excessive amount nor did he disobey the
traffic light.  Moreover, the defence urged that the manner of the appellant's
driving was not causally connected to the collision or the deaths or the
injuries.

 

          The jury found the accused
not guilty of causing death or bodily injury by dangerous driving but guilty of
the included offences of dangerous driving, simpliciter.

 

          On sentencing, the trial
judge noted that deterrence was the element that was most significant in this
case and then turned to various relevant facts.  The appellant's traffic
infractions, he said, ""do reflect some disregard for the rules to be
obeyed in driving a vehicle"".  He then commented that:

 

          Now
in this case, under the jury, they found you guilty of dangerous driving
alone.  And it's probably fortunate for you that they did.  But the facts still
are that two people died as the result ‑‑ or following that
collision ‑‑ following that collision.  And two others suffer
injuries that they are still being treated for today.

 

          Included in the case on
appeal was a letter or report written by the trial judge to the Court of
Appeal, which contains the following statement:

 

Nothing
is clearer than the death and injuries to the four victims arose directly from
that collision.  It was a flagrant example of dangerous driving taking all
circumstances into account.

 

          Before the Court of Appeal,
the accused argued that the sentence was excessive for dangerous driving,
simpliciter.  The
majority of the Court of Appeal ((1990), 81 Sask. R. 295) noted at p. 296 that
""If the [accused] is correct, the sentence here does not bear an
acceptable comparison [to other cases]. . . .""

 

          In the Court of Appeal, the
majority upheld the trial judge's sentence.  In the course of his majority
judgment Wakeling J.A. said at p. 296:

 

          The
appellant suggests the trial judge's right is restricted severely because if he
goes too far he is basing the sentence on facts which must have been rejected
by the jury, otherwise the lessor verdict of dangerous driving would not have
been rendered.  The Crown says the trial judge not only can but has the duty to
consider all of the evidence in order to determine a proper sentence, which
evidence includes the fact the accused is at least partly to blame for a
serious accident which took two lives.  If the appellant is correct, the
sentence here does not bear an acceptable comparison to such cases
. . . .  If the Crown is correct, then the sentence is not
exceptional when compared to cases in which the consequences are similar to
those involved in this case.

 

          In dissent, Tallis J.A.
noted the judge's obligation to respect the jury verdict which expressly
rejected any causal connection between the way he was driving and the deaths
and injuries and concluded the sentence should have been reduced to six months
imprisonment.

 

          The majority referred to an
apparent divergence between English and Australian courts on the position to be
taken regarding findings of fact by a sentencer when the determination of guilt
has been made by a jury.  Ruby, Sentencing (3rd ed. 1987), at pp. 61‑62,
Thomas, Principles of Sentencing (2nd ed. 1979) at p. 367, and
Tremblay v. The Queen
(1969), 7 C.R.N.S. 315 (Que. C.A.), were cited.

 

          The divergence to which the
majority of the Court of Appeal referred centres on the question of whether the
judge is bound to assume that the jury took the most lenient view of the facts
which would support the verdict.  That issue does not arise here because
the only factual question relates to the consequences and on that factual
question the jury's decision is not in doubt.  Thomas makes it clear that
subject to the jury's express and implied factual findings the judge must make
the necessary sentencing findings.  He or she must, of course, make those
findings in keeping with the law relating to the finding of facts on sentencing
set out in R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, which establishes
that while all credible and trustworthy evidence may be accepted, disputed
facts relied upon by the Crown in aggravation must be established beyond a
reasonable doubt.

 

          In
Tremblay, the trial
judge in sentencing for a manslaughter conviction expressed his opinion that
the accused was guilty of deliberate murder.  The majority of the Court of
Appeal decided not to interfere with the sentence on the basis that rid of references
or expressions of opinion to give the accused's acts the character of murder,
the acts were sufficiently grave to justify the sentence (a maximum).  The
dissenting judge found that the sentence was not fit and that it was influenced
by the conclusion that the acts were murder.  The majority thus found the
sentence was ""fit"", untainted by impermissible considerations.

 

          Before us, the parties were
agreed that there is no relevant difference between the English and Australian
positions.  In its factum filed here the Crown set out the English position,
again quoting Thomas from an article, ""Establishing a Factual Basis for
Sentencing"", [1970] Crim. L.R. 80, at p. 82, where he says:

 

. . .
the Court of Appeal has developed the principle that where the factual
implication of the jury's verdict is clear, the sentencer is bound to accept it
and a sentence which is excessive in the light of the facts implied in the
verdict will be reduced . . . .  This principle can only apply
however where the factual implication of the jury's verdict is clear;  where
. . . the factual implication is ambiguous, the court has held that
the sentencer should not attempt to follow the logical process of the jury, but
may come to his own independent determination of the relevant facts.

 

          This statement reflects the
correct principle, namely that the sentencer is bound by the express and
implied factual implications of the jury's verdict.  There are other
authorities to the same effect:  R. v. Speid (1985), 46 C.R. (3d) 22, at p. 47;
Boyle and Allen, Sentencing Law and Practice (1985), at pp. 225, 227 and 229; Fox and
Freiberg, Sentencing:  State and Federal Law in Victoria (1985), at p. 48; Stockdale and
Devlin, Stockdale and Devlin on Sentencing (1987), at p. 62.

 

          The Crown, here, took a
different position, namely, that the ""narrow question"" was whether
the jury's verdict was ambiguous leaving the sentencing judge free to make an
independent determination.  The argument is that the judge did not adequately
describe the test for causation set out  in Smithers v. The
Queen, [1978] 1
S.C.R. 506, R. v. Pinske (1988), 6 M.V.R. (2d) 19 (B.C.C.A.), affirmed
orally by this Court, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 979.  Counsel for the Crown analysed the
jury charge and argued that questions that were asked by the jury indicated
that it may not have been properly instructed or that it had misunderstood the
law on causation.  Those are arguments against the jury's acquittal on the more
serious charges and, if correct, would found an appeal of the acquittal.  The
Crown did not appeal the acquittals for dangerous driving causing death and
bodily injury and must accept the verdicts.

 

          The findings of dangerous
driving, simpliciter, in the face of the more serious charges leaves
no room for speculation.  The jury has negated the factor of causation.  This
verdict was unambiguous and the trial judge was bound by it.  So was the Court
of Appeal.

 

          Since Parliament has chosen
to make dangerous driving a consequence related crime, the consequence of death
or bodily injury must be taken to be excluded under a determination of guilt of
dangerous driving, simpliciter.  The Crown, here, conceded that had the accused
entered a guilty plea to dangerous driving, simpliciter, it could not argue a more serious
sentence based upon these consequences:  R. v. Doerksen (1990), 19 M.V.R. (2d) 16
(Man. C.A.).  There is, in my view, no valid distinction between the two
situations.

 

          It follows that the appeal
must be allowed.  The appellant invites us to substitute an appropriate sentence. 
The determination of a fit sentence for an offence is generally to be
determined by the provincial appellate courts.  In my view, Tallis J.A. has
fully considered the matter and determined the fit sentence in Saskatchewan in
the circumstances of this offence.  I would adopt his conclusion and impose a
sentence of six months imprisonment and affirm the driving prohibition of three
years imposed at trial.

    Cory J. --  We are all of the view
that this appeal as of right should be dismissed.

 

    The case lasted for seven weeks,
the charge for two days.  The trial judge in his directions to the jury
carefully and fairly reviewed the evidence of all the witnesses, including
their cross-examinations and the contradictions that were made arising from the
cross-examinations.

 

    The trial judge did warn the jury
of the unsavoury character of some of the witnesses.  He said that their
testimony was suspect and that they had reasons to lie.  His instructions
pertaining to the unsavoury witnesses were sufficient to comply with the
requirements set forth in Vetrovec.

 

    As well, we are satisfied that the
trial judge adequately set forth the theory of the defence.

 

    Nor did the trial judge err in his
response to the jury's request for the transcripts of the evidence of the seven
witnesses.  The request and response must be looked at in context.  It is
significant that the charge was completed at 12:15 p.m.  When the jury retired
they were told by the trial judge not to commence their deliberations until
advised by the sheriff officer; that is to say, when the trial judge had
completed his discussions with counsel pertaining to the charge.

 

    The question was posted shortly
after 2 p.m.  The jury asked for a transcript of all the witnesses and
particulary of seven named witnesses, five of whom gave evidence relating to
Ostrowski.  It would be speculative to say that the jury had even commenced
their deliberations by this time or had formed a precise reason for the
request.

 

    Further, the trial judge was
careful not to close the door to this request.  He suggested that they begin
their deliberations based on their collective recollection of the evidence. 
However, he specifically invited the jury to come back if after they had
commenced their deliberations they needed further assistance in this regard. 
He indicated that at that time he would read from his notes pertaining to the
witnesses or if necessary obtain the transcripts.  No objection to this
response was taken by the experienced counsel appearing for the appellant.  No
further request was made by the jury for the transcripts.  The jury deliberated
until shortly in the afternoon the following day at which time they delivered
their verdict.  In those circumstances, it cannot be said that any error was
made by the trial judge.

 

    In the result, the appeal is
dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
saskatchewan

 

    Criminal
law -- Appeals -- Powers of court of appeal -- Crown appeal against acquittal
-- Criminal Code providing that Crown may appeal an acquittal on a question of
law alone -- Whether Court of Appeal exceeded its jurisdiction in overturning
acquittals and ordering a new trial ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, ss. 605(1), 613(4).

 

    Appellants,
who were elementary school students, were acquitted at trial of sexually
assaulting a fellow student.  The trial judge had a reasonable doubt as to
their involvement in the alleged assault.  He also found that the date of the
offence was an essential element and that it had not been proved.

 

    The
complainant was eight years old at the time of the alleged offence and nine at
the time of the trial.  The Crown's other key witness, Z, a co-accused and
accomplice who had pleaded guilty to the same charge, was fourteen at the time
of trial.  Both were sworn.  The complainant's evidence, however, was found to
be unreliable.  Z's evidence was not accepted either.

 

    The
Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.  The appeal had
been lodged under s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , which
provides for a Crown appeal on a question of law alone.  The court justified
its intervention in that the trial judge had erred in considering the evidence
of the complainant and of Z in isolation from each other instead of considering
the potential for corroboration.  It also found that the father's testimony
corroborated that of the complainant.

 

    At
issue here is whether the Court of Appeal exceeded its jurisdiction when it
overturned the appellants' acquittals and ordered a new trial.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per Wilson,
L'Heureux-Dubé and Cory JJ.:  The Crown may appeal an acquittal on a question
of law alone under s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code .  The reasonableness of a verdict or the sufficiency of
the evidence does not raise a question of law alone.  The narrower ground for
appeal from an acquittal as opposed to appeal from a conviction reflects the
fundamental principle that an accused is presumed innocent until proved guilty
by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  In Harper v. The Queen, this
Court held that an appellate tribunal has jurisdiction to review the record
below to determine whether the trial court has properly directed itself to all
the evidence bearing on the relevant issues.  A misapprehension of relevant
evidence will amount to an error of law alone pursuant to s. 605(1) (a) only
if it is the result of misdirection.  As this was the case here, the matter
fell within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

 

    The
approach the trial judge takes to the evidence must be correct in law to ensure
that the final step in the process, the weighing of the evidence, is not
flawed.  Individual pieces of evidence must not be examined in isolation, but
must be considered in the context of all the evidence.  In this case, the trial
judge considered the evidence of the two key Crown witnesses separately, and
failed to consider the evidence as a whole.  He first considered the
complainant's evidence in isolation, and rejected it as unreliable.  He then
moved on to Z's evidence, stating that it was all he had left.  He also failed
to consider the corroborative aspects of Z's testimony and of the evidence
relating to the complainant's broken glasses.  This viewing of the evidence
without the support of other evidence amounted to serious misdirection
according to this Court's decision in R. v. Morin. 
Finally, the trial judge erred in concluding that it was necessary for the
Crown to establish with precision the date on which the alleged offence
occurred, and this error heavily influenced his finding of a reasonable doubt.

 

    Per
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.:  The appeal should be dismissed and a new trial
ordered in view of the trial judge's erroneous conclusion that the Crown was
obliged to establish the precise time when the offence occurred.  While it is
an error of law for the trial judge to direct that the reasonable doubt
standard must be applied to individual pieces of evidence, it is far from
certain that he committed this error.  He never stated that any piece of
evidence was to be considered with respect to reasonable doubt in isolation
from the rest of the evidence, nor did he suggest that any piece of evidence
should be completely disregarded for failing to meet such a standard.  With respect
to the corroborative value of Z's testimony, where a trial judge is sitting as
a trier of fact, it is open to him to reject the evidence of a witness as
lacking credibility and hence not being capable of constituting corroboration.

    The
judgment of Wilson, L'Heureux-Dubé and Cory JJ. was delivered by

 

    Wilson
J. -- The appellants are young offenders who were acquitted of sexual assault
at trial.  The Crown's appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was allowed
and the appellants now appeal to this Court as of right.  This judgment is the
third in a trilogy dealing with the sexual assaults that allegedly occurred at
Sheho Elementary School in Saskatchewan between September 1985 and May 1986. 
This appeal was heard together with R. v. B. (G.), [1990]
2 S.C.R. 000, and R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000, (hereinafter R. v. G.B., A.B. and C.S.), which are dealt
with in two related judgments.  The issue in this appeal is whether the Court
of Appeal exceeded its jurisdiction in overturning the appellants' acquittals
and ordering a new trial.

 

1.  The
Facts

 

    Each
of the appellants was separately charged in informations alleging that:

 

On or
between the 3rd day of September A.D. 1985 and the 30th day of September A.D.
1985 at Sheho in the Province of Saskatchewan being a young person within the
meaning of the Young Offenders Act did commit a sexual assault on S.M. contrary
to Section 246.1(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

    The
two key witnesses for the Crown were S.M., the complainant, and C.Z., a
co-accused and accomplice who had previously entered a plea of guilty to the
same charge prior to trial.  S.M. was eight years old at the time of the
alleged offence and nine years old at the time of the trial.  C.Z. was fourteen
years old at the time of trial.  Both witnesses were duly sworn by the trial
judge.

 

    The
complainant identified C.Z. and each of the appellants as participants in the
alleged assault.  He testified that he thought the offence occurred in
September of 1985.  When cross-examined, however, he was uncertain when the
incident occurred and agreed with defence counsel's suggestion that it may have
been after Easter and thus in the spring of 1986.  The trial judge summarized
S.M.'s testimony as follows:

 

I was
coming out of the bathroom, G.B. kicked the door open and pushed me back, and
they sweared at me -- pulled my pants down and shoved a pencil in my bum and
there was blood running out of my bum, and there was blood on the pencil.  They
pulled my penis and they pulled down their pants, and they forced me to pull
their penis -- and banged my head against the wall and broke my glasses.

 

    C.Z.
gave similar evidence.  He testified that he and the appellants came across the
complainant in the school washroom just before recess, each kicked the
complainant, put a pencil in the complainant's bum, and touched his penis.  He
testified that he did not recall seeing the appellants' penises at any time. 
With respect to the time of the offence C.Z. testified that the incident
occurred between September 1 and September 30 of 1985 but could not remember if
it was the beginning, middle, or end of September.  During cross-examination
C.Z. agreed with defence counsel that the alleged assault could have happened
the last week of September or the beginning of October but stated that it could
not have occurred at the end of October or in November. 

    The
complainant's father and stepmother gave the only other evidence for the
Crown.  Neither had been told of the incident and had suspected nothing.  The
father testified that he had had the complainant's glasses repaired in September
of 1985.  The only other clear evidence of S.M. breaking his glasses was an
incident later in the winter when the lens popped out during gym class after an
incident with another student.

 

    The
appellants all testified and denied that they had sexually assaulted the
complainant at any time.  The defence also called a number of teachers who
testified that there was constant supervision by teachers at the school and
they were not aware of, nor advised of, anything untoward happening.  One of
the teachers, Shaunda Halldorson, testified that there had been a problem in
the gym with S.M.'s glasses.  All of the appellants were acquitted by the trial
judge.

 

2.  Issues

 

    The
sole issue for determination in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal
exceeded its jurisdiction in overturning the acquittals and ordering a new
trial.

 

    Section
605(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 676(1) ) authorizes the Attorney
General to appeal an acquittal to the Court of Appeal.  It reads:

 

    605. (1)  The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

 

(a) 
against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by
indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone, . . .

 

    Section
613(4) (now s. 686(4)) sets out the options available to the Court of Appeal on
a Crown appeal of an acquittal:

 

                            613. . . .

 

    (4)  Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court
of appeal may

 

(a)  dismiss the appeal; or

 

(b)  allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

 

(i)  order a new trial, or

 

(ii)
except where the verdict is that of a court composed of a judge and jury, enter
a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its opinion, the
accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law, and pass a
sentence that is warranted in law.

 

2.  The
Courts Below

 

Saskatchewan
Provincial Court (Chorneyko Prov. Ct. J., unreported)

 

    The
trial judge first explained that his approach to the case would be to review
the salient parts of the evidence without comment and then comment on that
evidence in light of the legal principles.  He proceeded to outline the
evidence of the complainant and the participant C.Z.  Commenting first on the
evidence relating to the complainant's glasses, he expressed the view that the
evidence of the parties on this aspect was completely neutral.  It neither
helped the Crown's case nor assisted the defence.  As to the balance of the
evidence, the trial judge reminded himself of Judson J.'s comment as to the
inherent frailties of children's evidence in Kendall v. The Queen, [1962]
S.C.R. 469, at p. 473.  He then concluded that the complainant's evidence was
unreliable since it had become clear during his examination and
cross-examination that with the proper approach one could get him to admit
almost anything.  He was also of the view that the complainant's testimony had
been rehearsed.  This therefore  ""leaves the evidence of C.Z.""

 

    The
trial judge noted that C.Z. had given an earlier statement which was different
from his testimony in court.  C.Z. admitted that the first part of his
testimony was lies and, when pressed, he could not indicate with any degree of
certainty when the truth began.  The trial judge referred to the fact that C.Z.
testified that each of the boys hit S.M., pulled his penis, and stuck a pencil
up his bum.  The complainant was said to be crying and yelling at the time. 
The trial judge stated that, if this had really occurred, it would have taken
longer than a couple of minutes and there would have been bleeding and
discomfort displayed by the boy such as a difference in his walk.  Common sense
would also indicate that the crying and shouting would have been heard by
others.  There was absolutely no evidence to corroborate the bleeding,
bruising, or crying.  After discussing the logistical difficulties implied by
the testimony of C.Z. the trial judge stated he could not accept his version of
the alleged assault.  There were just too many unresolved questions and too
many doubts as to what actually happened.

 

    Chorneyko
Prov. Ct. J. next addressed the question of time.  He said that after hearing
all the evidence he could not form a view with any reasonable degree of
certainty when the alleged offence took place.  He referred to R. v.
Hamilton-Middleton (1986), 53 Sask. R. 80, as authority for the
proposition that the date of an offence is an essential element and must be
proven.  He therefore refused the Crown's request to amend the information to
conform with the evidence led.  He said that C.Z., being fourteen years of age,
should have been able to reconstruct when the alleged event took place with
greater precision.  He was left with a reasonable doubt that each of the
appellants was involved in the alleged assault and therefore had to find each
of them not guilty.

 

Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal  ((1988), 65 Sask. R. 134)

 

    The
Court of Appeal (Vancise, Wakeling and Gerwing JJ.A.) unanimously allowed the
Crown's appeal and ordered a new trial.  Vancise J.A., for the court,
acknowledged that it was not open to an appellate court on an appeal under s.
605  of the Criminal Code  to consider the
reasonableness of the trial judge's findings of fact but stated that it could
review the record to determine whether the trial judge had properly directed
himself to all the relevant evidence bearing on the relevant issues.  He cited
this Court's decision in Harper v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R.
2, as authority.

 

    In
the opinion of the court an examination of the reasons for judgment of the
trial judge revealed that he had examined the evidence of the complainant and
of C.Z. in isolation from each other thereby failing to appreciate that the
evidence of C.Z. was capable of corroborating the evidence of the complainant. 
Vancise J.A. stated that while there were discrepancies between the evidence of
S.M and C.Z., they were relatively insignificant.  It would be surprising,
moreover, if there were no such discrepancies.

 

    After
reviewing the part of the judgment dealing with the testimony of C.Z., the
court concluded that the trial judge must have ignored his  evidence when he
found that the event had not occurred.  Accordingly the court was justified in
interfering with his decision and ordering a new trial.  Vancise J.A. stated at
p. 146:

 

    He
did not take into account the evidence of C.Z. which was corroborative of the
story of S.M., that is: (1) that it occurred in the boys' washroom; (2) that it
occurred at the end of recess;  (3) that six persons other than C.Z. were
involved; (4) that G.B. initiated the assault; (5) that S.M. was kicked and
pushed to the floor; (6) that his penis was pulled and that he was assaulted
anally.  All of that evidence was capable of confirming the story of S.M. which
implicated all the accused.  The trial judge ignored that evidence or failed to
mention it and instead concentrated on evidence which he stated should have
been led.  In so doing he displayed a lack of appreciation of relevant evidence
which could have had a bearing on the result which justifies this court
interfering.

 

    Vancise
J.A. next addressed the evidence as it related to the breakage of the complainant's
glasses, stating that the trial judge had also misapprehended that evidence. 
The complainant had testified that his glasses were broken during the alleged
assault and his father had testified that his son's glasses were broken in
September of 1985 and that he had had them repaired.  Vancise J.A. noted that
the glasses had been broken at other times but was of the view that the
father's evidence corroborated the complainant's evidence of this particular
breakage.  Vancise J.A. also reviewed the evidence relating to the time of the
offence and held that the trial judge should have amended the information as
requested by the Crown.

 

    Wakeling
J.A. wrote additional reasons (Gerwing J.A. concurring) in which he commented
on the trial judge's treatment of the evidence of child witnesses and the
expert witness.  However, since the appellants raised his comments directly in
the related appeal of R. v. G.B., A.B. and C.S., I have dealt with
them in that judgment.

 

4.  Analysis

 

    The
major submission of the appellants to this Court is that the Court of Appeal
exceeded its jurisdiction in substituting its own views of the evidence for
that of the trial judge.  The appellants point out that the trial judge reached
his conclusion that the event as described did not occur after noting that
common sense would dictate discomfort by the child, bleeding, a different walk,
bruising, and that the entire episode would take more than two minutes.  The
appellants claim that these were findings of fact which should not have been
interfered with.  The appellants further submit that the argument that a trial
judge has failed to appreciate the relevant evidence makes sense in the context
of an appeal from conviction but not in the case of an appeal against an
acquittal.  When a trial judge acquits he or she need only find a reasonable
doubt; the rest of the decision is superfluous.  However, if need be, the
appellants submit that the trial judge did not disregard the relevant evidence.

 

    In
support of their argument the appellants cite Sunbeam Corporation
(Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 221, which dealt with the recurring
problem of whether it is a question of law alone when the Crown establishes all
the essential elements of the offence but the trial judge still acquits on the
basis of a reasonable doubt.  This question is, of course, very important in
the case of an appeal by the Crown against an acquittal pursuant to s. 605(1)(a) since
the Crown is confined under that subsection to an appeal on a question of law
alone.  The narrower ground for appeal from an acquittal as opposed to appeal
from a conviction reflects the fundamental principle that an accused is
presumed to be innocent until proved guilty by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

    In Sunbeam the
corporation was charged with four counts of attempting to require or induce the
maintenance of a resale price contrary to the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314.  The corporation was convicted on
two of the counts and acquitted on the other two on the ground that there was
insufficient evidence of inducement.  The Crown appealed the acquittals and a
majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal (Laskin J.A. dissenting) allowed the
appeal and entered convictions on both counts.  Schroeder J.A., for the
majority, was of the view that no person acting judicially and properly
instructed as to the relevant principles of law could have reached the decision
of the trial judge.  He concluded that the court was therefore entitled to
assume that some misconception of law was responsible for the decision.

 

    On
appeal to this Court the corporation submitted that the Court of Appeal had no
jurisdiction to deal with the Crown's appeal because it was not on a question
of law alone.  Ritchie J., for the majority (Judson, Spence and Pigeon JJ.
dissenting), agreed and reversed the Court of Appeal.  He found that the trial
judge had simply concluded that the evidence was not sufficient to satisfy him
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.  He stated at pp.
234-35:

 

    In
the present case the trial judge accepted the evidence as contained in the
letters above referred to and thus gave full effect to s. 41(2) of the Combines
Investigation Act, but he concluded that this evidence was not sufficient
to satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were guilty on the
3rd and 4th counts.  However wrong the Court of Appeal or this Court may
think that he was in reaching this conclusion, I am of opinion, with all
respect for those who hold a different view, that his error cannot be
determined without passing judgment on the reasonableness of the verdict or the
sufficiency of the evidence, and in my view these are not matters over which
the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction under s. [605(1)(a)] of the Criminal
Code .  [Emphasis added.]

 

In
reaching this conclusion Ritchie J. referred to the different standards set for
appeals from acquittals and appeals from convictions under the Criminal
Code  and found that the different words used by Parliament
in the different sections of the Code supported his
conclusion.  He stated at pp. 237-38:

 

    Parliament
has thus conferred jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal
against a conviction on three separate grounds, one of which is the very ground
upon which the Court of Appeal allowed the present appeal, i.e., that ""the
verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be
supported by the evidence"".  The fact that s. [613(1)(a)]
recognizes this ground as being separate and distinct from ""the ground of
a wrong decision on a question of law"" appears to me to be the best kind
of evidence of the fact that Parliament did not intend the phrase ""a
question of law"" as it is used in the Code to include the question of
whether the verdict at trial was unreasonable or could not be supported by the
evidence.  It is noteworthy that having accorded the Court of
Appeal jurisdiction to hear appeals against conviction on the ground that the
verdict was unreasonable, Parliament did not confer the same jurisdiction on
that Court in appeals by the Crown.  No authority is needed for the proposition
that appellate jurisdiction must be expressly conferred and with all respect
for those who may hold a different view, I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal
has exceeded its jurisdiction by allowing this appeal on a ground reserved for
appeals against conviction which does not extend to appeals by the Attorney
General.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    A
few months after Sunbeam this Court considered the issue again
in  Lampard v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 373, in which the
accused had been acquitted on charges of fraudulent manipulation of stock
exchange transactions.  The key issue in the case was the intent of the
accused.  McLennan J.A., for the Ontario Court of Appeal, reversed the trial
judge's decision on the basis that there was only one reasonable inference that
could be drawn from the evidence on the record, indeed an irresistible one,
namely, that a guilty intention existed in the mind of the accused.  In allowing
the accused's appeal to this Court, Cartwright C.J. held that a person's
intention is a question of fact and that in criminal cases there will always be
some evidence upon which to rest an acquittal.  He stated at pp. 380-81:

 

    When the onus of establishing a certain fact lies
upon a party it may be a question of law whether there is any evidence (as
distinguished from sufficient evidence) to prove that fact.  In the case at bar
the onus was, of course, upon the Crown to prove that the appellant did the
acts complained of with the guilty intention specified in the section.  If the
learned trial Judge erred in finding that that onus had not been satisfied, his
error was one of fact, certainly not one of law in the strict sense.  The
applicable principles are clearly set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie
giving the judgment of the majority of this Court in the Sunbeam case, supra, and it
is not necessary to repeat them.

 

    In a
criminal case (except in the rare cases in which a statutory provision places
an onus upon the accused) it can sometimes be said as a matter of law that
there is no evidence on which the Court can convict but never that there is no
evidence on which it can acquit; there is always the rebuttable presumption of
innocence.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
correctness of these two cases was recently affirmed by this Court in Schuldt v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, which is also relied on by the
appellants in support of their position.  Lamer J., for the Court, expanded
upon the reasoning in Sunbeam and dealt with the confusion that had
arisen with respect to Wild v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R.
101.  In Wild Martland J., for a majority of this
Court (Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting), held that where a
trial judge has acquitted an accused on a charge of criminal negligence on the
basis that the evidence raised a reasonable doubt that the accused was driving
and where, on a proper view of the law, that evidence was not capable of
creating such a doubt, a question of law is raised.  Cartwright C.J. and Hall
and Spence JJ., however, dissented on the ground that no question of law was
raised.  They relied on Sunbeam and Lampard as
authority.  

 

    Lamer
J. concluded that Wild had been correctly decided because
the trial judge had speculated on the possibility that one of the other
occupants might have been the driver of the car thus coming to a conjectural
conclusion which he considered might be inconsistent with guilt.  Lamer J.
confirmed that this would indeed constitute an error of law.  He further held,
however, that while he agreed with Martland J. that a finding of fact made in
the absence of any supportive evidence is an error of law, this will only happen
in the case of an acquittal on the basis of a reasonable doubt if there has
been a transfer to the accused by law of the burden of proof of a given fact. 
Lamer J. added that the majority decision in Wild should
not be taken as detracting from this statement of the law.

 

    In Schuldt the
accused was charged with having attempted to break and enter a gun shop with
the intent to commit an indictable offence.  The accused had been acquitted at
trial as the trial judge found that there was no proof that the accused had the
requisite intention.  The acquittal was set aside by the majority of the
Manitoba Court of Appeal on the basis that the trial judge's finding of fact
was not reasonable but fanciful and quite out of touch with the reality of the
case.  The Court of Appeal therefore found that there was no factual basis upon
which to have a reasonable doubt and that this constituted an error of law. 
Relying on Sunbeam and Lampard Lamer
J. concluded that the Court of Appeal had exceeded its jurisdiction.  He
explained why at p. 610:

 

In other
words, absent a shifting of the burden of proof upon the accused there is
always some evidence upon which to make a finding of fact favourable to the
accused, and such a finding, if in error, is an error of fact.  But when the
burden of proof has been shifted (as is the case for proof of intent when a
person is found in a place which he or she has broken into), it can be said,
absent any evidence to the contrary, that there is no evidence upon which a
reasonable doubt could exist as regards the intent of the accused, and an
appeal against the ensuing acquittal raises a question of law alone.

 

    In
light of these authorities it was, in my view, clearly not open to the Court of
Appeal to overturn the acquittal because it found it to be unreasonable or
unsupported by the evidence.  On an appeal from an acquittal as opposed to an
appeal from a conviction an appellate tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction if it
attempts to reassess the facts in order to determine whether the trial judge's
findings were reasonable.  However, even if Schuldt had the
effect of narrowing the scope of a question of law for purposes of an appeal
from an acquittal pursuant to s. 605(1)(a), as
was suggested by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Dixon (1988),
26 B.C.L.R. (2d) 251, it only did so for cases in which the issue before the
court is when, if ever, a finding of fact becomes a question of law.

 

    It
is my opinion, therefore, that this line of authority, while correctly stating
the law, does not support the appellants' argument that the Court of Appeal
exceeded its jurisdiction in this case.  Indeed, both the Crown and the Court
of Appeal acknowledge that it is not open to an appellate court to overturn an
acquittal on the ground that it was unreasonable.  There are, however, other
questions of law arising in a case which will confer jurisdiction on an
appellate tribunal.  Aside from clearly established questions of law such as
the admissibility of evidence, the interpretation of a statute, or whether
evidence is capable of being corroborative, this Court has recognized appellate
jurisdiction where the question of law originates from the trial judge's
conclusion that he or she is not convinced of the guilt of the accused beyond a
reasonable doubt because of an erroneous approach to, or treatment of, the
evidence adduced at trial.  The Wild case is an example
of this.  A question of law was raised in that case because the trial judge's
""reasonable"" doubt was based on pure conjecture.

 

    An
acquittal based on an erroneous conclusion of reasonable doubt constitutes a
question of law where the trial judge has erred as to the legal effect of
undisputed or found facts rather than the inferences to be drawn from such
facts.  Authority for this proposition is to be found in Belyea v.
The King, [1932] S.C.R. 279, the first appeal to come before
this Court following the introduction of s. 605  into the Code.  The
accused had been acquitted of conspiracy charges at trial.  Anglin C.J., for
the Court, holding that the error of the trial judge raised a question of law,
affirmed the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal which reversed the
acquittal on the basis that the trial judge misdirected himself in finding that
the Crown had not proved that the accused took part in the overt acts.  Anglin
C.J. noted that it was not essential to a finding of guilt of conspiracy to
establish that the accused actually participated in the overt acts.  He stated
at p. 296:

 

    The
right of appeal by the Attorney-General, conferred by s. [605(1)(a)], Cr. C. . . .
is, no doubt, confined to ""questions of law"".  That implies, if it
means anything at all, that there can be no attack by him in the Appellate
Divisional Court on the correctness of any of the findings of fact.  But we
cannot regard that provision as excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional
Court, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or
innocence of the accused, depends, as it does here, upon the legal effect of
certain findings of fact made by the judge or the jury, as the case may be, to
enquire into the soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot regard it as
anything else but a question of law, -- especially where, as here, it is a
clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial judge. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    Belyea was
distinguished by Lamer J. in Schuldt but its correctness was not questioned. 
For a comprehensive list of the case law in this area see Ewaschuk J., Criminal
Pleadings and Practice in Canada (2nd ed. 1987), at paras. 23:1010 and
23:1025.

 

    A
question of law may also arise, it seems to me, when the trial judge misdirects
himself or herself with respect to the relevant evidence.  Indeed, the Court of
Appeal in this case reversed the acquittals after concluding that an error of
law had arisen due to the trial judge's failure to properly direct himself to
all the evidence bearing on the relevant issues.  In its oral argument to this
Court the Crown conceded that, if the trial judge's error was not the result of
misdirection, then the Court of Appeal was without jurisdiction.

 

    In
support of its position the Crown relies on Harper v. The Queen, supra, as did
the Court of Appeal.  The accused in that case, a police officer, had been
charged with assault but contended that all the complainant's injuries were
sustained when he resisted arrest.  The complainant and one witness testified
that the accused had punched the victim in the face but the defence called four
witnesses who testified that they had not seen the accused hit the
complainant.  In his reasons for judgment the trial judge stated that only the
complainant and the other Crown witness had observed the events.  The evidence
of the defence witnesses was expressly not taken into account by the trial
judge because he concluded they were not present at the crucial time but no
finding was made as to their credibility.  The accused was convicted at trial
and his appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal was dismissed.

appeal to this Court the issue was whether the trial judge's failure to
consider the defence evidence constituted an error of law.  Estey J., for the
majority (Ritchie J. dissenting) concluded that rejecting the evidence of the
defence witnesses was an error of law and a new trial was ordered.  With
respect to the jurisdiction of an appellate court generally Estey J. stated the
following at p. 14:

 

    An appellate tribunal has neither the duty nor the
right to reassess evidence at trial for the purpose of determining guilt or
innocence.  The duty of the appellate tribunal does, however, include a
review of the record below in order to determine whether the trial court has
properly directed itself to all the evidence bearing on the relevant issues. 
Where the record, including the reasons for judgment, discloses a lack of
appreciation of relevant evidence and more particularly the complete disregard
of such evidence, then it falls upon the reviewing tribunal to intercede. 
This problem was before this Court in MacDonald v. The
Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 665, when Laskin C.J. stated, at p.
673:

 

    It
does not follow, however, that failure of a trial judge to give reasons, not
challengeable per se as an error of law, will be equally
unchallengeable if, having regard to the record, there is a rational basis for
concluding that the trial judge erred in appreciation of a relevant issue or in
appreciation of evidence that would affect the propriety of his verdict.  Where
some reasons are given and there is an omission to deal with a relevant issue
or to indicate an awareness of evidence that could affect the verdict, it may
be easier for an appellate Court or for this Court to conclude that reversible
error was committed.  [Emphasis added.]

 

In
dissent, Ritchie J. noted that an accused's appeal to this Court was limited to
a question of law in the strict sense and expressed the view that the appeal
did not raise a question of law alone because it concerned a difference of
opinion as to the sufficiency of the evidence.

 

    This
Court has not yet applied Harper to an appeal from an acquittal.  It
was, however, applied to an appeal from an acquittal by the Newfoundland Court
of Appeal in R. v. Roman (1987), 38 C.C.C.
(3d) 385.  The accused in that case were charged with illegal entry into
Canadian fisheries waters contrary to the Coastal Fisheries
Protection Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-21.  The trial judge acquitted the
accused on the basis that their equipment may not have been working properly. 
The Crown appealed the acquittals but the accused claimed that the appeal was
not maintainable because no question of law was raised.  In response the Court
of Appeal, per Marshall J.A., said at p. 391:

 

    There
is a distinction between reassessment by an appeal court of evidence for the
purpose of weighing its credibility to determine culpability on the one hand
and, on the other, reviewing the record to ascertain if there has been an
absence of appreciation of relevant evidence.  The former requires addressing
questions of fact and is placed outside the purview of an appellate tribunal by
s. 605(1)(a) of the Code.  The latter inquiry
is one of law because if the proceedings indicate a lack of appreciation of
relevant evidence, it becomes a reviewable question of law as to whether this
lack precluded the trial judge from effectively interpreting and applying the
law.

 

He cited Harper in
support.  He then reviewed the trial judge's treatment of the evidence which
included testimony to the effect that the ship was in good working condition on
the day in question.  From this evidence the trial judge inferred that it could
at times be in bad working condition and founded his reasonable doubt on that
basis.  The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge's inference in this
regard constituted a misapprehension of the evidence given by the witnesses,
which was evidence bearing on the central issue before him, and the conclusion
drawn therefrom was a reversible error of law within the meaning of Harper. 
Relying on Wild the Court also found that the trial
judge was in error in basing the acquittal upon an inference drawn from a
conjectural possibility.

 

    Assuming
that Marshall J.A. was correct in finding that the trial judge's
misapprehension of the relevant evidence amounted to an error of law within the
meaning of Harper, it is my opinion that such an error
will only amount to an error of law alone pursuant to s. 605(1)(a) of the Code if it
is the result of misdirection.  Thus while I do not think it is necessary to
restrict Harper to appeals from convictions per se, I
would add the essential caveat that the ""misapprehension"" or
""lack of appreciation"" of the relevant evidence must have been the
result of the trial judge's misdirection of himself or herself as to the
applicable law, which in my view, was the case in the present appeal.  Of
necessity it will be more difficult in an appeal from an acquittal to establish
with certainty that the error committed by the trial judge raised a question of
law alone because of the burden of proof on the Crown in all criminal
prosecutions and the increased importance of examining critically all evidence
that may raise a reasonable doubt.

 

    I
find support for my conclusion that the trial judge's errors of law in this
case were the result of misdirection in R. v. Morin, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 345.  In Morin this Court had occasion to consider
whether individual pieces of evidence should be examined in isolation and what
the appropriate approach to weighing the evidence should be in the context of a
Crown appeal from a jury acquittal on a charge of first degree murder.  The
Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and ordered a new trial on
the basis that the trial judge had misdirected the jury when he invited them to
apply the criminal burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to individual
pieces of evidence.  This Court unanimously upheld the decision of the Court of
Appeal with respect to this ground of appeal, finding that the individual
pieces of evidence should be examined in the context of all the evidence.

 

    Sopinka
J., writing for the majority (Lamer and Wilson JJ. concurring), first noted
that there was ample authority for the proposition that it is misdirection to
instruct the jury to apply the standard of reasonable doubt to individual
pieces of evidence.  The accused did not dispute this but argued that the
charge did not invite a piecemeal examination of the evidence.  However, on
this Court's view of the jury charge, the trial judge had indeed made a serious
error.  Sopinka J. concluded at p. 358:

 

    The effect
of the misdirections referred to above may very well have been that the jury
examined evidence that was crucial to the Crown's case in bits and pieces.  Standing
alone or pitted against the evidence of the accused without the support of
other evidence, much of this evidence might have been discarded as not
measuring up to the test.  When the jury came to consider the Crown's case
as a whole there may not have been very much left of it.  We cannot know for
certain, but this scenario is a very likely one and the charge therefore
constituted a serious misdirection. [Emphasis added.]

 

The
point of departure in the majority and minority decisions related to the
accused's submission that while a piece of evidence must be examined in
relation to the other evidence, it must nonetheless individually meet the test
of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, calling therefore for a two-stage process
of deliberation each attracting the application of the doctrine of reasonable
doubt.  My colleague, Lamer J., and I agreed with this submission.  The
majority rejected it.  The whole Court agreed, however, that the evidence must
be looked at as a whole.

 

    I
believe that Morin highlights the fact that the approach
taken by the trial judge to the evidence must be correct in law so as to ensure
that the final step in the process, the weighing of the evidence, is not
flawed.  In this case, even although the trial judge was sitting alone, he was
wearing two ""hats"" at different stages.  He was both the trier of law
and had to direct himself as to the proper approach to the evidence and then,
having done so, he became the trier of fact in weighing it.

 

    A
review of the trial judge's decision in this case makes it clear that he failed
to consider the evidence in its totality.  This was the result of misdirection
and brought the matter within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

 

    While
Chorneyko Prov. Ct. J. did outline the evidence of both key Crown witnesses, he
considered their evidence separately and failed to consider their evidence as a
whole.  He first considered the evidence of the complainant in isolation and
rejected it as unreliable.  He then moved on to the evidence of the accomplice,
stating that, having found the evidence of the complainant unreliable, all he
had left was the evidence of C.Z.  Further, he looked only for discrepancies as
to details in the evidence presented and did not consider the corroborative
aspects of the evidence and the numerous elements of the alleged offence which
were testified to by both witnesses capable of substantiating each other's
story.  The trial judge also did not consider the corroborative aspects of the
evidence relating to the complainant's broken glasses.  There was evidence of a
breakage at the time of the alleged assault and this evidence would have been
capable of corroborating the child's testimony so as to enhance its reliability
and should have been viewed together with the rest of the Crown's evidence.  I
do not believe that the trial judge considered the individual pieces of evidence
""in the context of all of the evidence"".  Rather, the evidence was
viewed ""without the support of other evidence"".  According to Morin this
amounts to serious misdirection.

 

    I
find the words of the High Court of Australia in Chamberlain v. The
Queen (1984), 58 A.L.J.R. 133, which was referred to in Morin, very
much on point.  Chief Justice Gibbs and Justice Mason stated at p. 139:

 

    We
have no doubt that the position is correctly stated in the following passage in R. v.
Beble [1979] Qd. R. 278 at 289, that ""It is not the law
that a jury should examine separately each item of evidence adduced by the
prosecution, apply the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt as to that
evidence and reject it if they are not so satisfied.""  At the end of
the trial the jury must consider all the evidence, and in doing so they may
find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts as to another.  For
example, the jury, considering the evidence of one witness by itself, may doubt
whether it is truthful, but other evidence may provide corroboration, and when
the jury considers the evidence as a whole they may decide that the witness
should be believed.  Again, the quality of evidence of identification may
be poor, but other evidence may support its correctness; in such a case the
jury should not be told to look at the evidence of each witness
""separately in, so to speak, a hermetically sealed compartment""; they
should consider the accumulation of the evidence . . . .  [Emphasis added.]

 

    A
final difficulty I have with the trial judge's reasons relates to the
statements he made regarding the time of the offence.  As was clearly
established in the related appeal of R. v. G.B., A.B. and
C.S., it is not necessary for the Crown to establish with
precision when the alleged offence occurred.  In view of the trial judge's
reasoning in R. v. G.B., A.B. and C.S., I believe one can
conclude with reasonable certainty that the trial judge's finding of a
reasonable doubt was heavily influenced by his error with respect to the legal
requirements regarding the time of the offence.

 

5.  Disposition

 

    For
all of these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.  In my view, the Crown has
established that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same absent
the trial judge's misdirection.  However, I am not confident that, absent the
error of law, the appellants would have been found guilty and accordingly I
agree with the Court of Appeal that a new trial is appropriate. 

 

//McLachlin
J.//

 

    The
reasons of Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

    McLachlin
J. -- I agree with my colleague, Wilson J., that the appeal should be dismissed
and a new trial ordered.

 

    I
base this conclusion on the third error of the trial judge to which Wilson J.
refers -- his view that the Crown was obliged to establish the precise time
when the offence occurred.

 

    In
my opinion, it is not clear that the trial judge misdirected himself with
respect to the relevant evidence in the manner referred to by Wilson J.    In
the absence of such misdirection the law is clear that doubts about the
reasonableness of the trial judge's assessment of the evidence do not
constitute questions of law alone, and hence cannot support an appeal from
acquittal.

 

    The
first misdirection Wilson J. suggests is that the trial judge directed himself
that the evidence of the complainant and C.Z. must be independently considered.  R. v.
Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, establishes that it is an error
of law for the trial judge to direct that the reasonable doubt standard must be
applied to individual pieces of evidence.  On re-reading the trial judge's
reasons I am far from certain that he committed this error.  He reviewed the
evidence of the complainant and C.Z. in separate paragraphs, expressing doubts
about the evidence of each.  After stating that there were just too many
unresolved questions and too many doubts as to what actually happened for him
to accept the Crown's version, and after discussing the question of time, he
concluded:

 

    Taking
these factors into account, I have a reasonable doubt that each of the accused
was involved in the act, and therefore have to find each of the accused not
guilty.

 

    It
is reasonable to conclude that the phrase ""these factors"" was
intended to include all the evidence, the findings of credibility of particular
witnesses referred to earlier, as well as the erroneous statement of law with
respect to the issue of proof of time of the offence (which I agree is an error
of law).  The trial judge never stated that any piece of evidence was to be
considered with respect to reasonable doubt in isolation from the rest of the
evidence, nor did he suggest that any piece of evidence should be completely
disregarded for failing to meet such a standard.  Nor did his statements
concerning the credibility of the witnesses' stories amount to an error in law,
in my view.   While the trial judge's statement may not be as clear as one
might wish, it is not clearly in error and does not establish  misdirection.

 

    The
second misdirection Wilson J. suggests is that the trial judge failed to
instruct himself that the evidence of C.Z. should be looked at to see if it was
capable of corroborating the evidence of the complainant.  This might be valid
if one were instructing a jury serving as the trier of fact.  But where a trial
judge is sitting as a trier of fact, it is open to him to reject the evidence
of a witness as lacking credibility and hence not being capable of constituting
corroboration.  In those circumstances it would be wrong for a trial judge to
instruct himself or herself that the evidence of the witness should be
considered to see if it was capable of corroborating the other evidence. 
Again, this leaves me unable to conclude that there was error of law or
misdirection.

 

    For
these reasons, I find myself unable to conclude that the trial judge's reasons
disclose misdirection within the test in Morin or
otherwise with respect to the first two errors referred to by Wilson J.

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal and order a new trial.

    Each
of the appellants, who are young offenders, was charged with sexually
assaulting the complainant, a fellow elementary school student who was seven
years old at the time of the alleged offence.  The complainant was sworn in by
the trial judge and testified that the assault took place sometime during the
wintertime when she was in grade one.  The complainant's mother testified that
her daughter experienced bed-wetting and nightmares during the late months of
1985 and the early months of 1986.  The trial judge concluded that if the event
did take place, its date had not been established.  He noted that if the
offence had taken place while the complainant was in grade one, it would have
had to occur a year earlier than alleged.  He found that the date is an
essential element of the offence and refused to amend the information as
requested by the Crown.  He concluded that since one of the main ingredients of
the offence had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellants
must be acquitted.  The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge erred in
failing to find that the date had been established with sufficient
particularity and in failing to amend the information in light of the evidence
presented at trial.  It set aside the acquittals and ordered a new trial.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    An
information or indictment must provide an accused with enough information to
enable him or her to defend the charge.  While time must be specified, the
exact time need not be identified or proved.  In this case the information
provided was adequate, having regard to the nature of the offence charged and
the age of the victim.  Under s. 529(4.1) of the Criminal Code , a
variance between the indictment and the evidence is not material with respect
to the time of commission of the offence.  The common law had developed a
similar rule:  if the time specified in the information conflicts with the
evidence and time is not an essential element of the offence or crucial to the
defence, the variance is not material and the information need not be quashed. 
Further, the Crown need not prove the alleged date unless time is an essential
element of the offence, as when an accused defends the charge by providing
evidence of an alibi for the date or time period alleged.  The first question
that must be asked is thus whether time is either an essential element of the
offence or crucial to the defence.  If it is not, a conviction may result even
though the time of the offence is not proven.  In the present case the trial
judge failed to address this question.  Had he done so, he would have been
forced to conclude that time was not an essential element of the offence or
crucial to the defence.  The Court of Appeal was therefore correct in holding
that the time of the offence did not need to be proven beyond a reasonable
doubt in the circumstances of this case.

    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

    Wilson
J. --  The appellants are young offenders who were acquitted of sexual assault
at trial.  The Crown's appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was allowed
and the appellants now appeal to this Court as of right.  This judgment is the
second in a trilogy concerning the alleged sexual assaults that occurred at
Sheho Elementary School in Saskatchewan between September 1985 and May 1986.  
This appeal was heard together with R. v. B. (G.), [1990]
2 S.C.R. 000, and R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000, which are dealt with in two related judgments.  In this case the
appellants raise three grounds of appeal, the main ground being the degree of
precision required by law for the date on which the offence is alleged to have
been committed.

 

1.  The
Facts

 

    Each
of the appellants was separately charged in informations alleging that:

 

    On
or between the 2nd day of December A.D. 1985 and the 20th day of December A.D.
1985 at Sheho in the Province of Saskatchewan being a young person within the
meaning of the Young Offenders Act did commit a sexual assault on E.G. contrary
to Section 246.1(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

    The
complainant, E.G., a student at Sheho Elementary School, was seven years old at
the time of the alleged offence and eight years old at the time of the trial. 
She was sworn in by the trial judge.  Her evidence was to the effect that
sometime during the noon break during the wintertime when she was in grade one
she had been dragged into the boys' washroom by the three appellants and pushed
into a cubicle.  She was told to pull down her pants and was touched in the
area of her ""bum"" and her ""pee-pee"" by the appellants.  On
cross-examination she affirmed that the incident occurred when she was in grade
one and she implicated other youths as parties to the alleged offence in
addition to the appellants.

 

    At
trial the appellants pointed out that the complainant was in grade one in the
fall of 1984 and that the information alleged that the offence took place in
December of 1985.  The Crown submitted, however, that there was other relevant
evidence as to the date of the offence and that the complainant's testimony
that the incident occurred in grade one must be viewed in light of all the
evidence.  The evidence included:

 

1.The floorplan of the school showed that grades 1 and 2
were in the same room.

 

2.The complainant identified the washroom close to her
classroom when she was in grade 2 as the room in which the assault took place.

 

3.The complainant also testified that she did not know
the year in which the assault took place but that her mother was working at the
bakery in Foam Lake at the time.

 

4.The
complainant's mother testified that her daughter experienced various problems
such as bed-wetting and nightmares during the late months of 1985 and the early
months of 1986.  She further testified that this stopped abruptly once the
complainant spoke with the investigating officer.  The mother had been working
at Foam Lake at the end of November, 1985, but as a cook, not in a bakery.  She
testified she had worked at a bakery at Foam Lake when E.G. was in
kindergarten.

 

    Dr.
Richard Wollert, a clinical psychologist specializing in the treatment of young
victims and perpetrators of sexual offences, testified for the Crown.  He said
that there were several behavioural characteristics which are experienced by
young victims of sexual offences.  These include bed‑wetting, nightmares,
and anxiety.  He also testified that these problems may be caused by other
occurrences in the child's life.  He stated that he had not interviewed the
complainant but had spoken only briefly to her while waiting to testify.

 

    All
three appellants testified and denied any involvement in the alleged offence.

 

2.  Issues

 

    The
appellants raise the following issues on appeal:

 

1.The learned Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan erred in
law in holding that the trial judge erred in failing to find the date of the
offence with respect to the complainant, E.G., had been established with
sufficient particularity and in failing to amend the Information as requested
by the Crown.  The Court of Appeal further erred in holding that the Crown did not
have to establish the particular time that the offences occurred, with respect
to the complainant E.G.

 

2.The learned Court of Appeal erred in holding that the
trial judge erred in applying an adult standard in assessing the credibility of
the child witnesses.

 

3.The
learned Court of Appeal erred in law in finding that the trial judge gave
little credence to expert testimony because he based the purpose of expert
testimony on an erroneous assumption.

 

    The Criminal
Code provision relevant to the first issue is s. 529(4.1),
S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 123(3) (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
s. 601(4.1) ).  It reads:

 

    529. . . . 

 

(4.1) A variance between the indictment or a count
therein and the evidence taken is not material with respect to

 

(a)  the time when the offence is alleged to have been
committed, if it is proved that the indictment was preferred within the
prescribed period of limitation, if any; or

 

(b)  the
place where the subject-matter of the proceedings is alleged to have arisen, if
it is proved that it arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. 

 

3.  The
Courts Below

 

Saskatchewan
Provincial Court (Chorneyko Prov. Ct. J., unreported)

 

    The
trial judge first acknowledged that he was governed by the admonition of this Court
in Kendall v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 469, in which Judson
J. stated at p. 473:

 

    The
basis for the rule of practice which requires the judges to warn the jury of
the danger of convicting on the evidence of a child, even when sworn as a
witness, is the mental immaturity of the child.  The difficulty is fourfold: 
1.  His capacity of observation.  2.  His capacity of recollection.  3.  His
capacity to understand questions put and frame intelligent answers.  4.  His
moral responsibility.

 

    Chorneyko
Prov. Ct. J. was clearly not impressed with the evidence of the alleged event
having taken place at all and stated that after hearing the evidence he was
forced to conclude that if the event did take place, its date had not been
established.  He noted that the complainant had stated that the incident
occurred sometime in the winter when she was in grade one.  That evidence, if
true, indicated that the offence would have had to have happened a year earlier
than alleged.

 

    The
Crown sought at trial to amend the information so as to read between November
1, 1985 and December 20, 1985.  However, relying on R. v.
Hamilton-Middleton (1986), 53 Sask. R. 80, as authority for the
proposition that the date of the offence is an essential element of the offence
and must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial judge said that it
would be difficult to fashion an appropriate amendment when it was not known
when the alleged offence had occurred.

 

    In
the opinion of the trial judge the Crown by asking for the amendment was
suggesting that the date of the offence could be established through the
evidence of the mother and Dr. Wollert.  The expert witness had testified as to
the way in which someone might be expected to react after suffering an
emotional trauma but the trial judge doubted that such evidence could be used
to establish that a child displaying those symptoms must have been assaulted
and therefore was telling the truth.  Even if it could, however, he was of the
view that since the doctor had testified that bed‑wetting and nightmares
could be caused by events other than sexual abuse, the doctor's statement, in
conjunction with the mother's testimony as to when the bed-wetting occurred,
could have little weight in determining the date of the offence.  Neither, he
found, could it constitute corroboration.  The trial judge was also of the view
that this evidence could not be used to establish the date of the offence
because between December 2 and 20 of 1985, when the alleged assault took place,
the complainant was in the hospital for a period of thirteen days for an
unrelated event.  This meant that there was a significant period during which
the offence could not possibly have occurred.

 

    The
trial judge held, therefore, that the evidence of the mother and doctor could
not accurately establish the date of the offence and that using that type of
analysis for this purpose was fraught with danger and should be discouraged. 
He concluded that since one of the main ingredients of the offence had not been
established beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellants must be acquitted.  In
light of his conclusion, the trial judge did not find it necessary to weigh the
other evidence in order to determine whether he would have been left with a
reasonable doubt as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.

 

Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal ((1988), 65 Sask. R. 134)

 

    The
Court of Appeal (Vancise, Wakeling and Gerwing JJ.A.) noted that the only
matter dealt with by the trial judge was whether the offence occurred on the
date or dates charged  It noted also that he had interpreted
Hamilton-Middleton, supra, as holding that the Crown was
required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the date of the offence as an
essential ingredient of the offence.  Vancise J.A., writing for the court, said
that, although it was not entirely clear from the reported case, Hamilton-Middleton did not
stand for that proposition and that the trial judge accordingly committed an
error of law in so finding.

 

    According
to Vancise J.A., in Hamilton-Middleton (Wakeling J.A.
delivered the judgment with Vancise J.A. concurring) the guilt of the accused
turned directly on the date of the offence.  It was therefore a critical
element in that case.  That was not so here.  Turning to the evidence in this
case, Vancise J.A. stated at p. 143:

 

The
information alleged that the offence had occurred between the 2nd of December
and the 20th of December 1985.  During the course of the trial, it appeared
that the assault occurred in November of 1985, when the child was in Grade II. 
She testified that the assault occurred ""in winter"", at the beginning
of November, while her mother was working at a camp and before her mother
worked at a bakery in Foam Lake.  Her mother testified that she worked at a
bakery in Foam Lake in December 1985, after she finished working as a cook in a
construction camp.  That evidence and the evidence of the child's teacher would
place the timing between the 1st of November and the 20th of December 1985. 
Section 529(4.1) of the Code now makes it clear that the date is not, in
the circumstances described here, a critical or essential element. 

 

Vancise
J.A. concluded that the trial judge had erred in failing to find that the date
had been established with sufficient particularity.  He had also erred in
failing to amend the information as requested by the Crown and in failing to consider
the evidence as a whole in order to determine whether the Crown had proved its
case beyond a reasonable doubt.  Because the trial judge did not make any
findings of fact on any other issues Vancise J.A. concluded that it had no
alternative but to direct a new trial.

 

    Wakeling
J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring) said he was in full agreement with the judgment
of Vancise J.A., but wanted to add a few comments on the possibility of expert
testimony providing a basis for corroboration.  He thought it was important to
register his disagreement with the way in which the trial judge dealt with the
expert testimony.  Wakeling J.A. thought it apparent that the evidence of Dr.
Wollert, the expert on child sexual abuse, had been given little credence by
the trial judge.  In his view, the trial judge's approach ran counter to the
current view that the courts need and should be encouraged to seek assistance
in the performance of their responsibilities when dealing with the evidence of
children in sexual abuse cases.  He stated at p. 148:

 

    I do
not need to resort to statistics to establish that there are many more cases
now coming to trial involving sexual abuse of children and requiring a very
difficult evaluation of youthful testimony.  Under these circumstances, it is
understandable that the courts should seek as much assistance as possible from
those who can be qualified as experts.  They can shed some additional light on
evidence that would otherwise be of negligible value, so as to assist the judge
in reaching a determination of what facts have been adequately corroborated or
otherwise established.

 

Dealing
more specifically with the facts at hand he added at p. 149:

 

    I
think it can now be taken that evidence of an expert, in the nature of that
given by Dr. Wollert as to the psychological and physical conditions which
frequently arise as a result of sexual abuse of a child, is admissible.  It
provides assistance to the trial judge in concluding whether an assault has
occurred.  This kind of testimony is helpful, because it provides a benchmark
which can hardly be doubted, as it is entirely unlikely that such things as
bedwetting and nightmares are subject to be concocted or contrived by a
youthful witness to support or buttress the reliability of any testimony that
witness may later be called upon to give in court.  It is always open to the
trial judge to accept or reject expert testimony, but I am concerned that the
trial judge's basis for giving little credence to Dr. Wollert's testimony was
based on an erroneous assumption of its purpose.

 

Wakeling
J.A. was careful to point out, however, that the expert evidence should not be
used to bolster the credibility of witnesses or indicate that they should be
believed since credibility is a matter exclusively reserved for the trier of
fact.

 

    Wakeling
J.A. also added some general comments regarding the testimony of youthful
witnesses.  He was of the opinion that the trial judge erred in utilizing and
applying a strictly adult standard when assessing the credibility of the young
people who appeared before him.  He stated at p. 150:

 

Although
the cross-examination was conducted quite reasonably in these trials (but
sometimes by as many as three counsel), I find it unremarkable that the
youthful witness would eventually find shelter in silence or simple agreement
with counsel's suggestions.  Nor do I find it difficult to understand that the
trauma resulting from the incidents of assault would prevent a witness from
having an accurate and detailed recall of the event, even if it were being
recalled on the day it occurred.  In the same way that adult standards would
not be suitable to gauge the conduct of youths in physical, mental, social, or
other aspects of human activity, it is equally unacceptable that such a
standard be applied without modification when measuring the credibility of
their testimony.

 

4.  Analysis

 

(a)  Time of
the offence

 

    The
appellants take issue with the Court of Appeal's conclusion that the trial
judge erred in finding that the time of the offence was an essential element of
the offence and in refusing to amend the information in light of the evidence
presented at trial.  In support of this ground the appellants advance three
main propositions:

 

1.An information must specify the time, place and matter
of an offence in order to afford an accused a full defence and fair trial;

 

2.If the time specified on the information conflicts
with that of the evidence the information must be quashed; and 

 

3.Time
is an essential element of any offence, but particularly so when the accused
leads alibi evidence.  Therefore, the time of the offence must be proven beyond
a reasonable doubt in order for a conviction to result and if the evidence is
conflicting with respect to time and the date of the offence cannot be
determined the information must be quashed.

 

While
these three propositions are not entirely separable and each bears on the
balance that must be maintained between eschewing unnecessary technicalities
and the right of an accused to make full answer and defence, it is, in my view,
most convenient to deal with each proposition individually.

 

    Turning
then to the appellants' first proposition, I note at the outset that there was
no formal attack on the information in this case and no motion to quash for
insufficiency.  Under s. 529(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34 (now s. 601(1)), a motion to quash based on a defect on the face
of the count must be brought before plea and thereafter only by leave of the
court.  Thus, it would not be open for the appellants to claim now that the
trial judge should have quashed the information prior to trial.  However, the
case law on the issue of particularity is instructive in demonstrating the
degree of particularity required in relation to the date of the offence.

 

    The
general proposition is that an information or indictment must provide an
accused with enough information to enable him or her to defend the charge. 
This Court's decision in Brodie v. The King, [1936] S.C.R.
188, continues to be relied on by accused persons arguing that the charge laid
against them does not satisfy the requirements of the Criminal
Code  and therefore should be struck.  Brodie has
thus become the standard against which sufficiency is measured; the indictment
must describe the offence so as to ""lift it from the general to the
particular"" (p. 198).  The appellants in Brodie were
convicted of being parties to a seditious conspiracy but this Court held that
the indictment should be quashed and acquittals entered because essential
averments had been omitted.  Rinfret J., writing for the Court, discussed the
requirements of s. 852  at p. 193 as follows:

 

    If
section 852 be analysed, it will be noticed the imperative requirement
(""shall contain"") is that there must be a statement that the accused
has committed an indictable offence; and such offence must be
""specified.""  It will be sufficient if the substance of the offence
is stated; but every count must contain such statement"" in substance."" 
In our view, this does not mean merely classifying or characterizing the
offence; it calls for the necessity of specifying time, place and matter
. . . of stating the facts alleged to constitute the indictable offence. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

Rinfret
J. went on to outline one of the main reasons why this degree of particularity
is necessary (p. 194):

 

[T]he
statement must contain the allegations of matter ""essential to be
proved,"" and must be in ""words sufficient to give the accused notice
of the offence with which he is charged.""  Those are the very words of the
section; and they were put there to embody the spirit of the legislation, one
of its main objects being that the accused may have a fair trial and
consequently that the indictment shall, in itself, identify with reasonable
precision the act or acts with which he is charged, in order that he may be
advised of the particular offence alleged against him and prepare his defence
accordingly.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
appellants rely on the statement in Brodie that the time,
place, and matter of the offence must be specified in support of their argument
that the time of the offence is an essential ingredient and must be clearly
identified and proven.  However, since Brodie, there
has been an increased tendency for the courts, including this Court, to reject
insufficiency arguments on the basis that they are overly technical and an
unnecessary holdover from earlier times.  Thus the earlier authorities called
for a greater degree of specificity than seems to be required today but there
are also more extensive corrective measures available to the Crown in the
present Criminal Code .

 

    For
example, in R. v. Côté, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 8, the accused was
charged with failing to comply with a demand for a breath sample.  The
information omitted the words ""without reasonable excuse"".  The Court
of Appeal quashed the conviction, having concluded that an essential averment
of the offence was omitted.  This Court restored the conviction and de Grandpré
J., for the majority, commented that the Court should not revert to the old
very technical approach.  He stated at p. 13:

 

[T]he
golden rule is for the accused to be reasonably informed of the transaction
alleged against him, thus giving him the possibility of a full defence and a
fair trial.  When, as in the present case, the information recites all the
facts and relates them to a definite offence identified by the relevant section
of the Code, it is impossible for the accused to be misled.  To
hold otherwise would be to revert to the extreme technicality of the old
procedure. 

 

    One
cannot, however, overlook the concerns that gave rise to the strict approach
and the importance of providing an accused with sufficient information.  And
the courts will not hesitate in appropriate circumstances to quash an
information that is insufficient and cannot be cured by the provision of
particulars.  In R. v. Wis Development Corp., [1984] 1 S.C.R.
485, this Court was asked to rule on the sufficiency of an information
containing some thirty-two counts alleging breaches of the
Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. A-3.  Lamer J., writing for the Court,
held that the counts failed to provide adequate information of the
circumstances of the alleged offences, especially the time, place and manner of
their commission.  He emphasized again that an accused must be treated fairly
and be able to identify clearly what is alleged against him so that he can
prepare an adequate defence.

 

    What
the above cases do not address, however, is with what degree of particularity
the time of the offence must be spelled out in order to constitute adequate
information.  The usual practice in alleging the time of the offence is to
state the day on which, or a particular time period during which, the offence
was committed.  The Crown contends, however, that while time must be specified,
the exact time need not be identified or proved.  The precedential
authority from various provincial appellate courts supports the Crown's
position.

 

    In R. v.
Colgan (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 183, the accused was charged
with unlawfully stealing money ""[b]etween the first day of January, A.D.,
1979 and the 31st day of March, A.D., 1985"".  Prior to plea, counsel for
the accused objected to the insufficiency of the information and the trial
judge quashed the information on the basis that it did not give the accused
enough detail to enable her to identify the transactions alleged to have
occurred between the dates specified.  Monnin C.J.M., for the majority of the
Manitoba Court of Appeal, noted that the main difficulty confronting the trial
judge was that the time period was more than six years.  He reviewed this
Court's decisions in Brodie, Côté, and Wis
Development, and concluded that the wording of the count did lift
the offence from the general to the particular and that no essential element of
the offence was missing.  In doing so he noted that the accused had been told
the time period, the place, the victim and the offence in terms that were
sufficient to describe the nature of the offence although not the specific
details of it.  In addressing the lengthy time period Monnin C.J.M. said at p.
189:

 

There
are and have been many similar charges in this jurisdiction.  The only
difference in this one is that the period of the alleged theft extends over 63
months and as a result it may be difficult for the defence to prepare its
case.  That is not sufficient ground to invalidate an otherwise proper and
complete count.  Fairness or difficulty to prepare a defence are matters to be
presented to the trier of facts when the evidence is tendered.

 

    Chief
Justice Monnin's decision was upheld in this Court:  see [1987] 2 S.C.R. 686.

 

    In Re Regina
and R.I.C. (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 399, the majority of the Ontario
Court of Appeal upheld the validity of an information charging the accused with
sexually assaulting a nine‑year‑old child over a period of six
months.  The trial judge of his own motion had quashed the information on the
ground that it failed to specify the acts constituting the alleged offence of
sexual assault and also because of the period of time over which the offence
was alleged to have been committed.  The Court of Appeal, Krever J.A., with
Brooke J.A. concurring, pointed out that due to the nature of the charge and
the age of the victim, complete particularity with respect to time would likely
be impossible.  Krever J.A. stated at p. 403 that ""to require it would
make prevention of a serious social problem exceedingly difficult"".  He
concluded that the sufficiency requirements in the Criminal Code  were
met.  See also R. v. Ryan (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.),
leave to appeal to this Court refused, [1986] 1 S.C.R. xiii; and R. v. Fox (1986),
24 C.C.C. (3d) 366 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to this Court refused, [1986] 1
S.C.R. ix, which both dealt with the offences of impaired driving and held that
the exact time need not be specified in the information.

 

    It
is apparent from these cases that what constitutes reasonable or adequate
information with respect to the act or omission to be proven against the
accused will of necessity vary from case to case.  The factual matters which
underlie some offences permit greater descriptive precision than in the case of
other offences.  Accordingly, a significant factor in any assessment of the
reasonableness of the information furnished is the nature and legal character
of the offence charged.  It is also apparent, however, that in general an
information or indictment will not be quashed just because the exact time of
the offence is not specified.  Rather, the matter will continue on to trial on
the merits.  While it is obviously important to provide an accused with sufficient
information to enable him or her to identify the transaction and prepare a
defence, particularity as to the exact time of the alleged offence is not in
the usual course necessary for this purpose.  It goes without saying, of
course, that there may be cases where it is.

 

    In
this case the only particular at issue is time, the place, victim and offence
alleged to have been committed all being clearly identified in the
information.  The appellants submit, however, that time is an essential element
of any offence and must be specified and proven.  Given the tenor of the
decisions referred to, the appellants cannot succeed on this ground.  Having
regard to the nature of the offence charged and the age of the victim, the
information provided was, in my view, adequate.

 

    I
turn now to the appellants' second submission, namely, that if the time
specified in the information conflicts with the evidence the information must
be quashed.  I believe that s. 529(4.1)  of the Criminal Code  is a
complete answer to this submission.  It provides that a variance between the
indictment and the evidence is not material with respect to the time of
commission of the offence.  This provision was enacted in 1985 and replaced the
former s. 732(4)  which was in identical language but applied only to summary
conviction proceedings.  Prior to the enactment of s. 529(4.1) , however, the
common law had developed a similar rule and there is an abundance of case law
on the subject which has been fairly consistent throughout this century.  I refer
to a few of the earlier cases because they have a bearing on the appellant's
third submission as well as on this one.  They support the view that the date
of the offence need not be proven unless it is an essential element of the
offence.  

 

    In Veronneau
v. The King (1916), 26 C.C.C. 278 (Que. K.B.) (affirmed by this
Court (1916), 54 S.C.R. 7), one of the issues before the court was whether the
trial judge should have allowed an amendment to the indictment after it became
apparent that there was a variance between the charge as laid and the evidence
regarding the date of the alleged offence.  Cross J., for the court, noted that
as a general rule the date assigned to the commission of an offence need not be
the one actually proved, citing at p. 286 the following passage from Archbold's
Pleading, Evidence, & Practice in Criminal Cases (23rd
ed. 1905) at p. 297:

 

    The
day and year on which the facts are stated in the indictment or other pleading
to have occurred are not in general material; and the facts may be proved to
have occurred upon other day previous to the preferring of the indictment.

 

The
court held that it was only necessary to amend the indictment if the case fell
within the common law exception to the general rule because time was ""of
the essence"" of the offence.

 

    Similarly,
in R. v. Dossi (1918), 13 Cr. App. R. 158, the indictment charged the
accused with indecently assaulting an eleven‑year-old girl on March 19,
1918.  The child gave sworn testimony at trial and the trial judge invoked the rule
of practice that it would be dangerous to convict absent corroboration.  The
accused provided alibi evidence for March 19, 1918 but could not do so for any
other day in March.  The child gave no evidence of a specific date but referred
to constant acts of indecency over a considerable period of time ending at some
date in March, 1918.  The jury found the accused not guilty of the offence on
the date alleged.  The Crown then amended the indictment to read ""on some
day in March"" whereupon the jury found the accused guilty.  The conviction
was upheld on appeal, Atkin J. stating at p. 159 that ""[f]rom time
immemorial a date specified in an indictment has never been a material matter
unless it is actually an essential part of the alleged offence"".  He
continued at p. 160:

 

Thus,
though the date of the offence should be alleged in the indictment, it has
never been necessary that it should be laid according to truth unless time is
of the essence of the offence.  It follows, therefore, that the jury were
entitled, if there was evidence on which they could come to that conclusion, to
find the appellant guilty of the offence charged against him, even though they
found that it had not been committed on the actual date specified in the
indictment.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    It
is noteworthy that in this case not only did the date on the indictment differ
from the date arising from the evidence, but the exact date of the offence was
not proven.  The important thing was that the jury accepted that the accused
had committed the offence against the child although not the precise date on
which he had committed it.  To the same effect see R. v. James (1923),
17 Cr. App. R. 116 for further English authority and R. v. England (1920),
35 C.C.C. 141, where the New Brunswick Supreme Court, Appeal Division, adopted Dossi as a
correct statement of the law.  For contrary authority see R. v. Ball (1953),
17 C.R. 244 (Ont. C.A.), a case cited by the appellants in support of their
argument, as well as R. v. Hindle (1955), 113 C.C.C.
388, a decision of the same court.

 

    In R. v. Ball the
accused was convicted on a charge that ""on or about November 19,
1952"" he retained cattle in his possession knowing them to have been
stolen.  The evidence suggested, however, that the accused did not discover
that the cattle were stolen until February of 1953.  The accused was convicted
at trial but the Ontario Court of Appeal quashed the conviction.  Pickup
C.J.O., for the court, stated at p. 246:

 

    There
was no amendment to the indictment made at the trial; none was asked for. 
Whatever leeway the words ""on or about"" may give, we are of the
opinion that they do not give sufficient leeway to enable the Crown to maintain
a conviction on proof of knowledge inferred from events that occurred as late
as February when the charge in the indictment was that the offence was
committed on or about the 19th November.

 

    Subsequently,
however, in R. v. Greene (1962), 133 C.C.C.
294, the Ontario Court of Appeal overruled both Ball and Hindle.  In Greene, the
accused was appealing his conviction for assault.  The indictment charged him
with assault on December 16, 1961, but the evidence disclosed that the assault
took place on December 17, 1961.  The Magistrate was of the view that it was
unnecessary to amend the information to conform with the evidence and
registered a conviction.  On appeal the accused argued that the conviction
should be quashed on the ground that there was no evidence that the assault
took place on the 16th as alleged in the information.  McKay J.A., for the
court, reviewed the case law, noting that Ball and Hindle were
both oral judgments and that the decisions in the English Court of Criminal
Appeal and in New Brunswick and Manitoba courts were not brought to the
attention of the court.  McKay J.A. held that to the extent that Ball and Hindle were at
variance with what Atkin J. had stated in Dossi, they
should not be followed.  He concluded at pp. 300-301:

 

    In
the present case the appellant does not allege that he was misled or prejudiced
in his defence by the wrong date in the information, and while I think it might
well have been the better course to amend the information when the evidence
disclosed the error in the date, the failure to amend does not invalidate the
conviction.

 

    This
rule continued to be applied in later cases.  For example, in R. v.
Nadin (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 221, the British Columbia Court
of Appeal cited Dossi and Greene with
approval, stating that if the date is not an essential part of the alleged
offence, it is not a material matter.  For additional authorities to the same
effect see R. v. Pawliw (1973), 13 C.C.C.
(2d) 356 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. Clark (1974), 19 C.C.C.
(2d) 445 (Alta. S.C., App. Div.); W. Eric Whebby Ltd. v. Gunn Prov.
Magistrate (1974), 26 C.R.N.S. 379 (N.S.C.A.); R. v.
Labine (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 567 (Ont. C.A.); R. v.
McCrae and Ramsay (1981), 25 Man. R. (2d) 32 (Co. Ct.); and R. v.
Sarson (1982), 15 Man. R. (2d) 192 (Co. Ct.)

 

    This
longstanding rule of the common law is summarized by Ewaschuk J. in his text Criminal
Pleadings and Practice in Canada (2nd ed. 1987) at para. 9:10050 as
follows:

 

    From
time immemorial, a date specified in an indictment has never been held to be a
material matter.  Thus the Crown need not prove the alleged date unless time
is an essential element of the offence or unless there is a specified
prescription period.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    From
the foregoing, it is clear that it is of no consequence if the date specified
in the information differs from that arising from the evidence unless the time
of the offence is critical and the accused may be misled by the variance and
therefore prejudiced in his or her defence.  It is also clear from Dossi and
other authorities that the date of the offence need not be proven in order for
a conviction to result unless time is an essential element of the offence. 
Accordingly, while it is trite to say that the Crown must prove every element
of the offence in order to obtain a conviction, it is, I believe, more accurate
to say that the Crown must prove all the essential elements.  The Crown need
not prove elements which are, at most, incidental to the offence.  What the
Crown must prove will, however, of necessity vary with the nature of the
offence charged and the surrounding circumstances.  Time may be an essential
element of the offence in some circumstances and it may be instructive
therefore to look at a few cases where this was held to be so in order to
respond to the appellant's third submission.

 

    In
Hamilton-Middleton, supra, the accused was charged with theft
and there was no dispute that she had taken the food and clothing in question. 
She defended on the basis that she had received permission.  The evidence was
to the effect that at one time the accused did have such permission but that it
had been subsequently withdrawn.  There was nothing in the evidence to
establish whether the goods were taken before the permission was withdrawn or
after the permission was withdrawn.  It was held that time was an essential
element of the defence and must be strictly proved.

 

    In R. v.
McCrae and Ramsay, supra, the accused were acquitted at trial
of operating a plane without the proper authorization contrary to the
Aeronautics Act .  The trial judge was not sure that the offence had
occurred between the dates contained in the information.  The Crown appealed
the acquittals alleging that the trial judge erred in concluding that the dates
within which the offence was alleged to have occurred constituted an essential
averment.  Kennedy Co. Ct. J. dismissed the Crown's appeal on the basis that
the time of the offence was an essential element of the offence since the case
turned upon the holding of a valid certificate during a particular period of
time.  He acknowledged that time was generally not an essential element
requiring strict proof but held that it could become so depending on the
circumstances.  He stated at p. 33:

 

    If
charged with an offence of indecent assault or forging and uttering (as were
the factual situations referred to in the cases of R. v. England, 35
C.C.C. 141, and in the case of R. v. Parkin, 27 C.C.C. 35
respectively), it was held, it was only necessary to find that an offence had
occurred.  An offence under the Aeronautics Act  which
involves flying an aircraft, is not in itself an offence if it is done in a
period of time in which the pilot or owner had the necessary authorization,
just as driving a car is not unlawful unless done during a period where the
driver was not licenced. 

 

    Another
circumstance which has been held on the authorities to make the time of the
alleged offence critical is when an accused defends the charge by providing
evidence of an alibi for the date or time period alleged.  To hold otherwise
would be to deny an accused the right to make full answer and defence.  For
example, in the early case of R. v. Parkin (1), (2) (1922),
37 C.C.C. 35 (Man. C.A.), the accused was charged with indecent assault and
carnal knowledge.  The offences were alleged to have occurred ""on or about
August 8, 1920"".  The accused relied upon an alibi in his defence and
provided evidence that he was out of the province between August 7 and 22.  The
trial judge instructed the jury that it was not confined to the 8th of August
as the key date and that, if it found that the offence was committed during the
school holidays, the accused could be convicted.  He further instructed the
jury that the issue before it was whether a crime had been committed around
that time and the mere fact that the accused was not in the province on some of
the August dates did not matter if the jury was satisfied that the offence had
been committed on or about these dates.  The accused was found guilty of
indecent assault and appealed his conviction.  A majority of the Manitoba Court
of Appeal cited Dossi with approval but went on to conclude
that on the facts of this case the trial judge had erred in instructing the
jury that the August 8 date was immaterial and that they could convict if they
were satisfied that the offence had been committed during the holidays. 
Dennistoun J.A. noted that the accused relied upon the date specified in the
indictment in putting forward his defence of alibi.  He expressed the view that
the significance of the August 8 date in the context of the alibi defence
was not highlighted to the jury as it should have been.  On the contrary, they
were told to ignore it.  The accused therefore succeeded on this ground of
appeal and a new trial was ordered.  For more recent Canadian authority see W. Eric
Whebby Ltd. v. Gunn Prov. Magistrate, supra.

 

    More
modern English authority is found in Wright v. Nicholson, [1970]
1 All E.R. 12 (Q.B.), in which the accused was charged with having incited a
child on August 17, 1967 to commit a gross indecency.  The complainant was
unable to recall the date of the offence at trial and testified only that it
had occurred ""in August"".  The information was not amended and the
accused provided evidence which, if believed, would have afforded him a
complete alibi for August 17.  The accused was convicted at trial the court
finding that the offence had occurred some time in August even if it could not
be proven that it had occurred on August 17.  On appeal, Lord Parker C.J. for
the court allowed the accused's appeal and quashed the conviction.  He held
that the date of the offence was important because the evidence suggested that
the accused could have established alibi evidence for the whole month of August
by reference to work records if the information had been amended.  Because of
this, Dossi was distinguishable.

 

    In
my view, the following conclusions can be drawn from the authorities:

 

1.While time must be specified in an information in
order to provide an accused with reasonable information about the charges
brought against him and ensure the possibility of a full defence and a fair
trial, exact time need not be specified.  The individual circumstances of the
particular case may, however, be such that greater precision as to time is
required, for instance, if there is a paucity of other factual information
available with which to identify the transaction.

 

2.If the time specified in the information is
inconsistent with the evidence and time is not an essential element of the
offence or crucial to the defence, the variance is not material and the
information need not be quashed.

 

3.If there is conflicting evidence regarding the time of
the offence, or the date of the offence cannot be established with precision,
the information need not be quashed and a conviction may result, provided that
time is not an essential element of the offence or crucial to the defence.

 

4.If the
time of the offence cannot be determined and time is an essential element of
the offence or crucial to the defence, a conviction cannot be sustained.

 

    Accordingly,
when a court is faced with circumstances in which the time of the offence
cannot be determined with precision or the information conflicts with the
evidence, the first question that must be asked is whether time is either an
essential element of the offence or crucial to the defence.  It will only be in
cases where this first question is answered affirmatively that the trier of
fact must then determine whether the time of the offence has been proven beyond
a reasonable doubt.  If the answer to the first question is in the negative, a
conviction may result even although the time of the offence is not proven, provided
that the rest of the Crown's case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

    In
the present case, however, the trial judge failed to address the first
question.  He found on the evidence before him that the date of the offence had
not been established beyond a reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused.  In
doing so he erred.  (I add in fairness to the learned trial judge that he was
understandably misled by the sparse report of Hamilton-Middleton upon
which he relied in reaching his decision.)  Had the trial judge directed
himself to the first question, he would have been forced to conclude that time
was not an essential element of the offence or crucial to the defence.  Indeed,
the date of the offence is not generally an essential element of the offence of
sexual assault.  It is a crime no matter when it is committed.  From the record
in this case it is also clear that the date of the offence was not crucial to
the defence.  The appellants' claim on appeal that the date was crucial because
alibi evidence was led cannot, in my view, be seriously maintained.  At trial
each appellant testified and put forward only general denials.  They did not
lead alibi evidence at that time.  Moreover, since the alleged assault took
place in the school washroom during recess, the only possible alibi would seem
to be that one or more of the appellants was not in attendance at school during
the relevant period specified in the information or suggested by the evidence. 
There is nothing in the record to support this.

 

    I
conclude therefore that the Court of Appeal was correct in holding that the
time of the offence was not an essential element in the circumstances of this
case and need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  I also agree with the
Court of Appeal that if the assault took place as alleged the evidence supports
the conclusion that it occurred some time between November 1, 1985 and December
20, 1985 and that amending the information to this effect would not cause
irreparable harm to the appellants.  Since the trial judge made no findings of
fact apart from the time element the Court of Appeal was correct in concluding
that a new trial was necessary.

 

(b)  Standard
of Credibility

 

    The
remaining two grounds of appeal are directed at the concurring reasons of Wakeling
J.A. in which he discusses the use of expert testimony in cases of sexual
assault involving children and the approach that should be taken when assessing
the credibility of child witnesses.  Given that his comments in this regard are obiter
dicta, Wakeling J.A. having firmly stated they were not to be
viewed as affecting the main judgment with which he concurred, it is not
strictly necessary for this Court to deal with them.  However, in light of the
importance of the testimony of the complainant in this case as well as the
testimony of the children in the related appeals, I think this Court should
address them, albeit briefly.

 

    Dealing
first with Wakeling J.A.'s comments regarding the credibility of child
witnesses it seems to me that he was simply suggesting that the judiciary
should take a common sense approach when dealing with the testimony of young
children and not impose the same exacting standard on them as it does on
adults.  However, this is not to say that the courts should not carefully
assess the credibility of child witnesses and I do not read his reasons as
suggesting that the standard of proof must be lowered when dealing with
children as the appellants submit.  Rather, he was expressing concern that a
flaw, such as a contradiction, in a child's testimony should not be given the
same effect as a similar flaw in the testimony of an adult.  I think his
concern is well founded and his comments entirely appropriate.  While children
may not be able to recount precise details and communicate the when and where
of an event with exactitude, this does not mean that they have misconceived
what happened to them and who did it.  In recent years we have adopted a much
more benign attitude to children's evidence, lessening the strict standards of oath
taking and corroboration, and I believe that this is a desirable development. 
The credibility of every witness who testifies before the courts must, of
course, be carefully assessed but the standard of the ""reasonable
adult"" is not necessarily appropriate in assessing the credibility of
young children.

 

(c)  Credence
given to Expert Testimony

 

    Wakeling
J.A. felt that the trial judge may not have given adequate credence to the
evidence of the expert witness because of his concern that expert testimony not
supplant his role as the trier of fact.  However, all Wakeling J.A. did, it
seems to me, was review the settled law regarding the admissibility of expert
evidence.  I need only say in dealing with this ground of appeal that I agree
with Wakeling J.A.'s conclusion that the expert evidence in this case was well
within the bounds of acceptable and admissible testimony and that in cases of
sexual assault against children the opinion of an expert often proves
invaluable.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
saskatchewan

 

    Criminal
law -- Evidence -- Witnesses -- Corroboration -- Evidence of children --
Criminal Code requiring that unsworn evidence of a child be corroborated in a
material particular by evidence that implicates the accused --Whether there is
corroboration in law if the evidence is corroborated with respect to the
occurrence of the event but not with respect to the identity of the accused --
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 586.

 

    Appellant,
a young offender, was charged with committing an aggravated sexual assault on
the complainant, a kindergarten student who was five years old at the time of
the alleged offence.  The trial judge found no evidence of wounding and
therefore considered only the included offences of sexual assault and sexual
assault causing bodily harm.  The complainant gave unsworn testimony at the
trial.  There was corroborating evidence that the assault took place at the
time and place the complainant alleged, but there was no evidence, apart from
the complainant's identification of appellant, that pointed to appellant's
having been the perpetrator of the assault.  The Criminal Code 
provided at the time that no person could be convicted upon the unsworn
evidence of a child unless the evidence was ""corroborated in a material
particular by evidence that implicates the accused.""  The trial judge
found that although there was evidence corroborating the fact that the event
described had taken place, there was no independent evidence connecting
appellant to the event.  He accordingly acquitted him.  The Court of Appeal
found that the trial judge erred in insisting that the corroborating evidence
connect the accused to the commission of the offence, and in failing to find that
the complainant's evidence was confirmed in a material particular.  It set
aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    In
its decision in Vetrovec this Court effectively put an end to
the strict rule in Baskerville, which required
that in order for there to be corroboration of unsworn evidence there must be
independent evidence that implicates the accused.  Although Vetrovec dealt
with corroboration of the evidence of accomplices in situations where
corroboration is required as a matter of common law, it is clear that this
Court has rejected an overly technical approach to corroboration and has
returned to a common sense approach which reflects the original rationale for
the rule.  The requirement in s. 586  of the Criminal Code  that
the corroborating evidence implicate the accused requires only that the
evidence confirm the witness's story in some material particular.

 

    This
conclusion is consistent with the language and intent of s. 586 .  While it
is clear that the section requires that there be evidence that implicates the
accused, it is not clear whether it is the evidence of the unsworn child or the
corroborating evidence that must implicate the accused.  Given the semantic
difficulties in the section, the legislative intention cannot be determined by
looking at the wording alone.  The section's purpose, which is to allow the
evidence of a witness otherwise feared to be untrustworthy to be given weight,
must also be looked at.  In order to achieve that purpose, what is required is
additional evidence that renders it probable that the complainant's story is
true and may be safely acted upon.  Provided that the complainant's evidence is
corroborated in a material particular, with or without implicating the accused,
the veracity of the witness will be strengthened.  Since the only evidence
implicating the accused in many sexual offences against children will be the
evidence of the child, imposing too restrictive a standard on their testimony
may permit serious offences to go unpunished and perhaps to continue.

    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

    Wilson
J. -- The appellant is a young offender who was charged with a number of sexual
assaults on younger children at Sheho Elementary School in Saskatchewan between
September 1985 and May 1986.  One of these assaults is the subject of this
appeal.  A.B., H.H., C.S. and S.S. are other young offenders who were also
charged with one or more of the alleged sexual assaults and the circumstances
of their involvement will be dealt with in the two related judgments of R. v. B.
(G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000 (hereinafter R. v.
G.B., A.B. and C.S.) and R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000 (hereinafter R. v. G.B., C.S., H.H., S.S. and A.B.)

 

    In
the first instance trials were conducted in the following three matters:  R. v.
G.B.; R. v. G.B., A.B. and C.S.; and R. v.
G.B., C.S., H.H., S.S., A.B. and P.H.  All of the youths
were acquitted of all charges by the trial judge, who wrote three separate
judgments.  Appeals by the Crown to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal were
allowed and the court delivered one judgment encompassing all three appeals. 
The young offenders now appeal to this Court as of right pursuant to s. 27 of
the Young Offenders Act, S.C. 1980-81-82‑83, c. 110, as
amended, and s. 618(2)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 691(2) (a)). 
Five separate appeals were initially filed but by order of this Court the
appeals were consolidated and the appellants were granted leave to file a joint
factum.

 

    I
find that it is more convenient to deal with the appeals in three separate
judgments because of the distinct facts pertaining to each and the different
issues raised by the appellants on each appeal.  The main issue which arises
for determination in this appeal is the issue of corroboration and in
particular whether there is corroboration in law if the evidence of an unsworn
child is corroborated with respect to the occurrence of the event but not with
respect to the identity of the accused.  In R. v. G.B., A.B. and
C.S., on the other hand, the main issue is with what degree
of specificity the time of the offence must be established by the Crown in
order to proceed to a determination on the merits.  And in R. v.
G.B., C.S., H.H., S.S. and A.B., the Court is called upon to clarify
the rule applicable to appellate review of an acquittal and to determine
whether the Court of Appeal in the circumstances of this case was entitled to
interfere with the decision of the trial judge.  Each appeal thus raises
discrete issues some of which are fairly narrow and technical.  The broader
question, however, raised by each of them is how the courts should deal with
the evidence of child witnesses and, although each judgment will touch upon
this question, it will be dealt with most extensively in the related judgment
of R. v. G.B., A.B. and C.S.

 

1.  The
Facts

 

    The
appellant G.B. was charged that:

 

On or
about the 9th day of May A.D. 1986 at Sheho in the Province of Saskatchewan
being a young person within the meaning of the Young Offenders Act did in
committing a sexual assault on D.M. wound the said D.M. thereby committing an
aggravated sexual assault contrary to Section 246.3  of the Criminal Code .

 

The
trial judge found no evidence of wounding and therefore considered only the
included offences of sexual assault and sexual assault causing bodily harm.

 

    The
complainant, D.M., a kindergarten student at Sheho Elementary School, was five
years old at the time of the alleged offence.  He gave unsworn testimony at the
trial.  He testified that during the afternoon recess on May 9, 1986, when he
left his classroom to get a drink of water, the appellant grabbed him and
carried him to the janitor's room located next to the senior boys' washroom. 
According to the complainant the appellant then pulled down the complainant's
pants, pulled and twisted his penis, injuring him, and leaving him in the
janitor's room.  There were some discrepancies at trial with respect to the
complainant's evidence as to the perpetrator(s) involved but the complainant
consistently included the appellant and claimed that he was the one who
assaulted him in the janitor's room.

 

    P.M.,
the older brother of the victim, also gave unsworn evidence at trial.  He
testified that he had seen someone he could not identify take his brother into
the janitor's room.  After that person left, P.M. said that he let his brother
out of the janitor's room and that D.M. then returned to his classroom.

 

    Mrs.
Seidlick, the complainant's kindergarten teacher, testified that on the day in
question she noticed the complainant lying down on the carpet in the classroom
away from the other students.  She also noticed that he was upset and when she
tried to find out what was bothering him he complained of soreness.  She
further testified that the complainant had informed her that the big boys had
hurt him and that he had named the appellant as one of the students involved.

 

    D.M's
parents testified as to his physical and emotional condition on the evening of
the alleged offence.  D.M. had complained to his father of a stomachache.  The
father testified that when he asked his son where it hurt the child indicated
the area of his penis.  His father examined him and noticed that the penis was
swollen and distended.  The child was immediately taken to Dr. Raju, who
examined him.  The doctor testified at trial and stated that when he examined
the complainant he found that the child's penis was diffusely swollen and had a
three millimetre abrasion inside the foreskin where it joins the glans.  The
doctor further testified that the injury was fresh, not self-inflicted, and estimated
it to have been inflicted within 24 hours of the examination.

 

    There
was other Crown evidence including the testimony of Constable Lehman and Mrs.
Bolingbrooke, a teacher at the school.  Each testified that some time after the
event the complainant was taken to the school and when the janitor's room was
opened he exhibited signs of terror and fear.  The complainant's parents also
testified that they had noticed bed-wetting and other behavioural changes in
the child.

 

2.  The
Issue

 

    The
sole issue raised on this appeal is whether there was evidence that the trial
judge should have accepted as being capable of corroborating the evidence of
the unsworn complainant.  The determination of this question turns on the
interpretation of s. 586  of the Criminal Code  which
was in force at the time of trial.  It provides:

 

    586.  No
person shall be convicted of an offence upon the unsworn evidence of a child
unless the evidence of the child is corroborated in a material particular by
evidence that implicates the accused.

 

This
provision was repealed by An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Canada
Evidence Act, S.C. 1987, c. 24, s. 15, effective January 1, 1988. 
There is currently no statutory requirement for corroboration of an unsworn
child's evidence in the Criminal Code .  The related
provisions of the Canada Evidence Act  (s. 16(2) , R.S.C.
1970, c. E‑10) and the Young Offenders Act (s. 61(2)), which
required an unsworn child's evidence to be corroborated by some other material
evidence, have also been repealed.

 

3.  The
Courts Below

 

Saskatchewan
Provincial Court  (Chorneyko Prov. Ct. J., unreported)

 

    The
trial judge first stated that the evidence of the kindergarten teacher, parents
and doctor satisfied him that the event described by the complainant took place
on the date alleged in the information.  Having decided that the event occurred
Chorneyko Prov. Ct. J. did not rule on the probative value of the evidence of
Constable Lehman and Mrs. Bolingbrooke.

 

    The
trial judge then turned to the question whether the complainant's unsworn
evidence was corroborated in law, stating that this was the critical issue he
had to deal with.  He found first that the complainant's evidence was the only
evidence which implicated the appellant since the evidence of P.M. could not be
used for corroborative purposes.  He referred to R. v. Baskerville, [1916]
2 K.B. 658 (C.A.), for the principle applicable to the corroboration of unsworn
evidence and noted that this principle was adopted in Canada in this Court's
decision in Paige v. The King, [1948] S.C.R.
349.  In his view, these cases clearly indicated that in order to constitute
corroboration there must not only be independent evidence on some material
particular but that such evidence must implicate the accused.  The trial judge
then considered some later cases such as R. v. Chayko (1984),
12 C.C.C. (3d) 157, in which the majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal
suggested that the Baskerville test was too
narrow.  He reviewed the facts of the cases that were alleged to have expanded
the test and stated:

 

    Whether one considers the narrow view contained in
the Baskerville principle or the wider view in Chayko and Fiddler, in my view,
the result is the same.  Although Chayko and Fiddler state that independent
evidence does not have to show that the accused committed the crime, it is
clear that the independent evidence must somehow connect the accused to the
event complained of.  This was the case in Chayko where the sworn evidence
showed the accused buttoning up his trousers, coming from the area where the
offences were alleged to have happened and messy hair.  All this connects the
accused to the event described by the unsworn testimony.

 

    Likewise in Bear, the father of Joey comes to the
house where the accused is holding the child in a battered condition.  The
brother slaps him, and the accused said nothing.  Again, this is sworn evidence
tending to connect the accused to the event.

 

    In
Fiddler, there is the sworn evidence of the accused being near the scene and
coupled with his attempt to deny he was near the scene during the critical
time.  This evidence also connects the accused to the event.

 

Chorneyko
Prov. Ct. J. concluded that in order to have corroboration in law there must be
sworn evidence which somehow connected the accused to the event described. 
Applying this test to the facts he decided that even although there was
evidence corroborating the fact that the event had taken place, there was no
independent evidence connecting the appellant to the event.  He therefore found
the appellant not guilty.

 

Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal ((1988), 65 Sask. R. 134)

 

    The
Court of Appeal (Vancise, Wakeling and Gerwing JJ.A.) unanimously allowed the
Crown's appeal and ordered a new trial.  Writing for the court Vancise J.A.
agreed that the origin of the English rule concerning corroboration is to be
found in Baskerville, supra.  He
went on to state, however, that the narrow interpretation of the
Baskerville test was considered and rejected by this Court in Murphy and
Butt v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 603.  Murphy and Butt dealt
with corroboration of the evidence of a complainant alleging sexual assault
under s. 142  of the Criminal Code .  After reviewing Murphy and
Butt in depth the Court of Appeal then moved to this Court's
decision in Vetrovec v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R.
811, and noted that Dickson J. in Vetrovec had expressed the
view that the inadequacy of the Baskerville test of
corroboration was recognized by this Court in Murphy and Butt.

 

    Vancise
J.A., relying on the above dicta in Vetrovec and the
approach taken to s. 142  of the Criminal Code  in Murphy and
Butt, concluded that this Court has not accepted the
proposition that s. 586  of the Criminal Code 
embodies the Baskerville rule.  The Court
of Appeal found therefore that the trial judge was in error in insisting that
the corroborating evidence connect the accused to the commission of the
offence.  It was the view of the court that the appropriate approach was to ask
(1) has the child given evidence which implicates the accused? and, if so, (2)
is that evidence corroborated in some material particular?  A material
particular, the court found, is one which tends to confirm that the witness's
testimony is true and could be, but need not be, the ""particular"" of
identification.  Vancise J.A., applying this approach, found as follows at p.
142:

 

    In
this case the child, D.M., gave evidence as to what transpired.  That evidence
implicated the accused as a perpetrator.  The evidence as to what transpired
was confirmed in every material respect (except in respect of the identity of
the perpetrator) by independent evidence.  As the trial judge noted, the
evidence of the teacher, the parents and the doctor, confirmed that the story
as told by D.M. took place.  It was material evidence which elevated the
testimony of D.M. and confirmed the story, even though there was no evidence,
save that of D.M., pointing to the accused as the perpetrator.

 

    Vancise
J.A. concluded that the trial judge erred in law in failing to find that the
evidence of D.M. was confirmed in a material particular.  Because of this
conclusion it was necessary to order a new trial.  He went on to state that it
did not follow that a conviction must automatically result, only that there was
evidence which was capable of constituting corroboration and which must be
considered on the question of guilt or innocence.

 

    I
note at this point that Wakeling J.A., with Gerwing J.A. concurring, made some
additional comments with respect to the helpfulness of expert testimony on the
issue of corroboration and the treatment that should be accorded such
evidence.  However, since this concurrence is raised directly in the matter of R. v.
G.B., A.B. and C.S. in the appellants' written argument, I defer my
comments and a review of Wakeling J.A.'s reasons until I deal specifically with
that appeal.

 

4.  Analysis

 

    The
appellant submits that in order to corroborate the complainant's testimony and
allow a decision to be reached by the trier of fact on the merits of the case,
there must be evidence which in some way connects the accused to the commission
of the crime.  The appellant does not argue that the corroboration must be
direct evidence of the accused's involvement but contends rather that it is not
enough for the corroborating evidence to enhance the credibility of the
complainant if it does not relate to a material particular implicating the
accused.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the evidence
of the complainant's teacher, his parents, and a doctor who examined him,
corroborated his evidence as required by s. 586  of the Criminal
Code .

 

    The
Crown, on the other hand, supports the Court of Appeal's interpretation of the
section and argues that the evidence need only corroborate in some material
particular the statements of the complainant which implicate the accused.  The
issue joined on the appeal then is which of these two positions is correct.

 

    I
note at the outset that the facts of this case are clear.  As found by both the
trial judge and the Court of Appeal there is corroborating evidence that the
assault took place at the time and place the complainant alleged.  However,
there is no evidence, apart from the complainant's identification of the
appellant, that points to the appellant as having been the perpetrator of the
assault.  Accordingly, if the appellant's position is correct, the appeal must
be allowed; if the Crown's position is correct, the appeal must be dismissed.

 

    I
begin with a brief historical overview of corroboration in order to set the
stage for the review of the case law and discussion that follows.

 

(a) 
Historical Overview

 

    In
the early history of the common law children under the age of fourteen were
automatically disqualified from giving testimony regardless of their
intelligence or religious instruction.  This was due to a perceived natural
lack of intelligence of young children which would lessen their capacity to
understand either what they were testifying about or the nature of the
obligations that testifying under oath entailed.  However, in the late
eighteenth century the law concentrated on the young witness's ability to
understand the nature and consequences of an oath and the age limit was dropped
as a strict requirement.  In R. v. Brasier (1779), 1 Leach
199, 168 E.R. 202, for example, the court held that there was no precise or
fixed rule as to the time within which infants must be precluded from giving
evidence.

 

    In
the late nineteenth century England enacted legislation to permit the receipt
of unsworn testimony from children provided ""other material evidence""
was available to corroborate such testimony (Criminal Law Amendment
Act, 1885 (U.K.), 48 & 49 Vict., c. 69, s. 4).  Canada
adopted similar legislation in 1890 (An Act further to
amend the Criminal Law, S.C. 1890, c. 37, s. 13) and in 1893 enacted the
forerunner of the recently repealed provision of the Canada Evidence Act  (S.C.
1893, c. 31, s. 25) which allowed the unsworn evidence of children to be
admitted provided the child possessed sufficient intelligence to justify the
reception of the evidence and understood the duty to speak the truth.  Under
the original Criminal Code  of 1892, S.C.
1892, c. 29, s. 685, the unsworn evidence of children could not be admitted
unless it was corroborated by ""some other evidence in support thereof
implicating the accused"" and was only allowed for the offences of carnal
knowledge and indecent assault.  The unsworn evidence of a child in any other
case had to be received under the Canada Evidence Act  until
the Criminal Code  of 1954, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, was enacted.  Despite the
difference in wording between the Criminal Code  and the Canada
Evidence Act , the degree of corroboration required was thought to be
the same:  see R. v. Silverstone, [1934] 1 D.L.R.
726 (Ont. C.A.)  Thus, for over 100 years the law in Canada has required the
unsworn evidence of children to be corroborated.

 

    In
recent years there has been considerable criticism of the rule regarding
corroboration both in judicial decisions and academic commentaries.  In 1976
the Law Reform Commission of Canada expressed the view that the corroboration
rule was unnecessary:  see Report on Evidence (1975), reprinted
in (1976), 34 C.R.N.S. 26, at p. 33.  The Badgley Report
recommended that the statutory requirement of corroboration of an unsworn
child's evidence be abolished and that the weight to be given their evidence
should be a matter for the trier of fact:  see Sexual Offences
Against Children in Canada: Summary of the Report of the Committee on Sexual
Offences Against Children and Youths (1984).

 

    The
criticism of the rules was not without effect.  This Court's decision in Vetrovec, supra,
eliminates the common law rule relating to accomplices and the Criminal
Code  provision dealing with corroboration of a complainant's
evidence in rape cases was repealed by the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, 1975, S.C. 1974-75-76, c. 93, s. 8 .  As mentioned, the
provision requiring corroboration of proof based on the unsworn evidence of a
child has also been repealed and the provisions allowing unsworn children to
give evidence have become more liberal.  These changes are evidence of the
decline in importance of the need for corroboration due to the recognition that
the trier of fact is competent to weigh the evidence and credibility of all
witnesses.  It also reflects a desire to overcome technical impediments in the
prosecution of offences.  Nevertheless, this appeal must be decided on the
basis of the legislative limitations upon an unsworn child's testimony that
were in place at the time of trial.

 

(b)  Case Law

 

    Any
review of the case law dealing with corroboration must begin with a discussion
of Baskerville.  At issue in the case was the scope of the rule of
practice requiring corroboration of the evidence of an accomplice but Lord
Reading C.J. for the court stated that the rule was the same for statutory
requirements.  Lord Reading pointed out that it was clearly not necessary for
the evidence of an accomplice to be confirmed in every detail but that a
difference of opinion had arisen as to whether it was essential that the
corroborative evidence connect the accused with the crime.  After a review of
the authorities the court concluded that the better opinion was that the
evidence must be confirmed not only as to the circumstances of the crime but
also as to the identity of the accused.  Quoting from p. 667:

 

    We
hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony which affects
the accused by connecting or tending to connect him with the crime.  In other
words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that is, which confirms in
some material particular not only the
evidence that the crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner
committed it.  The test applicable to determine the nature and
extent of the corroboration is thus the same whether the case falls within the
rule of practice at common law or within that class of offences for which
corroboration is required by statute.  The language of the statute,
""implicates the accused,"" compendiously incorporates the test
applicable at common law in the rule of practice.  The nature of the
corroboration will necessarily vary according to the particular circumstances
of the offence charged.  It would be in high degree dangerous to attempt to
formulate the kind of evidence which would be regarded as corroboration, except
to say that corroborative evidence is evidence which shows or tends to show
that the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true,
not merely that the crime has been committed, but that it was committed by the
accused. [Emphasis added.]

 

    It
is the interpretation of this passage which seems to have caused confusion in
recent years.  The majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal in Chayko found
the judgment in Baskerville hard to interpret
and noted that different courts have interpreted it in different ways.  Kerans
J.A., for the majority, relying on the latter portion of the above excerpt,
concluded that Lord Reading intended the words ""implicates the
accused"" to refer only to an implication of guilt arising from the evidence
that requires corroboration.

 

    The
Crown relies heavily on Kerans J.A.'s judgment.  It submits that the
Baskerville rule is open to two interpretations.  The first, or
narrow rule, sees corroborative evidence as independent evidence that itself
implicates the accused.  The second, and considerably broader interpretation,
is that if the witness identifies the accused and the evidence of the witness
is confirmed in some material particular, then there is corroboration in law of
that witness's evidence.  The Crown advocates the broader interpretation. 
However, in my view, support for the broader interpretation is not to be found
in Lord Reading's judgment.  He made it abundantly clear throughout his reasons
that there had to be corroborative evidence as to a material circumstance of
the crime and as to the identity of the accused in relation to that
crime.  In Vetrovec, Dickson J. shared this view, stating
at p. 826:

 

Prior to
the judgment of Lord Reading, there had been controversy over whether corroborative
evidence must implicate the accused, or whether it was sufficient if it simply
strengthened the credibility of the accomplice.  Lord Reading settled the
controversy in favour of the former view.

 

    In
the years following Baskerville the narrow interpretation
of the rule was approved in numerous decisions of this Court.  One text writer
has commented that this Court acted upon the narrow interpretation of the rule
on at least fifteen occasions over a period of sixty years:  see Schiff, Evidence
in the Litigation Process (1988), vol. 1, at p. 613.  For example, in Hubin v.
The King, [1927] S.C.R. 442, Anglin C.J., for the Court, stated
at p. 444:

 

    Since
the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v.
Baskerville, the requirements of the provision now found in s. 1002
admit of no doubt.  The corroboration must be by evidence independent of the
complainant; and it ""must tend to show that the accused committed the
crime charged"".

 

    In R. v.
Parish, [1968] S.C.R. 466, this Court, per Ritchie
J., again relied on Baskerville when applying the
rule for corroboration as set out in the Criminal Code  (then
s. 134 ) for evidence given by the complainant in a rape case, the same
provision at issue in Hubin.  Ritchie J. held that even although
the corroborating evidence need not be direct evidence that the accused
committed the crime, circumstantial evidence being sufficient, it must
nonetheless touch upon the accused's connection with the crime.  On the facts
of that case the corroborating evidence implicated the accused without touching
upon the question whether or not there had been actual intercourse between the
accused and the complainant.  This was held sufficient to constitute
corroboration in law.

 

    There
was little controversy as to what the common law rule was or what the statute
required until 1976 when this Court delivered two contemporaneous judgments
addressing statutory corroboration in the context of rape.  As in this case,
the provision in question was in effect when the events took place but was
repealed prior to this Court's decisions.  Several commentators and courts have
viewed these cases as leading to the demise of Baskerville.

 

    In Warkentin
v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 355, this Court considered the
requirements for statutory corroboration when one of the live issues for
determination was the identity of the alleged rapists.  Section 142  of the Criminal
Code  was still in force at the relevant time and provided
that there must be a warning to the jury if the evidence of the complainant
""is not corroborated in a material particular by evidence that implicates
the accused"".

 

    In Warkentin, the
complainant testified that she had been seized by the three accused and a
fourth man, forced into a red Ford Mustang, and taken to an isolated place
where she was raped by one of the men while two others held her arms and the
fourth stood by laughing.  After managing to escape she was picked up by two
friends who testified to her distraught condition at the time.  The trial judge
left the following items with the jury as evidence of corroboration and the
accused were convicted:  evidence of the association of the accused with the
complainant earlier in the evening, the complainant's distraught condition, the
finding of sperm on the complainant, the finding of scalp hair that could have
come from one of the accused, and the finding of pine needles in the
complainant's underclothing that could have come from the scene of the alleged
rape.

 

    In
this Court the appellants argued that there were three separate issues, namely
intercourse, consent, and identity, in respect of each accused, and that the
trial judge had erred in failing to distinguish which pieces of evidence were
capable of corroborating the evidence of the complainant on each issue.  The
majority of this Court (Laskin C.J. and Spence, Pigeon and Dickson JJ.
dissenting) affirmed the trial judge's decision and concluded that, while none
of the items on their own could have provided corroboration, taken together the
evidence was capable of establishing each of the elements of the offence and
greatly enhanced the credibility of the complainant's evidence.
De Grandpré J., for the majority, rejected the view that the identity of
each accused had to be corroborated separately in the case of a gang rape.  He
wrote at p. 379:

 

    I am
satisfied that the corroborative evidence of which s. 142  speaks need not
identify each accused separately when the evidence to be corroborated is that a
gang rape has been committed.  It is sufficient to establish that intercourse
without consent has taken place and that the group was a party to it.  In the
same fashion, I cannot accept the submission that the corroborative evidence of
s. 142  must be pigeonholed in three different slots, namely intercourse,
non-consent and identity.  The wording of the section goes against that
interpretation.  On the text of the article, there is corroboration when the
story of the complainant is ""corroborated in a material particular by evidence
that implicates the accused"".  It is the entire picture that must be
looked at, not a portion thereof.

 

    During
the course of his reasons, de Grandpré J. made several statements suggesting
that there should be a relaxation of the requirements of corroboration and that
corroboration should be treated as a matter of common sense without strict
adherence to formalities.  He stated at p. 374:

 

    Corroboration
is not a word of art.  It is a matter of common sense.  In recent years, this
Court has repeatedly refused to give a narrow legalistic reading of that word
and to impose upon trial judges artificial restraints in their instructions to
juries or to themselves.

 

    In
writing the dissenting opinion, Dickson J. stated that the corroboration
required by the section was not corroboration in the sense of evidence which
tends merely to confirm or support the story of the complainant.  Rather, the
section specifies that in order to be corroborative the evidence must be on a
material point in the case and, above all, must implicate the accused by
connecting or tending to connect him with the alleged offence.  Dickson J. also
noted that the corroborating evidence must be independent of the acts or words
of the complainant.

 

    The
Court's judgment in Murphy and Butt, supra, was
delivered on the same day, Spence J. writing the majority opinion and Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting in part.  The Crown relies on this case for the
proposition that the narrow interpretation of Baskerville has
been rejected by this Court.  The two appellants had been convicted of rape at
trial.  Murphy, one of the appellants, admitted having sexual relations with
the complainant but claimed it was consensual.  Butt, the other appellant,
denied that any sexual relations had taken place.  The corroborating evidence
put forward by the Crown was the police evidence of the complainant's
distraught condition shortly after the alleged offence.  It was clear that this
evidence could corroborate the complainant's absence of consent with respect to
Murphy.  The difficulty arose as to whether the same evidence could corroborate
the complainant's testimony against Butt.  Spence J., writing for the majority,
found that there was sufficient corroborating evidence as to the intercourse
between the complainant and Butt, a conclusion which suggests a departure from
the previous strict interpretation of the statutory provision.  He stated at
pp. 615-16:

 

It [s. 142 of the Code] is
firstly called into force when ""the only evidence that implicates the
accused is the evidence, given under oath, of the female person in respect of
whom the offence is alleged to have been committed"".  Those conditions do
apply to the present case.  Then what is required is ""that evidence is not
corroborated in a material particular by evidence that implicates the
accused"".  So that what is required to be corroborated is a material
particular of the evidence of the complainant.  The evidence of
the complainant was, as I have already recited, that she was taken by these two
appellants acting under a pretence of friendship to the apartment which they
occupied and then raped first by the appellant Murphy and then by the appellant
Butt.  It is a material particular of that evidence which must be
corroborated.  There is no requirement that the whole of her evidence be
corroborated.  Were that the requirement, there would be no need for even the
evidence of the complainant.  The so-called corroborative evidence would be
sufficient for a conviction.

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

    It is all of that evidence plus the complainant's
distraught condition upon which the Crown relies as corroboration of not only
Murphy's but Butt's rape of the complainant.  The jury were entitled to consider
all of that evidence and to come to the conclusion that that evidence with its
rather unusual outline of events does corroborate the evidence of the
complainant.  It was that evidence which the learned trial judge left to the
jury as evidence which they might find corroborative of the complainant's
testimony.

 

    In
my view, the learned trial judge was correct in his conclusion that that
evidence was capable of corroborating the complainant's story implicating each
of the accused.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Chief
Justice Laskin, however, was of a different view.  He applied the stricter
requirements of s. 142  as had Dickson J. in Warkentin.  He
concluded that the complainant's distraught condition was not corroborative
because it did not implicate Butt.  He would have allowed Butt's appeal,
stating at p. 606:

 

    I do
not quarrel with the proposition that a complainant's hysterical condition or
emotional distress, evident after the commission of an alleged rape, may be
adduced in evidence as corroboration provided, however, that, in the words of
s. 142 , it is ""evidence that implicates the accused"".  It cannot be
said that evidence of a complainant's hysterical condition or emotional
distress is capable of being corroborative at large and that it can be used
accordingly against a particular accused simply because the complainant has
alleged that he raped her.  It may be evidence that is corroborative against an
accused who admits sexual intercourse, as Murphy did, but who at the same time
alleges consent.  In such a case it may properly be regarded as supporting the
complaint in a material particular, that is want of consent, and to implicate
the accused because of his admission of intercourse.  I am unable to
understand, however, how a complainant's hysterical condition can implicate an
accused in any material particular when he has denied intercourse and there is
no other evidence (apart from the complainant's) that can support a finding of
intercourse.

 

    Both
McWilliams (Canadian Criminal Evidence (2nd ed. 1984))
and Schiff, op. cit., view these two cases as considerably weakening the
requirements for statutory corroborative evidence.  McWilliams states that the
evidence in Warkentin was barely sufficient to be
corroborative of identity and that Spence J. in Murphy and Butt
construed s. 142  so that it would be sufficient if corroborative evidence went
to one of the issues whether that issue was a live one or not.  Schiff comments
that Murphy and Butt can be taken as the case in which the majority rejected
""implicating the accused"" as a necessary element of corroboration. 
A. B. Clarke, an Associate of King's College, London, has also reviewed the two
cases and says the Court rejected the Baskerville
approach in favour of a search for evidence to support the victim's credibility
with the jury:  see ""Corroboration in Sexual Cases"", [1980] Crim. L.R. 362. 
Clarke writes at p. 363:

 

The
rigid Baskerville formulation has given way to a search for circumstances
and other testimony, more consistent with the truth of the victim's statements
than their falsity, particularly in the areas of dispute -- a concentration on
the victim's story and the support for it.

 

    On
the other hand, both cases were analyzed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
McNamara (No. 1) (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193, and the court came to the
conclusion that in both cases the requirement that the corroborating evidence
link the accused in some way to the crime was maintained.  Regarding Warkentin the
court wrote at pp. 274-75:

 

In our
view, the basis of the majority judgment is that the hair on the complainant's
jeans, which was similar to that found on Warkentin, was capable of linking Warkentin
to the offence.  The admission by all the accused that they had been together
earlier in the evening, coupled with the fact that they were arrested together,
was capable of linking the other accused to Warkentin at the relevant time and,
thus, the evidence was capable of implicating the entire group and each member
of it in the commission of the offence.  Whether those items, in fact,
constituted corroboration was, of course, for the jury to determine. 

 

With
respect to Murphy and Butt, the court was of
the view that the evidence of Butt and Murphy looking for a prostitute and
taking the complainant back to the apartment provided the implicating link to
Butt that might not have been provided if the evidence of the complainant's
distraught condition had been considered on its own.  The court stated at p.
277:

 

    Again,
we consider that the difference of opinion reflected in the majority and
minority judgments was merely a difference as to whether it was open to the
jury to find that the evidence left with them as capable of being corroborative
implicated the accused.  Both the majority and minority judgments accept the
proposition that evidence to be corroborative must implicate the accused in the
commission of the offence.

 

    It
may be that at first glance Warkentin tends to support the Crown's
submission that the element of identity by itself need not be corroborated and
that any evidence that makes the complainant's story more credible on any issue
is sufficient.  However, it is my view that while this may be the correct
interpretation of s. 586  of the Criminal Code , the
majority decision in Warkentin provides only limited support for
it.  De Grandpré J. stated that while the circumstantial evidence taken piece
by piece did not tend to show that intercourse had taken place without the
consent of the complainant and with one or other of the accused, taken in its
totality it was capable of establishing the three elements of the offence,
including identity.  This, I believe, tends to show that the majority believed
there was independent evidence corroborative of identity.  However, the
judgment does suggest a weakening of the strict requirement of evidence
corroborative of the accused's connection with the offence.

 

    A
broad reading of the judgment of Spence J. in Murphy and Butt leads
me to conclude that he thought that any evidence that tended to corroborate in
any respect the testimony of the witness whose evidence required corroboration
would suffice.  Thus, it would be sufficient if the corroborative evidence
confirmed the complainant's story implicating the accused.  Spence J. did not,
however, make it clear whether the complainant's distraught condition was
corroborative because it could be taken as implicating Butt or because it
raised the credibility of the complainant's story which had implicated Butt. 
Instead, he referred to all the evidence, i.e. Murphy's admission of
intercourse, the fact that both accused had picked up the complainant and taken
her to their apartment thinking she was a prostitute, and the complainant's
distraught condition, as providing the corroboration. 

 

    In
my opinion, it is only when the Chief Justice's dissent in Murphy and
Butt is compared to the majority judgment that the
difference in approaches becomes clear.  Laskin C.J. carefully reviewed the
Canadian cases in which the complainant's distraught condition was admissible
as corroboration implicating the accused and found that in each case the issue
was one of consent, not whether the accused had intercourse with the complainant. 
He thus concluded that there was no evidence capable of corroborating the
complainant's evidence with respect to Butt.  Applying the strict
interpretation of the statutory requirement this conclusion would appear to be
correct.  It is difficult to see how the evidence of the complainant's
distraught condition, even together with the admitted fact that both the
accused had picked her up and taken her to her apartment, is of any probative
value, when viewed independently of the complainant's testimony, on the issue
of the alleged intercourse with Butt.  For the majority to reach this result it
had to accept that the corroborative evidence implicated Butt because of the
evidence of the complainant.  Unlike Warkentin, it was
not a gang rape situation in which proof against one would be sufficient for
the other.  In Murphy and Butt there had to be
corroboration against each of the accused.

 

    This
interpretation of the majority decision in Murphy and Butt was
accepted by this Court in its unanimous decision in Vetrovec.  At
issue in Vetrovec was corroboration of the evidence of
accomplices and this Court effectively put an end to the strict rule in
Baskerville at least in so far as it applied to the common law,
thereby affirming its willingness to depart from its own prior decisions. 
Dickson J. reviewed the rationale for the rule and concluded that there was no
logical need for it.  He pointed out that in all categories of witnesses some
will be untrustworthy and if the trial judge thinks that the jury should be
cautioned as to the evidence of such a witness, he or she may instruct
accordingly.

 

    The
Court expressed a preference for a common sense approach rather than the overly
technical approach in Baskerville.  It found at
least three problems with Baskerville.  The first was
that it confuses the reason behind the accomplice warning and prompts the
courts to determine whether the corroborative evidence fits the definition
rather than deciding whether there is evidence that bolsters the credibility of
the accomplice.  Secondly, because corroboration became a legal term of art the
law in the area became increasingly complex and technical.  Thirdly, and most
importantly, the Court was of the view that the definition was unsound in
principle.  Dickson J. stated at p. 826:

 

    With
great respect, on principle Lord Reading's approach seems perhaps
over-cautious.  The reason for requiring corroboration is that we believe the
witness has good reason to lie.  We therefore want some other piece of evidence
which tends to convince us that he is telling the truth.  Evidence which
implicates the accused does indeed serve to accomplish that purpose but it
cannot be said that this is the only sort of evidence which will accredit the
accomplice. 

 

In
conclusion, the Court held in Vetrovec that there should
be no special category for accomplices.  An accomplice should be treated like
any other witness.  While careful to point out that his comments were limited
to situations in which corroboration is required as a matter of common law, and
even although the focus of the Court's analysis was on the branch of the
corroboration doctrine involving accomplices, Dickson J. also wove into the
discussion a comment on Murphy and Butt.  After quoting
the decision of Spence J., he stated at p. 828:

 

    Mr.
Justice Spence's approach was to look for evidence which confirmed the story of
the complainant.  Once the story was confirmed, the complainant could be
believed and the accused convicted.  Implicit in this approach, it seems to me,
is a recognition of the inadequacy of the Baskerville
definition of corroboration.  Evidence implicating the accused is a possible
but not a necessary element for corroboration.  Here, even though there was
no evidence implicating Butt, there was evidence confirming the story of the
complainant and thus it was safe to convict.  The important question, as
Wigmore pointed out, is not how our trust is restored, but whether it is
restored at all.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    It
seems to me, therefore, that this Court has clearly rejected an ultra technical
approach to corroboration and has returned to a common sense approach which
reflects the original rationale for the rule and allows cases to be determined
on their merits.  This was also the view of the majority of the Alberta Court
of Appeal in Chayko.  Kerans J.A. cited Dickson J.'s
comments on Murphy and Butt in Vetrovec and
held that the requirement in s. 586  that the corroborating evidence implicate
the accused requires only that the evidence confirm in some material particular
the story of the witness giving the evidence which required corroboration.

 

    I
am, accordingly, in agreement with the Crown's position.  In my view, the Court
of Appeal was correct to dispose of this appeal on the strength of this Court's
statements in Murphy and Butt and Vetrovec. 
However, I would be remiss if I did not address the interpretation of s. 586 
independently of authority in order to confirm that this conclusion is
consistent with the language and intent of the legislative provision.

 

(c)  Statutory
Interpretation

 

    I
reproduce s. 586  in full for ease of reference:

 

    586.  No
person shall be convicted upon the unsworn evidence of a child unless the
evidence of the child is corroborated in a material particular by evidence that
implicates the accused.

 

    Turning
first to a literal interpretation, the section speaks of corroboration (a) in a
material particular and refers to (b) evidence which implicates the accused. 
The appellant strongly contends that the language of the section compels one to
conclude that for the corroboration requirement to be met there must be some
link between the corroborating evidence and the accused.  I do not agree.  In
my view, while it is clear that the section requires that there be evidence
that implicates the accused, it is not clear  whether it is the evidence of the
unsworn child in need of corroboration that must implicate the accused or
whether it is the corroborating evidence that must implicate the accused.  In Chayko, Kerans
J.A., when dealing with the Baskerville definition of
corroboration which contains substantially the same wording as s. 586 , also
found ambiguity.  He stated at p. 168:

 

This is
compounded by a semantic problem with the words ""which implicate the
accused"".  These can refer to an implication of guilt which rests only on
the corroborating evidence independently of the evidence needing
corroboration.  Alternatively, they can refer to an implication of guilt which
arises from the evidence needing corroboration and which is now reliable
because corroborated.

 

    The
semantic difficulties in the section are highlighted if one rewords the section
in line with the two possible interpretations.  If the wording of the section
were ""corroborated . . . by evidence that implicates the accused""
without the intervening words ""in a material particular"", a literal
interpretation would support the appellant's position.  But if the appellant's
interpretation is correct, one is forced to conclude that the intervening words
""in a material particular"" are redundant because, if the
corroborative evidence implicates the accused, it will inevitably be
corroboration in a material particular.  The identity of the accused is always
material.

 

    On
the other hand, to support the Crown's position, the only wording that is
necessary is ""corroborated in a material particular"".  If the section
stopped there, its interpretation would not be contentious.  However, the
section continues and adds ""by evidence that implicates the
accused"".  Nonetheless, the addition of these words does not create the
same redundancy as does interpreting the provision in accordance with the
appellant's position.  The extra words are necessary if what is required is
that the evidence of the unsworn child implicate the accused.  However it does
create a redundancy of a different kind since there can be no conviction unless
the accused person is implicated by some evidence:  indeed, implicated beyond a
reasonable doubt.

 

    Given
the interpretive problems in the language of the section, it is difficult to
discern the intention of the legislature by looking at the wording alone.  I
think we have to apply a purpose approach.  In my view, the purpose of s. 586 
is to allow the evidence of a witness, otherwise feared to be untrustworthy, to
be given weight.  Another way of formulating the purpose is to state that the
section is designed to ensure that no accused will be convicted on the basis of
testimonial evidence that is by its very nature unreliable.  In order to
achieve the section's purpose, therefore, what is required is additional
evidence that renders it probable that the complainant's story is true and may
safely be acted upon.  Provided that the complainant's evidence is corroborated
in a material particular, with or without implicating the accused, the veracity
of the witness will be strengthened.  A good example in this case would be the
evidence of the doctor that the child had indeed been sexually assaulted.

 

    Also
in favour of the liberal interpretation are the presumptions that the law does
not require the impossible and the legislator intends only what is just and
reasonable.  Since the only evidence implicating the accused in many sexual
offences against children will be the evidence of the child, imposing too
restrictive a standard on their testimony may permit serious offences to go
unpunished and perhaps to continue.  Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that
the legislator did not intend an accused to benefit from the youthful age of
his victim by placing unnecessary impediments in the way of prosecuting
offences against small children.

 

    Nevertheless,
I am fully conscious of the fact that a strict interpretation of s. 586 
provides a strong protection against false convictions since establishing the
identity of the perpetrator is a necessary pre-condition to any criminal
prosecution.  However, after weighing the considerations on either side of the
issue I have concluded that of the two possible interpretations, each of which
can be supported on the wording of the section, the preferable interpretation
is that s. 586  of the Criminal Code  requires the
evidence of the complainant which implicates the accused to be corroborated in
a material particular by other independent testimony.

 

5.  Disposition

 

    I
would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.

s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Code infringes the freedoms of expression and of
association guaranteed by ss. 2(b) and 2(d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms.

 

    The
respondent was charged with ""communicating in a public place for the
purpose of obtaining the sexual services of a prostitute"" contrary to
s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal Code .  The
trial judge convicted the respondent but the Court of Appeal set aside the
conviction holding that s. 195.1(1) (c)
infringed the guarantee of freedom of expression in s. 2 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and that s. 195.1(1) (c) was
not justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter .  The
court also suggested that s. 195.1(1) (c)
violated the guarantee of freedom of association in s. 2 (d) of the Charter .  This
appeal is to determine whether s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Code
infringes s. 2 (b) or (d) of the Charter ; and,
if so, whether s. 195.1(1) (c) is justifiable
under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Held (Wilson
and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and La Forest and Sopinka JJ.:  Section 195.1(1)(c) of the Code does
not infringe s. 2 (d) of the Charter .  In proscribing
street solicitation for the purposes of prostitution, s. 195.1(1) (c)
attacks expressive activity of a commercial nature.  It focuses on the
prostitute or customer who stops or communicates with another person in a
public place for the purposes of engaging in prostitution.  The target of
s. 195.1(1) (c), therefore, is expressive conduct and not conduct of
an associational nature.  The section does not directly proscribe an agreement
between two individuals for the exchange of sex for money, nor sexual relations
between consenting individuals.  The mere fact that an impugned
legislative provision limits the possibility of commercial activities or
agreements is not sufficient to show a prima facie
interference with s. 2 (d).

 

    For
the reasons given by the Chief Justice in Reference re
ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.),
s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Code infringes
s. 2 (b) of the Charter  but is justifiable
under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Per Lamer
J.:  For the reasons given by the Chief Justice, s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code  does not infringe s. 2 (d) of the Charter .  For
the reasons I gave in Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the
Criminal Code (Man.), s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Code
infringes s. 2 (b) of the Charter  but is justifiable
under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Per Wilson
and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. (dissenting): For the reasons given by the minority in Reference
re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.),
s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal Code 
infringes the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Charter  and is
not saved by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Section
195.1(1)(c) of the Code also infringes the
right to freedom of association guaranteed by s. 2 (d) of the Charter .  A
provision which prohibits parties from associating with a view to pursuing a
lawful common objective infringes s. 2 (d),
whether that objective is entry into a commercial transaction or some other
lawful objective.  In considering whether or not a given activity is protected
under s. 2 (d), the Court must have regard to how that activity is
pursued rather than to the nature of the activity.  In the present context, prostitutes
and potential customers associate when they meet to discuss the sale of sex. 
That meeting is the form their association takes and this is what s. 2 (d)
protects, not the activity in which they intend to engage thereafter.  So long
as it remains lawful to sell sex for money, there is a right to associate with
others in order to reach an agreement for this purpose.  Section 195.1(1)(c) of the Code, which
seeks to prohibit both the meetings and the communications between prostitutes
and potential customers, infringes freedom of association as well as freedom of
expression.  Even if the legislature's purpose in enacting s. 195.1(1) (c) was
not to restrict freedom of association, that is clearly the effect of the
legislation.  Section 195.1(1) (c) interferes
directly with a prostitute's ability to associate with potential customers.

 

    Section
195.1(1)(c) is not justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter .  While
the nuisance caused by street solicitation, at least in the major population
centres in Canada, is a pressing and substantial concern warranting a
limitation on freedom of association, s. 195.1(1) (c) fails
to meet the proportionality test.  The measures are rationally connected to the
prevention of the nuisance, but s. 195.1(1) (c) is too
broad and not sufficiently tailored to the objective.  In view of the expansive
meaning given to the expression ""public place"" in s. 195.1(2) of
the Code, s. 195.1(1)(c)
prevents a prostitute and potential customer from associating in a wide range
of circumstances in which no nuisance will result from their meeting together. 
It is not reasonable to prohibit associational activity that harms no one on
the basis that in some circumstances and in some areas a high concentration of
that activity may give rise to a public or social nuisance.  If such activity
is to be prohibited, there must be a much closer nexus between the
associational activity that is prohibited and the nuisance to which it is
alleged to give rise.

//The Chief
Justice//

 

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and La Forest and Sopinka JJ. was delivered by

 

    THE CHIEF JUSTICE -- The
respondent, Dorman Thomas Skinner, was charged that he:

 

. . . at
or near Halifax, in the County of Halifax, Nova Scotia, on or about the 2nd day
of January, 1986, did unlawfully in a public place communicate with Aileen
Richardson for the purpose of obtaining the sexual services of a prostitute,
contrary to Section 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

    Section
195.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, reads as follows:

 

    195.1 (1) Every person who in a public
place or in any place open to public view

 

    (a)stops or attempts to stop any motor vehicle,

 

    (b)impedes the free flow of pedestrian or vehicular
traffic or ingress to or egress from premises adjacent to that place, or

 

    (c)stops or attempts to stop any person or in any manner
communicates or attempts to communicate with any person

 

for the purpose of engaging in prostitution or of
obtaining the sexual services of a prostitute is guilty of an offence
punishable on summary conviction.

 

    (2)
In this section, ""public place"" includes any place to which the
public have access as of right or by invitation, express or implied, and any
motor vehicle located in a public place or in any place open to public view.

 

    Section
2  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
guarantees that everyone has, among others, the following fundamental freedoms:

 

(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression,
including freedom of the press and other media of communication;

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

(d)
freedom of association.

 

 

    Section
1  of the Charter  provides that:

 

    1.  The Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms
set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can
be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

    On
the evening of Thursday, January 2, 1986, Constable Aileen Richardson, a member
of the Morality Squad of the Halifax Police Department, was working in an
undercover capacity in the area of Cornwallis Park in the city of Halifax,
posing as a prostitute.  Constable Richardson dressed in slacks and a fur coat,
was strolling back and forth on the sidewalk adjacent to the park.  Seated in
an unmarked police cruiser parked nearby were Sergeant Ronald Mosher, the head
of the Morality Squad, and Constable Bill MacLeod.  Constable Richardson was
fitted with a body pack voice recording device.  Any conversations Constable
Richardson engaged in could be heard by Sergeant Mosher in the police cruiser. 
At approximately 10:25 p.m., the respondent, a resident of Dartmouth, walked
across Hollis Street from the area of the Nova Scotian Hotel and approached
Constable Richardson.  They exchanged greetings.  The respondent walked past
Constable Richardson a distance of approximately twelve feet, stopped, and
walked back to her.  As they strolled side by side on the sidewalk, Skinner and
Richardson engaged in the following conversation:

 

S.:  How much do you charge?

 

R.:  For what?

 

S.:  For a blow job. [fellatio]

 

R.:  What do you have?

 

S.:Ooh, you charge by how much the person has.  Do you
have a place?

 

R.:  No.

 

S.:  Where do you live?

 

R.:  Not close to here.

 

S.: 
Well, how much do you charge for a blow job?

 

At this
point, Constable Richardson turned and walked away from the respondent. 
Sergeant Mosher and Constable MacLeod pulled up to the curb in the police
cruiser and got out.  Sergeant Mosher advised the respondent that he was under
arrest, told him the reason for the arrest, and advised him of his right to
counsel.

 

    In
Nova Scotia Provincial Court, the respondent pleaded not guilty and, as his
defence, challenged the constitutional validity of s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code .  He argued that the provision violated the freedoms of
expression and association declared in s. 2  of the Charter .  The
respondent was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $100 and, in default, to
imprisonment for ten days.

 

    The
respondent appealed to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal.  MacKeigan J.A. (Clarke
C.J.N.S. and Pace J.A. concurring), found that s. 195.1(1) (c), in
prohibiting an expressive economic message, constituted a prima
facie violation of s. 2 (b) of the Charter : 
(1987), 79 N.S.R. (2d) 8.  The s. 2 (d) issue
did not receive extensive consideration.  However, MacKeigan J.A. did suggest
that s. 195.1(1) (c) also violated s. 2 (d), at p.
15:

 

    Section
195.1 would similarly appear to offend s. 2 (d) of the Charter  (Freedom
of Association) inhibiting the free association of prostitute and customer;
does not s. 2 (d) protect sexual association between consenting adults --
whether the consent is freely given or paid for?

 

    The
majority of the Court of Appeal then went on to find that the impugned
provision could not be upheld under s. 1  of the Charter . 
Section 195.1(1) (c) was accordingly declared of no force or effect.

 

    Jones
J.A., in dissent in the Court of Appeal, found that the impugned provision
violated neither the fundamental guarantee of freedom of expression under s. 2 (b) nor
that of freedom of association under s. 2 (d).

 

    This
Court granted leave to appeal, [1987] 2 S.C.R. ix, and stated three
constitutional questions quoted at the conclusion of these reasons.  The
Attorneys General of Canada, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and
Ontario were granted leave to intervene, as was the Canadian Organization for
the Rights of Prostitutes.  The case was heard together with Reference
re ss. 193 and 195(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 000, and R. v. Stagnitta, [1990] 1 S.C.R.
000.  The respondent in this case challenges s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  as constituting a violation of both s. 2 (b) and s.
2 (d) of the Charter .  The challenge
under the s. 2 (b) guarantee of freedom of expression is addressed by the
Court in the reasons given in Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of
the Criminal Code (Man.), released concurrently.  The challenge to the impugned
legislative provision under the s. 2 (d)
guarantee of freedom of association is unique to this appeal.

 

    Before
this Court, however, very little emphasis was put on the s. 2 (d)
challenge.  The arguments put forward to challenge s. 195.1(1)(c) under
s. 2 (d) were largely secondary to and dependent on those
challenging the provision under the s. 2 (b)
guarantee of freedom of expression.

 

    The
appellant submits that as the impugned provision proscribes ""street
prostitution"" rather than sexual association between consenting adults, s.
2 (d) is not infringed.  In other words, it is the
appellant's contention that s. 2 (d) Charter 
protection does not extend to one-on-one bargaining between a prostitute and a
customer in public.  The appellant refers to Trotter's annotation to the Court
of Appeal reasons in this case reported in 58 C.R. (3d) 137, which found that
the majority judgment erred in its s. 2 (d)
analysis (at p. 139):

 

The
issue is not whether it is permissible for one person to pay another for sex,
but whether one is guaranteed the right to impede the flow of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic for the purposes of entering into that form of association.

 

In sum, it
is the appellant's submission that ""[t]he scope of the freedom rests on a
much higher plane"", and that s. 2 (d) of the Charter  has
nothing to do with s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Code.

 

    In
reply, the respondent argues that s. 195.1(1)(c)
prohibits individuals with a mutual desire to engage in prostitution from
making contact with each other through communication in a public place.  The
provision thereby attacks an individual's underlying motive or rationale for
being in association with another individual.  Sexual activity is not
prohibited, and it is argued, therefore, that the scope of s. 2 (d) must
be wide enough to protect the association of individuals for the purpose of
engaging in sexual relations.  

 

    In Reference
re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.), [1987] 1 S.C.R.
313, this Court undertook a full review of the historical origins and
constitutional scope of freedom of association.  I find it unnecessary to
repeat here the purposes and meaning of the s. 2 (d) Charter 
guarantee explored in the judgments in that case.  I will only say that the
offer of a service by a prostitute, or the request for that service by the
prostitute's customer clearly falls beyond the ambit of any definition of
freedom of association considered in Reference re Public
Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.)  In the context of
the impugned legislation which criminalizes street solicitation for the
purposes of prostitution, I intend to avoid any unnecessary delineation of the
scope of freedom of association.

 

    I am
unable to find any persuasive argument presented before this Court for finding
that the respondent's s. 2 (d) freedom is infringed by the impugned legislative
provision.  The starting point for an assessment of the s. 2 (d)
challenge in this case is an inquiry into the essence of the offence.  The
nature of the activity to which the legislation is directed is communicating in
a public place for the purposes of engaging in prostitution.  It is of course
true that such communication or solicitation is aimed at either a prostitute or
a potential customer and that the expressive activity is meant to lead to an
exchange of sex for money.  That exchange or sale requires the involvement of
another party, and contemplates as the final objective the
""association"" of the individuals in some form of sexual activity.

 

    The
target of the impugned legislation, however, is expressive conduct.  In
proscribing street solicitation for the purposes of prostitution, the 
provision attacks expressive activity of a commercial nature.  It focuses on
the prostitute or customer who stops or communicates with another person in a
public place for the purposes of engaging in prostitution.  In contrast, it
does not attack conduct of an associational nature.  In answer to the
respondent's assertion that such an attack is to be found in the legislation's
interference with an agreement between two individuals for the exchange of sex
for money and with sexual relations between consenting individuals, I fail to
find that the impugned provision directly proscribes either activity.  I find
it unnecessary to decide whether the exercise of either activity would be
protected by s. 2 (d) if it were to be the target of the legislation.

 

    The
Attorney General of Canada makes the following submission with which I am in
agreement:

 

    The
Respondent asserts that s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal Code 
infringes the freedom of association since it prohibits individuals ""from
making contact with others through words, acts, gestures, or mere presence in
public places"".  It is respectfully submitted that the challenged
provision does not, on any rational construction, purport to reach ""mere
presence in public"", and that the gravamen of the complaint is therefore
that s. 195.1(1) (c) interferes with communications by word or deed.  That is an
issue which falls squarely under the guarantee of freedom of expression in s.
2 (b) of the Charter  and which ought appropriately to be resolved there.

 

    It
might be said that as the limitation on freedom of expression to be found in s.
195.1(1) (c) also has the effect of limiting association, the
impugned section should be held to violate s. 2 (d) as
well as s. 2 (b).  In my view, however, an analysis of the effects of
s. 195.1(1) (c) on freedom of association does not advance the
respondent's case.  Most limitations on expression have the effect of limiting
the possibilities for human association.  It is certainly the case that all
limitations on commercial expression will have the effect of limiting the
possibilities for commercial transactions.  I do not find convincing the
argument that freedom of association is infringed by s. 195.1(1) (c) because
that provision has the effect of making it more difficult for individuals to
transact commercial bargains for the sale of sex.  The mere fact that an
impugned legislative provision limits the possibility of commercial activities
or agreements is not, in my view, sufficient to show a prima
facie interference with the s. 2 (d)
guarantee of freedom of association.  The primary focus of the constitutional
challenge advanced in this case was on the s. 2 (b)
guarantee of freedom of expression and in my view, given the nature of the
impugned legislative provision, the respondent must succeed or fail on the
basis of the s. 2 (b) challenge.

 

    I
conclude that s. 195.1(1) (c) does not constitute a prima facie
infringement of the s. 2 (d) freedom of association guaranteed by the Charter .  I
emphasize the fact that I come to this conclusion based on the characteristics
of the specific legislative provision being challenged here and the nature of
the proscribed activity.  As this Court has made clear many times, the scope of
any Charter  guarantee must be delineated on a case-by-case basis.

 

    This
Court has found that the impugned provision does constitute a prima
facie infringement of s. 2 (b)
freedom of expression for the reasons given in Reference re ss. 193
and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.)  In my reasons in
that Reference, I found that infringement to be justifiable under s. 1 , and I
adopt those reasons and conclusion in this appeal.

 

    I
would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Appeal Division
of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and restore the conviction entered and
sentence imposed by the Provincial Court judge.

 

    I
would answer the constitutional questions as follows:

 

Question                      1.Does
s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, as amended, infringe the freedom of expression guaranteed by s.
2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer                            Yes.

 

Question                      2.Does
s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, as amended, infringe the freedom of association guaranteed by s.
2 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer                                 No.

 

Question                      3.If
s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code 
infringes rights guaranteed by s. 2 (b) or s.
2 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is s.
195.1(1) (c) justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

AnswerYes, as pertains to the infringement
of s. 2 (b).  There is no need to answer this question with
respect to s. 2 (d).

 

//Lamer J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    LAMER J. --
This appeal deals mainly with similar issues as those raised in the companion
cases of Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 000, and  R. v. Stagnitta, [1990]
1 S.C.R. 000, released concurrently.  In short, this appeal deals specifically
with s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, and whether it restricts freedom of expression and association
as guaranteed by s. 2 (b) and (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  I set out the constitutional
questions stated for this appeal by order of the Chief Justice:

 

1.Does s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, as amended, infringe the freedom
of expression guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.Does s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, as amended, infringe the freedom
of association guaranteed by s. 2 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

3.If s.
195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code 
infringes rights guaranteed by s. 2 (b) or s.
2 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is s.
195.1(1) (c) justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    The
Chief Justice has set out the facts and procedural history of this appeal and I
need not, therefore, repeat them here.  For the reasons I have given in Reference
re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), supra, I am
of the view that s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  does restrict freedom of expression protected by s. 2 (b) of the Charter , but
that the legislation is a reasonable and demonstrably justified limit on that
freedom under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

 

    There
remains then, the issue of whether the impugned section of the Criminal
Code  restricts freedom of association as guaranteed by s. 2 (d) of the Charter .  In
this regard, I am in agreement with the analysis of the Chief Justice in his
reasons for judgment in this appeal.

 

    I
would, accordingly, answer the constitutional questions as follows:

 

1. Yes.

 

    2.                     No.

 

3. Yes, the restriction on s. 2 (b) of the Charter  is
justified by s. 1 .  The question does not have to be answered in respect
of s. 2 (d) of the Charter .

 

    Therefore,
the appeal is allowed.

 

//Wilson J.//

 

    The
reasons of Wilson and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. were delivered by

 

    WILSON J.
(dissenting) -- For the reasons set out in my judgment in Reference
re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 000, it is my view that s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, infringes the right to freedom
of expression guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and is not saved by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    I
have had the benefit of reading the Chief Justice's reasons with respect to
whether s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Code also infringes the
right to freedom of association guaranteed by s. 2 (d) of the Charter .  The
Chief Justice concludes that it does not.  In his view, the provision does not
interfere with conduct of an associational nature; it focuses rather on
communication between the prostitute and the potential customer.  I cannot
agree with the Chief Justice.  I cannot see these as mutually exclusive and
believe that the same conduct can constitute an infringement of both sections. 
Nor do I think that the Chief Justice's conclusion is mandated by the majority
decision in Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.), [1987]
1 S.C.R. 313.

 

Freedom
of Association

 

    In Reference
re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.), supra,
McIntyre J. had occasion to review several approaches to freedom of
association. After rejecting a number of them he stated at p. 406:

 

    The
purpose of freedom of association is to ensure that various goals may be
pursued in common as well as individually. Freedom of association is not
concerned with the particular activities or goals themselves; it is concerned
with how activities or goals may be pursued. [Emphasis added.]

 

He went
on to observe at p. 407:

 

                            Of
the remaining approaches, it must surely be accepted that the concept of
freedom of association includes at least the right to join with others
in lawful, common pursuits and to establish and maintain organizations
and associations as set out in the first approach. This is essentially the
freedom of association enjoyed prior to the adoption of the Charter . It is,
I believe, equally clear that, in accordance with the second approach, freedom
of association should guarantee the collective exercise of constitutional
rights. Individual rights protected by the Constitution do not lose that
protection when exercised in common with others. People must be free to engage
collectively in those activities which are constitutionally protected for each
individual. [Emphasis added.]

 

    Le
Dain J. (Beetz and La Forest JJ. concurring) agreed with McIntyre J.'s
disposition of the appeal, stating at p. 391:

 

    Freedom
of association is particularly important for the exercise of other fundamental
freedoms, such as freedom of expression and freedom of conscience and religion.

 

    In
my view, McIntyre and Le Dain JJ.'s observations stand for at least three
propositions.  First, a purposive reading of s. 2 (d)
entails that at the very least freedom of association protects a person's right
to join with others in lawful common pursuits.  The right to freedom of
association is in no way limited to the right to create and belong to an
association.  A large and liberal interpretation of the provision requires that
it be read so as to protect a person's ability to associate with others
regardless of whether or not the association is taking place with a view to
forming an ""association"" in the technical sense.

 

    Second,
in deciding whether a given activity is protected by s. 2 (d) of the Charter , the
focus must be on whether one person seeks to associate with another, not on the
nature of the activities or goals that they wish to pursue in common.  The
actual activities the individuals wish to pursue in common are not, according
to the majority in that case, protected by s. 2 (d).  Only
the coming together is protected.  In this respect McIntyre J.'s observations
are consistent with the approach this Court has taken to other freedoms
embodied in s. 2  of the Charter .  Just as this Court made clear in Irwin Toy
Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, at p. 969, that
it could not ""exclude human activity from the scope of guaranteed free
expression on the basis of the content or meaning being conveyed"", so too
it is important not to exclude human activity from the scope of guaranteed free
association on the basis of the purpose for which the parties seek to
associate.

 

    Third,
freedom of association will, as Le Dain J. pointed out, often be of importance
precisely because it is integrally linked to a person's ability to exercise
other constitutionally protected rights.  In a wide range of instances the
freedoms guaranteed in s. 2  of the Charter  would be of little
value if one could not engage in them with others.  For example, a person's
right to freedom of expression would be of little value if the state could
control those with whom that person could communicate.  If, as this Court
suggested in Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, [1985]
1 S.C.R. 721, at p. 744, language and expression are important because they
bridge the gap between isolation and community, then a right that protects
expressive activity would be of little value if the state could deprive a
person of the community with which he or she wishes to communicate.  In many
instances, the freedoms enshrined in s. 2  of the Charter , while
separate and distinct, will be mutually reinforcing.

 

    In
the context of this appeal, the most basic aspect of the right to freedom of
association is engaged, namely the ability of one person to associate with
another for the pursuit of a common goal.  While the Chief Justice perceives
the proposed sexual activity between the prostitute and his or her customer as
the association in issue, it is my view that the association we should be
addressing is the association of the parties to discuss the possibility of
providing or obtaining a sexual service.  The parties may never in fact engage
in sexual activity.  They will nonetheless have associated in order to pursue a
common goal, namely to negotiate a commercial transaction.  I believe that a provision
which prohibits parties from associating with a view to pursuing a lawful
common objective infringes s. 2 (d) of the Charter ,
whether that objective is entry into a commercial transaction or some other
lawful objective.

 

    I
see no reason for excluding associational activity with a commercial purpose
from the ambit of the term ""association"" in s. 2 (d) of the Charter .  If we
are to treat seriously McIntyre J.'s observation that in considering whether or
not a given activity is protected under s. 2 (d) we
must have regard to how that activity is pursued (i.e. in that case by means of
association through the union) rather than to the nature of the activity (i.e.
in that case collective bargaining), then it is important to recognize that a
prostitute and his or her customer associate when they meet to discuss the sale
of sex.  That meeting is the form their association takes and, according to
McIntyre J., this is what s. 2 (d) protects, not the
activity in which they intend to engage thereafter.  The prostitute or customer
who relies on s. 2 (d) of the Charter  is not claiming
that prostitution is constitutionally protected by this provision. He or she is
simply advancing the proposition that, so long as it remains lawful to sell sex
for money, there is a right to associate with others, i.e. potential customers,
in order to reach an agreement for this purpose.

 

    In
other words, it is the fact that the parties to this transaction associate that
is relevant to a s. 2 (d) analysis, not the fact that the reason for which they
associate is to effect a commercial transaction in which sex is ultimately
exchanged for money.  This Court made clear in Ford v. Quebec
(Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 712, at pp. 766-67, that given
""the earlier pronouncements of this Court to the effect that the rights
and freedoms guaranteed in the Canadian Charter  should
be given a large and liberal interpretation, there is no sound basis on which
commercial expression can be excluded from the protection of s. 2 (b) of the Charter "".
It seems to me that this logic also holds good for s. 2 (d) of the Charter . Just
as this Court was not prepared to make a moral judgment on the expressive
activity in deciding whether or not it was protected by s. 2 (b) of the Charter , so too
it should avoid the temptation to make a moral judgment in deciding whether or
not associational activity is protected by s. 2 (d).

 

    I
turn now to consider whether s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Code
violates s. 2 (d) of the Charter .

 

Is the Purpose or Effect of s. 195.1(1)(c) to
Restrict Freedom of Association?

 

    With
great respect to the Chief Justice, the possibility that legislation violates
more than one section of the Charter  is a real one even although its
""target"" appears to be more specifically directed to conduct dealt
with in one section.  The legislature may have intended to restrict only one
constitutionally protected right but its legislation may in fact have the
effect of restricting two Charter  rights.  One must look to both
purpose and effect.  The Chief Justice has affirmed this on a number of
occasions.  In R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R.
295, Dickson J. (as he then was) observed at p. 331:

 

    In
my view, both purpose and effect are relevant in determining constitutionality;
either an unconstitutional purpose or an unconstitutional effect can invalidate
legislation.

 

And at
p. 334 he said:

 

    Thus,
if a law with a valid purpose interferes by its impact, with rights or
freedoms, a litigant could still argue the effects of the legislation as a
means to defeat its applicability and possibly its validity.

 

The
Chief Justice, Lamer J. and I reiterated these observations in Irwin Toy
Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), supra, at p.
976.  Dealing with s. 2 (b) of the Charter , we said:

 

                            Even
if the government's purpose was not to control or restrict attempts to convey a
meaning, the Court must still decide whether the effect of the government
action was to restrict the plaintiff's free expression. Here, the burden is on
the plaintiff to demonstrate that such an effect occurred. In order so to
demonstrate, a plaintiff must state her claim with reference to the principles
and values underlying the freedom.

 

    In
my view, Dickson J.'s observations in Big M Drug Mart Ltd. are as
relevant to an analysis of s. 2 (d) of the Charter  as they
were to the analysis of s. 2 (b) advanced in Irwin Toy.  Thus,
the Court must first consider whether the purpose of the impugned provision is
to restrict freedom of association.  If it concludes that the government's
purpose was not to restrict freedom of association, then it must still decide
whether the effect of the legislation is to restrict freedom of association.

 

a. Purpose

 

    In
my view, it is far from obvious that the impugned provision does not seek to
prohibit certain kinds of associational activity as well as certain kinds of
expressive activity.  Section 195.1(1)(c) of the Code states:

 

                            195.1 (1)
Every person who in a public place or in any place open to public view

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

    (c) stops or attempts to stop any person or
in any manner communicates or attempts to communicate with any person

 

    for
the purpose of engaging in prostitution or of obtaining the sexual services of
a prostitute is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.
[Emphasis added.]

 

The
provision is not limited to prohibiting expressive activity. It also seeks to
prohibit efforts to stop someone in a public place for the purpose of
negotiating a purchase or sale of sexual services.  It interferes directly with
a prostitute's ability to associate with potential customers and vice versa. 
Thus, in addressing the social nuisance that arises from the public display of
the sale of sex, the legislature has chosen to prohibit both meetings between
prostitutes and potential customers and communications between prostitutes and
potential customers.  They can neither associate with each other or talk to
each other in a public place or a place open to public view.  No doubt the
legislature adopted this two‑pronged approach in the belief that this would
prove effective in bringing to an end the social nuisance arising from the
public display of the sale of sex.  Indeed, given that the legislature was
concerned to deal with the social nuisance accompanying the concentration of
street solicitation, it is not altogether surprising that the legislature would
seek to prevent prostitutes and potential customers from associating in public
places as well as making their ""deals"" in public places.  But the end
result in my opinion is that the provision not only infringes the right to
freedom of expression, it also infringes the right to freedom of association.

 

b. Effect

 

    However,
if I am in error in thinking that the legislature's purpose was to restrict
freedom of association as well as freedom of expression, I believe that this is
its effect.  In limiting the circumstances in which a prostitute may
communicate with a potential customer to situations in which they are not in a
public place or a place open to public view, the impugned provision has the
effect of placing serious restrictions on their freedom to associate.  As
section 195.1(2) makes clear, persons who wish to meet in order to discuss the
sale of sexual services are not only excluded from any public place or place
open to public view, they may not get together in ""any place to which the
public have access as of right or by invitation, express or implied, and any
motor vehicle located in a public place or in any place open to public
view"".

 

    While
it would be my view that one of the purposes of s. 195.1(1)(c) is to
restrict the circumstances in which prostitute and potential customer may meet
or associate with a view to negotiating a sale of sexual services, even if that
is not its purpose it clearly in my view is its effect.  As a result, s.
195.1(1)(c) infringes the right to freedom of association and must
be justified, if it is to survive the Charter 
challenge, as a reasonable limit under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

Section
1  of the Charter 

 

    In Reference
re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), supra, I
emphasized that in assessing whether legislation constitutes a reasonable limit
that is justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter  one
must always have regard to the right that has been violated.  It is therefore
important that the government justify the infringement of s. 2 (d) of the Charter  as well
as its infringement of s. 2 (b).

 

    In
this case, however, the appellant and each of the Attorneys General made the
same submissions in support of s. 195.1(1)(c) as a
reasonable limit on s. 2 (d) as they made in its support as a reasonable limit on
s. 2 (b).

 

    I
agree that the nuisance caused by street solicitation, at least in the major
centres of population in Canada, is a pressing and substantial concern that
satisfies the first branch of the test set out in  R. v. Oakes, [1986]
1 S.C.R. 103.  Also I agree that s. 195.1(1)(c) is
rationally connected to the prevention of the nuisance.  As I observed in Reference
re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), supra,
""[t]he logical way to prevent the public display of the sale of sex and
any harmful consequences that flow from it is through the twofold step of
prohibiting the prostitute from soliciting prospective customers in places open
to public view and prohibiting the customer from propositioning the prostitute
likewise in places open to public view"" (p. 000).

 

    This
brings us to the test of proportionality. The question here is whether it is
reasonable and justifiable to limit freedom of association in the manner that
s. 195.1(1)(c) has done in order to deal with the nuisance caused by
street solicitation.  In my view, it is not. Section 195.1(1)(c)
prevents a prostitute and potential customer from associating in a wide range
of circumstances in which no nuisance will result from their meeting together.
Because of the remarkably expansive meaning given to ""public place""
in s. 195.1(2) of the Code, the proscribed meeting will
constitute a criminal offence even although it takes place in a secluded area
where there is no one present to see it let alone be offended by it.  In my
view, it is not reasonable to prohibit associational activity that harms no one
on the basis that in some circumstances and in some areas a high concentration
of that activity may give rise to a public or social nuisance. If such activity
is to be prohibited, there must be a much closer nexus between the
associational activity that is prohibited and the nuisance to which it is
alleged to give rise.  The section is simply too broad.  The Crown, in my view,
should have to show as a minimum that the associational activity in a given
case is likely to give rise to the undesired consequences.  As it stands, s.
195.1(1)(c) fails to meet the proportionality test set out in Oakes.

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal.  I would answer the constitutional questions as
follows:

 

Question1.Does
s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, 
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, as amended, infringe the freedom of expression
guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

AnswerYes.

 

Question2.Does
s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, as amended, infringe the freedom of association guaranteed by s.
2 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

AnswerYes.

 

Question3.If s.
195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code 
infringes rights guaranteed by s. 2 (b) or s.
2 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is s.
195.1(1) (c) justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

AnswerNo.

C.J. and La Forest and Sopinka JJ.:  For the reasons given by the Chief Justice
in Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.),
s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Code infringes
s. 2 (b) of the Charter  but is justifiable
under s. 1  of the Charter .  Section 195.1(1) (c) does
not infringe s. 7  of the Charter  on the grounds of
vagueness or uncertainty.

 

    Per Lamer
J.:  For the reasons I gave in Reference re ss. 193 and
195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Code
infringes s. 2 (b) of the Charter  but is justifiable
under s. 1  of the Charter .  Section 195.1(1) (c) does
not infringe s. 7  of the Charter  on the grounds of
vagueness or incertainty.

 

    Per Wilson
and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ. (dissenting):  For the reasons given by the
minority in Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the
Criminal Code (Man.), s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Code
infringes on the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Charter  and
cannot be saved by s. 1  of the Charter .  Section
195.1(1) (c) does not infringe the right contained in s. 7  of
the Charter  on the ground that it is so vague as to violate the
requirement that the criminal law be clear.  Nonetheless, the impugned
provision infringes the s. 7  right to liberty in a manner which is not in
accord with the principles of fundamental justice.  This infringement cannot be
justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

//The Chief
Justice//

 

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and La Forest and Sopinka JJ. was delivered by

 

    The
Chief Justice -- The appellant, Lina Maria Stagnitta, was charged that she:

 

. . . on
or about the 9th day of May, A.D. 1986, at or near the City of Edmonton, in the
Province of Alberta, did unlawfully attempt to communicate with Dave PYKE in a
public place for the purpose of engaging in prostitution, contrary to section
195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal Code .

 

    Section
195.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, reads as follows:

 

    195.1  (1) Every person who in a public
place or in any place open to public view

 

(a)stops or attempts to stop any motor vehicle,

 

(b)impedes the free flow of pedestrian or vehicular
traffic or ingress to or egress from premises adjacent to that place, or

 

(c)stops or attempts to stop any person or in any manner
communicates or attempts to communicate with any person

 

for the purpose of engaging in prostitution or of
obtaining the sexual services of a prostitute is guilty of an offence
punishable on summary conviction.

 

    (2) 
In this section, ""public place"" includes any place to which the
public have access as of right or by invitation, express or implied, and any
motor vehicle located in a public place or in any place open to public view.

 

    According
to the agreed statement of facts, Detective Dave Pyke of the Edmonton City
Police Department was driving along the west curb of 104th Street north of
Jasper Avenue in Edmonton on the 9th of May, 1986 at 10:40 p.m.  He was acting
in an undercover capacity.  He stopped his car and the appellant, Ms.
Stagnitta, walked north on the sidewalk twenty feet past his car, turned around
and walked back.  The Detective opened the passenger window of his car and the
appellant leaned in.

 

    The
appellant asked Detective Pyke whether he was a police officer and he replied
that he was not.  The two discussed briefly the possibility that the Detective
worked for the Edmonton City Police.  After Detective Pyke commented that there
were too many police cars around, the appellant got into the Detective's car. 
The conversation continued and the Detective eventually told the appellant,
""Okay, I'm the Chief of Police"".  The appellant told the Detective
that she would ""[s]how him a good time"" and, with her left hand,
grabbed his private parts.

 

    The
appellant asked the Detective, ""How much money do you have?"", to
which the Detective replied that he had $500.  She said, ""Okay, let's
go"", and the Detective said that he had a hotel room.  The Detective asked
what he would get for his money to which the appellant responded, ""A good
time"".

 

    The
Detective indicated that he would like to drive around and think about it, and
shortly thereafter, the appellant was arrested and charged.

 

    The
appellant challenged the constitutionality of s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  as her defence.  She was acquitted in Alberta
Provincial Court.  The court found that s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  infringed freedom of expression as defined in s. 2 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and that it was not saved by s. 1  of
the Charter .

 

    Section
2  of the Charter  guarantees that everyone has, among
others, the following fundamental freedom:

 

    2.  . . .

 

(b)
freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the
press and other media of communication;

 

    Section
1  of the Charter  provides that:

 

    1.  The Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms
set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can
be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

    The
Alberta Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by the respondent.  The appellant's
acquittal was quashed, a conviction was entered, and the appellant was
sentenced to a fine of $100 and, in default, to one day imprisonment:  (1987),
54 Alta. L.R. (2d) 1.  The court found that s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  was inconsistent with s. 2 (b) of the Charter , but
that it was demonstrably justified according to s. 1 .  This Court granted leave
to appeal that decision, [1987] 2 S.C.R. x.

 

    The
appeal was heard together with Reference re ss. 193 and 195(1)(c) of
the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 000, and R. v. Skinner, [1990]
1 S.C.R. 000.  The appellant Stagnitta challenges s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  as constituting a violation of ss. 2 (b) and 7 
of the Charter .

 

    In
my view, this appeal fails for the reasons I have set out in detail in Reference
re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), supra.

 

    The
constitutional questions to be answered are the following:

 

1.Does s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code  infringe or deny the right of freedom of expression
guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.Does s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code  infringe or deny the right guaranteed by s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  on the grounds of vagueness or
uncertainty?

 

3.If the
answer to either Questions 1 and 2 is yes, is s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    I
would answer these questions as follows:

 

1. Yes

 

2. No

 

3. Yes

 

    I
would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

 

//Lamer J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    Lamer
J. -- This appeal was heard together with two other cases, Reference
re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 000, and R. v. Skinner, [1990] 1 S.C.R.
000, judgments which were rendered this day.  The case at bar deals with
somewhat narrower issues in that only s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, and ss. 2 (b) and 7 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  are under
consideration.  Kerans J.A. for the Court of Appeal for Alberta concluded that
the impugned section restricts freedom of expression under s. 2 (b) of the Charter .  He
then went on to consider whether the section could be saved by s. 1  of the Charter . 
Kerans J.A. held that Parliament can, with the intention of preventing a
nuisance, forbid any act which it demonstrated on sound evidence to be an
essential pre-requisite to the nuisance, and where it was shown that a nuisance
is a very likely consequence of the act.  He concluded, therefore, that the
restriction imposed by s. 195.1(1) (c) is a
reasonable and justified limit:  (1987), 54 Alta. L.R. (2d) 1.

 

    The
following constitutional questions were stated by the Chief Justice on November
2, 1987:

 

1.Does s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code  infringe or deny the right of freedom of expression
guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

    2.Does s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code  infringe or deny the right guaranteed by s. 7  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  on the grounds of
vagueness or uncertainty?

 

    3.If
the answer to either Questions 1 and 2 is yes is s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    These
issues have received full consideration in Reference re
ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), supra, and
therefore I need not repeat the analysis here, except to state that my reasons
are equally applicable to this appeal.  Therefore I would answer the
constitutional questions as follows:

 

    1.                     Yes

 

    2.                     No

 

    3.                     Yes

 

    The
appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.

 

//Wilson J.//

 

    The
reasons of Wilson and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. were delivered by

 

    Wilson
J. (dissenting) -- For the reasons set out in my judgment in Reference
re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 000, it is my view that s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, infringes on the right to
freedom of expression guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and cannot be saved by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    As
my reasons in the Reference make clear, it is my view that s. 195.1(1)(c) does
not infringe the right contained in s. 7  of the Charter  on the
ground that it is so vague as to violate the requirement that the criminal law
be clear.  Nonetheless, the impugned provision infringes the s. 7  right to
liberty in a manner which is not in accord with the principles of fundamental
justice.  This infringement cannot be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .  I
would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal
and restore the acquittal.

 

    I
would answer the constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code 
infringe or deny the right of freedom of expression guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.                        Yes.

 

2.Does
s. 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code 
infringe or deny the right guaranteed by s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  on the grounds of vagueness or uncertainty?

 

A.For the reasons set out in my judgment in Reference
re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.),
although s. 195.1(1)(c) is not vague or uncertain, it nevertheless infringes
s. 7  of the Charter .

 

3.If the
answer to either Questions 1 and 2 is yes, is s. 195.1(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

A.                        No.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

    Criminal
law -- Young offenders -- Alternative measures -- Ontario choosing not to
implement alternative measures programmes -- Whether s. 4 of Young
Offenders Act imposes mandatory obligation on provinces to authorize such
programmes -- Whether s. 4 intra vires Parliament -- Whether Ontario's
failure to implement alternative measures programmes infringes a young
offender's right to equality before the law under s. 15 of Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms -- Young Offenders Act, S.C. 1980‑81‑82‑83,
c. 110, ss. 3, 4.

 

    Constitutional
law -- Distribution of legislative powers -- Young Offenders Act -- Alternative
measures -- Provinces permitted under s. 4 of Young Offenders Act to
implement alternative measures programmes for young offenders -- Whether s. 4
intra vires Parliament -- Whether s. 4 encroaches upon provincial
jurisdiction over child welfare -- Whether s. 4 is unconstitutional
delegation of Parliament's authority over criminal law ‑‑ Constitution
Act, 1867 , ss. 91(27) , 92(13)  -- Young Offenders Act , S.C. 1980‑81‑82‑83,
c. 110, s. 4 .

 

    Constitutional
law -- Charter of Rights  -- Equality before the law ‑‑ Discrimination
on the basis of province of residence -- Ontario failing to implement
alternative measures programmes pursuant to s. 4 of the Young Offenders
Act -- Whether Ontario's failure to implement such programmes infringes
s. 15(1) of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms -- Whether s. 4
of the Act infringes s. 15(1) of the Charter -- Impact of s. 15(1) of
Charter on distinctions based upon province of residence in the application of
a valid federal law.

 

    The
respondent, a young offender, was charged with possession of stolen
goods.  Before he entered a plea, his counsel brought a motion alleging
that Ontario's failure to designate ""alternative measures programmes""
for the purposes of s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act
resulted in a violation of the respondent's right to equality before the law,
as guaranteed by s. 15(1)  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .  Section 4  provides that ""alternative
measures may be used to deal with a young person alleged to have
committed an offence instead of judicial proceedings under this Act only
if"" a number of conditions are met. The judge held that the Attorney
General for Ontario was under a positive duty to authorize alternative measures
programmes in the province by virtue of s. 3(1)(d) and (f) of the
Act, and that the failure to implement such programmes, which were available to
young offenders in all the other provinces, infringed the respondent's
s. 15(1)  right. He concluded that the infringement could not be justified
under s. 1  of the Charter  and dismissed the charge. Before the
Court of Appeal, the appellant submitted that s. 4 of the Act was, in pith
and substance, legislation in relation to child welfare, a matter falling
within the sphere of provincial legislative competence under s. 92(13)  of
the Constitution Act, 1867 . The court rejected this argument,
upheld the trial judge's decision on the s. 15(1)  issue and dismissed the
appeal.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be allowed.

 

(1) Section 4
of the Young Offenders Act

 

    Section
4(1) of the Act does not oblige the provinces to implement alternative measures
programmes; rather, the legislation leaves the decision to the discretion of
each province. The use of the word ""may"" in s. 4(1) and the
absence of an obligation expressed in unequivocally mandatory language lead to
that conclusion. The word ""should"" in s. 3(1)(d) of the
Act, which states that ""taking measures other than judicial proceedings
under this Act should be considered for dealing with young
persons who have committed offences"", does not provide evidence of a
mandatory duty.  In the context of s. 3(1)(d), the
word ""should"" denotes simply a ""desire or request"" and not
a legal obligation.  Section 4(1) thus gives to the provincial Attorneys
General a power, but not a duty, to develop and implement alternative measures
programmes.

 

(2) Section
91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867

 

    Section
4 of the Act is intra vires Parliament. The
Act as a whole is valid criminal law.  It addresses the commission of offences
contrary to the Criminal Code  and other federal
criminal law statutes.  While s. 4(1) differs from most criminal law
remedial statutes in that the focus is on alternatives to more traditional
criminal sanctions, the federal legislative power over criminal law is sufficiently
flexible to recognize new developments in methods of dealing with
offenders.  Indeed, Parliament's jurisdiction under s. 91(27)  of the
Constitution Act, 1867  extends beyond the confines of creating offences and
establishing penalties.  The discretion to create an alternative measures
programme pursuant to s. 4  represents a legitimate attempt to deter young
offenders from continued criminal activity.  There is a concern with preventing
recidivism and with balancing the interests of the offending `young person'
with those of society.  Section 4 , therefore, was a valid exercise of
Parliament's legislative authority under s. 91(27) .

 

    Section
4 of the Act is not an unconstitutional delegation of Parliament's authority
over criminal law and procedure.  There is no limitation imposed by the
Constitution Act, 1867  on Parliament's ability to leave the implementation of
alternative measures programmes to the discretion of the provincial Attorneys
General. The provinces have accepted a delegation of responsibility from
Parliament in respect of prosecutions, including the prosecution of young
offenders (s. 2  of the Criminal Code  and s. 2(4)
of the Act).  The discretion to establish alternative measures programmes is
clearly incidental to that legitimate delegation.

 

(3) Section 15
of the Charter

 

    Since
s. 4 of the Act does not impose a mandatory duty on the province to
establish alternative measures programmes, the Attorney General for Ontario's
decision not to authorize such programmes cannot contravene the respondent's
equality rights under s. 15(1)  of the Charter .  His
decision was made in accordance with the permissive terms of s. 4 .  That
section, and not the discretionary determination made by the Attorney General
pursuant to its provisions, constitutes ""the law"" for the purposes of
a s. 15  challenge. Further, once it is determined that there is no duty on
the Attorney General for Ontario to implement alternative measures programmes,
the non‑exercise of discretion cannot be constitutionally attacked simply
because it creates differences among provinces.  To find otherwise would
potentially open to Charter  scrutiny every jurisdictionally
permissible exercise of power by a province, solely on the basis that it
creates a distinction in how individuals are treated in different
provinces.  The constitutionality of s. 4 , in terms of compliance
with the Charter , was not in issue in this appeal.

 

    The
outcome of this appeal would be no different had s. 4 been challenged
directly.  As a result of the discretion granted by Parliament to the
provincial Attorneys General, alternative measures programmes were available to
young offenders in all the provinces of Canada except Ontario. The absence of
this benefit in that province must be considered a legal disadvantage imposed
upon young offenders resident in Ontario. However, while the respondent has
established that he was not receiving equal treatment before and under the law
or that the law has a differential impact on him in the protection or benefit
accorded by law, he did not establish that s. 4 was discriminatory. In a
federal system of government, the values underlying s. 15(1)  cannot be
given unlimited scope.  The division of powers not only permits differential
treatment based upon province of residence, it mandates and encourages
geographical distinction.  Unequal treatment which stems solely from the
exercise, by provincial legislators, of their legitimate jurisdictional powers
cannot be the subject of a s. 15(1)  challenge on the basis only that it
creates distinctions based upon province of residence.  A case‑by‑case
approach is appropriate to determine whether province-based distinctions which
arise from the application of federal law contravene s. 15(1) .  Here, the
legislation does not amount to a distinction which is based upon a
""personal characteristic"" for the purposes of s. 15(1)  of the Charter .
Differential application of federal law can be a legitimate means of forwarding
the values of a federal system, especially in the context of the administration
of the criminal law, where differential application is constitutionally
fostered by ss. 91(27)  and 92(14)  of the Constitution Act,
1867 .  The area of criminal law and its application is one
in which the balancing of national interests and local concerns has been
accomplished by a constitutional structure that both permits and encourages
federal‑provincial cooperation. Further, although s. 4 of the Act is
valid federal law, it is not wholly unconnected to child welfare -- a matter of
provincial jurisdiction.  Differential application of the law through federal‑provincial
cooperation is a legitimate means whereby governments can overcome the rigidity
of the ""watertight compartments"" of the distribution of powers with
respect to matters that are not easily categorized or dealt with by one level
of government alone.

c. 110 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. Y‑1 ).

 

The
Legislation

 

Young
Offenders Act

 

    The
provisions of the Young Offenders Act relevant to this
appeal, as they stood at the time of the events in issue, are as follows:

 

                       INTERPRETATION

 

    2.  (1) In this Act,

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

""alternative measures"" means measures other
than judicial proceedings under this Act used to deal with a young person
alleged to have committed an offence;

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

                            (4)
Unless otherwise provided, words and expressions used in this Act have the same
meaning as in the Criminal Code .

 

                  DECLARATION
OF PRINCIPLE

 

    3. (1) It is hereby recognized and
declared that

 

(a) while young persons should not in all instances be
held accountable in the same manner or suffer the same consequences for their
behaviour as adults, young persons who commit offences should nonetheless bear
responsibility for their contraventions;

 

(b) society must, although it has the responsibility to
take reasonable measures to prevent criminal conduct by young persons, be
afforded the necessary protection from illegal behaviour;

 

(c) young persons who commit offences require supervision,
discipline and control, but, because of their state of dependency and level of
development and maturity, they also have special needs and require guidance and
assistance;

 

(d) where it is not inconsistent with the protection of
society, taking no measures or taking measures other than judicial proceedings
under this Act should be considered for dealing with young persons who have
committed offences;

 

(e) young persons have rights and freedoms in their own
rights, including those stated in the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  or in the Canadian Bill of Rights, and in
particular a right to be heard in the course of, and to participate in, the
processes that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons should
have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms;

 

(f) in the application of this Act, the rights and
freedoms of young persons include a right to the least possible interference
with freedom that is consistent with the protection of society, having regard
to the needs of young persons and the interests of their families;

 

(g) young persons have the right, in every instance where
they have rights of freedoms that may be affected by this Act, to be informed
as to what those rights and freedoms are; and

 

(h) parents have responsibility for the care and supervision
of their children, and, for that reason, young persons should be removed from
parental supervision either partly or entirely only when measures that provide
for continuing parental supervision are inappropriate.

 

    (2)
This Act shall be liberally construed to the end that young persons will be
dealt with in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1).

 

                    ALTERNATIVE
MEASURES

 

    4. (1) Alternative measures may be used
to deal with a young person alleged to have committed an offence instead of judicial
proceedings under this Act only if

 

(a) the measures are part of a program of alternative
measures authorized by the Attorney General or his delegate or authorized by a
person, or a person within a class of persons, designated by the Lieutenant
Governor in Council of a province;

 

(b) the person who is considering whether to use such
measures is satisfied that they would be appropriate, having regard to the
needs of the young person and the interests of society;

 

(c) the young person, having been informed of the
alternative measures, fully and freely consents to participate therein;

 

(d) the young person has, before consenting to participate
in the alternative measures, been advised of his right to be represented by
counsel and been given a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel;

 

(e) the young person accepts responsibility for the act or
omission that forms the basis of the offence that he is alleged to have
committed;

 

(f) there is, in the opinion of the Attorney General or
his agent, sufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution of the offence;
and

 

(g) the
prosecution of the offence is not in any way barred at law.

relevant to this appeal are as follows:

 

    15. (1) Every individual is equal before
and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit
of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination
based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental
or physical disability.

 

    (2)
Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its
object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups
including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic
origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.

 

The
Facts

 

    On
February 24, 1986, the respondent Sheldon S., who was then 14 years of age,
appeared before Judge D. A. Bean of the Ontario Provincial Court (Family Division)
at Toronto and was arraigned on a charge which alleged that he:

 

. . . on
or about the 23rd day of September in the year 1985 at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York unlawfully did have in
his possession property to wit:  four shirts and two sweaters, of a value
exceeding two hundred dollars, knowing that all of the property was obtained by
the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment, contrary to
the Criminal Code .

 

    Before
a plea was entered, counsel for the respondent indicated that he wished to
bring a motion alleging that the failure of the Lieutenant Governor in Council
for the province of Ontario to designate ""alternative measures
programs"" for the purposes of s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act
resulted in a violation of the respondent's equality rights, as guaranteed by
s. 15  of the Charter .  Counsel for the respondent
indicated that the remedy sought was an order pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter  staying
the proceedings or dismissing the charge.

 

The
Judgments Below

 

The
Judgment at First Instance

 

    The
motion was heard on April 18, 1986.   It was agreed that the respondent had not
been considered for an alternative measures program.  On August 11, 1986, Judge
Bean delivered his reasons and ordered that the charge be dismissed.  He
defined the issue in this manner:

 

. . .
are the young person's rights in accordance with Section 15  infringed or
denied, because the Attorney General for Ontario or Lieutenant Governor in
Council for Ontario has not authorized alternative measures pursuant to Section
4(1) (a) of the Young Offenders Act, and therefore this young person cannot be
considered for alternative measures under Section 3(1) (d) of the Young
Offenders Act .

 

The judge
held that no programs of alternative measures were in operation for which the
respondent could be considered.  Had the Attorney General for Ontario or the
Lieutenant Governor in Council authorized such a program, the judge found on
the evidence that the respondent could have been considered for alternative
measures.  Furthermore, it was found that the failure to implement an
alternative measures program could be traced to two factors:

 

. . . I
further find on the evidence before me that the reasons why the Attorney
General has not authorized programs in Ontario are; firstly, that the
philosophy of the Attorney General and his Ministry, with regard to the
dispositions and procedures of the Young Offenders Act, is in conflict with
that of the Federal Government, and in particular the Federal Ministry of
Justice, and; secondly, that the Attorney General does not wish to either
expend the public funds for or to cope with the administrative difficulties
inherent in setting up alternative measures in the Province of Ontario.

 

    Judge
Bean held that s. 3(1) (d) of the Young Offenders Act gave to
the young person a positive right to be considered for alternative measures;
the denial of that right, when such alternative measures are available in
provinces other than Ontario, denied the young person the equal protection and
equal benefit of the Young Offenders Act  based on place of
residence, and this constituted discrimination under s. 15  of the Charter . 
Furthermore, the judge held that the Attorney General for Ontario was under a
positive duty to authorize a program of alternative measures in Ontario by
virtue of s. 3(1)(d) and (f) of the Act. He
found, from the context of the Act as a whole and, in particular, from the
wording of s. 4(1) (a) that:

 

. . .
the intention of Parliament was to give the Attorney General the right to
authorize parts of a program, and by inference, not to authorize other parts of
a program.  I think, on the wording of Section 4(1) (a), the Attorney General
was not given a right by law to not authorize all parts, or to not authorize a
program at all.

 

    Because
the judge found that the failure of the Attorney General for Ontario to
implement alternative measures pursuant to his duty under the statute violated
the respondent's right under s. 15(1)  of the Charter , it was
then necessary to determine whether the infringement could be justified under
s. 1  of the Charter .  First, Judge Bean determined that
the limitation on the respondent's rights was not ""prescribed by law""
within the meaning of s. 1 :

 

The non‑authorization
is not proscribed [sic] by law; the authorization is prescribed by law.  And,
I quite frankly, do not see how one can, taking the Act as a whole and Section
4(1) (a) in particular, come to the conclusion that by the mere empowering of the
Attorney General to authorize measures which are a part of a program of
alternative measures, parliament has given the Attorney General the right, by
law, to also not authorize any program.

 

In the
alternative, the judge held that even if the limitation was prescribed by law,
it did not meet the reasonableness test of s. 1 .  This determination was
based on a number of factors:

 

In my
view, on the evidence before me, it is simply not reasonable.  The Attorney
General of Ontario has disregarded; firstly, the will of Parliament as clearly
expressed in the legislation; secondly, the experience of eight other provinces
with regard to alternative measures under this Act; thirdly, the experience of the
Province of Ontario with regard to alternative measures prior to the
introduction of the Young Offenders Act, and; fourthly, the opinion of the
Ministry of Community and Social Services of the Province . . . .

 

    The
issue of the power of Parliament to enact s. 4 of the Young
Offenders Act was not raised at trial.

 

The Court
of Appeal

 

    The
Attorney General for Ontario appealed the decision of Judge Bean to the Ontario
Court of Appeal.  The Attorney General of Canada intervened in support of the
respondent.  Before the Ontario Court of Appeal, the Attorney General for
Ontario submitted that s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act was, in
pith and substance, legislation in relation to child welfare, a matter falling
within the sphere of provincial legislative competence under s. 92(13)  of
the Constitution Act, 1867 .

 

    The
Majority

 

    The
reasons of the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal were delivered by
Tarnopolsky J.A., Krever J.A. concurring:  (1988), 63 C.R. (3d) 64, 26
O.A.C. 285, 42 C.C.C. (3d) 41, 35 C.R.R. 247 (hereinafter cited to
C.R.R.); leave to appeal to this Court granted September 30, 1988, [1988] 2
S.C.R. ix.  Tarnopolsky J.A. referred extensively to the reasons of Fauteux J.,
writing for a unanimous Supreme Court of Canada, in Attorney General of British
Columbia v. Smith, [1967] S.C.R. 702.  He found the reasons in Smith to be
applicable to the Young Offenders Act and rejected the
argument of the appellant that the Court's decision in Regional
Municipality of Peel v. MacKenzie, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 9, governed the facts
of the instant case.  Tarnopolsky J.A. saw no merit in the argument that
s. 4  of the Young Offenders Act  was in pith and
substance in relation to child welfare.  Instead, he held that s. 4  of the Young
Offenders Act  is valid criminal law and, therefore, intra
vires the Parliament of Canada.

 

    On
the Charter  issue raised by the respondent, and accepted by the
trial judge, Tarnopolsky J.A. applied a three‑step analysis to determine
whether there had been a contravention of s. 15(1)  of the Charter  (at
p. 271):

 

(1)an identification of the class of individuals who are
alleged to  be treated differently;

 

(2)a consideration of whether the class purported to be
treated  differently from another class is similarly situated to that other
class in relation to the purpose of the law; and

 

(3)a
determination as to whether the difference in treatment is  ""discriminatory""
in the sense of a pejorative or invidious or disadvantageous purpose or effect
of the law or action impugned.

 

    In
applying the first step, Tarnopolsky J.A. had little difficulty in finding a
class of individuals alleged to have been treated differently since 
""[t]he class of individuals at issue are the young persons defined in
s. 2 of the Act"" (p. 271).  With respect to the second, he found the
classes of individuals identically situated but for their province of
residence.  With respect to the third step, Tarnopolsky J.A. analyzed the
disadvantage to the class of individuals identified in order to determine
whether it was ""so unfair as to be discriminatory having regard to the
purpose and effect of the legislation"".  He found the fact that the legislation
was federal to be decisive in his determination that the treatment was
discriminatory in nature (at p. 275):

 

This is
. . . a case arising out of what the federal government clearly thought was a
reform in favour of young offenders.  Considerable time was spent trying
to convince provincial governments that diversion by way of alternative
measures was desirable both from the point of view of young persons and of
society generally.  In the final analysis, we are concerned with federal
legislation and the federal Attorney‑General has submitted a long list of
arguments which lead one to conclude that non‑implementation by any
province of the scheme set out in the Act, according to the principles
declared, would be invidious or pejorative to the extent of being
discriminatory. [Emphasis in original.]

 

    Tarnopolsky
J.A. next dealt with the question of whether the reference to designation in
s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act was mandatory or
permissive.  This analysis was undertaken in the context of the issue of what
the ""law"" is that results in a denial of equal benefit to young
persons in Ontario.  After examining the relevant statutory provisions, he
found that the discretion granted in the opening paragraph of s. 4(1)  was
in respect of each individual young person and that s. 4 ""is not the
basis of either a mandatory or a permissive delegation of power""
(p. 278).  However, upon examining the Act as a whole, and in particular,
ss. 3(1) (d), 3(1) (f) and 3(2),
Tarnopolsky J.A. found that without provincial designation of alternative
measures the purpose of the Act would be undermined (at p. 279):

 

    There
is no way that young persons can be dealt with ""in accordance with the
principles set out in (sub‑s. 3(1) )"" which is the ""Policy
for Canada with respect to young offenders"", unless there are alternative
measures programs designated under s. 4(1) (a), for
which a young person can be considered.  The learned trial judge was correct in
holding that s. 3 imposes a positive duty to authorize such
programs.  A failure to implement a legislative mandate, which results in
the kind of discriminatory or invidious inequality discussed earlier herein,
constitutes a contravention of Charter  s. 15(1) .

 

Consequently,
Tarnopolsky J.A. held that the failure of the Attorney General for Ontario to
designate alternative measures programs resulted in the respondent being denied
the equal benefit of the law as protected by s. 15(1) .

 

    The
final step in the Charter  analysis engaged in by Tarnopolsky
J.A. was a determination of whether the denial of the equal benefit of the law
amounted to a reasonable limit under s. 1  of the Charter . 
Applying the test set out by this Court in R. v. Oakes, [1986]
1  S.C.R. 103, Tarnopolsky J.A. found that the first requirement, that the
objective of the limit must be of sufficient importance to justify overriding a
constitutionally protected right, had not been met.  Alternatively, he held
that even if the objectives provided by the Attorney General for Ontario were
accepted as sufficient to justify overriding the s. 15(1)  right, the
appellant failed to meet the proportionality requirement in Oakes.

 

    On
the basis of the s. 15(1)  infringement, the majority of the Ontario Court
of Appeal held that the appropriate remedy was a declaration that until
programs of alternative measures within ss. 3 and 4 of the Act were
instituted in Ontario, action against any young person who might have qualified
and so claims, may have to be stayed.  In the instant case, the majority of the
court upheld the disposition of the trial judge that the charges against the
respondent be dismissed. The alternative remedy of a stay of proceedings until
alternative measures were introduced in the province would violate the
respondent's right under s. 11 (b) of the Charter .

 

    The
Minority

 

    Robins
J.A., in dissent, defined the issue, at p. 250, as being:

 

. . .
whether or not a young offender residing in Ontario is denied the right to the
equal protection and benefit of the law, as guaranteed by s. 15  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , because the Attorney‑General
for Ontario, unlike eight of his provincial counterparts, has not authorized a
program of alternative measures within Ontario pursuant to s. 4 of the Young
Offenders Act.

 

    He
held, first, that the Young Offenders Act does not obligate
the Attorney General for Ontario to authorize alternative measures, but rather
the legislation leaves the decision to the discretion of each province.  He
reached this conclusion on the basis of the wording of s. 4 of the Act (at
p. 255):

 

The
wording used in s. 4(1)(a) of the Act
indicates that alternative measures may be used in Ontario
to deal with a young person alleged to have committed an offence only if they
are part of a provincially authorized program.  The section does not impose or
purport to impose a positive obligation on the provinces to authorize such a
program.  Read in its grammatical or ordinary sense, s. 4(1) (a) is a
permissive enabling enactment granting powers whose exercise is optional. 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

He
referred to s. 28 of the Interpretation Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑23, which stated that the word
""may"" is to be construed as permissive, and he concluded that the
words ""only if"" signify that provincial authorization is a precondition
to the use of alternative measures.  In the opinion of Robins J.A.,
s. 3(1) and (2) provided no aid in interpreting s. 4(1)  (at
p. 256):

 

The
words of s. 4 in question are, however, plain and unambiguous; they
empower the provinces of Canada to implement alternative measures programs
within federally stipulated safeguards only if they so desire; they do not
create any obligation on the provinces to establish such programs.  If, as
stated earlier, Parliament had intended that alternative measures be made
available across Canada, it can be assumed that s. 4 would have been
framed in mandatory and not permissive terms.

 

Robins
J.A. also examined the purpose of the Act, and found no indication that the
legislation was predicated on the universality of alternative measures programs
(at pp. 256‑57):

 

In not
forcing the provinces to implement programmes and in not establishing criteria
(other than minimum safeguards) as to their nature, content and scope,
Parliament recognized that diverse conditions exist from province to province
and within the provinces themselves, and that legislation of this nature cannot
be universal in its application across Canada but must be tailored to take
regional differences into account.  The approach Parliament has adopted to this
area of the new juvenile justice system, in my opinion, is intended to
accommodate both federal and provincial interests and values as they relate to
the use of measures alternative to court proceedings in dealing with young
offenders.

 

    Robins
J.A. drew support for his interpretation of s. 4 from extrinsic evidence
introduced by the parties.  He found the comments of the then Solicitor
General of Canada, the Honourable Robert Kaplan, in the House of
Commons Debates on Second Reading of the Young Offenders Act, April
15, 1981, at p. 9309, to be of particular relevance (at p. 258):

 

    One
of the criticisms of the new law has been to the effect that the
federal government should have made diversion mandatory and more explicit.  But
the proponents of such arguments fail to recognize the importance to the young
person of having the right to plead not guilty and the role of the provinces in
the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  The use of
alternative measures, in my opinion, is better left to the discretion of
provinces which can develop programs to suit their particular circumstances. 
[Emphasis added by Robins J.A.]

 

He also
relied upon the following passage from Nicholas Bala and Heino Lilles, The Young
Offenders Act Annotated (1984), at p. 257:

 

    Alternative
measures must be part of an authorized program.  The Act does not set out
guidelines for establishing the programs; it merely provides legislative
authority for them and legislates minimum standards to safeguard the young
person's rights.  The Act permits each province to determine whether it
wishes to implement alternative measures programs, and provides flexibility for
the development of different types of programs in response to local needs,
interests and resources.  [Emphasis added by Robins J.A.]

 

He
referred to a similar observation made by Paul Rabinovitch in his paper
""Diversion Under Section 4:  Is There a Future for It in Ontario?"",
published in the Young Offenders Service (1984), at
p. 257:

 

    With
the proclamation of the Young Offenders Act in April of 1984
and the official recognition of diversion under the Alternative Measures
Provision, s. 4, it was hoped that diversion would finally become a
permanent part of the juvenile justice system for all of Canada.  The result
would be that the obstacles in the way of the growth of diversion in provinces
such as Ontario would be permanently removed.  The Young Offenders Act 
appeared to do just that, as it formally recognized diversion and gave it
official status.  The key to s. 4, however, was that it was up to
the individual provinces to take the initiative and respond to the
legislation.  The Y.O.A. itself did not officially establish diversion programs
but merely gave the provinces the ability to do so.  The Act
encouraged the provinces to review their policies on diversion, and it gave
them the incentive to formulate long range plans.  As an added impetus to
the provinces, a cost‑sharing scheme was put into the Y.O.A. in
s. 70.  This provision allowed individual provinces to enter into a cost‑sharing
agreement with the federal Ministry of the Solicitor‑General. [Emphasis
added by Robins J.A.]

 

    Having
concluded that s. 4 did not impose a mandatory duty on the Attorney
General for Ontario, Robins J.A. did not feel obliged to pursue the
s. 15(1)  Charter  analysis.  In his determination
of the case, once it is found that s. 4 is permissive with respect to the
provinces, then the provincial Attorneys General cannot be faulted for failing
to implement an alternative measures program.  Section 4 constitutes ""the
law"" for the purposes of a s. 15  challenge, but the legislation
itself was not in issue with respect to its compatibility with s. 15  of
the Charter .

 

    Robins
J.A. would allow the appeal, set aside the acquittal and order a new trial.

 

Constitutional
Questions

 

    The
following constitutional questions were stated:

 

1.Is
s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act ultra vires the
Parliament of Canada because it is, in pith and substance, legislation dealing
with a matter outside Parliament's jurisdiction over criminal law and procedure
as conferred by s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act,
namely, child welfare?

 

2.Does
the decision of the Attorney General for Ontario not to authorize diversion
programs as alternative measures under s. 4 of the Young
Offenders Act violate the equality rights of the young persons
accused of committing offences within Ontario, as guaranteed by s. 15  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

3.If the
answer to question number 2 is yes, is the decision of the Attorney General for
Ontario not to authorize diversion programs as alternative measures justified
under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

The
Issues

 

    This
appeal involves three issues:  (i) whether s. 4(1)(a) of the Young
Offenders Act imposes a legal obligation on the provinces to
authorize programs of alternative measures; (ii) whether s. 4 is intra
vires the Parliament of Canada pursuant to its jurisdiction
over criminal law in s. 91(27)  of the Constitution Act,
1867 ;  and (iii) whether, if the legislation is intra
vires, the failure of the Attorney General for Ontario to
implement a program of alternative measures is a denial of the respondent's
right to equality before and under the law pursuant to s. 15(1)  of the Charter .  I
propose to deal with each issue in turn.

 

Analysis

 

1.Does
s. 4(1)(a) of the Young Offenders Act Impose a Legal Obligation on the
Provinces to Authorize Alternative Measures?

 

    The
appellant argued before this Court that s. 4(1) of the Young
Offenders Act does not oblige the province of Ontario to designate
programs of alternative measures.  The respondent submitted that the
presence of programs of alternative measures is obligatory throughout Canada
under federal criminal legislation and that the integrity of the legislative
scheme would be jeopardized if the spectrum of sanctions was not universally
available.

 

    In
the judgment below, a majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with the
respondent and upheld the trial judge's ruling that s. 4(1) of the Young
Offenders Act imposes a mandatory duty on the provincial governments
to establish programs of alternative measures.  With respect, I must
disagree with this finding.  In my opinion, the meaning of s. 4(1) is
unambiguous and can be gleaned from the plain meaning of the provision.  The
section requires that ""[a]lternative measures may be used to deal
with a young person alleged to have committed an offence instead of judicial
proceedings under this Act only if"" a number of conditions are met.
(Emphasis added.)  Based upon the wording of the section, Robins J.A. in his
dissenting reasons in the Court of Appeal below concluded, at p. 255,
that:

 

. . .
Parliament chose to employ the words ""may"" and ""only if"" in
conjunction with a province's use of alternative measures under the Y.O.A.  These
words can in no sense be taken as indicating a federal intention to place the
provinces under a duty to authorize alternative measures.

 

    I
agree with this conclusion.  However, I wish to add that my reasons should not
be taken as an indication that the use of the term ""may"" alone is
determinative of the question whether an obligation is imposed.  The Oxford
English Dictionary (2nd ed. 1989), vol. IX, p. 501, includes the
following two alternative definitions of the word ""may"", both of
which are relevant to this issue:

 

Expressing permission or sanction:  To be allowed (to do
something) by authority, law, rule, morality, reason, etc.

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

In the
interpretation of statutes, it has often been ruled that may is to
be understood as equivalent to shall or must.

 

Obviously,
either interpretation of s. 4(1) might be supported by the dictionary
meaning of the word ""may"".  The absence of an obligation expressed in
unequivocally mandatory language is, however, one factor which leads me to
conclude that the Young Offenders Act does not oblige
the provinces to initiate a program of alternative measures.

 

    Furthermore,
I do not find support for the respondent's argument in the ""Declaration of
Principle"" set out in s. 3 of the Act.  Tarnopolsky J.A., for the
majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal, made reference to s. 3(2), which
states that the Young Offenders Act ""shall be
liberally construed to the end that young persons will be dealt with in
accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1)"".  In order to
construe the statutory purpose, then, it is necessary to refer to those
principles.  Of particular relevance to this appeal is s. 3(1)(d):

 

. . .
where it is not inconsistent with the protection of society, taking no measures
or taking measures other than judicial proceedings under this Act should
be considered for dealing with young persons who have committed offences; 
[Emphasis added.]

 

I agree
with Robins J.A. that the use of the term ""should"" in s. 3(1)(d) does
not provide evidence of a mandatory duty.  While I agree that s. 3(2)
dictates that a liberal interpretation be given to the legislation, in my
opinion that does not require the abandonment of the principles of statutory
interpretation nor does it preclude resort to the ordinary meaning of words in
interpreting a statute.  In the context of s. 3(1)(d), I
find that the word ""should"" denotes simply a ""desire or
request"" (to use Robins J.A.'s definition) and not a legal obligation.

 

    In
interpreting this section I have found the approach taken in the English case
of Julius v. Bishop of Oxford (1880), 5
App. Cas. 214 (H.L.) to be of some assistance.  That case was
concerned with the phrase ""it shall be lawful"" in the Church
Discipline Act (U.K.), 3 & 4 Vict., c. 86, s. 3.  The
House of Lords held that the phrase was permissive and not compulsory in the
sense that the Bishop had the discretion not to institute proceedings against
an individual accused of ecclesiastical offences.  The dictum of Lord
Selborne remains relevant to this appeal (at p. 235):

 

I agree
with my noble and learned friends who have preceded me, that the meaning of
such words is the same, whether there is or is not a duty or obligation to use
the power which they confer.  They are potential, and never (in themselves)
significant of any obligation.  The question whether a Judge or a public
officer, to whom a power is given by such words, is bound to use it upon any
particular occasion, or in any particular manner, must be solved aliunde, and,
in general, it is to be solved from the context, from the particular
provisions, or from the general scope and objects, of the enactment conferring
the power.

 

To the
same effect are the comments of Elmer A. Driedger in his treatise
Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87:

 

    Today
there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be
read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense
harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the
intention of Parliament.

 

Equally
instructive is the interpretive approach adopted by Professor Pierre‑André
Côté in his book, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (1984),
at p. 235:

 

    It
is reasonable to believe that this rationality [that of the legislator] first
manifests itself within a particular enactment:  the statute is to be read as a
whole, and each of its components should fit logically into its scheme.

 

    From
the point of view of the context, provisions, and scope and objects of the
legislation, I find that the Young Offenders Act gives to the
provincial Attorneys General a power, but not a duty, to develop and implement
programs of alternative measures.  The federal Parliament has left it to
the provinces to deal with a matter which it has determined is best resolved at
the provincial level.  In my opinion, it must have been within the
contemplation of Parliament that the result of s. 4(1) would be diversity
among provinces in the content of alternative measures programs and moreover,
diversity in terms of whether alternative measures programs were instituted at
all.  In fact, the legislation was intended to foster diversity as a means of
""tailoring"" programs of alternative measures to the facilities and
needs of territorially based communities.  In their book The Young
Offenders Act  Annotated, Professors Bala and Lilles elaborate on the types of
programs of alternative measures which could be developed by the provinces, and
they emphasize the discretionary nature of the decision to implement a program
(at pp. 22‑23):

 

    Under
the Y.O.A., each province is free to set up and administer
alternative measures programs.  If the provincial programs follow the most
common model of present diversion programs, a decision will be made prior to
the first court appearance to determine whether the young person will be
offered an opportunity to participate in the program.  If the young person
agrees, a meeting will be held to discuss the alleged offence and the choice of
alternative measures available.  The young person must acknowledge
responsibility for the act, as a minimum prerequisite to participation.  If he
is not prepared to accept responsibility, the young person should be dealt with
in youth court.  If alternative measures are felt suitable, the legislation
does not specify the conditions which may be imposed.  Normally, they might
include measures such as writing an essay, restitution, community service work,
participation in a recreation program, involvement with Big Brothers/Big
Sisters, or some form of counselling.

 

    The
fact that the Attorney General for Ontario chose not to implement an
alternative measures program, then, should not be construed as a failure  to
comply with a statutorily imposed duty.  Rather, it is a legitimate decision
not to exercise a power granted by Parliament.

 

2.  Is s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act intra vires
the Parliament of Canada?

 

    The
appellant, supported by the intervener Attorney General of Quebec, argued that
s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act was not
constitutionally supportable pursuant to Parliament's jurisdiction over
criminal law in s. 91(27)  of the Constitution Act,
1867 .  Instead, the appellant submitted that s. 4 is in
pith and substance in relation to child welfare, a matter falling within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces over ""Property and Civil
Rights""  pursuant to s. 92(13) .  The respondent and the intervener
Attorney General of Canada argued that s. 4 is merely an extension of the
scope of sanctions available to address the criminal activity of young persons
and is a valid exercise of Parliament's legislative authority.

 

    The
federal jurisdiction over the criminal law has been the subject of much
judicial comment and the principle which has been followed consistently in interpreting
s. 91(27)  is that stated by the Lord Chancellor writing for the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council in Attorney‑General for Ontario v.
Hamilton Street Railway Co., [1903] A.C. 524, at p. 529:  ""the
criminal law, in its widest sense, is reserved for the exclusive authority of
the Dominion Parliament"".  This principle was reiterated and expanded upon
by the Privy Council in the often cited case involving the constitutionality of
combines legislation, Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney‑General
for Canada, [1931] A.C. 310.  In that case Lord Atkin held
that in determining whether legislation has been validly enacted pursuant to
the criminal law power, consideration must be given to the dynamic nature of
the criminal law (at p. 324): 

 

It
certainly is not confined to what was criminal by the law of England or of any
Province of 1867.  The power must extend to legislation to make new
crimes.  Criminal law connotes only the quality of such acts or omissions
as are prohibited under appropriate penal provisions by authority of the State.

 

    These
general principles have been applied by this Court in judicial review of the
predecessor legislation to the Young Offenders Act, namely
the Juvenile Delinquents Act.  In my opinion the judicial treatment
of that statute is useful in an examination of s. 4 of the current Act,
although the differences between the two statutes must be borne in mind.  The
scope of the Juvenile Delinquents Act was all
encompassing.  In the introduction to their book, Justice and the Young
Offender in Canada (1988), Joe Hudson, Joseph P. Hornick and Barbara
Burrows describe the underlying rationale of the Juvenile Delinquents
Act as based upon the welfare of the child (at pp. 4‑5):

 

The juvenile court was to serve, in whatever manner
deemed necessary, the best interests of the children who came before it.  The
court was to act as a kind of clinic, concerned with assessing and fulfilling
the needs of its clients, as opposed to a criminal court concerned with due
process and the protection of society.  Delinquency was viewed as a product of
the social environment and susceptible to treatment.  The court's role under
the JDA was to act on behalf of parents when the best interests
of children were not being met.  Thus the court took on the role of a "". .
. stern but understanding parent.""

 

    The
protective ideology was integral to the JDA. 
Indeed, the JDA is widely described as paternalistic.  The parens
patriae doctrine of the JDA "".
. . emphasized treatment and minimized accountability (on the part of the young
person)"".  Children were to be saved, not punished for their
misdeeds.  The parens patriae doctrine drew no
distinction between criminal and noncriminal youth conduct, which supported the
view that juvenile court proceedings were civil rather than criminal in
nature.  There was seen to be no need to differentiate between delinquent and
neglected children.  Rather, they were perceived by one of the original
drafters of the JDA to be of the ""same class""; the principal concern
was to be on treatment (i.e. helping the child), with ""minimal attention
paid to accountability, or the justification for intervention"".

 

In
contrast, the Young Offenders Act has a narrower
focus and a more modest child welfare component.  The Act addresses the
commission of offences contrary to the Criminal Code  and
other federal criminal law statutes.  Its purpose was described by
McLachlin J. in R. v. M. (S.H.), [1989] 2 S.C.R.
446, at p. 454:

 

    The Young
Offenders Act specifies that a young person charged with a criminal
offence is to be tried in Youth Court, rather than in ordinary court in
accordance with the law applicable to an adult offender.  The procedures in
Youth Court differ from those in ordinary court in a number of respects. 
They are less formal, and are before a judge alone rather than before judge and
jury.  Moreover, the consequences of conviction in Youth Court are also much
less severe than in ordinary court.

 

I refer
to this passage because it is indicative of the focus of the Young
Offenders Act, which is primarily on the criminal law as applied to
young persons, and not on the welfare of the young persons per se.

 

    In
my opinion, there is no question that the Young Offenders Act as a
whole is valid criminal law.  This Court addressed the question of the
constitutionality of the Juvenile Delinquents Act in Attorney
General of British Columbia v. Smith, supra, and
Fauteux J. held that the Act did not encroach upon provincial jurisdiction over
child welfare, at p. 708:

 

    The
primary legal effect of the Juvenile Delinquents Act . . . is the
effective substitution, in the case of juveniles, of the provisions of the Act
to the enforcement provisions of the Criminal Code  or of
any other Dominion statute, or of a provincial statute validly adopted, under
head 15 of s. 92  . . . . this substitution of the provisions of the Act to
the enforcement provisions of other laws, federally or provincially enacted, is
a means adopted by Parliament, in the proper exercise of its plenary power in criminal
matters, for the attainment of an end, a purpose or object which, in its true
nature and character, identifies this Act as being genuine legislation in
relation to criminal law.

 

Given
that the  focus of the Young Offenders Act is more closely
tailored to our traditional conception of the criminal law than was the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, I think it is a logical conclusion that this Court's
reasoning in Smith remains applicable to the current
legislation.

 

    That,
however, does not in itself resolve the issue before this Court.  Although the
Act as a whole is constitutionally valid, the appellant argues that s. 4
is ultra vires and severable from the Act.  In support of this
argument the appellant relies upon this Court's decision in Regional
Municipality of Peel v. MacKenzie, supra.  In
that case the Court's attention was focussed upon s. 20 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act:

 

    20. (1)  In the case of a child adjudged
to be a juvenile delinquent the court may, in its discretion, take either one
or more of the several courses of action hereinafter in this section set out,
as it may in its judgment deem proper in the circumstances of the case:

 

(a) suspend final disposition;

 

(b) adjourn the hearing or disposition of the case from
time to time for any definite or indefinite period;

 

(c) impose a fine not exceeding twenty‑five dollars,
which may be paid in periodical amounts or otherwise;

 

(d) commit the child to the care or custody of a probation
officer or of any other suitable person;

 

(e) allow the child to remain in its home, subject to the
visitation of a probation officer, such child to report to the court or to the
probation officer as often as may be required;

 

(f) cause the child to be placed in a suitable family home
as a foster home, subject to the friendly supervision of a probation officer
and the further order of the court;

 

(g) impose upon the delinquent such further or other
conditions as may be deemed advisable;

 

(h) commit the child to the charge of any children's aid
society, duly organized under an Act of the legislature of the province and
approved by the lieutenant governor in council, or, in any municipality in
which there is no children's aid society, to the charge of the superintendent,
if there is one; or

 

(i) commit the child to an industrial school duly approved
by the lieutenant governor in council.

 

    (2)
In every such case it is within the power of the court to make an order upon
the parent or parents of the child, or upon the municipality to which the child
belongs, to contribute to the child's support such sum as the court may
determine, and where such order is made upon the municipality, the municipality
may from time to time recover from the parent or parents any sum or sums paid
by it pursuant to such order.

 

Martland
J., writing for the Court, held that while s. 20(1) unquestionably was a
valid exercise of Parliament's criminal law jurisdiction, s. 20(2) was
outside of the scope of s. 91(27) , at pp. 16‑17:

 

    Unless
it were held to be necessarily incidental to the exercise of Parliament's
legislative authority in the field of criminal law, in the enactment of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, it would not be possible to support the constitutional
validity of the subsection.  It is designed to come into operation only after
the trial has occurred, the accused has been found to be a juvenile delinquent
and the Court has decided as to the disposition of the delinquent child.  It is
not a part of the definition of the offence, of the procedures to be followed
or of the penalties which may be imposed.  What it seeks to do is to impose
upon municipalities the financial burden of contributing toward the support of
a delinquent child who has already been tried, convicted and made subject to
the disposition prescribed in the Court order.   In my opinion this is not, per se,
legislation in relation to criminal law.

 

    In
my opinion, this dicta provides no assistance to the appellant.  Section 4(1)
of the Young Offenders Act more closely resembles s. 20(1)
of the Juvenile Delinquents Act in that both deal with the
""punishment"" of young persons found to have contravened the law. 
Section 20(2), on the contrary, dealt with the financing of that disposition,
which is well beyond the scope of the criminal law power as it was defined in
the Proprietary Articles Trade Association case, supra.

 

    Although
I agree with the argument of the appellant that s. 4(1) differs from most
criminal law remedial statutes in that the focus is on alternatives to
more traditional criminal sanctions, I do not find this factor to be
dispositive.  While resort to non‑judicial alternatives in the correction
of young offenders may not resemble the criminal law model envisioned by Lord
Atkin, this Court has held repeatedly that the legislative power over criminal
law must be sufficiently flexible to recognize new developments in methods of
dealing with offenders.  This principle was applied by Laskin C.J., in
dealing with a restitutionary remedy for a criminal offence: R. v.
Zelensky, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 940.  The principle is equally
relevant here.

 

    Further
support for this interpretation of s. 4(1) can be drawn from the principle
that Parliament's jurisdiction over criminal law in s. 91(27)  extends
beyond the confines of creating offences and establishing penalties.  In Goodyear
Tire & Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R.
303, this Court upheld a prohibition order provided for by the Criminal
Code  and the Combines Investigation Act.  Locke
J., writing for a majority of the Court, found that the validity of the order
was sustainable not only on the basis that it defined a new offence, but also
on the basis that it was a means for the prevention of further crime (at
p. 308):

 

The
power to legislate in relation to criminal law is not restricted, in my
opinion, to defining offences and providing penalties for their commission. 
The power of Parliament extends to legislation designed for the prevention of
crime as well as to punishing crime.

 

In my
opinion, the discretion to create an alternative measures program pursuant to
s. 4 represents a legitimate attempt to deter young offenders from continued
criminal activity.  In this regard, I agree with Tarnopolsky J.A.'s
characterization of s. 4 as demonstrating a ""concern with a curative
approach, rather than the traditionally punitive approach of the criminal law. 
There is a concern with preventing recidivism  and with balancing the interests
of the offending `young person' with those of society"" (p. 270). 
Although I do not intend to define the limits of the ""prevention of
crime"" doctrine, s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act is well
within its scope.

 

    Thus,
I find that s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act has been validly
enacted pursuant to Parliament's power over criminal law in s. 91(27)  of
the Constitution Act, 1867 .  In view of my disposition of this
question, I need not consider the alternative argument that s. 4 is
""necessarily incidental"" to the criminal law power.

 

    As a
related issue, the respondent also raised the question whether s. 4 of the Young
Offenders Act is an unconstitutional delegation of Parliament's
authority over criminal law and procedure.  This matter can be dealt with
summarily as, in my opinion, there is no limitation imposed by the
Constitution Act, 1867  on the ability of Parliament to leave this issue to the
discretion of the provincial Attorneys General.  Tarnopolsky J.A. has summarized
accurately the effect of the decisions of this Court regarding the intersection
of ss. 91(27)  and 92(14)  of the Constitution Act,
1867  (at p. 278):

 

There is
no doubt, since the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in A.‑G.
Can. v. Canadian National Transportation Ltd. (1983), 7
C.C.C. (3d) 449, 3 D.L.R. (4th) 16, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 206, and R. v.
Wetmore and A.‑G. Ont. (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 507, 2 D.L.R.
(4th) 577, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 284, that the federal Parliament has jurisdiction to
confer powers on provincial officials to supervise the conduct of criminal
prosecutions.

 

Authority
over the prosecution of young offenders has been delegated through the
definition of Attorney General in s. 2 of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ). 
This is made applicable to the Young Offenders Act by
virtue of s. 2(4) (now s. 2(2)) of the Act).  With respect to the Young
Offenders Act , the provinces have accepted a delegation of
responsibility from the federal Parliament in respect of prosecutions.  In
my view, the discretion to establish programs of alternative measures clearly
is incidental to that legitimate delegation.

 

    The
only remaining issue, then, is whether the diversity which flows from the
conferral of a discretion on provincial officials over the conduct of a
criminal prosecution pursuant to s. 92(14)  of the
Constitution Act, 1867  is unconstitutional by reason of the equality
provisions of s. 15(1)  of the Charter .

 

3.Does
Ontario's failure to authorize alternative measures violate s. 15 of the
Charter?

 

    The
appellant argued that the Ontario Court of Appeal erred in law when it held
that the decision of the Attorney General for Ontario not to authorize a
program of alternative measures pursuant to s. 4 of the Young
Offenders Act violated the right of the respondent to equality before
and under the law and to the equal benefit of the law as guaranteed by
s. 15(1)  of the Charter .  The respondent has not attacked the
constitutionality of s. 4 itself in this appeal; rather, the issue is
whether the exercise of discretion by the Attorney General for Ontario in
choosing not to implement a program of alternative measures itself violated the
respondent's equality rights.  The respondent also raised s. 7  of the Charter ;
however, no constitutional question in relation to s. 7  was framed in this
case.  In any event, the extent to which the principles of fundamental justice
encompass the values which underpin the equality guarantee in s. 15(1)  of
the Charter  is premised upon an initial determination that
s. 15(1)  itself has been violated.  The Attorneys General of Quebec and
Saskatchewan intervened on behalf of the appellant and the Attorney General of
Canada made submissions in support of the position of the respondent on this
issue.

 

    The
rights protected by s. 15(1)  are all framed in terms of ""the
law""  -- equality before and under the law, and equal protection and equal
benefit of the law.  Therefore, it is first necessary to determine whether the
failure of the Attorney General for Ontario to implement a program of
alternative measures can be considered ""the law"" for the purposes of
a s. 15 challenge.  This issue is made more difficult by my determination
that this legislation does not impose a mandatory obligation on the Attorney
General for Ontario.  Robins J.A. in his dissenting reasons at the Court of
Appeal found this fact to be conclusive (at pp. 259‑60):

 

    In
my opinion, once it is accepted that s. 4 of the Act does not impose a
mandatory duty on the province to establish alternative measures, the Attorney‑General
for Ontario's decision not to authorize such programs under s. 4 cannot
contravene the respondent's equality rights under s. 15(1)  of the Charter .  His
decision was made in accordance with the permissive terms of s. 4.  That
section, and not the discretionary determination made by the Attorney‑General
pursuant to its provisions, constitutes ""the law"" for the purposes of
a s. 15  challenge.  If equality is denied alleged young offenders in
Ontario, the denial results, not from the Attorney‑General's decision or,
as the intervenant argues and the trial judge held, from the Attorney‑General's
failure ""to give effect to the will of Parliament"", but from the law
enacted by Parliament in the exercise of its governmental power over criminal
law which authorizes the Attorney‑General to proceed precisely as he
has.  In short, the Attorney‑General for Ontario's decision is not
""the law"" and that decision cannot in itself violate s. 15 .

 

I
agree.  Once it is determined that there is no duty on the Attorney General for
Ontario to implement a program of alternative measures, the non‑exercise
of discretion cannot be constitutionally attacked simply because it creates
differences as between provinces.  To find otherwise would potentially
open to Charter  scrutiny every jurisdictionally permissible exercise of
power by a province, solely on the basis that it creates a distinction in how
individuals are treated in different provinces.  The Attorney General for
Ontario was under no legal obligation to implement a program and, in my
opinion, the decision is unimpeachable because, for the purposes of a
constitutional challenge on the basis of s. 15(1)  of the Charter ,
""the law"" is s. 4, which grants the discretion.  The respondent
did not risk invalidating the entire scheme of alternative measures programs
brought into being by federal statute.  As a consequence, the constitutionality
of s. 4, in terms of compliance with the Charter , was
not in issue in this appeal.

 

    I
would add, however, that in my opinion the result of this appeal would be no
different had s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act been
challenged directly.  This Court's approach to s. 15(1)  was outlined by
McIntyre J. in Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989]
1 S.C.R. 143, at p. 182.  First, the complainant must establish that
""he or she is not receiving equal treatment before and under the law or
that the law has a differential impact on him or her in the protection or
benefit accorded by law"".  On this point, there can be no dispute.  As a
result of the discretion granted by Parliament to the provincial Attorneys
General, there existed, in all but one province, programs of alternative
measures available to young persons found to have violated a federal law in
that province.  I note that both Robins J.A. and Tarnopolsky J.A., in the Court
of Appeal below mistakenly stated that Prince Edward Island had not instituted
a program of alternative measures.  In a statement issued on March 29,
1988, the Honourable Wayne D. Cheverie, Q.C., Minister of Justice and Attorney
General for Prince Edward Island, noted that alternative measures were
authorized in that province on April 2, 1984.  Therefore, a distinction based
on the situs of an offence is created.  Moreover, it is reasonable
to assume that but for the exceptional case, a young person who commits an 
offence will do so in the province in which he or she lives.  Thus, I find
the substantive distinction to be geographic and based upon the province of residence
of young offenders. I agree with Tarnopolsky J.A., that the absence of
this benefit in the province of Ontario must be considered to be a legal
disadvantage imposed upon young offenders resident in that province
(p. 272).  As a consequence, the respondent has met the first stage of the
s. 15(1)  test.

 

    Having
reached that conclusion, it becomes necessary to deal with the second aspect of
the test for the determination of whether a s. 15(1)  violation
exists.  McIntyre J. described the inquiry that courts must undertake in Andrews, supra, at
pp. 174‑75:

 

I would
say then that discrimination may be described as a distinction, whether
intentional or not but based on grounds relating to personal characteristics of
the individual or group, which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations,
or disadvantages on such individual or group not imposed upon others, or which
withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages available
to other members of society.  Distinctions based on personal characteristics
attributed to an individual solely on the basis of association with a group
will rarely escape the charge of discrimination, while those based on an
individual's merits and capacities will rarely be so classed.

 

In the
context of a distinction based upon province of residence, the inquiry turns to
whether the distinction is based upon a personal characteristic.  In my
view, the approach to s. 15(1)  established by this Court in Andrews takes
on an extra dimension when the distinction is province based.  It is trite law
that the Canadian Constitution creates not only a boundary between the
individual and the state, but also creates boundaries between the federal and
provincial levels of government.  The intersection of these two constitutionally
mandated boundaries inherently raises a problem because it represents the
conflict of two competing values -- uniformity and diversity.  This is
particularly true when the Charter  section raised is s. 15(1) ,
which enshrines the principle of equality before and under the law.  As
Professor Katherine Swinton has observed in ""Competing Visions of
Constitutionalism:  Of Federalism and Rights"", in Katherine E. Swinton and
Carol J. Rogerson, eds., Competing Constitutional Visions:  The Meech Lake
Accord (1988), at p. 291:

 

In
Canada, the concerns about the permissible limits on rights and the scope of
the equality guarantee will inevitably raise questions about diversity among
and within communities in Canada and the degree to which governments can
respond to that diversity without violating the Charter .

 

    Obviously,
the federal system of government itself demands that the values underlying
s. 15(1)  cannot be given unlimited scope.  The division of powers not only
permits differential treatment based upon province of residence, it mandates
and encourages geographical distinction.  There can be no question, then, that
unequal treatment which stems solely from the exercise, by provincial
legislators, of their legitimate jurisdictional powers cannot be the subject of
a s. 15(1)  challenge on the basis only that it creates distinctions based
upon province of residence.  As Wilson J. stated in Reference Re Bill 30,
An Act to Amend the Education Act (Ont.), [1987] 1 S.C.R.
1148, at p. 1197, ""[it] was never intended, in my opinion, that the Charter  could
be used to invalidate other provisions of the Constitution"".  To find
otherwise would be to completely undermine the value of diversity which is at
the foundation of the division of powers.

 

    However,
the matter does not end there.  This appeal raises the issue of the impact of
s. 15(1)  on distinctions based upon province of residence in the
application of a valid federal law.  Thus, the question is whether in
that circumstance, province of residence can be considered a ""personal
characteristic"".   This Court recently dealt with this question in R. v.
Turpin, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1296.  That case concerned the ability
of an accused to waive the right to trial by judge and jury.  Wilson J.,
writing for the Court, concluded that the fact that only in the province of
Alberta could an accused charged with murder choose to be tried by judge alone
did not give rise to a violation of the s. 15(1)  Charter  right
to equality before the law.  Wilson J. determined that while the Criminal
Code  section denied the appellants equality before the law
because it ""denied an opportunity which is available to others""
(p. 1329), the distinction was not based upon a personal characteristic
for the purposes of the second stage of the Andrews inquiry
(at pp. 1332‑33):

 

    The appellants claim that because they are accused
of one of the indictable offences listed in s. 427  of the Criminal
Code  but do not have an opportunity, as do persons charged
with the same offence in Alberta, to be tried by a judge alone, they are
victims of discrimination.  I disagree.  In my respectful view, it would be
stretching the imagination to characterize persons accused of one of the crimes
listed in s. 427  of the Criminal Code  in all the provinces
except Alberta as members of a ""discrete and insular minority"". . .
.  Differentiating for mode of trial purposes between those accused of
s. 427  offences in Alberta and those accused of the same offences
elsewhere in Canada would not, in my view, advance the purposes of s. 15 
in remedying or preventing discrimination against groups suffering social,
political and legal disadvantage in our society.  A search for indicia of
discrimination such as stereotyping, historical disadvantage or vulnerability
to political and social prejudice would be fruitless in this case because what
we are comparing is the position of those accused of the offences listed in
s. 427  in the rest of Canada to the position of those accused of the
offences listed in s. 427  in Alberta.  To recognize the claims of the
appellants under s. 15  of the Charter  would, in my
respectful view, ""overshoot the actual purpose of the right or freedom in
question"": see R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., at p. 344.

 

    I
would not wish to suggest that a person's province of residence or place of
trial could not in some circumstances be a personal characteristic of the
individual or group capable of constituting a ground of discrimination.  I
simply say that it is not so here.  [Emphasis added.]

 

I agree
with Wilson J. that in determining whether province‑based distinctions
which arise from the application of federal law contravene s. 15(1)  of the Charter , a case‑by‑case
approach is appropriate.  However, in my view, in order to engage in that
analysis, it is useful to formulate a principled approach for dealing with such
distinctions.

 

    It
is necessary to bear in mind that differential application of federal law can
be a legitimate means of forwarding the values of a federal system.  In fact,
in the context of the administration of the criminal law, differential
application is constitutionally fostered by ss. 91(27)  and 92(14)  of the
Constitution Act, 1867 .  The area of criminal law and its application is one
in which the balancing of national interests and local concerns has been
accomplished by a constitutional structure that both permits and encourages
federal‑provincial cooperation.  A brief review of Canadian
constitutional history clearly demonstrates that diversity in the criminal law,
in terms of provincial application, has been recognized consistently as a means
of furthering the values of federalism.  Differential application arises from a
recognition that different approaches to the administration of the criminal law
are appropriate in different territorially based communities.  In a line
of cases beginning with Fredericton v. The Queen (1880), 3 S.C.R.
505, this Court consistently has upheld federal statutes with differential
geographic application.  As Laskin J. conceded in his dissenting reasons in R. v.
Burnshine, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 693, a case which dealt with the
differential application of a provision of the Criminal Code  in the
context of s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, at
p. 715:

 

    As a
matter of legislative power only, there can be no doubt about Parliament's
right to give its criminal or other enactments special applications, whether in
terms of locality of operation or otherwise.

 

That
principle was reaffirmed by Le Dain J., in the context of s. 1(b) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, writing for the Court in R. v. Cornell, [1988]
1 S.C.R. 461.  Finally, it was recognized in the context of s. 15  of the Charter  by
Wilson J. in Turpin, supra, at
p. 1334:

 

    In
concluding that s. 15  is not violated in this case, I realize that I am
rejecting the proposition accepted by several Courts of Appeal in Canada that
it is a fundamental principle under s. 15  of the Charter  that
the criminal law apply equally throughout the country.

 

I agree
with that conclusion and find it equally applicable to the facts of this
appeal.

 

    In
my opinion, the question of how young people found to have committed criminal
offences should be dealt with is one upon which it is legitimate for Parliament
to allow for province‑based distinctions as a reflection of distinct and
rationally based political values and sensitivities.  Professors Bala and
Lilles, op. cit., emphasize the benefits that derive from the adaptability of a
program of alternative measures to the needs of different regions and
communities (at pp. 17‑18):

 

The
benefits of alternative measures range from reducing delays in handling young
persons to the increased scope for flexibility, especially in procedures and in
the manner of dealing with young persons.  The use of alternative measures
frees court facilities, allowing the youth court to be reserved for the more
serious cases.  The range of dispositional options that may be used in
alternative measures programs includes special education and counselling for
behavioural problems or drug or alcohol related problems.  Alternative
measures programs can be adaptable to the particular needs of the communities
in which they are set up, whether the community is rural, urban, native, etc. 
One aim of such programs is to involve the community in dealing with the
problems of the illegal behaviour of young persons;  this is often achieved
through the use of community participants at all levels of the alternative
measures program, through the involvement of the victim and the employment of
innovative forms of disposition.  [Emphasis added.]

 

In
recognizing the benefit of geographical diversity in the context of programs of
alternative measures, I am mindful of the fact that although I have found this
legislation to be valid federal law, it is not wholly unconnected to child
welfare -- a matter of provincial jurisdiction.  Differential application of
the law through federal‑provincial cooperation is a legitimate means
whereby governments can  overcome the rigidity of the ""watertight
compartments"" of the distribution of powers with respect to matters that
are not easily categorized or dealt with by one level of government alone. 
Consequently, I find that in this case the legislation does not amount to a
distinction which is based upon a ""personal characteristic"" for the
purposes of s. 15(1)  of the Charter .

 

Disposition

 

    This
appeal is allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is set aside, and a new
trial is ordered.

 

    I
would answer the constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.Is
s. 4 of the Young Offenders Act ultra vires the
Parliament of Canada because it is, in pith and substance, legislation dealing
with a matter outside Parliament's jurisdiction over criminal law and procedure
as conferred by s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act,
namely, child welfare?

 

Answer:                No.

 

2.Does
the decision of the Attorney General for Ontario not to authorize diversion
programs as alternative measures under s. 4 of the Young
Offenders Act violate the equality rights of the young persons
accused of committing offences within Ontario, as guaranteed by s. 15  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:                No.

 

3.If the
answer to question number 2 is yes, is the decision of the Attorney General for
Ontario not to authorize diversion programs as alternative measures justified
under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:                The
question need not be answered.

the Criminal Code violates ss. 7 or 11(d) of the Charter ‑‑ If

    Respondent
was convicted of second degree murder, under s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code , in the killing of a person who had been abducted for
ransom and killed by one of his accomplices involved in the kidnapping plan. 
The credibility of the witness used to establish respondent's role in the
kidnapping was severely attacked in cross‑examination.  The Court of
Appeal, following R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636, struck down s. 213 (a) and held that a
new trial should be ordered on an indictment charging second degree murder as
the Crown had not met the test in s. 613(1) (b)(iii). 
The constitutional questions queried (1) whether s. 213 (a)
contravened ss. 7  and/or 11(d) of the Charter , and
(2), if so, whether it was justified by s. 1 .  Also at issue was whether
the Court of Appeal erred in failing to apply s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

 

    Held
(L'Heureux‑Dubé J. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.  The
first constitutional question should be answered in the affirmative, the second
in the negative.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ.:  For the reasons given
in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, the first constitutional question
should be answered in the affirmative and the second in the negative.

 

    Respondent
could be found guilty of second degree murder if he knew or ought to have known
the murder of the victim was a probable consequence of carrying out the
kidnapping.  As a result of the combined effect of R. v. Martineau,
involving s. 213 (a), and R. v. Logan, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000, involving s. 21(2), a new trial must be ordered.  Section 21(2), in
so far as it permits a conviction of a party for murder on the basis of
objective foreseeability, which is a lesser degree of mens rea than
that constitutionally required of the principal, is contrary to the principles
of fundamental justice.

 

    As
regards the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii),
the jury acting reasonably would not necessarily have found respondent guilty
of murder had it been left with the proper test.

 

    Per Sopinka
J.:  For the reasons given in R. v. Martineau, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 000, it is unnecessary to decide whether subjective foresight is an
essential requirement of the offence of murder.  Section 213 (a) is
invalid on the basis of R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636.  No constitutional question was stated with respect to s. 21(2)  of
the Criminal Code ; it was not an issue in this appeal.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé J. (dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed for the
reasons stated in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000.  Section 213 (a) is entirely different from s. 213 (d).  It
satisfies the objective foreseeability standard, and if all the elements of
s. 213 (a) are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, a murder
conviction can validly and constitutionally obtain.

    LAMER C.J. --


 

Introduction          

 

    This
is a case, heard together with R. v. Martineau, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 000, dealing with the constitutional validity of s. 213(a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, (now s. 230 (a), Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ).  Chief Justice Dickson stated
the following constitutional questions:

 

1.  Does s. 213(a) of the Criminal
Code  (as it read on May 30, 1984) contravene the rights and
freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.  If
the answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  (as it read on May 30, 1984) justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

For the
reasons that I have expressed in Martineau, supra, I
would answer the constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.  Yes, s. 213(a)
contravenes both ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

2.  No.

 

The
remaining issue involves whether the Court of Appeal for British Columbia erred
in failing to apply the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
(now s. 686(1)(b)(iii)) of the Criminal Code .  In
this regard it will be necessary to recite at some length the facts and
procedural history of this case.

 

Facts

 

    The
respondent was convicted of second degree murder in connection with the killing
of the wife of the manager of a supermarket.  The respondent became involved in
a plan with two other accomplices to abduct and hold for ransom the victim. 
Various phone calls were made to the husband of the victim after she was
kidnapped demanding ransom.  The victim was then shot and killed by one of the
respondent's accomplices. The Crown alleged that the respondent was a party to
the kidnapping and shooting of the victim by virtue of ss. 21(2), 212, 213(a) and
213(d) of the Code.  A witness at the
trial, David Drew, gave evidence to the effect that while bowling the
respondent told him of his involvement in the kidnapping. The respondent told
Drew that his role was to watch the comings and goings of people at the home of
the victim, and to give the times to his accomplice.  He described how all
three had followed the victim, grabbed her in an alleyway, hauled her into a
van, tied her feet and hands and gagged and blindfolded her.  The witness Drew
also claimed that the respondent told him how they transported the victim to
Burnaby Mountain where one of the respondent's accomplices took her out of the
vehicle and shot her.  The credibility of Drew was severely attacked in
cross-examination, especially on the grounds that he had 15 criminal
convictions, he was arrested as a suspect in the murder and that the victim's
gloves were found in the garbage behind his flat.  The respondent was convicted
of second degree murder, following deliberations by the jury that lasted three
days.

 

Judgment
Below

 

Court of
Appeal for British Columbia

 

    The
Court of Appeal for British Columbia observed that the evidence at trial
suggested that the respondent did not actually kill the victim but that the
jury believed he was involved in the kidnapping and killing.  The jury was
instructed at trial according to the law as it stood at the time, that is to
say that the respondent could be convicted as a party to the killing under ss.
21, 205, and 212, or as a party to constructive murder under s. 213.  In light
of this Court's decision in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia struck down s. 213(a) of the Code.  As
regards the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code, the Court said the following:

 

. . . as
the law presently stands it is clear to us that this accused may have been
convicted because of the constructive murder provisions of Code s. 213, which
is constitutionally invalid, and for that reason we are constrained to allow
the appeal.  We are not satisfied that the Crown has met the test required by
Code s. 613(1)(b)(iii) and must, therefore, order a new trial on an indictment
charging second degree murder.

 

Analysis

 

    There
is no doubt that the respondent was a party to a kidnapping.  It is not clear,
however, on what basis the jury decided that the respondent was a party to
murder.  It is clear that by virtue of s. 21(2) of the Code the
respondent could be found guilty of second degree murder if the respondent knew
or ought to have known that the murder of the victim was a probable consequence
of carrying out the kidnapping.  The constitutional validity of s. 21(2)  is not
an issue in this appeal, but it was an issue in a case, R. v.
Logan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, heard together with the present appeal. 
As a result of the combined effect of my reasons in Martineau and Logan,
released concurrently, I am of the view that a new trial must be ordered in
this case.  A conviction for murder must be based on proof of subjective
foresight of death.  In Logan, what was at issue was a charge of
attempted murder in which there must be proof of a specific intent to kill. 
This Court affirmed that, in so far as s. 21(2)  permits a conviction of a party
for the offence of attempted murder on the basis of objective foreseeability,
which is a lesser degree of mens rea than that constitutionally required
for a conviction for that offence, it is contrary to the principles of
fundamental justice.  The reasoning therein applies with equal force to the
case of murder where proof of subjective foresight of death is required.  A
party to a murder, therefore, cannot be convicted upon proof that he ought to
have known that the murder was a probable consequence of carrying out the
common purpose.  In the case at bar, it was open to the jury to find that the
respondent had formed an intention in common with his accomplices to kidnap the
victim and that he ought to have known that the killing of the victim
was a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose.  The jury could
have entertained a reasonable doubt that the respondent had subjective
foresight that the murder would be a probable consequence of the kidnapping and
yet still would have to convict the respondent as a party to murder.  Such a
result would be contrary to the principles of fundamental justice and the
presumption of innocence.  As regards the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii),
I am not convinced that had the jury been left with the proper test, namely
subjective foresight, they would, acting reasonably, have necessarily found the
respondent guilty of murder.  The judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia ordering a new trial is, therefore, affirmed.  Accordingly, the appeal
is dismissed.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé
J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    L'HEUREUX-DUBÉ J.
(dissenting) -- I have had the advantage of the opinion of Chief Justice Lamer,
and with respect I must dissent for the reasons stated in R. v.
Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, released concurrently.  As in Martineau, this
appeal raises the constitutionality of s. 213(a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s.
230 (a)) as regards ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  In
that case I found that an objective foreseeability test of death was
constitutionally valid for the crime of murder, and I distinguished this
Court's decision in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636.  In the present case, the British Columbia Court of Appeal, in my view,
interpreted Vaillancourt too broadly when
it stated: 

 

    We
are all of the view that the majority judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada
in R. v. Vaillancourt. . . which struck down Code s. 213(d) on constitutional
grounds requires [sic] us to apply the same reasoning and reach the same
conclusion with respect to Code s. 213(a).

 

    In
Vaillancourt, this Court dealt with s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code  and did not hold that subjective foresight of death was
constitutionally mandated for the crime of murder.  Section 213 (a)
satisfies the objective foreseeability standard, and if all the elements of s.
213 (a) are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, a murder
conviction can validly and constitutionally obtain.  As I discussed in Martineau, s.
213(a) is entirely different than s. 213 (d) in its
historical background, in its consistency with the test in
Vaillancourt, and in its resemblance to similar provisions enacted
in other common law jurisdictions.  Therefore, I must respectfully dissent from
my colleague's disposition for the reasons stated in Martineau.  I
would allow this appeal, reverse the judgment of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, and restore the conviction entered at trial.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    SOPINKA J. -- I
have read the reasons of Lamer C.J. and L'Heureux-Dubé J., and would dispose of
the appeal as proposed by Lamer C.J.

 

    For
the reasons I gave in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000, it is unnecessary to decide whether subjective foresight is an essential
requirement of the offence of murder.  On the basis of R. v.
Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, s. 213(a) is
invalid.  Since it was put to the jury and may have been acted upon, there must
be a new trial.

 

    With
respect to s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, no constitutional question was stated and it is not an issue in this
appeal.

    Criminal
law ‑‑ Search and seizure ‑‑ Bankruptcy ‑‑
Bankruptcy Act providing for authorization of searches in limited circumstances
related to bankruptcy ‑‑ Whether public authorities can also resort
to s. 443 of Criminal Code to obtain a search and seizure warrant where
Bankruptcy Act applies ‑‑ Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. B‑3, s. 6 ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,

    Respondent
Poirier, an R.C.M.P. constable, applied for a warrant under s. 443  of the Criminal
Code  in order to have access to appellants' books, records
and documents for purposes of an investigation into allegations of certain Bankruptcy
Act violations.  The warrant was issued and R.C.M.P. officers
searched appellants' premises and seized various documents.  Appellants
applied to have the warrant quashed on the ground that the search should have
been conducted pursuant to s. 6(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, not
s. 443  of the Criminal Code .  An amendment to
s. 443(1) of the Code in 1985 added the words ""or any
other Act of Parliament"" to paras. (a) and (b).  The
Superior Court concluded that the intent of the amendment was to render
s. 443  applicable to all federal statutes, whether or not they included
search and seizure provisions, and dismissed the application.  The Court of
Appeal affirmed the decision.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    The
1985 amendment to s. 443  of the Criminal Code  makes
the section applicable to all cases involving violations of federal
statutes.  On a plain reading, s. 443  applies to proceedings under
any federal statute, regardless of whether or not it contains search and
seizure provisions.  Additionally, the section reveals that Parliament,
when it wanted to restrict the application of s. 443 , did so expressly (as
in s. 443(1) (e)) through the use of the words ""subject to any
other Act of Parliament"".

    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

     LAMER C.J. --
Section 6 of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
B-3, provides for the authorization of searches in limited circumstances related
to bankruptcy.  This appeal raises the following issue:  in situations where s.
6 of the Bankruptcy Act is applicable, can
public authorities also resort to s. 443 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 487 , as amended by R.S.C., 1985,
c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 68) to obtain a search and seizure warrant?

 

Facts

 

    Pursuant
to s. 6(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, the
Superintendent of Bankruptcy asked the R.C.M.P. to investigate allegations of Bankruptcy
Act violations in relation to the bankruptcy of Multiform Kitchens
International Ltd.  The appellants were all companies related to Multiform
Kitchens International Ltd.  Constable J.H. Réal Poirier applied for a warrant
under s. 443  of the Criminal Code  in order to have
access to the appellants' books, records and documents, all of which were
necessary to the investigation.  Falardeau J.S.P.C. issued the warrant and the
R.C.M.P. officers searched the appellants' premises and seized various
accounting books, records and documents.  The appellants applied to have the
search warrant quashed stating that the search should have been conducted
pursuant to s. 6(2) of the  Bankruptcy Act and not s. 443  of
the Criminal Code .  The Quebec Superior Court dismissed the application. 
A subsequent appeal was dismissed by the Quebec Court of Appeal.

 

Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

Section
6 of the Bankruptcy Act provides

 

    6. (1) Where, on information supplied
by an official receiver, trustee or other person, it appears to the
Superintendent that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person
has, in  connection with a bankruptcy, committed an offence under this Act or
any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, whether before or after the
bankruptcy, the Superintendent may, if it appears to him that the matter might
not otherwise be investigated, make or cause to be made such inquiries or
investigations as he deems expedient with respect to the conduct, dealings and
transactions of the bankrupt concerned, the causes of his bankruptcy and the
disposition of his property.

 

    (2)  For the purposes of an investigation under
subsection (1), the Superintendent or any person duly authorized by him in
writing, with the approval of the court, which may be given upon an ex parte
application, may, either alone or together with such peace officers as he calls
on to assist him, enter and search, if necessary by force, any building,
receptacle or place for books, records, papers or documents that may afford
evidence as to an offence in connection with a bankruptcy and examine any such
books, records, papers or documents.

 

                                                                        . . . 

 

    (7) 
Where any book, record, paper or other document is examined or produced in
accordance with this section, the person by whom it is examined or to whom it
is produced or the Superintendent may make or cause to be made one or more
copies thereof, and a document purporting to be certified by the Superintendent
or a person thereunto authorized by him to be a copy made pursuant to this
section is admissible in evidence and has the same probative force as the
original document would have if it were proven in the ordinary way.

 

Section
443  of the Criminal Code , when the warrant
hereunder was sought, provided:

 

    443. (1) A justice who is satisfied by
information upon oath in Form 1, that there is reasonable ground to believe
that there is in a building, receptacle or place

 

(a)  anything on or in respect of which any offence
against this Act or any other Act of Parliament has been or is suspected to
have been committed,

 

(b)  anything that there is reasonable ground to believe
will afford evidence with respect to the commission of an offence against this
Act or any other Act of Parliament, or

 

(c)  anything that there is reasonable ground to believe
is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any offence against the
person for which a person may be arrested without warrant, 

 

may at any time issue a warrant under his hand
authorizing a person named therein or a peace officer

 

(d)  to search the building, receptacle or place for any
such thing and to seize it, and

 

(e) 
subject to any other Act of Parliament, to, as soon as practicable, bring the
thing seized before, or make a report in respect thereof to, the justice or
some other justice for the same territorial division in accordance with section
445.1.

 

Finally,
s. 27(2) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
I-23, read as follows:

 

    27. ...

 

    (2) 
All the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating to
indictable offences apply to indictable offences created by an enactment, and
all the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating to
summary conviction offences apply to all other offences created by an
enactment, except to the extent that the enactment otherwise provides.

 

The
Judgments of the Courts Below

 

Superior
Court:  [1987] R.J.Q. 879, 33 C.C.C. (3d) 521

 

    Section
443(1) was amended in 1985 to add the words ""or any other Act of
Parliament"" to paras. (a) and (b).  Boilard J. noted
that, prior to this amendment, s. 443 of the Code could
be used to obtain a warrant in relation to federal statutes which did not have
search and seizure provisions.  He concluded that the intent of the 1985
amendment was to render s. 443  applicable to all federal statutes, whether or
not they included search and seizure provisions.  Boilard J. was also of the
opinion that the availability of two procedures for authorizing searches
(s. 443 of the Code and s. 6 of the Bankruptcy
Act) would not offend s. 15  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

Court of
Appeal:  [1988] R.L. 216, 22 Q.A.C. 168, 42 C.C.C. (3d) 174

 

    Bernier
J.A., writing for the Court, held that until the 1985 amendment, s. 443 of
the Code could only be used where the federal statute in
question contained no search and seizure provisions.  In his opinion, the
purpose of the 1985 amendment which added the words ""or any other Act of
Parliament"" was to widen the application of s. 443 of the Code so as
to make it available as an investigatory tool for violations of any federal
statute.  He also dismissed the argument to the effect s. 27 of the
Interpretation Act removes search and seizure powers of the Superintendent
in relation to violations of the Bankruptcy Act from
the potential application of s. 443 of the Code.  It
could not be said that, to use the terms of s. 27(2) of the
Interpretation Act, s. 6 of the Bankruptcy Act
""otherwise provides"".  Like the Superior Court, the Court of Appeal
dismissed any argument relating to an alleged violation of the Charter .

 

Analysis

 

    Two
preliminary remarks are in order to circumscribe the limits of the question
this Court is called upon to answer. First, neither the constitutionality of
s. 6 of the Bankruptcy Act nor that of s. 443
of the Code and, in particular, the applicability of the latter to
all offences irrespective of whether they are created by an Act other than the Criminal
Code , was questioned by the parties before this Court. 
Second, although the appellants seek remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter , no
argument was presented to this Court in relation to any violation of the Charter . 
Indeed, there is no suggestion that the officers, through the exercise of the
powers granted them under s. 443 of the Code,
violated the appellants' rights under the Charter .  The
only question this Court must answer is whether s. 6 of the Bankruptcy
Act and s. 443  of the Criminal Code  can both be
resorted to in the course of an investigation instigated by the Superintendent
of Bankruptcy.

 

    The
parties and the courts below made an exhaustive review of the case law which
developed prior to the amendment of s. 443 of the Code in
1985.  Where a federal statute included search and seizure powers, the cases
were clearly to the effect that s. 443 of the Code could
not be resorted to.  Some legal controversy existed however where statutes were
silent as to search and seizure powers.  The majority of the cases suggested
that s. 443 of the Code could be used in such cases by
resorting to the application of s. 27(2) of the Interpretation Act.  Since
section 27(2) provided that the Code was applicable to
any offence under a federal statute, s. 443  was, where the statute was silent
as regards searches, available to public authorities in need of a search
warrant.  Indeed, in cases where the statute was silent as to search and
seizure powers, it could not be said that s. 27(2) did not apply because there
was not in the statute an ""enactment [that] otherwise provides"".

 

    What
then is the effect of the amendment?  In my view, the amendment to s. 443 of
the Code makes it applicable to all cases involving violations
of federal statutes.

 

    When
the courts are called upon to interpret a statute, their task is to discover
the intention of Parliament.  When the words used in a statute are clear and
unambiguous, no further step is needed to identify the intention of
Parliament.  There is no need for further construction when Parliament has
clearly expressed its intention in the words it has used in the statute.  As
Maxwell stated in The Interpretation of Statutes (12th
ed. 1969), at pp. 28-29:

 

If there is nothing to modify, alter or qualify the
language which the statute contains, it must be construed in the ordinary and
natural meaning of the words and sentences.  ""The safer and more correct
course of dealing with a question of construction is to take the words
themselves and arrive if possible at their meaning without, in the first
instance, reference to cases.""

 

    The rule of construction is ""to intend the
Legislature to have meant what they have actually expressed.""  The object
of all interpretation is to discover the intention of Parliament, ""but the
intention of Parliament must be deduced from the language used,"" for
""it is well accepted that the beliefs and assumptions of those who frame
Acts of Parliament cannot make the law.""

 

    Where
the language is plain and admits of but one meaning, the task of interpretation
can hardly be said to arise.

 

Or, as
Professor P. A. Côté succinctly puts it in The Interpretation of
Legislation in Canada (1984), at p. 2:

 

It is
said that when an Act is clear there is no need to interpret it: a simple
reading suffices.

 

To the
same effect see Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at
p. 28.

 

     Turning
back to s. 443  as it stood after its amendment, I am in complete agreement 
with Boilard J. when he says (at p. 529, C.C.C.):

 

    [Translation] 
This amendment was not adopted for the sole purpose of codifying the common law
rule which is distilled from the list of decisions set out above.  Parliament
clearly wanted to change the scope of s. 443  and to extend it to all federal
legislation.

 

    In
1985, the words ""or any other Act of Parliament"" were added to paras.
(a) and (b) of s. 443(1) of
the Code.  On a plain reading, s. 443  would thus apply to
proceedings under any federal statute, regardless of whether or not the statute
in question also contains search and seizure provisions.  The use of the word
""any"" unambiguously shows that every single Act of Parliament could
fall within the ambit of these paragraphs.

 

    Further
support for the general application of paras. (a) and (b),
assuming any is needed, is found by reference to para. (e) of s.
443(1), which reveals that when Parliament wanted to restrict the application
of s. 443  it expressly did so.  In para. (e) of s.
443(1), Parliament specifically provided for a restriction to the general
application of this paragraph by making it ""subject to any other Act of
Parliament"".  As the expressio unius est exclusio alterius maxim
suggests, the presence of such a restriction in one paragraph reinforces the
position that Parliament did not intend to restrict the scope of paras. (a) and (b).  I
therefore conclude that s. 443(1)(a) and (b) (now
s. 487(1)(a) and (b)) is applicable to
any federal statute whether or not that statute includes any reference to
search and seizure powers.

 

    I
would accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs.

    Martineau
and a friend, Tremblay, set out armed knowing that they were going to commit a
crime; Martineau testified that he thought it would only be a break and enter. 
Tremblay shot and killed two people after robbing them and their house. 
Martineau allegedly said or thought, after he heard the shot which killed the
first victim, ""Lady, say your prayers"".  As they left, Martineau
asked Tremblay why he killed them and Tremblay answered, ""They saw our
faces"".  Martineau responded, ""But they couldn't see mine 'cause I
had a mask on"".

 

    Respondent
was convicted of second degree murder.  The trial judge charged the jury on
s. 213(a) and (d) and on s. 21(1) 
and (2)  of the Criminal Code .  The Court of
Appeal held that s. 213 (a) was inconsistent
with ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  for reasons given
in R. v. Vaillancourt and that it was not saved by s. 1  of the Charter .  The
Court could not conclude that a conviction should be entered pursuant to
s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code because
the jury had not been not instructed on any portion of s. 212 .

 

    The
constitutional questions queried whether s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  infringed s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Charter , and if
so, whether or not it was justified by s. 1 .

 

    Held
(L'Heureux‑Dubé J. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.  Section
213 (a) of the Criminal Code 
infringes both ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  and is
not justified by s. 1 .

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ.:  The principles of fundamental
justice require that a conviction for murder be based upon proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of subjective foresight of death.  This appeal was disposed of
on the basis of the principle of subjective foresight of death, even though it
could have been disposed of on the basis of objective foreseeability.

 

    The
introductory paragraph of s. 213 (a)
expressly removes the Crown's burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that
the accused had subjective foresight of death.  This section is an anomaly as
regards the other murder provisions, especially in light of the common law
presumption against convicting a person of a true crime without proof of intent
or recklessness.  In a free and democratic society that values the autonomy and
free will of the individual, the stigma and punishment attaching to murder
should be reserved for those who choose intentionally to cause death or who
choose to inflict bodily harm knowing that it is likely to cause death. 
Requiring subjective foresight of death in the context of murder maintains a
proportionality between the stigma and punishment attached to a murder
conviction and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.

 

    A
special mental element with respect to death is necessary before a culpable
homicide can be treated as murder and gives rise to the moral blameworthiness
that justifies the stigma and punishment attaching to a murder conviction.  It
is a principle of fundamental justice that a conviction for murder cannot rest
on anything less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective foresight
of death.  Section 213 of the Code expressly
eliminates the requirement for proof of subjective foresight and therefore
infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

    The
objective of deterring the infliction of bodily harm during the commission of
certain offences because of the increased risk of death is sufficiently
important to warrant overriding a Charter  right.  The
section, however, unduly impairs Charter  rights because it
is not necessary to convict of murder persons who do not intend or foresee the
death in order to achieve this objective.

 

    Since
subjective foresight of death must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before a
conviction for murder can be sustained, the phrase ""ought to know is
likely to cause death"" in s. 212(c) of the Code
probably infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter . 
Section 212 (c) would not likely be saved by s. 1 .

 

    Per Sopinka
J.:  The issue of subjective foresight of death should be addressed only if it
is necessary to do so in order to decide this case or if there is an overriding
reason making it desirable to do so.  Overbroad statements of principle are
inimical to the tradition of incremental development of the common law.  Here,
ruling on the issue of subjective foresight was not necessary for the
disposition of this case because R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 636, applied.  Since objective foreseeability of death is a
constitutional minimum for the definition of murder, the conclusion must follow
that s. 213 (a) does not meet this constitutional minimum.  This
section places a restriction on s. 7  of the Charter  by
permitting a person to be convicted of murder without proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of objective foreseeability of death, or of an equivalent substitute
requirement, and cannot be saved by s. 1  for the reasons expressed by Lamer J.,
as he then was, in Vaillancourt and in the case at
bar.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé J. (dissenting):  Section 213 (a) does
not offend the principles of fundamental justice and accordingly does not
violate ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

    Neither
the subjective foresight of death test nor the objective foreseeability test
violate the principle of fundamental justice.  It has been decided in a number
of cases, including R. v. Vaillancourt, that subjective foresight
of death is not the exclusive standard for murder and no other common law
jurisdiction has adopted that standard as the exclusive standard for murder. 
Significant policy considerations favour upholding the existing legislation.

 

    The
invocation of s. 213 (a) may not have been necessary in the instant case.  The
statement, ""Lady, say your prayers"", whether it was actually said or
thought, reflected a mental state of mind sufficient to anchor a charge under
s. 212(a) which is the only truly subjective foresight murder
provision of the Criminal Code .

 

    The
tests of subjective foresight and objective foreseeability are not static or
distinct concepts and are not mutually exclusive.  In most instances, and
certainly those delineated by s. 213 (a), death
will be both objectively and subjectively foreseeable.  The two are profoundly
interrelated, especially when dealing with a crime committed during the
execution of a predicate crime.  The validity of a provision should not be
evaluated on a strict ""either‑or"" approach.  A fastidious
adherence to prescribed labels becomes particularly obdurate when gauging the
constitutionality of legislation.

 

    Vaillancourt settled
only two legal questions.  First, it established a standard of objective
foreseeability of death for the crime of murder.  Second, it only disposed of
s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code .

 

    The
legislature, rather than simply eliminating any need to prove the essential
element, may substitute proof of a different element.  This will be
constitutionally valid only if, upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of the
substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential element. 
Section 213 (d) could not meet that test; s. 213 (a) does. 
                                                     Section 213 (a) is
completely different in its historical development in its consistency with the
objective foreseeability of death test established in R. v.
Vaillancourt and in the parallel provisions adopted in other common
law jurisdictions.

 

    An
exacting combination of factors must be proven, all beyond a reasonable
doubt, before the accused can be found guilty of murder under s. 213 (a).  The
offender must:  (1) cause the death by committing a ""culpable
homicide""; (2) cause the death while committing or attempting to commit
one of a limited number of very serious, inherently dangerous and specific
intent crimes; (3) intentionally inflict bodily harm while committing one of
these offences; (4) inflict the bodily harm purposefully in order to perpetrate
the underlying crime or to facilitate escape; and (5) the death must ensue from
the bodily harm intentionally inflicted.

 

    No Charter
violation of ss. 7  or 11 (d) takes place if
the test of objective foreseeability has been met.  The accused must
specifically intend to, and actually commit the underlying offence, and must
specifically intend to, and actually inflict bodily harm.  The law necessitates
conclusive proof beyond a reasonable doubt of factors that are collectively
tantamount to an objective foreseeability requirement.  The inexorable
conclusion is that the resulting death is objectively foreseeable.  Neither the
presumption of innocence nor the other reference provisions which give content
and scope to s. 7  are impugned.

 

    How
harm or injury is to be defined and what level of harm or injury is required
are matters for Parliament to consider and decide.  Many factors enter into the
determination of an appropriate penalty for a particular offence; the degree of
blameworthiness is only one.  So long as Parliament does not act irrationally
or arbitrarily or in a manner otherwise inconsistent with the fundamental
principles of justice, its choice must be upheld.

 

    Concentration
on social ""stigma"" is overemphasized, and in the great majority of
cases, completely inapplicable.  The ""stigma"" and punishment attached
to murder need not be proportionate to the mens rea alone. 
Rather they must correspond to the combination of the physical and
mental elements that collectively define a murder.

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ. was
delivered by

 

    LAMER C.J. --
This is the first of a series of appeals that raises the constitutionality of
s. 213(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, (now s. 230 (a), Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ).  The appeal arises as a result
of the application to s. 213 (a) by the Alberta
Court of Appeal of this Court's decision in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 636, in which s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code  was declared of no force or effect because it infringed
ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and
could not be saved by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

Facts

 

    The
facts of this case are not central to the disposition of this appeal, and
therefore, may be briefly summarized as follows. On February 7, 1985 the bodies
of James McLean and Ann McLean were found in the bathroom of their home, a
trailer, in Valleyview, Alberta.  A police investigation led to Martineau and
one Patrick Tremblay.  Martineau, who was fifteen at the time, was charged with
both murders and was transferred to adult court.

 

    Martineau
was tried by a judge and jury starting on September 12, 1985.  Thirty witnesses
gave evidence including the accused.  The evidence revealed that Martineau and
his friend, Tremblay, had set out one evening armed with a pellet pistol and
rifle respectively.  Martineau testified that he knew that they were going to
commit a crime, but that he thought it would only be a ""b and e"". 
After robbing the trailer and its occupants, Martineau's friend Tremblay shot
and killed the McLeans.

 

    As
they left the trailer, Martineau asked Tremblay why he killed them and Tremblay
answered, ""they saw our faces"".  Martineau responded, ""But they
couldn't see mine 'cause I had a mask on"".  They drove James McLean's car
to Grande Prairie where they abandoned it.   The respondent was convicted of
second degree murder.  The trial judge charged the jury on s. 213 (a) and (d) of the Criminal
Code  and on s. 21(1)  and (2)  of the Criminal
Code .

 

Judgment
Below

 

Alberta
Court of Appeal (1988), 61 Alta. L.R. (2d) 264

 

    The
respondent's appeal was first heard in September of 1987 on grounds relating to
the trial judge's charge to the jury.  After the decision of this Court in
Vaillancourt, a re-hearing was ordered before a five-person panel of
the Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal held that, given the law as it then
stood, the charge to the jury could not be criticized.  The Court then
considered the impact of Vaillancourt, and stated the
following interpretation of that case, at p. 274:

 

    The
effect of these passages [from Vaillancourt], in my view, is
to emphasize that s. 213 (d) offends the
Charter , not because Parliament lacks the constitutional power to create a
crime, an element of which is unforeseen or unforeseeable death, but because in
this case three other factors were present.  First, Parliament chose to label
the crime as murder.  Second, it imposed the same punishment as that provided
for an intentional killing.  Third, and perhaps most important, that punishment
is mandatory life imprisonment, as severe a punishment as is available in
Canadian law.  The combined effect of these three factors was to proclaim that
an unforeseen and unforeseeable killing was the moral equal of an intended
killing, a proposition so inaccurate as to be unjust.

 

The
Court of Appeal then drew the following conclusion, at pp. 277-78:

 

    In
my opinion, s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code  must be held to be inconsistent
with ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  for the reasons given in
Vaillancourt with respect to s. 213 (d).  The
section is not restricted to situations where there was an intention to inflict
an injury of a life threatening nature.  An accused person may find himself
within the ambit of s. 213 (a) even though he did not foresee, and could not
reasonably have foreseen, that death would likely result from the injury which
he intended to inflict.

 

The
Court went on to hold that the section could not be saved by s. 1  of the Charter .  Since
the jury was not instructed on any portion of s. 212  of the Criminal
Code , the Court could not conclude that a conviction should
be entered pursuant to s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.  The
Court quashed the convictions and ordered a new trial.

 

Legislation

 

Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 213(a)

 

    213.  Culpable homicide is murder where a
person causes the death of a human being while committing or attempting to
commit high treason or treason or an offence mentioned in section 52
(sabotage), 76 (piratical acts), 76.1 (hijacking an aircraft), 132 or
subsection 133(1) or sections 134 to 136 (escape or rescue from prison or
lawful custody), section 246 (assaulting a police officer), section 246.1
(sexual assault), 246.2 (sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party
or causing bodily harm), 246.3 (aggravated sexual assault), 247 (kidnapping and
forcible confinement), 302 (robbery), 306 (breaking and entering) or 389 or 390
(arson), whether or not the person means to cause death to any human being and
whether or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any human being,
if

 

    (a)  he means to cause bodily harm for the purpose of

 

(i)  facilitating the commission of the offence, or

 

(ii)  facilitating his flight after committing or
attempting to commit the offence,

 

and the
death ensues from the bodily harm;

 

Issues

 

The
following constitutional questions were stated by Chief Justice Dickson:

 

1.Does s. 213(a) of the Criminal
Code  infringe or deny the rights or freedoms guaranteed by
s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2If the
answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 213(a)
justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

Analysis

 

    Parliament,
of course, decides what a crime is to be, and has the power to define the
elements of a crime.  With the advent of the Charter  in
1982, Parliament also has, however, directed the courts to review those
definitions to ensure that they are in accordance with the principles of
fundamental justice.  We, as a Court, would be remiss not to heed this command
of Parliament.  This is an unassailable proposition since the decision of
Parliament to entrench into our constitutional framework a Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms and also the principle that the Constitution is the supreme law of
the land.  Since 1982, this Court has consistently assumed its duty to measure
the content of legislation against the guarantees in our Charter
designed to protect individual rights and freedoms.  See for example Singh v.
Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R.
177; Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486; and R. v.
Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103.

 

    In R. v.
Vaillancourt, supra, s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code  was declared of no force or effect because it violated
ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  The ratio of
Vaillancourt, strictly speaking, was that it is a principle of
fundamental justice that before a person could be convicted of murder there
must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt of at least objective foreseeability of
death.  The impugned section in that case did not accord with this principle
because it would be possible for a conviction for murder to occur under
s. 213 (d) despite the jury's having a reasonable doubt as to
whether the accused ought to have known that death was likely to ensue.  

 

    In
Vaillancourt I analyzed a number of matters, including s. 213
of the Code in the context of the other murder provisions, the
historical development of s. 213 , felony murder provisions in other jurisdictions,
the essential elements of certain crimes at common law, and the principles of
fundamental justice under the Charter  and their
application to s. 213 of the Code.  As a result of this analysis I
concluded that objective foreseeability of death was the minimum threshold test
before a conviction for murder could be sustained.  I went on to state,
however, that it was my view that the principles of fundamental justice require
more; they demand that a conviction for murder requires proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of subjective foresight of death.  The Chief Justice, Estey and Wilson
JJ. agreed with that position.  I am still of that view today, and indeed,
while I agree with the Alberta Court of Appeal and could dispose of this appeal
on the basis of objective foreseeability, it is on the basis of the principle
of subjective foresight of death that I choose to dispose of this appeal.  I
choose this route because I would not want this case, a very serious matter, to
return to this Court once again on the grounds that there is some doubt as to
the validity of the portion of s. 212(c) of the Code that
allows for a conviction for murder if the accused ""ought to know""
that death is likely to result.  I need not, therefore, repeat the analysis
from Vaillancourt here, except to add some brief observations as regards
s. 213 (a) and the principle of fundamental justice that
subjective foresight of death is required before a conviction for murder can be
sustained.

 

    Section
213(a) of the Code defines culpable
homicide as murder where a person causes the death of a human being while
committing or attempting to commit a range of listed offences, whether or not
the person means to cause death or whether or not he or she knows that death is
likely to ensue if that person means to cause bodily harm for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of the offence or flight after committing or
attempting to commit the offence.  The introductory paragraph of the section,
therefore, expressly removes from the Crown the burden of proving beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused had subjective foresight of death.  This
section stands as an anomaly as regards the other murder provisions, especially
in light of the common law presumption against convicting a person of a true
crime without proof of intent or recklessness:  R. v. Sault Ste.
Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at pp. 1309-10, per Dickson
J., as he then was.

 

    A
conviction for murder carries with it the most severe stigma and punishment of
any crime in our society.  The principles of fundamental justice require,
because of the special nature of the stigma attached to a conviction for
murder, and the available penalties, a mens rea
reflecting the particular nature of that crime.  The effect of s. 213  is to
violate the principle that punishment must be proportionate to the moral
blameworthiness of the offender, or as Professor Hart puts it in Punishment
and Responsibility (1968), at p. 162, the fundamental principle of a
morally based system of law that those causing harm intentionally be punished
more severely than those causing harm unintentionally.  The rationale
underlying the principle that subjective foresight of death is required before
a person is labelled and punished as a murderer is linked to the more general
principle that criminal liability for a particular result is not justified
except where the actor possesses a culpable mental state in respect of that
result:  see R. v. Bernard, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 833, per McIntyre J., and R. v. Buzzanga and
Durocher (1979), 49 C.C.C. (2d) 369 (Ont. C.A.), per Martin
J.A.  In my view, in a free and democratic society that values the autonomy and
free will of the individual, the stigma and punishment attaching to the most
serious of crimes, murder, should be reserved for those who choose to
intentionally cause death or who choose to inflict bodily harm that they know
is likely to cause death.  The essential role of requiring subjective foresight
of death in the context of murder is to maintain a proportionality between the
stigma and punishment attached to a murder conviction and the moral
blameworthiness of the offender.  Murder has long been recognized as the
""worst"" and most heinous of peace time crimes.  It is, therefore,
essential that to satisfy the principles of fundamental justice, the stigma and
punishment attaching to a murder conviction must be reserved for those who
either intend to cause death or who intend to cause bodily harm that they know
will likely cause death.  In this regard, I refer to the following works as
support for my position, in addition to those cited in
Vaillancourt:  Cross, ""The Mental Element in Crime""
(1967), 83 L.Q.R. 215; Ashworth, ""The Elasticity
of Mens Rea,"" in Crime, Proof and Punishment (1981);
Williams, The Mental Element in Crime (1965); and
Williams, ""Convictions and Fair Labelling"", [1983] 42
C.L.J. 85.

 

    In
sum then, I am of the view that a special mental element with respect to death
is necessary before a culpable homicide can be treated as murder.  That special
mental element gives rise to the moral blameworthiness that justifies the
stigma and punishment attaching to a murder conviction.  For all the foregoing
reasons, and for the reasons stated in Vaillancourt, I
conclude that it is a principle of fundamental justice that a conviction for
murder cannot rest on anything less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt of
subjective foresight of death.  That was my position when
Vaillancourt was decided, and that is my position today.  Therefore,
since s. 213 of the Code expressly eliminates the requirement
for proof of subjective foresight, it infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

    As
regards s. 1  of the Charter , there is no doubt that the objective
of deterring the infliction of bodily harm during the commission of certain offences
because of the increased risk of death is of sufficient importance to warrant
overriding a Charter  right.  Further, indiscriminately
punishing for murder all those who cause death irrespective of whether they
intended to cause death might well be thought to discourage the infliction of
bodily harm during the commission of certain offences because of the increased
risk of death.  But it is not necessary in order to achieve this objective to
convict of murder persons who do not intend or foresee the death.  In this
regard the section unduly impairs the Charter 
rights.  If Parliament wishes to deter persons from causing bodily harm during
certain offences, then it should punish persons for causing the bodily harm. 
Indeed, the conviction for manslaughter that would result instead of a
conviction for murder is punishable by, from a day in jail to confinement for
life.  Very stiff sentences for the infliction of bodily harm leading to death
in appropriate cases would sufficiently meet any deterrence objective that
Parliament might have in mind.  The more flexible sentencing scheme under a
conviction for manslaughter is in accord with the principle that punishment be
meted out with regard to the level of moral blameworthiness of the offender. 
To label and punish a person as a murderer who did not intend or foresee death
unnecessarily stigmatizes and punishes those whose moral blameworthiness is not
that of a murderer, and thereby unnecessarily impairs the rights guaranteed by
ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  In my view then,
s. 213 (a), indeed all of s. 213 , cannot be saved by
s. 1  of the Charter . 

 

    The
fact that I have based my reasons on the principle of subjective foresight
casts serious if not fatal doubt on the constitutionality of part of
s. 212(c) of the Code, specifically the
words ""ought to know is likely to cause death"".  The validity of
s. 212(c) of the Code has not been
directly attacked in this appeal, but the Court has had the benefit of hearing
argument from the Attorney General of Canada and from the Attorneys General for
Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba, who chose to
intervene, on the issue of whether subjective foresight or objective
foreseeability of death is the constitutionally required minimum mens rea for
murder.  In my view, subjective foresight of death must be proven beyond a
reasonable doubt before a conviction for murder can be sustained, and as a
result, it is obvious the part of s. 212(c) of the Code
allowing for a conviction upon proof that the accused ought to have known that
death was likely to result violates ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  I
find further support for this view in the following passage from Professor
Stuart's treatise Canadian Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1987), at
pp. 217-18, dealing specifically with the objective element of s. 212(c) of the Code and the
principle of subjective foresight:

 

    This is a clear instance where our legislation has
not kept up with developments in other jurisdictions.  We have seen that a
similar objective test for murder resorted to by the House of Lords in the
notorious decision in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Smith (1960)
[[1961] A.C. 290 [1960] 3 All E.R. 161 (H.L.)] was rejected by the British
Legislature and by the Australian High Court.  Very few jurisdictions,
including those in the United States, resort to anything but the subjective
approach in defining murder.  The only direct parallels to our section 212(c) are to
be found in the codes of Queensland, Tasmania, and New Zealand.  The wording in
these provisions is almost identical to ours except that in New Zealand the
words ""or ought to have known"" were deleted as a result of a quick
and firm rejection of Smith.  The New Zealand section now reads
in part:

 

... if
the offender for any unlawful object does an act that he knows to be likely to
cause death, and thereby kills any person, though he may have desired that his
object should be effected without hurting anyone.

 

    Indeed,
Lord Goff in his article ""The Mental Element in the Crime of Murder""
(1988), 104 L.Q.R. 30, at p. 36, had this to say about
the Smith decision and about objective foreseeability as a test
for murder:

 

This
decision was very much criticised, by judge and jurist alike.  What they
disliked about it was that it imposed an objective instead of a subjective test
for ascertaining the existence of the relevant mental element for the crime of
murder.  In due course, it was reversed by statute; later, on an appeal from a
jurisdiction where that statute did not apply at the relevant time, Smith was, in
effect, held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to have been
wrongly decided (see Frankland and Moore v. R.),
[1987] 2 W.L.R. 1251.  So the objective test was never part of the common
law, properly understood; and we can now forget about it.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

    Although
it would be open to save that part of s. 212(c) under
s. 1  of the Charter , it seems to me that the attempt
would fail for the reasons I have given in respect of the attempt to similarly
save s. 213 of the Code.   I would therefore answer the
constitutional questions as follows:

 

Q:Does
s. 213(a) of the Criminal Code 
infringe or deny the rights or freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or
s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A:Yes, the section infringes both ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

Q:If the
answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 213(a)
justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    A:No.

 

    The
only remaining issue is the potential application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
(now s. 686(1)(b)(iii)) of the Criminal Code .  The
Court of Appeal for Alberta declined to invoke the section and enter a
conviction for the following reason, at p. 279:

 

The jury
in this case was not instructed on any portion of s. 212.  I am unable to
say that a properly instructed jury must necessarily have found that the
appellant had, at some point, the requisite intention under that section rather
than being carried along by events.

 

    I
agree.  In the present case, the respondent was convicted pursuant to a
combination of ss. 213 and 21 of the Code.  Since
in this case the jury was left only with s. 213 which has been declared to
be inoperative, a new trial must be ordered.  Accordingly, the Court of
Appeal's decision quashing the convictions and directing a new trial is
affirmed.  The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé
J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    L'HEUREUX-DUBÉ J.
(dissenting) -- I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons of Chief Justice
Lamer, and with respect, I must dissent.  I fully agree with my colleague's
characterization, at p. 000,  of this Court's ""duty to measure the content
of legislation against the guarantees in our Charter
designed to protect individual rights and freedoms"" while however, in my
view, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  is not
impermeable to the rights of the collectivity.  I also heartily concur with my
colleague's assertion that this Court is directed to review, when challenged,
Parliament's definitions of the elements of a crime to ensure that they are in
accordance with fundamental justice.  In my view, however, this Court must stop
short of effectively legislating on its own.  The question should not be what
is the ""best"" test, but rather what is a constitutionally valid test.

 

    The
following constitutional questions were stated by Chief Justice Dickson:

 

1.Does s. 213(a) [now
s. 230 (a)] of the Criminal Code 
infringe or deny the rights or freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 213(a)
justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    The
same constitutional questions were stated in R. v. Rodney, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 000, heard concurrently, judgment also rendered concurrently.  R. v.
Logan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, R. v. Arkell, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 000 and R. v. Luxton, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000, were also heard and are released concurrently with this appeal.  Logan deals
with the constitutionality of s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, Arkell with s. 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code , and Luxton with s. 214(5) (e) of the Criminal
Code .  The latter two appeals also raise the
constitutionality of s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code , which
is the focus of the present appeal.

 

    Section
213  of the Criminal Code  reads as follows:

 

    213. Culpable homicide is murder where a
person causes the death of a human being while committing or attempting to
commit high treason or treason or an offence mentioned in section 52
(sabotage), 76 (piratical acts), 76.1 (hijacking an aircraft), 132 or
subsection 133(1) or sections 134 to 136 (escape or rescue from prison or lawful
custody), section 246 (assaulting a peace officer), section 246.1 (sexual
assault), 246.2 (sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or
causing bodily harm), 246.3 (aggravated sexual assault), 247 (kidnapping and
forcible confinement), 302 (robbery), 306 (breaking and entering) or 389 or 390
(arson), whether or not the person means to cause death to any human being and
whether or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any human being,
if 

 

(a) he means to cause bodily harm for the purpose of 

 

(i) facilitating the commission of the offence, or

 

(ii) facilitating his flight after committing or
attempting to commit the offence,

 

and the death ensues from the bodily harm;

 

(b) he administers a stupefying or overpowering thing for
a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a), and the death
ensues therefrom;

 

(c) he wilfully stops, by any means, the breath of a human
being for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a), and
the death ensues therefrom; or

 

(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon his person

 

(i) during or at the time he commits or attempts to
commit the offence, or

 

(ii) during or at the time of his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence,

 

and the
death ensues as a consequence.

 

    My
colleague concludes that s. 213 (a) is
unconstitutional because it violates ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  and
cannot be saved by s. 1 .  In his opinion, the principles of fundamental justice
demand that subjective foresight of death be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
before a conviction for murder can be secured.  I reach a contrary conclusion
on the basis that subjective foresight is not the only appropriate standard
that can be applied to conform to ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  My
reasons are as follows:  the test of objective foreseeability of death for the
crime of murder does not offend the principles of fundamental justice; this
Court's decisions, including R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636, do not commend such a result; the exclusive standard of subjective
foresight of death for the crime of murder has found no parallel in other
common law jurisdictions; and there are significant policy considerations in
favour of upholding the existing legislation.

 

    Before
discussing the substantive legal issues, I wish to recall the particular facts
of this case.  Martineau and a friend, Tremblay, had set out one evening armed
with a pellet pistol and rifle.  Martineau had the pellet pistol and Tremblay
had the rifle.  Martineau's testimony is unclear as to when he first saw the
rifle.  Martineau testified that he knew that they were going to commit a crime
which he thought would be a ""b & e"" (breaking and entering, which
is one of the predicate crimes mentioned in s. 213 ).  They forced their way
into a trailer and Martineau put a quilt over the occupant, James McLean's
head, and Tremblay tied his hands.  The female occupant, Ann McLean, then came
home and was similarly covered and bound.  Martineau testified that as soon as
he heard the first shot, he realized that James McLean had been shot.  He then
either said, or thought, ""Lady, say your prayers"".  He did nothing to
stop his friend from proceeding further.  Ann McLean was then shot and killed
by Tremblay.  During cross-examination, Martineau admitted that he knew James
McLean had been shot before Ann McLean was shot.

 

    Martineau's
testimony did not account for some of the physical evidence in the trailer. 
There were bullet casings from the rifle and bullet holes showing that it had
been fired more often than recounted by Martineau.  There was also evidence
that there were pools of blood in three rooms of the trailer and that the man
had suffered a protracted beating prior to his death and was also probably
dragged about.

 

    In
the trial judge's charge to the jury both s. 213 (a) and (d) were
reviewed and the jury was informed that if the Crown could prove the accused
was a party then he would be just as guilty as if he had pulled the trigger. 
After explaining the meaning of aiding and abetting the trial judge proposed to
the jury that they proceed in the following sequence:  First, consider whether
the Crown had proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, based upon s. 21(1) (b) and (c), and
s. 213 (d), with respect to both counts of murder; next, if the
Crown's case did not meet that test, they were to consider s. 21(2) as it
related to s. 213 (d) on both counts; finally, if the Crown did not meet
this onus, they were to consider s. 21(1) (a) and (b) in
conjunction with s. 213 (a), as they related only to the death of the female
occupant, Ann McLean.  The accused was convicted of two counts of second degree
murder.

 

    While
s. 21 of the Criminal Code  was included in
the charge to the jury, its constitutionality is not at issue in this appeal. 
Section 21  reads:

 

21. (1) Every one is a party to an offence who

 

(a) actually commits it,

 

(b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding
any person to commit it; or

 

(c) abets any person in committing it.

 

    (2)
Where two or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful
purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of them, in carrying out
the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have
known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of
carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence.

 

    The
accused's appeal from his convictions was first heard exclusively on grounds
relating to the trial judge's charge to the jury.  The Court of Appeal (1988),
61 Alta. L.R. (2d) 264,  found that the judge's charge to the jury was
appropriate given the state of the law at the time of trial.  However,
following this Court's decision in Vaillancourt, a re-hearing was
ordered.  As a result of Vaillancourt, s. 213(d) had
been rendered unconstitutional.  It failed to meet the objective foreseeability
of death test for the crime of murder.  Therefore, only the third component of
the trial judge's instructions, s. 213(a) as it
applies to the killing of Ann McLean, remains to be examined.

 

    I
would like to point out that the invocation of s. 213(a) may
not have been necessary.  In my view, ""Lady, say your prayers"",
whether it was actually said or thought, reflects a mental state of mind
sufficient to anchor a charge under s. 212(a), the
only truly subjective foresight murder provision of the Criminal
Code :

 

212. Culpable homicide is murder

 

(a)                        where the person who causes the
death of a human being

 

(i)  means to cause his death, or

 

(ii) means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is
likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;

 

However,
the prosecution chose to proceed under s. 213(a), and
the trial judge charged the jury accordingly.  Hence, the necessity to deal
with this provision here.

 

    My
colleague has chosen to introduce subjective foresight of death as the exclusive
standard for the crime of murder.  In his view, anything short of that
requirement would render a provision constitutionally infirm.  Given this
inauguration in the criminal law, it may be helpful to discuss both the
distinction and the interrelationship between subjective foresight and
objective foreseeability.

 

I.   Subjective
Foresight v. Objective Foreseeability

 

    Definitionally,
a standard of subjective foresight to ground criminal responsibility dictates
that:

 

. . . the trier of fact must determine what was actually
going on in the mind of this particular accused at the time in question.  This
is variously stated as a requirement of awareness, conscious thought,
advertence or simply a requirement that the person was actually thinking.

 

                                                                        .
. .

 

What is vital is that this accused given
his personality, situation and circumstances, actually intended, knew or
foresaw the consequence and/or circumstances as the case may be.  [Stuart, Canadian
Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1987), at pp. 121, 123.]

 

    In The Common
Law, Holmes discussed objective foreseeability, at pp. 53-54, as follows:

 

If the
known present state of things is such that the act done will very certainly
cause death, and the probability is a matter of common knowledge, one who does
the act, knowing the present state of things, is guilty of murder, and the law
will not inquire whether he did actually foresee the consequences or not.  The
test of foresight is not what this very criminal foresaw, but what a man of
reasonable prudence would have foreseen.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Gordon,
""Subjective and Objective Mens Rea"", [1975] 17 Crim. L.Q. 355, at
p. 359, not only discusses distinctions between subjective foresight and
objective foreseeability, but also the interrelationship between them:

 

. . .
what is important in the context of proof of mens rea is that
certain objective descriptions of actions are in themselves descriptions of
intentional actions, so that once the Crown has proved what happened they
have established their case, and need not go on to prove separately the
existence of some particular event or condition in the agent's mind.  In these
cases proof of the external behaviour is proof that he was acting
intentionally; his only defence, unless of course he can show he was not a
voluntary agent, is to show that the objective description offered by the Crown
is incorrect, by producing witnesses who describe as an accident what the Crown
witnesses describe as intentional, by showing, e.g., that
he did not push the victim but accidentally fell against him.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

    Furthermore,
at p. 368:

 

    We
resort to the reasonable man in an endeavour to make it possible for the Crown
to prove mens rea.  We stress that
the reasonable man is only a tool to help us discover the accused man's state
of mind; that the law goes no further than to entitle the jury to apply this
tool to conclude that the accused had the mens rea of the
reasonable man; and that they are not obliged so to conclude.  But very often
we have nothing other than the reasonable man to guide us, so the difference
between the position I have just described, and a rule that the accused may be
held to have acted with a particular intent, if any reasonable man must have
had that intent, is not a real one.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Mewett
& Manning, Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1985)
also addresses the association between subjective foresight and objective
foreseeability.  When assessing the accused's own state of mind, certain
inferences may be drawn from the circumstances surrounding the event at issue. 
As they point out at p. 138:

 

[The
question becomes] whether this is really an objective test or is merely a
disguised evidentiary technique for determining what the accused actually
foresaw.  If the accused were to say that he did not anticipate events that a
reasonable man, given the facts as actually appreciated by the accused, would
have anticipated, one may wonder whether the jury would have any difficulty in
finding that the accused ""must have"" anticipated them, thus finding
not only that a reasonable man would have anticipated them but that the accused
actually did appreciate them in spite of what he says.

 

    As
Gordon, supra, expressed it, at p. 371:

 

. . .
what is more likely to happen, is that the innocent man will be so nervous and
unskilled that he will make a bad witness, while the man the jury believes will
be the plausible psychopath.  One of the problems of an excessively
""subjective"" approach is that it is likely to feed what I often fear
is an unfounded conceit in our ability to gauge a witness' truthfulness by his
demeanor.  

 

    Gordon
feels that the ultimate distinction is a ""moral"" one.  In some
instances, the subjective failure to foresee certain consequences of one's
criminal activity may merit greater public opprobrium than the assumption of a
foreseen calculated risk of death.  This recognition warrants a classification
whereby flagrant callous, ruthless, or selfish acts causing death, perpetrated
by one whose purpose is already criminal, will be treated more harshly than a
mere accidental killing.  As Gordon explains at pp. 389-90:

 

    If, then, it is appropriate to classify certain
forms of unintentional killing in a way which distinguishes them from grossly
negligent killing, what should be the basis of the classification?  Well, the
main purpose of the classification, perhaps the only purpose since the
disappearance of capital punishment, is stigmatization, and the basis of the
classification should be, simply, moral guilt. . . .  We should distinguish the
most heinous, from the not quite so bad, and from the merely venial.  And the
assessment of moral guilt depends on a view of the whole circumstances, and not
on the distinction between the presence or absence of a particular mental event
such as the foresight and acceptance of a risk. 

 

                                                                        .
. . 

 

. . .
any realistic approach to the problem must recognize that what is ultimately
in issue is the community's moral judgment on the accused's behaviour, and not
the satisfaction of a legal formula.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
above analysis indicates that tests of subjective foresight and objective
foreseeability cannot be seen as static or distinct concepts.  They are
certainly not mutually exclusive.  In most instances, and certainly in those
limited circumstances delineated by s. 213(a),
discussed below, death will be both objectively and subjectively foreseeable. 
There is a profound interrelationship between the two, especially when dealing
with a crime committed during the execution of a predicate crime.  The validity
of a provision should not be evaluated on a strict ""either-or""
approach, and a fastidious adherence to prescribed labels becomes particularly
obdurate when gauging the constitutionality of Parliamentary legislation.

 

II.   R. v.
Vaillancourt

 

    My
colleague suggests that Vaillancourt bears potently
upon the present appeal.  However, Vaillancourt settled only two
legal questions, and this critical feature of the decision must be kept in mind
before it is applied to any subsequent holdings of this Court.  First,
Vaillancourt established a standard of objective
foreseeability of death for the crime of murder.  Second, the decision only
disposed of s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code , and no
other.  Any discussion relating to subjective standards or to the
constitutional survival of any other provisions was strictly obiter. 
Furthermore, to the extent that such discussion did take place, it did so only
in one of the four separate opinions rendered.

 

    The
facts themselves in Vaillancourt negated mens rea as Vaillancourt
testified that, at the time of the robbery during which the killing occurred,
he was convinced that his accomplice's gun was unloaded.  He had agreed to
commit the robbery on the condition that only knives were to be used as
weapons.  When his accomplice arrived with a gun, Vaillancourt insisted that
the bullets be removed, and he subsequently placed these bullets in a glove
which was later recovered by the police at the scene and produced at trial. 
Given these facts, it seems unlikely that Vaillancourt, or any reasonable
person in his position, had reason to foresee that anyone would be killed in
the course of the robbery.  Unlike the accused in the present appeal,
Vaillancourt could not have been prosecuted under any provision except for s. 213(d). 
Section 213(d) did not impose the stringent criteria that must be
proven before a conviction under s. 213(a) can be
secured.  Under section 213(d), death caused by the commission of any of the crimes
listed in s. 213 was murder, if

 

213.  . . .

 

(d) [the offender] uses a weapon or has it upon his person

 

(i) during or at the time he commits or attempts to
commit the offence, or

 

(ii) during or at the time of his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence,

 

and the
death ensues as a consequence.

 

Admittedly,
under this definition, an offender could theoretically be convicted for murder
while only minimally to blame for causing death.  No intention to injure,
physically impair, or to even use a weapon was required.  Under section 213(d),
anyone who resisted a police officer during the course of an arrest, and
happened to have a weapon on his person which accidentally discharged causing
death, would be labelled a murderer.  No intentional use of the weapon in any
fashion was required.

 

    In
Vaillancourt, Lamer J. (as he then was) determined, at p. 654, that:

 

. . . it
is a principle of fundamental justice that, absent proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of at least objective foreseeability, there surely cannot be a murder
conviction.

 

    Furthermore,
my colleague's specific displeasure with s. 213(d)
emanated from the possibility that a jury could convict in the shadow of
""a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused ought to have known that
death was likely to ensue"", at p. 657:

 

. . . if
Parliament frames the section so that, upon proof of the conduct, it would be
unreasonable for a jury not to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused ought to have known that death was likely to ensue, then I think that
Parliament has enacted a crime which is tantamount to one which has
objective foreseeability as an essential element, and, if objective
foreseeability is sufficient, then it would not be in violation of s. 7  or s.
11 (d) in doing so in that way. 
[Emphasis added].

 

Hence
the proposed test is whether the mens rea requirement under
s. 213(d) was such that it must be apparent to the reasonable
person in similar circumstances that death was likely to ensue. This mens rea
requirement is an essential element that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt, at p. 656:

 

. . .
the legislature, rather than simply eliminating any need to prove the essential
element, may substitute proof of a different element.  In my view, this will be
constitutionally valid only if upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of the
substituted element it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential element.

 

    Section
213(d) could not meet that test.  Section 213(a) does. 
Section 213(d) had substituted proof of a different element in a
manner that could leave a jury in doubt as to the objective foreseeability of
the likelihood that death would be caused.  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt of
objective foreseeability of death was replaced with proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of the intention to commit or attempt to commit one of the enumerated
predicate crimes, coupled with the intent to use a weapon or have it upon one's
person.

 

    In
Vaillancourt, Lamer J. found that this was an invalid substitution,
and that the objective foreseeability test was not met.  He also made obiter
remarks, at p. 654, to the effect that:

 

I am
presently of the view that it is a principle of fundamental justice that a
conviction for murder cannot rest on anything less than proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of subjective foresight.

 

    This
notion of ""subjective mental element"" from the reasons of Lamer J. in
Vaillancourt is neither constitutionally mandated nor necessitated
by elemental principles of the criminal law.  The insistence on a subjective
foresight requirement was not germane to the decision in
Vaillancourt.  The obiter statements were
endorsed by only four of the eight Justices who participated in
Vaillancourt.  Beetz J. (for himself and Le Dain J.), at p. 661,
held that:

 

. . . I
do not find it necessary to decide whether there exists a principle of
fundamental justice that a conviction for murder cannot rest on anything less
than proof beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective foresight.

 

La
Forest J. held at p. 665 that:

 

. . .
the principles of fundamental justice require a mens rea
reflecting the particular nature of that crime, namely one referable to causing
death.  In addition to the intention to cause death, this can include a
closely related intention such as intention to cause bodily harm likely to
result in death combined with recklessness as to that result.  [Emphasis
added.] 

 

    McIntyre
J. dissented, and quoted Martin J.A. in R. v. Munro and Munro (1983),
8 C.C.C. (3d) 260, that the required mens rea element
""is a matter for Parliament and not for the courts"".

 

    The
other four Justices also exercised deliberate prudence to address only s. 213(d), and
not speak to the other paragraphs under s. 213.  As La Forest J. held at p.
665:

 

It is
sufficient to say that the mental element required by s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code  is so remote from the intention specific to murder
...if,  then that a conviction under that paragraph violates fundamental
justice.  All the provision requires is an intention to commit another
crime and to possess a weapon while carrying out this intention or in fleeing
afterwards.  The provision is so broad that under it a person may be found
guilty of murder even though the death was the result of an accident.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

Beetz
J., for himself and Le Dain J., held at p. 661:

 

I agree
that s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code  does not conform to the principles of fundamental
justice. . . . [Emphasis added.]

 

Recognizing
the difference between the two provisions, the discussion of s. 213 (a) was
reserved for a later day.  Today is that day.

 

III.  Section
213 (a) of the Criminal
Code 

 

    Vaillancourt held
that s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code 
violated ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and
could not be saved by s. 1 .  Section 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  is completely different --in its historical
development, in its consistency with the objective foreseeability of death test
established in Vaillancourt, and in the
parallel provisions adopted in other common law jurisdictions.

 

(a)  
Historical Background

 

    The
historical background to s. 213 (a) reveals that it
must be analyzed in a fundamentally different manner than s. 213 (d).  The
language of s. 213 (a) can be traced as far back as Coke, The Third
Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England (6th ed. 1680),
where at p. 47, murder was defined as the killing of any human ""with
malice forethought, either expressed by the party, or implied by Law"".  By
the early part of the nineteenth century the rule had crystallized: if during
the commission of an unrelated felony the perpetrator unintentionally killed
someone, he was guilty of murder and not merely manslaughter:  Archbold, Pleading
and Evidence (1822).  The British Parliamentary Papers
""Criminal Law"" 1879, vol. 6, stated at pp. 468-70:

 

For
practical purposes we can make no distinction between a man who shoots another
through the head, expressly meaning to kill him, a man who strikes another a
violent blow with a sword, careless whether he dies of it or not, and a man
who, intending for some object of his own, to stop the passage of a railway
train, contrives an explosion of dynamite or gunpowder under the engine, hoping
indeed that death may not be caused, but determined to effect his purpose
whether it is so caused or not.

 

    The
equivalent of section 213 (a), (b), and (c) [now s. 230 (a), (b), (c)] was
incorporated as part of Canada's first Criminal Code  in
1892.  Paragraph (d) did not exist, nor had it even been recommended by any
of the Commissioners' Reports.  It did not appear until 55 years later, in the
1947 version of the Criminal Code .  It represented
an attempt by Parliament to reverse this Court's decision in R. v.
Hughes (1942), 78  C.C.C. 257, that homicide committed by the
accidental discharge of a firearm by an accused during a robbery does not
amount to murder.  One writer has commented that this new amendment was indeed
a ""strange bedfellow"" when compared to the rest of s. 213 :  Edwards,
""Constructive Murder in Canadian and English Law"" (1959), 3 Crim. L.Q. 481, at
p. 491.

 

    Section
213 (a) is much more restrictive than the common law rule. 
The bodily harm inflicted by the perpetrator must have been done for the
purpose of facilitating the commission of the offence or the subsequent flight
of the offender.  Furthermore, only a narrowly circumscribed list of predicate
criminal offences can trigger the application of the section.  Under the old
common law rule, a killing in the midst of any felony would support a
charge of murder.

 

    Admittedly,
up until the 1955 version of the Criminal Code ,
culpable homicide was murder if the accused meant to inflict
""grievous"" bodily harm for the purpose of facilitating the commission
of the underlying offence or flight from it.  For ""grievous bodily
harm"", the injury did not have to be ""either permanent or dangerous,
if it be such as seriously to interfere with comfort or health, it is
sufficient"":  R. v. Ashman (1858) 1 F. &
F. 88, 175 E.R. 638; R. v. Archibald (1898), 4 C.C.C.
159 (Ont. H.C.); R. v. Bottrell (1981), 60 C.C.C.
(2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.).

 

    The
common law definition of ""bodily harm"" has been substantially
incorporated in s. 245.1(2)  of the Criminal Code , and
means ""any hurt or injury to the complainant that interferes with the
health or comfort of the complainant and that is more than merely transient or
trifling"".  As Laycraft C.J. pointed out at the Court of Appeal, at p.
277:

 

The
addition of the word ""grievous"" to the term merely added the
connotation of ""serious""; in neither case would the injury
necessarily be life threatening.

 

    Senator
Hayden, who had served on the committee considering the amended Code in
1953, explained in the Proceedings of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, June 27, 1961, at p. 41:

 

There
would not be any charge unless death resulted, and then there is the bodily
harm which caused the death.  We felt that ""grievous"" in most
circumstances was only a complication.  If a man means to administer or to do
bodily harm to the extent that would enable him to commit any of the enumerated
offences, and death results, then we felt that that was enough to constitute
murder.

 

    Section
213 (d) did not require any intent on the part
of the perpetrator to do bodily injury.  It only required, minimally, that one
of the participants possess a weapon which accidentally discharged and caused
death.  That is a substantially discounted mental element, one much lower than
that required under s. 213 (a).

 

(b)    Section
213 (a) Passes the Objective Foreseeability Test

 

    An
exacting combination of factors must be proven, all beyond a reasonable
doubt, before the accused can be found guilty of murder under this section.  
The offender must:

 

(1)cause the death by means of the commission of a
""culpable homicide"";

 

(2)cause the death while committing or attempting to
commit one of a limited number of very serious crimes all of which are, by
their very nature, inherently dangerous;

 

(3)intentionally inflict bodily harm while committing
one of these inherently dangerous offences, all of which are specific intent
crimes;

 

(4)inflict the bodily harm purposefully in order to
perpetrate the dangerous underlying crime or for the purpose of facilitating
his flight; and

 

(5)the death must ensue from the bodily harm
intentionally inflicted.

 

    It
should be noted that in the present case the underlying offence was committed,
and the intent to inflict bodily harm was clear.  Moreover, this amalgamation
of indispensable prerequisites establishes that this crime, as phrased by Lamer
J. in Vaillancourt, is ""tantamount to one which has objective
foreseeability as an essential element, and, if objective foreseeability is
sufficient, then it would not be in violation of s. 7  or s. 11 (d) in
doing so in that way"".  I am of the view that in light of these
requirements, the test of objective foreseeability is sufficient, and that if
that test has been met, then no Charter  violation has
taken place.  The above list requires that the accused specifically intend to,
and actually commit the underlying offence, and specifically intend to, and
actually inflict bodily harm.  In my view, the inexorable conclusion is that
the resulting death is objectively foreseeable. 

 

    Those
who are critical of all forms of the ""felony-murder"" rule base their
denunciation on the premise that mens rea is the exclusive
determinant of the level of ""stigma"" that is properly applied to an
offender.  This appears to me to confuse some very fundamental principles of
criminal law and ignores the pivotal contribution of actus reus to the
definition and appropriate response to proscribed criminal offences.  If both
components, actus reus as well as mens rea, are
not considered when assessing the level of fault attributable to an offender,
we would see manslaughter and assault causing bodily harm as no more worthy of
condemnation than an assault.  Mere attempts would become as serious as full
offences.  The whole correlation between the consequences of a criminal act and
its retributive repercussions would become obscured by a stringent and
exclusive examination of the accused's own asserted intentions.

 

    As
stated in Crump and Crump, ""In Defense of the Felony Murder Doctrine""
(1985), 8 Harv. J. of L. and P.P. 359, at p. 366:

 

    Scholarly
criticisms of felony murder have tended to neglect its relationship to
proportionality and grading.  The criticisms erroneously tend to regard mens
rea as the only legitimate determinant of the grade of a homicide resulting
from a felony.  This reasoning sometimes leads modern writers into the same
rigid formalism, divorced from policy, that they rightly reject in historical
justifications of the rule.  Mens rea is not a ""unified field
theory"" of homicide, and while such a theory might make the subject
artificially ""logical"" or ""consistent"", it does not reflect
our society's more complex understanding of the nature, function, and purpose
of the criminal law.  The fallacy of this approach is its denigration of actus
reus and its failure to include the result of defendant's conduct as a
determinant of just disposition.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Having
found that an objective foreseeability of death test is sufficient for the
crime of murder, I believe that the test has been met in this appeal.  Section
213 (a) enumerates a catalogue of criteria, all of which must
be conclusively demonstrated before a murder conviction can obtain.  In this
case, the predicate crime was committed, there was a clear intention to effect
bodily harm, and such harm did in fact result in the death of Ann McLean.

 

(c)   A
Comparative Analysis

 

    This
sudden introduction of a subjective foresight standard for the crime of murder
is most novel, and finds no parallel in Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand
or the United States.  While each of these jurisdictions imposes different
requirements for the crime of murder, none has adopted the requirement of
subjective foresight of death.

 

    (i) 
England and Scotland

 

    While
England did abolish the felony-murder rule in its Homicide Act, 1957 (U.K.),
5 & 6 Eliz. 2, c. 11, murder is still defined to include killings in
circumstances that require a mental state short of a subjective foresight of
death; causing death while intending to merely inflict grievous bodily harm is
sufficient.  Furthermore, Lord Goff, while admittedly rejecting a strict
objective foreseeability test, in ""The Mental Element in the Crime of
Murder"" (1988), 104 L.Q.R. 30, at p. 58, has advocated that
killings in circumstances which manifest ""wicked indifference"" are
properly classified as murder even though at the time of the killing no
subjective awareness of the risk of death exists in the killer.  This is the
law in Scotland and it is ""inherently desirable that the crime of murder
should be the same both north and south of the River Tweed"":

 

I am . . . urging that English law should adopt the
Scottish concept of wicked recklessness. . . . [although] I would prefer to
describe the concept as indifference to death.

 

    The
reactions of the judges and juries ... demonstrate, I think, a strong feeling
that the mental element in murder, restricted to intention -- whether to kill
or to cause grievous bodily harm -- is too closely confined to do justice in
all cases.

 

    (ii)  
Australia

 

    Each
of the Australian jurisdictions continues to recognize some version of the
felony-murder rule.  In South Australia, the following mental states constitute
the mens rea for murder:

 

(a)intention to kill;

 

(b)intention to cause grievous bodily harm;

 

(c)knowing that the probable consequence of an act is
either death or grievous bodily harm and nevertheless committing the act; and,

 

(d)causing unintended death during the course of certain
offences by acts of violence.

 

R. v.
Marshall (1987), 26 A. Crim. R. 259, at p. 266 (Ct. Cr. App. S.
Aust.);  R. v. Van Beelen (1973), 4 S.A.S.R. 353, at pp. 400-404 (S.C. S. Aust.).

 

    Victoria
has similar legislation which was recently amended as follows:

    3A.                  (1)  A person who
unintentionally causes the death of another person by an act of violence
done in the course or furtherance of a crime the necessary elements of which
include violence for which a person upon first conviction may, under or by
virtue of any enactment, be sentenced to life imprisonment or to imprisonment
for a term of 10 years or more shall be liable to be convicted of murder as
though he had killed that person intentionally.

 

                            (2)   The rule of law known
as the felony-murder rule (whereby a person who unintentionally causes the
death of another by an act of violence done in the course or furtherance of a
felony of violence is liable to be convicted of murder as though he had killed
that person intentionally) is hereby abrogated.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Crimes Act 1958 (Victoria) as
amended by the Crimes (Classification of Offences) Act 1981 (No.
9576, 1981 Statutes of Victoria), s. 3.

 

    In
New South Wales murder is defined by s. 18 of the Crimes Act as
including killing:

 

(a)with intent to kill;

 

(b)with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm;

 

(c)with reckless indifference to human life;

 

(d)during
or immediately after the commission of a qualifying felony [one punishable by
death or life imprisonment].

 

    Queensland,
Tasmania, and Western Australia have classified murder in statutory provisions similar
to those in the Canadian Criminal Code.  They provide
that an unlawful killing is murder in the following circumstances:

 

(1)an intentional killing

 

Queensland, Criminal Code Act, 1899, 63
Vic., No. 9, s. 302(1)

 

Western Australia, Criminal Code, 1913, s. 278

[guilty of ""wilful murder""]

 

Tasmania, Criminal Code Act, 1924, 14
Geo. V, No. 69, s. 157(a)

 

(2)an intention to do the person killed some grievous
bodily harm

 

Queensland, Criminal Code Act, 1899, 63
Vic., No. 9, s. 302(1)

 

Western Australia, Criminal Code, 1913, s.
279(1)

 

Tasmania, Criminal Code Act, 1924, 14
Geo. V, No. 69, s. 157(b)  [""intention to cause bodily harm which the
offender knew to be likely to cause death ... although he had no wish to cause
death""]

 

(3)death caused by means of an act done in the
prosecution of an unlawful purpose, which act is of such a nature as to be
likely to endanger human life

 

Queensland, Criminal Code Act, 1899, 63
Vic., No. 9, s. 302(2)

 

Western Australia, Criminal Code, 1913, s.
279(2)

 

Tasmania, Criminal Code Act, 1924, 14
Geo. V, No. 69, s. 157(c)

[by means of any unlawful act ... which the offender
knew or ought to have known, to be likely to cause death in the circumstances,
although he had no wish to cause death or bodily harm to any person]

 

(4)intention to do grievous bodily harm for the purpose
of committing certain serious crimes (or the use of a stupefying thing or
wilfully stopping breath in the commission of such a crime)

 

Queensland, Criminal Code Act, 1899, 63
Vic., No. 9, s. 302(3), (4), (5)

 

Western Australia, Criminal Code, 1913, s.
279(3), (4), (5)

 

Tasmania, Criminal
Code Act, 1924, 14 Geo. V, No. 69 s. 157(1)(d), (e), (f) and s.
157(2)

 

    (iii)  
New Zealand

 

    New
Zealand's definition of murder also includes killings which occur in
circumstances not involving subjective foresight of death.  Homicide is murder
if the offender means to cause grievous bodily injury (or administers a
stupefying or overpowering thing or wilfully stops the breath of a person) for
the purpose of facilitating the commission of a number of enumerated serious
offences or for the purpose of resisting lawful apprehension.  In these
circumstances a homicide is classified as murder ""whether the offender
means or does not mean death to ensue, or knows or does not know that death is
likely to ensue"":  New Zealand Crimes Act 1961, 1961
(N.Z.), No. 43, s. 168.

 

    (iv)  
United States

 

    In
the United States the common law notion of felony-murder continues to exist in
a modified form in all but three states.  Gilbert, ""Degrees of Felony
Murder"" (1983), 40 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 1601.  While a
number of jurisdictions have limited the rule by requiring the felony to be
inherently violent or by requiring violent means to be used during the course
of the felony, the rule still contains no requirement of subjective foresight
of death.  Apart from certain limits when combined with the death penalty,
the United States Supreme Court has consistently upheld the constitutional
validity of the felony-murder rule:  Tison v. Arizona, 107
S.Ct. 1676 (1987);  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153
(1976).  

 

    In
Substantive Criminal Law (vol. 2, 1986), LaFave and Scott discuss
""depraved-heart murder"" in {SS} 7.4, at pp. 199-200:

 

    Extremely
negligent conduct, which creates what a reasonable man would realize to be not
only an unjustifiable but also a very high degree of risk of death or serious
bodily injury to another or to others -- though unaccompanied by any intent to
kill or do serious bodily injury -- and which actually causes the death of
another, may constitute murder.

 

    Wharton's
Criminal Law (14th ed. 1979), {SS} 145, at pp. 204, 207-08,
addresses the rationale behind the felony-murder rule as follows:

 

    In the typical case of felony-murder, there is no
malice in ""fact"", express or implied; the malice is implied by the
""law"".  What is involved is an intended felony and an unintended
homicide.  The malice which plays a part in the commission of the felony is
transferred by the law to the homicide.  As a result of the fictional transfer,
the homicide is deemed committed with malice; and a homicide with malice is
common law murder.

 

                                                                        .
. .

 

. . .
ordinarily, the doctrine of felony-murder involves an unintended homicide....
Under the most common pattern [of state law], an unintended homicide in the
course of certain enumerated felonies constitutes murder in the first degree,
and an unintended homicide in the course of some other felony constitutes
murder in the second degree.  Although the felonies which are enumerated vary
from state to state, the ones that seem to have found their way into most
statutes are arson, rape, robbery, and burglary.  Other felonies, such as
kidnapping, mayhem, and forcible sodomy, are often added to the list.  What
the enumerated felonies always seem to have in common is the element of danger
or violence.  By holding a felony-murderer strictly accountable, even though
the homicide is unintended, the law is attempting to protect innocent lives --
victims, law enforcement officers, bystanders.  The law is not attempting
merely to deter the commission of dangerous or violent felonies; presumably,
the punishment authorized by law for such felonies is sufficiently severe to
accomplish that purpose.  But rather, the law is attempting to deter the
commission of such felonies in a dangerous or violent way.  For example, a
potential robber may be encouraged to use an unloaded gun, to use a club rather
than a gun, to use no weapon at all; or a potential arsonist or burglar may be
encouraged to make certain that a target building is unoccupied.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

    In People v.
Rose, 227 Cal. Rep. 570 (1986), the defendant urged that the
felony-murder rule is unconstitutional since it lacks both a legitimate
deterrent rationale and a legitimate retributive rationale.  The court rejected
both these arguments, at p. 574:

 

The
Legislature has said in effect that this deterrent purpose [to deter felons
from killing negligently or accidentally by holding them strictly responsible
for killings they commit] outweighs the normal legislative policy of examining
the individual state of mind of each person causing an unlawful killing to determine
whether the killing was with or without malice, deliberate or accidental, and
calibrating our treatment of the person accordingly.  Once a person
perpetrates or attempts to perpetrate one of the enumerated felonies, then in
the judgment of the Legislature, he is no longer entitled to such fine judicial
calibration, but will be deemed guilty of first degree murder for any homicide
committed in the course thereof.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    It
must be recalled that the felony-murder rule in the United States includes the
potential that accidental homicides might be labelled murder.  As England
abolished this possibility, however remote, so did this Court in
Vaillancourt.  What remains is a test of objective foreseeability,
as well as specific intent for at least two underlying serious and dangerous
crimes.  The chance that an accidental homicide will be encompassed within this
definition has been judicially eliminated.

 

    In
conclusion, no other common law jurisdiction has found that fundamental justice
is offended by something less than an exclusive subjective foresight standard
for the crime of murder.  On the whole, s. 213 (a) is
comprehensively disparate from s. 213 (d).  It
finds enduring support in criminal legislation.  It satisfies all the
components of the objective foreseeability test established by this Court in
Vaillancourt.  It is consistent with similar provisions enacted in
other common law jurisdictions.  For these reasons, I am of the view that s.
213 (a) does not offend the principles of fundamental justice,
and therefore ss. 7 and 11(d) of our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  have
not been violated in the present case.

 

IV.   Policy
Considerations

 

    During
the 27-year period from 1961-1987, the evidence reveals that 2177 homicide
offences occurred during the commission of another criminal act.  The
percentage of homicide offences committed during the commission of another
criminal act has varied from 11.9% in 1965 to 28.4% in 1970.  The annual
average for the period was 16.7%.  See ""Homicide in Canada:  Offences
Committed During the Commission of Another Criminal Act"", statistics
provided by R.C.M.P. for the period 1961-1987.  The homicide offences committed
during another criminal act are divided into four categories:

 

Robbery:  includes robbery, theft, and break
and enter offences.  1315 victims; 61.7% of all homicide offences committed
during another criminal act.

 

Sexual Assault & Rape:  includes all
sexual attacks on either males or females.  483 victims;  22.3% of all homicide
offences committed during another criminal act.

 

Escape:  involves attempts to escape from
correctional institutions or lawful custody, to avoid arrest, or to escape
detection as a parole or probation violator.  346 victims;  14.2% of all homicide
offences committed during another criminal act.

 

Other: 
includes other types of criminal acts such as arson, assault, kidnapping, etc. 
33 victims;  1.8% of all homicide offences committed during another criminal
act.

 

    These
statistics reflect a matter of critical public concern, and sustain the
Legislature's compulsion to deliver an appropriate response.  It is
constitutionally permissible under the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  to define the mental element required for murder with
reference to an intention by the perpetrator to harm or injure the victim, with
death resulting.  How that harm or injury is to be defined, and what level of
harm or injury is required are matters for Parliament to consider and decide. 
As La Forest J. said in R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986]
2 S.C.R. 713, at p. 795:

 

It must
be remembered that the business of government is a practical one.  The
Constitution must be applied on a realistic basis having regard to the nature
of the particular area sought to be regulated and not on an abstract
theoretical plane.

 

In this
same case, Dickson C.J. noted at p. 782 that:

 

The
courts are not called upon to substitute judicial opinions for legislative ones
as to the place at which to draw a precise line.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

    Dickson
C.J. expanded on this notion recently in Irwin Toy Ltd. v.
Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, at p. 990:

 

Where
the legislature mediates between the competing claims of different groups in
the community, it will inevitably be called upon to draw a line marking where
one set of claims legitimately begins and the other fades away without access
to complete knowledge as to its precise location.  If the legislature has
made a reasonable assessment as to where the line is most properly drawn, ...
it is not for the court to second guess.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
criminal law must reconcile two ""competing claims"" as well.  Social
protection must be measured against justice to the individual accused.  The
appropriate balance between these two will certainly vary, and ""A
monolithic approach to the proper basis of culpability will be unable to
respond to the varying nature of that conflict"":  Wells, ""Swatting
the Subjectivist Bug"", [1982] Crim. L.R. 209, at p. 212.

 

    As
Lamer J. held in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
486, at p. 512:

 

    The term ""principles of fundamental
justice"" is not a right, but a qualifier of the right not to be deprived
of life, liberty and security of the person; its function is to set the
parameters of that right.

 

                                                                        .
. . 

 

    Consequently,
the principles of fundamental justice are to be found in the basic tenets and
principles, not only of our judicial process, but also of the other components
of our legal system.

 

The fact
that the principles embraced by s. 213 (a) have
existed for over 300 years is in itself relevant, though not necessarily determinative,
of whether or not a rule of ""fundamental justice"" has been breached
by virtue of their adoption by the Parliament of Canada.  In my view, while the
guarantee entrenched in s. 7  of the Charter  is to have broad
application, it cannot go so far as to grant the courts judicial licence to
modify or strike down legislation in the absence of a constitutional violation.

 

    Lamer
J. infused s. 7  with palpable content in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle
Act, at p. 512:

 

    Sections
8 to 14 address specific deprivations of the ""right"" to life,
liberty and security of the person in breach of the principles of fundamental
justice, and as such, violations of s. 7 .  They are therefore illustrative
of the meaning, in criminal or penal law, of ""principles of fundamental
justice""; they represent principles which have been recognized by the
common law, the international conventions and by the very fact of entrenchment
in the Charter , as essential elements of a system for the
administration of justice which is founded upon the belief in the dignity and
worth of the human person and the rule of law.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Of
sections 8 to 14, only s. 11 (d) is being
challenged here.  Section 11 (d) of the Charter 
guarantees that:

 

    11.  Any
person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                        .
. .

 

(d) to be
presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public
hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal; . . .

 

    It
is difficult for me to see how this right has been violated in the present
appeal.  The accused has been presumed innocent.  His trial was ""a fair
and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal"".  He was
subsequently ""proven guilty according to law"".  The alleged
infringement is that the presumption of innocence is displaced by the lack of a
subjective foresight requirement.  This is just not so.  The law as it stands
necessitates conclusive proof beyond a reasonable doubt of factors that are
collectively tantamount to an objective foreseeability requirement.  According
to Vaillancourt, this condition does not defeat the presumption of
innocence.  None of the other reference provisions which give content and scope
to s. 7  is impugned.  Therefore, in my view, no Charter 
guarantee has been offended.

 

    Section
213 (a) is intended to carve out certain killings and place
them in a category of the most serious culpable homicides, murder.  This is a
designation which Parliament is entitled to ascribe pursuant to its
responsibility for the protection of those under its dominion.  This
legislative objective can be anchored in Parliament's legitimate attempt to
deter persons from conduct which falls within s. 213 (a).  In
particular, Parliament is attempting to deter those who commit crimes from
intentionally inflicting actual bodily harm on their victims in order to
achieve their unlawful purpose.  The killings subsumed within s. 213 (a) are
regarded as sufficiently heinous to warrant being placed in the category of the
gravest culpable homicides.  Parliament felt that this was the appropriate
manner to ensure that the criminal law is in accordance with social values as
to the gravity of such killings, and that this was an effective method to
preserve the lives and safety of Canadians.

 

    In R. v.
Arkell (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 412-13, 
McLachlin J.A. (now of this Court) considered the validity of s. 214(5)  (now s.
231(5)).  Writing for the British Columbia Court of Appeal -- this Court's
decision in Arkell is being rendered concurrently with
the present one -- she held that:

 

. . . it must be recognized that many factors other than
the accused's degree of moral blameworthiness must be considered by Parliament
in establishing a sentencing scheme.  General deterrence, the degree of
perceived danger to the public and the prevalence of certain types of offences
are only some of the other considerations which Parliament may properly
consider.  It follows that the mere fact that a harsher sentence may be imposed
for one offence than for another offence which is arguably more blameworthy,
does not mean that the scheme that permits the sentence violates s. 7  of the
Charter .

 

                                                                        .
. .

 

Many
factors enter into the determination of an appropriate penalty for a particular
offence; the degree of blameworthiness is only one.  The question is one of
policy, to be determined by Parliament.  So long as Parliament does not act
irrationally or arbitrarily or in a manner otherwise inconsistent with the
fundamental principles of justice, its choice must be upheld.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

    I
agree completely, and find that the test applies to s. 213 (a) as
well.  If Parliament chooses to label a crime ""murder"" and attach
commensurate penalties, so long as a mens rea
requirement is imposed, as it is here, this Court should not lightly interfere
with that legislative decision.  Mewett & Manning, writing before this
Court's decision in Vaillancourt, acknowledged at
pp. 544-45 that:

 

Section
213  [now section 230 ] and the concept of constructive murder have been much
criticized and, in fact, abolished in many jurisdictions.  The criticism is
that it imposes liability for murder in situations where death was not intended
nor even, in some cases, foreseen.  But murder is a legal concept; it does
not have to be defined in terms of intentional killing, and even under s. 212
[now s. 229] the definition is not this narrow.  The policy behind s. 213  is to
put the risk of killing a victim during the course of the commission of certain
offences upon the offender to a higher degree than if it were merely classified
as manslaughter.  In any case, with the present distinction between murder
punishable by death and murder punishable by life imprisonment now abolished,
much of the criticism loses its force.  It was the thought of someone being
executed for a non-intended homicide that led to the feeling that the
definition of murder should somehow be limited to the old common law concept of
""murder with malice aforethought"".  [Emphasis added.]  

 

    Parliament
can abrogate s. 213  in its entirety and pioneer a strict subjective standard
for the crime of murder, but the Constitution does not require that it do so. 
As McIntyre J. said, dissenting in Vaillancourt, at p. 663:

 

    The
principal complaint in this case is not that the accused should not have been
convicted of a serious crime deserving of severe punishment, but simply that
Parliament should not have chosen to call that crime ""murder"".  No
objection could be taken if Parliament classified the offence as manslaughter
or a killing during the commission of an offence, or in some other manner. . .
.while it may be illogical to characterize an unintentional killing as murder, no
principle of fundamental justice is offended only because serious criminal
conduct, involving the commission of a crime of violence resulting in the
killing of a human being, is classified as murder and not in some other manner. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    In R. v.
Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, Lamer J. cited numerous examples
of curial deference to Parliamentary enactments.  My colleague then adopted, at
p. 1070, the following passage of Borins Dist. Ct. J. from R. v.
Guiller, Ont. Dist. Ct., Sept. 23, 1985, unreported:

 

    It
is not for the court to pass on the wisdom of Parliament with respect to the
gravity of various offences and the range of penalties which may be imposed
upon those found guilty of committing the offences.  Parliament has broad
discretion in proscribing conduct as criminal and in determining proper
punishment. While the final judgment as to whether a punishment exceeds
constitutional limits set by the Charter  is properly a
judicial function the court should be reluctant to interfere with the
considered views of Parliament and then only in the clearest of cases where the
punishment prescribed is so excessive when compared with the punishment
prescribed for other offences as to outrage standards of decency.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

    In
the present appeal, my colleague's justification (at p. 000) for insisting on
the narrowest of all possible definitions for the crime of murder is that:

 

    A
conviction for murder carries with it the most severe stigma and punishment of
any crime in our society. . . . [and] should be reserved for those who choose
to intentionally cause death or who choose to inflict bodily harm that they
know is likely to cause death.

 

The
menacing component of ""stigma"" was discussed in
Vaillancourt as well.  As Lindsay pointed out in ""The
Implications of R. v. Vaillancourt: Much Ado About
Nothing?"" (1989), 47 U. of T. Fac. Law Rev. 465, at p. 472:

 

    It
should also be noted that Lamer J. justified a requirement of a ""special
mental element"" based on either the stigma
associated with a crime or the penalties available.  A murder conviction qualified
on both grounds.  However, theft can involve penalties as low as an absolute
discharge.  Thus, the inclusion of theft in Lamer J.'s list of crimes
requiring a ""special mental element"" must have been based on stigma
rather than available penalties.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    I
find this concentration on social ""stigma"" to be overemphasized, and
in the great majority of cases, completely inapplicable.  The facts in the
present appeals reveal the truly heinous nature of the criminal acts at issue. 
The concern that these offenders not endure the Mark of Cain is, in my view, an
egregious example of misplaced compassion.  If the apprehension is that the
offenders in question will suffer from their ""murderer"" label, I
suspect they will fare little better tagged as ""manslaughterers"". 
Accidental killings cannot, after Vaillancourt, result in murder
prosecutions.  Only killings resulting from circumstances in which death is, at
a minimum, objectively foreseeable will be prosecuted under s. 213 (a). 
Furthermore, the duration of imprisonment, if at all different, will not
attenuate the ""stigma"".  To the extent that any such
""stigma"" can be said to exist, it is at least as palpable upon
release to the outside world as it is within the prison environment itself.

 

    The ""stigma""
and punishment attached to murder need not be proportionate to the mens rea alone. 
Rather they must correspond to the combination of the physical and
mental elements that collectively define a murder.  As stated in Crump
and Crump, ""In Defense of the Felony Murder Doctrine,"" supra, at pp.
362-63:

 

The classification and grading of offenses so that the
entire scheme of defined crimes squares with societal perceptions of
proportionality ... is a fundamental goal of the law of crimes.

 

    The
felony murder doctrine serves this goal, just as do the distinctions
inherent in the separate offenses of attempted murder and murder, or impaired
driving and vehicular homicide. ... [T]he felony murder doctrine reflects
the conclusion that a robbery that causes death is more closely akin to murder
than to robbery.  If this conclusion accurately reflects societal
attitudes, and if classification of crimes is to be influenced by such
attitudes in order to avoid depreciation of the seriousness of the offense and
to encourage respect for the law, then the felony murder doctrine is an
appropriate classificatory device.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Recalling
all the necessary hurdles which the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt
before s. 213 (a) can operate, the elements of deterrence as well as
retribution become critical.  As the Crumps discuss at pp. 370-71:

 

The conclusion does not follow, however, that felons
cannot be deterred, or that criminals are so different from other citizens that
they are impervious to inducements or deterrents that would affect people in
general.  There is mounting evidence that serious crime is subject to
deterrence if consequences are adequately communicated.  The felony murder
rule is just the sort of simple, commonsense, readily enforceable, and widely
known principle that is likely to result in deterrence.

 

                                                                         ...

 

The
proposition that accidental killings cannot be deterred is inconsistent with
the widespread belief that the penalizing of negligence, and even the
imposition of strict liability, may have deterrent consequences. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    Section
213 (a) does not deal with accidental killings, but rather
with killings that are objectively foreseeable as a result of the abominable
nature of the predicate crimes, committed with specific intent, coupled with
the intentional infliction of bodily harm.  Given the dual subjective
requirement already in place, the deterrence factor is most cogent in these
circumstances.  Whatever the competing arguments may be with respect to
deterring the merely negligent, here we are dealing with those who have already
expressly acted with the intent to commit at least two underlying serious
crimes.  If deterrence is to ever have any application to the criminal law, and
in my view it should, this is the place.

 

    Deterrence
can neither be analyzed in the abstract nor in isolation from the context of
the provision in question.  Section 213 (a) deals
with one who has already proven to be a ""hijacker"", a
""kidnapper"", a ""rapist"", or an ""arsonist"". 
Furthermore, this person has already proven willing to cause bodily harm to
commit the offence or to enable himself to escape after having committed the
offence.  In these circumstances, it is certainly appropriate for Parliament to
put this person on notice, that if these purposeful acts result in death, you
will be charged as a ""murderer"" as well.

 

    This
notion of Parliamentary autonomy cannot be displaced unless a Charter 
violation has occurred.  In my view that has not taken place here.  Repeating
my colleague's own test, as articulated in Vaillancourt at p.
657, if the legislation is ""tantamount to one which has objective
foreseeability as an essential element, and, if objective foreseeability is
sufficient, then it would not be in violation of s. 7  or s. 11 (d) in
doing so in that way.""

 

V.   Conclusion

 

    Policy
considerations in Canada as well as in other jurisdictions have inspired
legislation that considers objective foreseeability sufficient as the minimum mens rea
requirement for murder.  While it may not be the very best test for all cases,
it is certainly a constitutionally valid one.                                                                               Parliament
did not have to enact s. 213 (a), but that is not the
question before this Court.  The issue is whether it could.  In my view, the
answer rests on what level of foreseeability will be required before a
conviction for murder can be returned.  Based on this Court's precedents, and
the principles of fundamental justice, I believe that the objective
foreseeability of death test for the crime of murder is constitutionally
valid.  The additional mandatory elements demanded by s. 213 (a) lend
even greater force to this conclusion.

 

    Striking
down the legislation simply because some other scheme may be preferable would
be an unwarranted intrusion into Parliament's prerogative, and would undermine
the means it has chosen to protect its citizens.  The Charter  is not
designed to allow this Court to substitute preferable provisions for those
already in place in the absence of a clear constitutional violation.  Such a
task should be reserved for the Law Reform Commission or other advisory
bodies.  This Court's province is to pronounce upon the constitutionality of
those provisions properly before it.  The Charter  does
not infuse the courts with the power to declare legislation to be of no force
or effect on the basis that they believe the statute to be undesirable as a
matter of criminal law policy.  For the aforementioned reasons, I do not
believe that s. 213 (a) offends the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .

 

    Therefore,
I would allow this appeal, restore the conviction for second degree murder with
respect to the death of Ann McLean, and answer the constitutional questions as
follows:

 

Q:Does
s. 213(a) of the Criminal Code 
infringe or deny the rights or freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A:No.

 

Q:If the
answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 213(a)
justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

A:I need not answer this question in light of my answer
to the first question.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    SOPINKA J. -- I
have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Chief Justice Lamer and
Justice L'Heureux-Dubé.  I agree with Lamer C.J. that there must be a new trial
in this case.  I would give the same answers to the constitutional questions as
Lamer C.J. but, with respect, I cannot agree with his reasons.

 

    In
my view, the issue of subjective foresight of death should be addressed only if
it is necessary to do so in order to decide this case or if there is an
overriding reason making it desirable to do so.  Overbroad statements of
principle are inimical to the tradition of incremental development of the
common law.  Likewise, the development of law under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  is best served by deciding cases before
the courts, not by anticipating the results of future cases.

 

    The
first inquiry is whether ruling on the issue of subjective foresight is
necessary for the disposition of this case.  In my view, the case at bar is
governed by the reasons given in this Court's decision in R. v.
Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636.  The Court need go no further.

 

    In
Vaillancourt, the majority of the Court held that s. 213(d) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, was unconstitutional.  Lamer J.
(as he then was), Dickson C.J. and Estey and Wilson JJ. concurring, held that
it is a principle of fundamental justice that a person cannot be convicted of
murder without proof beyond a reasonable doubt of at least objective
foreseeability of the victim's death.  La Forest J. held that fundamental
justice requires that the mens rea requirement for murder be one
referable to causing death.  Beetz and Le Dain JJ. agreed with the reasons of
both Lamer and La Forest JJ. supporting the conclusion that s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code  did not conform to the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

    Each
of these three sets of reasons stated that it was not necessary to address the
issue of whether subjective foresight of death is a constitutional requirement
for a valid murder charge.  However, Lamer J. (and therefore four of the eight
judges participating) adopted the view, in obiter, that
subjective foresight of death is indeed the standard demanded by s. 7  of the Charter .

 

    Accepting
the majority position in Vaillancourt that objective
foreseeability of death is a constitutional minimum for the definition of
murder, the conclusion must follow that s. 213 (a) does
not meet this constitutional minimum.  With respect, I cannot agree with the
contrary conclusion reached by L'Heureux-Dubé J.

 

    Section
213 (a) applies ""whether or not the person means to cause
death to any human being"".  It substitutes for proof of these mind-states
the requirement that culpable homicide is murder when a person intentionally
causes bodily harm and death ensues from the bodily harm, if the harm is caused
for the purpose of facilitating the commission of or flight from certain
offences.  It is not difficult to imagine a case in which the underlying
offence is committed, bodily harm is intended, and death ensues which is not
objectively foreseeable.  For instance, A shoves B out of the way to facilitate
flight from a robbery, intentionally inflicting bodily harm in the sense of a
non-trivial interference with the health or comfort of B.  B unexpectedly
missteps as a result of being pushed, falls, strikes his head, and dies. 
Section 213 (a) would label this state of affairs murder, even though
there is reasonable doubt that B's death was objectively foreseeable.  Section
213 (a) therefore offends the principle of fundamental justice
described in Vaillancourt.

 

    I
conclude that in the case at bar it is clearly not necessary to address the
issue of subjective foresight of death to dispose of the case.  The question is
then whether there is an overriding reason making it desirable to do so.

 

    In
Vaillancourt, Lamer J. explicitly narrowed his decision to address
only objective foreseeability of death as a constitutional requirement for
murder, because otherwise his comments would have had a bearing on sections not
challenged in the case, namely ss. 212(c) and
205(5)(a).  A significant factor behind this approach was that
only the Attorney General for Ontario appeared as intervener in that case.  The
Attorney General of Canada did not appear, although he may well have done so
had ss. 212(c) and 205(5)(a) been
raised.

 

    In
the case at bar, Lamer C.J. does not narrow the issue to avoid commenting on
the validity of s. 212(c); rather he widens the issue in order to cast
""serious if not fatal doubt"" upon it.  He gives two reasons.  First,
unlike Vaillancourt there was wide participation by the Attorneys General. 
The Attorneys General of Canada, Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia
intervened on the issue of whether subjective foresight or objective
foreseeability of death is the constitutionally required minimum mens rea for
murder.  Second, justice would not be served if this case were to return to
this Court a second time on the ground that there is doubt as to the validity
of s. 212(c).

 

    In
my view, it is dangerous to justify a wider scope of decision in this case than
in Vaillancourt by reason of the participation of a greater number of
Attorneys General.  If the fact of their participation puts at risk a wider
range of legislation, this practically creates a disincentive to the exercise
of their right to intervene.  A more important consideration is that it is not
strictly accurate to state that the Attorneys General intervened on the issue
of whether subjective foresight or objective foreseeability is the
constitutionally required minimum mens rea for murder.  While
this was, of course, canvassed, the focus of argument was on whether s. 213 (a) met
constitutional standards or whether it could be justified under s. 1 , in
distinction from s. 213 (d).  I am not convinced that the submissions of the
Attorneys General, not to mention the parties, would have been the same had s.
212(c) or other sections been challenged.  

 

    Admittedly,
it is an important function of this Court to provide guidance to lower courts. 
In the context of this case, it would also be desirable that the validity of s.
212(c) be known with certainty for the purposes of the new
trial.  However, this desirable result does not outweigh the importance of
deciding on the validity of s. 212(c) in a case where
it is directly in issue and is fully argued by the parties.

 

    I
would therefore limit myself to the conclusion that s. 213 (a) is
unconstitutional because (i) it places a restriction on s. 7  of the Charter  by
permitting a person to be convicted of murder without proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of objective foreseeability of death, or of an equivalent substitute
requirement, and (ii) for the reasons expressed by Lamer C.J. in
Vaillancourt and in the case at bar, it cannot be saved by s. 1 . 
Other constitutional issues with respect to the murder provisions of the Criminal
Code  I would leave for another day.

    Appellant was convicted of first degree murder
as a result of culpable homicide committed during unlawful confinement:  the
victim, a cab driver, died of multiple stab wounds after being held at knife‑point
and robbed.  The appellant had told police on his arrest that he had been
drinking and taking drugs before getting into the cab.  An appeal from
conviction to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.  Six constitutional questions
were stated in this Court:  (1) whether s. 213 (a) of
the Criminal Code  contravened ss. 7  and/or 11(d) of
the Charter , and (2), if so, whether s. 213 (a) was
justified by s. 1 ; (3) whether s. 214(5) (e) was
inconsistent with s. 7  of the
Charter ; (4) whether s. 214(5) (e) in
combination with s. 669(a) of the
Code was inconsistent with ss. 7 , 9 
and 12  of the Charter  or (5) infringed s. 2(e) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights; and (6), if questions 3 or 4 were answered in the
affirmative, whether s. 214(5) (e) was
justified by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.  The first
constitutional question should be answered in the affirmative, the second
through fifth in the negative and the sixth needed not be answered.

 

    Per
Dickson C.J. and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ.:  The first
constitutional question was answered in the affirmative and the second in the
negative for the reasons given in R.
v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000; the third was answered in the negative for the reasons given in R. v. Arkell, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000.

 

    The combined effect of s. 214(5)(e) and
s. 669 accords with the principles of fundamental justice assuming those
principles require that differing degrees of moral blameworthiness in different
offences be reflected in differential sentences and that sentences be
individualized.  Even in the most serious cases, Parliament has provided for
some sensitivity to the individual circumstances when it comes to sentencing.

 

    The combination of s. 214(5)(e) and
s. 669 do not violate any principle of fundamental justice or s. 2(e) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights.  Rather, it clearly demonstrates a
proportionality between the moral turpitude of the offender and the malignity
of the offence and accords with the other objectives of a system of
sentencing.  The added element of forcible confinement, in the context of
murder, markedly enhances the offender's moral blameworthiness. 
Parliament's decision to elevate murders committed during forcible confinement
to first degree murder is consonant with the principle of proportionality
between the blameworthiness of the offender and the punishment.  Further, it is
consistent with the individualization of sentencing especially since only those
who have killed with subjective foresight of death while also committing the
offence of forcible confinement are subjected to that punishment.

 

    The combination of s. 214(5)(e) and
s. 669 does not demonstrate arbitrariness in contravention of s. 9  of
the Charter  merely because the statute imposes a mandatory term of
imprisonment for an offence that encompasses a range of mortal turpitude.  The
incarceration is statutorily authorized, narrowly defines a class of offenders
with respect to whom the punishment will be invoked and specifically prescribes
the conditions under which an offender may be found guilty of first degree murder. 
Further, the policy decision of Parliament to classify these murders as first
degree murders accords with the broader objectives of a sentencing scheme.

 

    The combined effect of s. 214(5)(e) and
s. 669 does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment ‑‑
punishment that is grossly disproportionate and not merely excessive ‑‑
contrary to s. 12  of the Charter .  These sections provide for punishment of the most
serious crime in criminal law.  The punishment is not excessive and clearly
does not outrage standards of decency.  The penalty is deservedly severe and
yet Parliament has been sensitive to the particular circumstances of each
offender.

 

    Section 613(1)(b)(iii)
was not applicable here.  A jury could not have reasonably reached any other
verdict even if the error in leaving s. 213 (a) had
not occurred.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé J.:  Lamer C.J.'s disposition of questions 3 through 6
were agreed with.  However, for the reasons stated in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, the first question must be answered in
the negative, and therefore the second question needed not be answered.  The
third question should be answered in the negative for the reasons given in R. v. Arkell, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, and in the judgment of McLachlin
J.A. for the British Columbia Court of Appeal in that case (1988), 43
C.C.C. (3d) 402.

 

    The distinction between first and second degree
murder only comes into play when the offender has been proven beyond a
reasonable doubt to be guilty of murder.  To be found guilty of first degree
murder under s. 214(5)(e), the offender must have committed murder
""while committing or attempting to commit forcible confinement"". 
This is in addition to the stringent criteria for the crime of murder itself. 
It is appropriate for Parliament to impose its most severe punishment.

 

    Per
Sopinka J.:  The appeal must be dismissed pursuant to s. 613(1)(b)(iii). 
The reasons given in R. v.
Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000,  were
applicable to the constitutional questions relating to s. 213 (a).  The
reasons of Lamer C.J. with respect to s. 214(5)(e) were
agreed with, except to the extent that those reasons rely on the view that
murder, and hence first degree murder, constitutionally requires subjective
foresight of death.

raised by R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000 and R. v. Arkell,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 000.  At stake is the constitutionality of s. 213(a) of

Facts

 

    The appellant was convicted of the first degree
murder of Charmayne Manke and was sentenced to life imprisonment without
eligibility for parole for 25 years.  The Court of Appeal for Alberta
dismissed, without written reasons, an appeal from conviction.  The body of the
victim was found lying in a farmer's field at about 7:00 a.m. on April 14,
1984.  An autopsy revealed that she had 12 stab wounds to her neck and three to
her head.  She bled to death as a result of a wound to her carotid artery.  At
trial, evidence was adduced to establish that the appellant hailed a cab
outside a gay night-club and asked the victim, the cab driver, to take him to
his motel room.  When they arrived at the motel, the appellant asked her to
wait for him while he picked up his luggage.  At that time the appellant also
retrieved a knife from his room.  The appellant, upon his return, sat in the
front passenger's seat.  A witness who observed the victim's driving testified
that her driving pattern was very erratic following the departure from the
motel.

 

    After his arrest, the appellant told the
R.C.M.P. that he had been drinking and taking drugs before getting into the
cab.  He remembered being in a field and wanting the cab driver's money.  When
he took her money, he had the knife displayed.  At his request, the victim got
out of the cab and his next memory was of his standing on the highway
attempting to flag down a truck. In a later statement he remembered that he had
initially pulled out the knife on entering the cab at the motel and told the
victim to keep driving until he told her to stop.  It was further alleged that
the appellant made an incriminating statement to another prisoner while in
custody awaiting trial to the effect that he had stabbed the victim inside the
cab and again outside the cab because she called him a ""faggot"".  The
fellow inmate also testified that the appellant had made reference to having
""had control of where they were going"" in the cab.

 

    In the course of its deliberations, the jury
sent the trial judge two questions:  (1) ""what causes first degree murder
to drop to second degree murder?"" and (2) ""please clarify forcible
confinement a little more, that is, if the death occurred outside the cab, was
the victim forcibly confined, if, for instance, she ran and attempted to
escape, was caught by the accused and killed, was she forcibly confined at the
time of death -- when does forcible confinement end?""  The trial judge
first noted that first degree murder does not ""drop"" to second degree
murder and then responded in the following way:

 

It is not first degree murder if, and I will tell
you in what circumstances it is not first degree murder, if you find on the
facts that there was no forcible confinement.  It is not first degree murder if
you find a robbery without a forcible confinement.  It is not first degree
murder if you find no planning or deliberation but, once again, as I told you
when I charged you, don't concern yourself with that one, because the Crown
conceded that this is not a case of planning and deliberation and I concur, but
there was some evidence that you might have found that in any event, so, I
charged you on it.  So, that one I would suggest you should put aside....  It
is not first degree murder if you find in fact you have a doubt as to whether
the accused did form the intent to forcibly confine....  It is not first degree
murder if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the forcible confinement
ended and this doubt must be resolved in favor [sic] of
the accused.  Finally, it is not first degree murder if death occurred to
facilitate flight after committing or attempting to commit forcible
confinement.

 

The jury returned about two hours later with a
verdict of guilty of first degree murder.

 

Judgment below

 

Court of Appeal for Alberta

 

    The appellant's appeal from conviction was heard
on March 10 and 11 of 1988 before a five-person panel of the Court of Appeal
for Alberta.  At the conclusion of the oral argument Kerans J.A. dismissed the
appeal.  No written reasons were ever provided, although a formal judgment of
the Court was rendered on April 6, 1988.  It is common ground between the
parties that the following represents a fair summation of the oral reasons
provided by Kerans J.A.  The Court of Appeal rejected a constitutional
challenge to s. 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code  because it does not create a
substantive offence, but rather simply classifies murder for sentencing
purposes.  Kerans J.A. indicated that the inclusion of certain offences in
s. 214(5)  was not arbitrary, relying on this Court's decision in R. v. Paré, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 618.  The Court further held  that even
if one assumes that s. 213 (a) of the
Criminal Code  violates s. 7 
of the Charter  based on the decision in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, the verdict of the jury should be
affirmed by application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

 

Relevant Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 214(5)(e) (now

    214.  ...

 

    (5) 
Irrespective of whether a murder is planned and deliberate on the part of any
person, murder is first degree murder in respect of a person when the death is
caused by that person while committing or attempting to commit an offence under
one of the following sections:

 

                                                                          ...

 

    (e)  section 247 (kidnapping and forcible

is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.

 

    (2) 
Every one who, without lawful authority, confines, imprisons or forcibly seizes
another person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment

    (3)  In proceedings under this section the fact
that the person in relation to whom the offence is alleged to have been
committed did not resist is not a defence unless the accused proves that the
failure to resist was not caused by threats, duress, force or exhibition of
force.

Issues

 

    The following constitutional questions were
stated by Chief Justice Dickson on June 2, 1989:

 

1.Does
s. 230(a) [then s. 213 (a)] of
the Criminal Code  contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by
s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 230(a) [then
s. 213 (a)] of the Criminal Code 
justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

3.Is
s. 231(5)(e) [then s. 214(5)(e)] of
the Criminal Code  inconsistent with s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

4.Is
s. 231(5)(e) [then s. 214(5)(e)] in
combination with s. 742(a) [then s. 669(a)] of
the Criminal Code  inconsistent with ss. 7 , 9  and, or in the
alternative, s. 12  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

5.Does
s. 231(5)(e) [then s. 214(5)(e)] in
combination with s. 742 [then s. 669] of the Criminal Code  abrogate or infringe the rights guaranteed by s. 2(e) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights?

 

6.If the answer to questions 3 or 4 is in the
affirmative, is s. 231(5)(e) [then s. 214(5)(e)]
justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

Analysis

 

    For the reasons stated in R. v. Martineau, released concurrently, s. 213 (a) of
the Criminal Code  infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of
the Charter  and cannot be saved by s. 1  of the Charter .  Therefore, the first constitutional question is answered
in the affirmative and the second question in the negative.   With respect to
question three which deals with whether s. 214(5) (e) is
inconsistent with s. 7  of the
Charter , I rely on my reasons in R. v. Arkell for the conclusion that the inclusion of certain offences
in s. 214  is guided by the organizing principle identified by this Court
in Paré, supra, and thereby is neither arbitrary nor
irrational.  Therefore, I would answer question three in the negative. 

 

    The remaining questions require an examination
of the combined effect of s. 214(5)(e) and
s. 669 of the Code on the rights guaranteed by ss. 7 , 9  and 12  of
the Charter , and s. 2(e) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights.  The appellant combines his argument in
respect of s. 7  of the Charter  and s. 2(e) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights.  He submits that the principles of
fundamental justice require that differing degrees of moral blameworthiness in
different offences be reflected in differential sentences, and that sentencing
be individualized.  The appellant cites the following judgments as support for
the view that the combined effect of s. 214(5) (e) and
s. 669  offends the principles that a just sentencing system contains a gradation
of punishments differentiated according to the malignity of offences and that
sentencing be individualized:  Re
B.C. Motor Vehicle Act,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, per Wilson J., R. v. Smith,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, per Lamer J. and per Wilson
J., and R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, per La
Forest J.  In my view, assuming that s. 7  incorporates the propositions
cited by the appellant as principles of fundamental justice, the combined
effect of s. 214(5) (e) and s. 669  is in accordance with them. 
Section 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code  isolates a particular group of
murderers, namely those who have murdered while committing certain offences
involving the illegal domination of the victim, and classifies them for
sentencing purposes as murderers in the first degree.  As a result of
s. 669  the murderer is sentenced to life imprisonment without parole
eligibility for 25 years.  It is of some note that even in cases of first
degree murder, s. 672 of the
Code provides that after serving 15 years
the offender can apply to the Chief Justice in the province for a reduction in
the number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for parole having
regard for the character of the applicant, his conduct while serving the
sentence, the nature of the offence for which he was convicted and any other
matters that are relevant in the circumstances.  This indicates that even
in the cases of our most serious offenders, Parliament has provided for some
sensitivity to the individual circumstances of each case when it comes to
sentencing.  

 

    I must also reiterate that what we are speaking
of here is a classification scheme for the purposes of sentencing.  The
distinction between first and second degree murder only comes into play when it
has first been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender is guilty of
murder, that is, that he or she had subjective foresight of death:  R. v. Martineau, handed down this day.  There is no doubt that a
sentencing scheme must exhibit a proportionality to the seriousness of the
offence, or to put it another way, there must be a gradation of punishments
according to the malignity of the offences.  However, a sentencing scheme
also must take into account other factors that are of significance for the
societal interest in punishing wrongdoers.  In Lyons, supra,
at pp. 328‑29, La Forest J. considered the dangerous offender
designation in the Code and said the following in respect of the
relationship between sentencing and its objectives:

 

I accordingly agree with the respondent's submission
that it cannot be considered a violation of fundamental justice for Parliament
to identify those offenders who, in the interests of protecting the public,
ought to be sentenced according to considerations which are not entirely
reactive or based on a ""just deserts"" rationale.  The imposition of a
sentence which ""is partly punitive but is mainly imposed for the
protection of the public"" ... seems to me to accord with the fundamental
purpose of the criminal law generally, and of sentencing in particular, namely,
the protection of society.  In a rational system of sentencing, the respective
importance of prevention, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary
according to the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender.

 

In my view the combination of s. 214(5) (e) and
s. 669  clearly demonstrates a proportionality between the moral turpitude
of the offender and the malignity of the offence, and moreover it is in accord
with the other objectives of a system of sentencing identified by La Forest J.
in Lyons.  As I have stated, we are dealing with individuals
that have committed murder and have done so with the now constitutionally
mandated mens rea of subjective foresight of death.  Parliament has chosen,
once it has been proven that an offender has committed murder, to classify
certain of those murders as first degree.  Murders that are done while
committing offences which involve the illegal domination of the victim by the
offender have been classified as first degree murder.  Forcible confinement is one
of those offences involving illegal domination.  The added element of forcible
confinement in the context of the commission of a murder, markedly enhances the
moral blameworthiness of an offender.  Indeed, forcible confinement is
punishable by up to ten years in prison.  The decision of Parliament to elevate
murders done while the offender commits forcible confinement to the level of
first degree murder is consonant with the principle of proportionality between
the blameworthiness of the offender and the punishment.  Further, it is
consistent with the individualization of sentencing especially since only those
who have killed with subjective foresight of death while also committing the
offence of forcible confinement are subjected to that punishment.  I,
therefore, can find no principle of fundamental justice that has been violated
by the combination of s. 214(5) (e) and
s. 669  of the Criminal
Code.  Equally, for these same reasons I
conclude that there is no violation of s. 2(e) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights.

 

    The appellant also submits in a separate
argument that the combination of s. 214(5) (e) and
s. 669  contravenes s. 9  of the Charter 
because of the imposition of a mandatory term of imprisonment by statute for an
offence that encompasses a range of moral turpitude.  This argument overlaps a
great deal with the appellant's s. 7  argument and I would only add the
following comments to those I have already made above.  The combined effect of
the impugned sections do not demonstrate arbitrariness on the part of
Parliament.  Indeed, as I noted above, Parliament has narrowly defined a class
of murderers under an organizing principle of illegal domination and has
specifically defined the conditions under which the offender can be found
guilty of first degree murder.  In order to be found guilty of first degree
murder under s. 214(5) (e), the offender must have committed murder with
subjective foresight of death and must have committed the murder ""while
committing or attempting to commit ... forcible confinement"".   Where the
act causing death and the acts constituting the forcible confinement all form
part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction, the
death is caused ""while committing"" an offence for the purposes of
s. 214(5) :  see Paré, supra at p. 632.  To commit the underlying offence
of forcible confinement, the offender must use ""physical restraint,
contrary to the wishes of the person restrained, but to which the victim
submits unwillingly, thereby depriving the person of his or her liberty to move
from one place to another"":  quoted from R. v. Dollan and Newstead (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 146, as cited with approval in R. v. Gratton (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 462 (Ont. C.A.).  It is true
that the definition of forcible confinement adopted by the courts allows for
varying circumstances in each individual case.  But this alone is not a sign of
arbitrariness.  The offence of forcible confinement as defined falls
clearly under the rubric of the organizing principle enunciated by Wilson J. in Paré,
namely that of the illegal domination of one person by another.  The decision
of Parliament to attach a minimum 25-year sentence without eligibility for
parole in cases of first degree murder, having regard to all these
circumstances, cannot be said to be arbitrary within the meaning of s. 9 
of the Charter .  The incarceration is statutorily authorized, it narrowly
defines a class of offenders with respect to whom the punishment will be
invoked and it prescribes quite specifically the conditions under which an
offender may be found guilty of first degree murder.  Further, the policy
decision of Parliament to classify these murders as first degree murders
accords with the broader objectives of a sentencing scheme.  The elevation of
murder while committing a forcible confinement to first degree reflects a
societal denunciation of those offenders who choose to exploit their position
of dominance and power to the point of murder.  

 

    The appellant's final argument is that the
combined effect of s. 214(5) (e) and s. 669  contravenes s. 12  of the Charter .  Section 12  of the Charter 
protects individuals against cruel and unusual punishment.  The phrase
""cruel and unusual punishment"" has been considered by this Court in R. v. Smith, supra.   That case held that the criterion to be applied
in order to determine whether a punishment is cruel and unusual is whether the
punishment is so excessive as to outrage standards of decency.  At pages 1072‑73
I stated that:

 

The
test for review under s. 12  of the Charter  is one
of gross disproportionality, because it is aimed at punishments that are more
than merely excessive.  We should be careful not to stigmatize every
disproportionate or excessive sentence as being a constitutional violation, and
should leave to the usual sentencing appeal process the task of reviewing the
fitness of a sentence.  Section 12  will only be infringed where the sentence is
so unfit having regard to the offence and the offender as to be grossly
disproportionate.  

 

    In assessing whether a sentence is grossly
disproportionate, the court must first consider the gravity of the offence, the
personal characteristics of the offender and the particular circumstances of
the case in order to determine what range of sentences would have been
appropriate to punish, rehabilitate or deter this particular offender or to
protect the public from this particular offender.

 

In Lyons, supra, La Forest J. addressed the meaning of the word
""grossly"" at pp. 344‑45:

 

The word ""grossly"" [as in ""grossly
disproportionate""], it seems to me, reflects this Court's concern not to
hold Parliament to a standard so exacting, at least in the context of
s. 12 , as to require punishments to be perfectly suited to accommodate the
moral nuances of every crime and every offender.

 

In my view, the combination of s. 214(5) (e) and
s. 669  does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  These sections
provide for punishment of the most serious crime in our criminal law, that of
first degree murder.  This is a crime that carries with it the most serious
level of moral blameworthiness, namely subjective foresight of death.  The
penalty is severe and deservedly so.  The minimum 25 years to be served before
eligibility for parole reflects society's condemnation of a person who has
exploited a position of power and dominance to the gravest extent possible by
murdering the person that he or she is forcibly confining.  The punishment is
not excessive and clearly does not outrage our standards of decency.  In my
view, it is within the purview of Parliament, in order to meet the objectives
of a rational system of sentencing, to treat our most serious crime with an
appropriate degree of certainty and severity.  I reiterate that even in the
case of first degree murder, Parliament has been sensitive to the particular
circumstances of each offender through various provisions allowing for the
royal prerogative of mercy, the availability of escorted absences from custody
for humanitarian and rehabilitative purposes and for early parole:  see
s. 672 (now s. 745), s. 674 (now s. 747) and s. 686
(now s. 751) of the Criminal
Code .  In Smith, supra,
at p. 1070, I quoted with approval the following statement by Borins Dist.
Ct. J. in R. v. Guiller:

 

    It is not for the court to pass on the wisdom of
Parliament with respect to the gravity of various offences and the range of
penalties which may be imposed upon those found guilty of committing the
offences.  Parliament has broad discretion in proscribing conduct as
criminal and in determining proper punishment.  While the final judgment as to
whether a punishment exceeds constitutional limits set by the Charter  is properly a judicial function the court should be
reluctant to interfere with the considered views of Parliament and then only in
the clearest of cases where the punishment prescribed is so excessive when
compared with the punishment prescribed for other offences as to outrage
standards of decency.

 

Therefore, I conclude that in the case at bar the
impugned provisions in combination do not represent cruel and unusual
punishment within the meaning of s. 12  of the Charter .

 

    The remaining issue is the potential application
of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) (now s. 686(1)(b)(iii))
of the Criminal Code .  I note that the trial judge charged the jury extensively
on s. 212 (a) (now s. 229 (a)) of
the Criminal Code  as well as on the effect of drunkenness in relation
to that section.  He also charged the jury secondarily on s. 213 (a) (now
s. 230 (a)).  He further told the jury to put aside any
consideration of planning and deliberation.  Therefore, the jury could only
rest its verdict of first degree murder on s. 214(5)  (now s. 231(5) ),
on which they were properly instructed.  In light of all the facts, especially
the fact that the appellant stabbed the victim a total of 15 times in the neck
and head, I am convinced that a jury could not have reasonably reached any
other verdict even if the error in leaving s. 213 (a) had
not occurred.  I would dismiss the appeal and answer the constitutional
questions as follows:

 

1.Does s. 230(a) [then
s. 213 (a)] of the Criminal Code 
contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

A.Yes.

 

2.If the answer to question 1 is affirmative, is
s. 230(a) [then s. 213 (a)] of
the Criminal Code  justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

A.No.

 

3.Is s. 231(5)(e) [then
s. 214(5) (e)] of the Criminal Code 
inconsistent with s. 7  of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.No.

 

4.Is s. 231(5)(e) [then
s. 214(5) (e)] in combination with s. 742(a) [then
s. 669 (a)] of the Criminal Code 
inconsistent with ss. 7 , 9  and, or in the alternative, s. 12  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.No.

 

5.Does s. 231(5)(e) [then
s. 214(5) (e)] in combination with s. 742 [then
s. 669 ] of the Criminal
Code  abrogate or infringe the rights
guaranteed by s. 2(e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights?

 

A.No.

 

6.If the answer to questions 3 or 4 is in the
affirmative, is s. 231(5)(e) [then s. 214(5) (e)]
justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

A.This
question does not have to be answered.

 

    Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

 

//L'Heureux-DubÉ//

 

    The following are the reasons delivered by

 

    L'HEUREUX‑DUBÉ J. ‑‑ I agree with my colleague Chief
Justice Lamer's ultimate disposition of this appeal.  However, given my
position in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, released concurrently, I
would answer constitutional questions 1 and 2 differently, and I wish to
qualify my concurrence with respect to s. 214(5)(e) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34 (now R.S.C.,
1985, c. C‑46 , s. 231 )5)(e)).

 

    The issues in this appeal are the
constitutionality of s. 213 (a) of the
Criminal Code  in light of
ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the
Charter , and the constitutionality of
s. 214(5) (e) in light of ss. 7 , 9 , and 12  of the Charter .  The following constitutional questions were stated by
the Chief Justice:

 

1.Does
s. 230(a) [then s. 213 (a)] of
the Criminal Code  contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by
s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 230(a) [then
s. 213 (a)] of the Criminal Code 
justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

3.Is
s. 231(5)(e) [then s. 214(5)(e)] of
the Criminal Code  inconsistent with s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

4.Is
s. 231(5)(e) [then s. 214(5)(e)] in
combination with s. 742(a) [then s. 669 (a)] of
the Criminal Code  inconsistent with ss. 7 , 9  and, or in the
alternative, s. 12  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

5.Does
s. 231(5)(e) [then s. 214(5)(e)] in
combination with s. 742 [then s. 669 ] of the Criminal Code  abrogate or infringe the rights guaranteed by s. 2(e) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights?

 

6.If the answer to questions 3 or 4 is in the
affirmative, is s. 231(5)(e) [then s. 214(5)(e)]
justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    I agree with my colleague's disposition of
questions 3 through 6.  However, for the reasons stated in Martineau, I am of the view that the first question must be answered
in the negative, and therefore the second question need not be answered.  I
would also answer question 3 in the negative, relying on my remarks in R. v. Arkell, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, released concurrently, as well as
the opinion of McLachlin J.A. (now of this Court) for the British Columbia
Court of Appeal in that case (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 402.

 

    In
Martineau, the sole issue was the
constitutionality of s. 213(a).  Under s. 213(a), a
whole series of requirements must be met before an accused can be convicted for
murder.  While I disagreed with my colleague's introduction of subjective
foresight of death as the exclusive constitutional standard to be applied for
the crime of murder, I do agree with his assessment in the present case that
""[t]he distinction between first and second degree murder only comes into
play when it has first been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender
is guilty of murder"" (p. 000).

 

    In order to be found guilty of first degree
murder under s. 214(5)(e), the offender must have committed murder
""while committing or attempting to commit. . . forcible
confinement"".  This is in addition to the stringent criteria for the crime
of murder itself; either subjective foresight of death, and/or the commission
of a predicate crime included in a circumscribed list of offences under
s. 213, combined with the concomitant intentional infliction of bodily
harm resulting in death.  When all of these factors are consolidated, it is
certainly appropriate for Parliament to impose its most severe punishment.

 

    Therefore I would dismiss this appeal answering
the constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.Does s. 230(a) [then
s. 213(a)] of the Criminal Code 
contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.No.

 

2.If the answer to question 1 is affirmative, is
s. 230(a) [then s. 213(a)] of
the Criminal Code  justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

A.This
question does not have to be answered.

 

3.Is s. 231(5)(e) [then
s. 214(5)(e)] of the Criminal Code 
inconsistent with s. 7  of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.No.

 

4.Is s. 231(5)(e) [then
s. 214(5)(e)] in combination with s. 742(a) [then
s. 669 (a)] of the Criminal Code 
inconsistent with ss. 7 , 9  and, or in the alternative, s. 12  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.No.

 

5.Does s. 231(5)(e) [then
s. 214(5)(e)] in combination with s. 742 [then
s. 669 ] of the Criminal
Code  abrogate or infringe the rights
guaranteed by s. 2(e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights?

 

A.No.

 

6.If the answer to questions 3 or 4 is in the
affirmative, is s. 231(5)(e) [then s. 214(5)(e)]
justified by s. 1  of the Canadian

    SOPINKA J. -- I agree with Chief Justice Lamer that the
appeal must be dismissed pursuant to s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34.  With
respect to s. 213(a), I would answer the constitutional questions in
the manner proposed by Lamer C.J.  I would do so for the reasons I gave in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000.  With respect to s. 214(5)(e), I
agree with Lamer C.J. except to the extent that he relies on the view that
murder, and hence first degree murder, constitutionally requires subjective
foresight of death.

    Respondents
were convicted of attempted murder.  During a robbery ‑‑ one of a
series ‑‑ a person was shot and severely injured.  Neither
respondent did the shooting.  Respondent Johnson, however, admitted to being
one of the robbers but stated that he had no intention to shoot and that there
had been no discussion concerning the use of guns.  Respondent Logan had
boasted of being involved in planning the robberies.  The trial judge
instructed the jury that the Crown had to establish beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused knew or ought to have known that someone would probably shoot
with the intention of killing.  The Court of Appeal allowed appeals with
respect to the convictions for attempted murder and substituted convictions for
robbery.  At issue here was (1) whether s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  infringed ss. 7  and/or 11(d) of the Charter , and
(2), if so, whether it was justified under s. 1 .

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ.:  R. v.
Vaillancourt cannot be construed as saying that, as a general
proposition, Parliament cannot ever enact provisions requiring different levels
of guilt for principal offenders and parties.  As a matter of policy, the
proposition seems more equitable than not but should not be characterized as a
principle of fundamental justice.

 

    There
are a few offences with respect to which the operation of the objective
component of s. 21(2)  will restrict the rights of an accused under
s. 7.  If an offence is one of the few for which s. 7 requires a
minimum degree of mens rea, Vaillancourt does
preclude Parliament from providing for the conviction of a party to that
offence on the basis of a degree of mens rea below the
constitutionally required minimum.

 

    The
question whether a party to an offence had the requisite mens rea to
found a conviction pursuant to s. 21(2)  must be answered in two
steps.  Firstly, is there a minimum degree of mens rea which
is required as a principle of fundamental justice before one can be convicted
as a principal for this particular offence?  Secondly, if the principles of
fundamental justice do require a certain minimum degree of mens rea in
order to convict for this offence, then that minimum degree of mens rea is
constitutionally required to convict a party to that offence as well.

 

    The
requisite mens rea for a murder conviction logically
must be the same for a conviction of attempted murder.  However, logic is not
sufficient reason to label something a ""constitutional requirement"".

 

    The
sentencing range available to the judge is not conclusive of the level of mens rea
constitutionally required.  Instead, the crucial consideration is whether there
is a continuing serious social stigma which will be imposed on the accused upon
conviction.

 

    The mens rea for
attempted murder cannot, without restricting s. 7  of the Charter ,
require less than subjective foresight of the accused ‑‑ the mental
element required of a murderer under s. 212 (a)(i). 
Parliament could well extend our definition of attempted murder to include the
unsuccessful murderers of s. 212 (a)(ii)
but it cannot go further and include objective foreseeability as being
sufficient for a conviction without restricting s. 7  of the Charter .

 

    When
the principles of fundamental justice require subjective foresight in
order to convict a principal of attempted murder, that same minimum degree of mens rea is
constitutionally required to convict a party to the offence of attempted
murder.  Any conviction for attempted murder, whether of the principal directly
or of a party pursuant to s. 21(2) , will carry enough stigma to trigger
the constitutional requirement.  To the extent that s. 21(2)  would allow
for the conviction of a party to the offence of attempted murder on the basis
of objective foreseeability, its operation restricts s. 7  of the Charter .

 

    Given
that a minimum degree of mens rea (subjective foresight) is
constitutionally required to convict a principal of the offence of attempted
murder, the restriction of s. 7  in this case is in convicting, through the
operation of s. 21(2) , a non‑principal who does not have that same
degree of mens rea.  It is not the legislative objective
of s. 21(2)  as a whole which this Court must scrutinize, but only the
legislative objective of that portion of s. 21(2)  that restricts the
accused's rights under s. 7  of the Charter  in
issue in the present case.  This differential treatment of parties and
principals charged with attempted murder is the restriction
which must undergo the s. 1  test.

 

    In
this case, the objective of such a differentiation is to deter joint criminal
enterprises and to encourage persons who do participate to ensure that their
accomplices do not commit offences beyond the planned unlawful purpose.  This
is a legislative objective of sufficient importance to justify overriding the
rights of an Accused under s. 7  of the Charter .

 

    The
objective of the legislation is that this possibility of conviction through
s. 21(2)  will make parties more responsible for the actions of their
accomplices.  Clearly, then, there is a rational connection between the
restriction and the legislative objective.  It, nevertheless, does not satisfy
the proportionality test because it unduly impairs an accused's rights under
s. 7  of the Charter .

 

    Because
of the importance of the legislative purpose, the objective component of
s. 21(2)  can be justified with respect to most offences.  However,
with respect to the few offences for which the Constitution requires subjective
intent, the stigma renders the infringement too serious and outweighs the
legislative objective which, therefore, cannot be justified under s. 1.

 

    The
words ""or ought to have known"" are inoperative when considering under
s. 21(2)  whether a person is a party to any offence where it is a
constitutional requirement for a conviction that foresight of the consequences
be subjective, which is the case for attempted murder.  Once these words are
deleted, the remaining section requires, in the context of attempted murder,
that the party to the common venture know that it is probable that his
accomplice would do something with the intent to kill in carrying out the
common purpose.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé J.:  The factors which, according to the majority,
operated to render the objective foreseeability standard unconstitutional in R. v.
Martineau are not importable to the crime of attempted murder.  A
conviction for attempted murder requires proof of the specific intent to kill. 
No lesser mens rea will suffice.  Parliament has decided
to create a distinct offence for attempted murder, recognizing that the results
of criminal acts are not to be ignored.  The death of a victim renders a
standard of objective foreseeability constitutionally permissible.  When the
attempt does not result in death, logic as well as principles of fundamental
justice enshrined in the Charter  dictate that the specific intent to
have committed the attempted murder must be conclusively proven.  When mere
attempts are at issue, mens rea assumes a dominant role.  The
rationale for invoking a test of subjective foresight for attempted murder does
not stem from the crime's relationship to the crime of completed murder, but
rather from its connection to crimes of attempt generally.  The motivation for
requiring subjective foresight for attempt crimes radiates from the primacy of
the mens rea component, not from any potential penalties or social
stigma that might attend conviction for the completed offence.

 

    For
mere attempts, no other unlawful act is necessary.  Intent is what is being
punished by s. 222, not the act itself.  The mens rea
criteria for the full offence of murder and mere attempt are necessarily
different.

 

    The
words ""ought to know"" are not to be read out of the section in all
cases.  This measure of objective foreseeability is certainly appropriate
when the mens rea of the principal can be ascertained
according to an objective standard as well.

 

    No
killing took place here.  The crime was one for which the specific intent of
the principal had to be shown.  In those instances where the principal is held
to a mens rea standard of subjective foresight, the party cannot constitutionally
be convicted for the same crime on the basis of an objective foreseeability
standard.  In this regard the actus reus component of the
offence cannot be ignored.  Policy considerations addressed in Martineau justify
treating completed killings more harshly than attempted ones.  If someone
who attempts to kill cannot be convicted unless the Crown proves that he had
the specific intent to do so, then he who accompanied the principal cannot be
convicted if the Crown merely shows that the attempted murder was objectively
foreseeable.

 

    Per Sopinka
J.:  There is no principle of fundamental justice whereby in all cases the
level of mens rea possessed by the principal offender
must also be possessed by the party.  The correct constitutional principle is
that if social stigma and other factors require the principal offender to
possess a constitutional minimum mind state in order to be convicted of an
offence, then a party under s. 21(2)  must possess that same minimum mind
state.  If it is assumed that murder requires subjective foresight of death, it
follows that subjective foresight is a constitutional requirement for attempted
murder.

judgment of Dickson C.J. and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ. was
delivered by

 

    LAMER C.J. --

 

Facts

 

    The
two respondents, Sutcliffe Logan Jr. and Warren Leroy Johnson, together with
two other co-accused, Hugh Logan (the brother of respondent Logan) and Clive
Brown, were all charged with a number of offences arising from a series of
robberies in the Toronto area.  This appeal pertains only to the charges
against the two respondents for attempted murder which resulted from an
incident during one of the robberies.

 

    The
facts surrounding the incident are as follows.  At around 11:00 p.m. on
September 23, 1983, Hugh Logan, Clive Brown and the respondent Warren Johnson
entered a convenience store, wearing masks and armed with revolvers.  Hugh
Logan shot the lone clerk, Barbara Turnbull, in the neck, causing severe
injuries.  The cash register was robbed and the men fled.

 

    While
awaiting trial on the charges, the respondents were held in protective custody
in a jail in the Toronto area.  Shortly before the trial, the police received
information from an informer that the respondent Sutcliffe Logan was boasting
openly about his involvement in the planning of the robberies, including the
one from which the attempted murder charges arose.  Two undercover police
officers were placed in protective custody with the respondents, posing as two
persons arrested on drug charges.  The officers struck up an acquaintance with
the two respondents who made certain inculpatory statements.  The officers
testified that they did not encourage the respondents to talk, but merely
provided the opportunity for the making of the statements.  The officers made
notes of the conversation immediately following the conversation during what
they pretended was a visit from an articling student from their lawyer's
office.

 

    These
statements were admitted into evidence at trial.  Also during the course of the
trial, the respondent Warren Johnson took the stand and, while admitting that
he was one of the robbers, testified that he had no intention to shoot anyone
and that there had been no discussion concerning the use of guns.

 

    In
his charge to the jury with respect to the respondent Warren Johnson, the trial
judge said that ""you may well have considerable doubt whether he knew or
should have known that one of his group would probably shoot somebody with the
intention to kill"".  With respect to the respondent Sutcliffe Logan, he
stated that ""you would then have to consider whether he knew or should
have known that one of the group would probably, in the course of the robbery,
shoot someone with intent to kill"".  In his explanation of s. 21 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, the trial judge instructed the
jury that ""[i]t must be established beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused knew or ought to have known that someone would probably shoot with the
intention of killing"".

 

    Hugh
Logan was found by the jury to have been the one who shot the victim.  The
respondents were convicted by the jury of a number offences including the
attempted murder of Barbara Turnbull.  The respondents appealed their
convictions to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.  The Court of Appeal allowed
their appeals with respect to the convictions for attempted murder, and
substituted convictions for armed robbery in their stead. The only issue before
this Court is the constitutionality of s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code .

Judgment
Below

 

Court of
Appeal for Ontario (1988), 63 O.R. (2d) 87

 

    The
Court began by reviewing the decision of this Court in R. v.
Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, with a view to considering its
effect on the provisions of s. 21  of the Criminal Code  in the
context of a charge of being a party to an attempted murder.  The Court noted
that the mens rea for the principal on a charge of
attempted murder ""cannot be less than the specific intent to kill"":  R. v.
Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225.  Indeed, the Court of Appeal
quoted at length from the judgment of McIntyre J. who spoke for the Court in
that case.  In the case at bar, the Court noted that it was open to the jury to
have a reasonable doubt as to whether the respondents knew it was a probable
consequence of the robbery that Hugh Logan would shoot with the intent to kill
and that the jury may have found them guilty on the basis of objective
foreseeability; that is, that the respondents ought to have known that the
shooting was a probable consequence of the robbery.  The Court concluded as
follows at pp. 133-34:

 

 

    As previously noted, on a charge of attempted
murder, the necessary mens rea must be that of an intention to
kill.  In our opinion, in so far as s. 21(2)  permits a conviction of a party
for the offence of attempted murder on the basis of objective foreseeability, a
lesser degree of mens rea than is required for the principal,
it is contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.  Nor do we think that
this departure from the principles of fundamental justice can be saved by s. 1 
of the Charter . 

 

                                                                        .
. .

 

    Thus,
on a charge of attempted murder, where s. 21(2)  is invoked to determine the
liability of a party to the offence, the words of s. 21(2) , ""ought to have
known"", must be held to be inoperative and cannot be resorted to by the
trier of fact to determine the guilt of such an accused person.

 

    Specifically
with respect to s. 1  of the Charter  the Court of Appeal held as follows
at pp. 133-34:

 

. . . it is unnecessary, in order to deter others, to
convict of attempted murder a person who did not know but ought to have known
that the principal would shoot with intent to kill.  Under such circumstances,
a person who forms an intention with one or more other persons to carry out an
armed robbery while armed with a firearm and to assist each other therein would
be guilty of armed robbery and of using a firearm in the commission of such an
indictable offence.

 

    Severe
sentences are imposed for armed robbery where all aggravating factors, such as
a severe injury to the person who was robbed, are entitled to be considered. 
Such a severe sentence should sufficiently deter others from engaging in such
criminal conduct.

 

    The
Court then noted that because the respondents had been convicted of attempted
murder, the trial judge stayed the armed robbery charges, of which the
respondents had also been convicted.  The Court of Appeal held that the trial
judge had erred in so doing, and it set aside the stay.  Convictions for armed
robbery were substituted for the attempted murder convictions and the matter
was referred back to the trial judge for sentencing.

 

Issues

 

    The
following constitutional questions were stated by Chief Justice Dickson:

 

    1.Does s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code 
contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

    2.If
the answer to question 1 is in the affirmative, is s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  justified under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

Analysis

 

R. v.
Vaillancourt

 

    The
appellant is challenging the constitutionality of s. 21(2)  in general and, in
particular, of the objective component of the section (""ought to have
known"").  However, the Court of Appeal, quite correctly, did not declare
the objective component of s. 21(2)  inoperative for all offences.  They dealt
specifically with the operation of the provision in relation to the offence of
attempted murder and the possibility that a party to an attempted murder could
be convicted upon proof of objective intent, whereas a conviction of the
principal would require proof of subjective intent.  More generally, as a basis
for their decision, the court determined that it is a principle of fundamental
justice that a party to any offence cannot be found guilty of the
offence based on a lower standard of requisite mens rea than
that required for convicting the principal.

 

    For
this proposition, the court relied on our judgment in
Vaillancourt.  In that case, this Court held that for a few offences
the principles of fundamental justice require that a conviction cannot stand
unless there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a minimum degree of mens rea, and
that legislation providing for any lesser degree violates the Charter  and is
inoperative.  Murder was one of those offences.

 

    With
respect, I cannot construe Vaillancourt as saying that, as
a general proposition, Parliament cannot ever enact provisions requiring
different levels of guilt for principal offenders and parties.  Although I
readily admit that, as a matter of policy, the proposition seems more equitable
than not, I am not ready to characterize it as a principle of fundamental
justice.  It must be remembered that within many offences there are varying
degrees of guilt and it remains the function of the sentencing process to
adjust the punishment for each individual offender accordingly.  The argument
that the principles of fundamental justice prohibit the conviction of a party
to an offence on the basis of a lesser degree of mens rea than
that required to convict the principal could only be supported, if at all, in a
situation where the sentence for a particular offence is fixed.  However,
currently in Canada, the sentencing scheme is flexible enough to accommodate
the varying degrees of culpability resulting from the operation of ss. 21  and
22 .

 

    That
said, however, there are a few offences with respect to which the operation of
the objective component of s. 21(2)  will restrict the rights of an accused
under s. 7 .  If an offence is one of the few for which s. 7  requires a minimum
degree of mens rea, Vaillancourt does
preclude Parliament from providing for the conviction of a party to that
offence on the basis of a degree of mens rea below the
constitutionally required minimum.

 

Requisite
Mens Rea for Conviction Pursuant to s. 21(2) 

 

    Therefore,
the question whether a party to an offence had the requisite mens rea to
found a conviction pursuant to s. 21(2)  must be answered in two steps. 
Firstly, is there a minimum degree of mens rea which
is required as a principle of fundamental justice before one can be convicted
as a principal for this particular offence?  This is an important initial step
because if there is no such constitutional requirement for the offence, the
objective component of s. 21(2)  can operate without restricting the
constitutional rights of the party to the offence.  Secondly, if the principles
of fundamental justice do require a certain minimum degree of mens rea in order
to convict for this offence, then that minimum degree of mens rea is
constitutionally required to convict a party to that offence as well.

 

    Step
One:  Section 7  and Attempted Murder

 

    With
respect to the case at bar, then, the first question which must be answered is
whether the principles of fundamental justice require a minimum degree of mens rea in
order to convict an Accused of attempted murder.  Ancio
established that a specific intent to kill is the mens rea
required for a principal on the charge of attempted murder.  However, as the
constitutional question was not raised or argued in that case, it did not
decide whether that requisite mens rea was a constitutional
requirement.  The case simply interpreted the offence as currently legislated.

 

    In R. v.
Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, a judgment handed down this day,
this Court has decided, as a constitutional requirement, that no one can be
convicted of murder unless the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the
person had subjective foresight of the fact that the death of the victim
was likely to ensue.  Because of both the stigma and the severe penal
consequences which result from a conviction for murder, the Constitution
requires at least that degree of intent.

 

    As
defined in Ancio, the elements of mens rea for
attempted murder are identical to those for the most severe form of murder,
murder under s. 212(a)(i).  For each, the accused must have had the specific
intent to kill.  All that differs is the ""consequences"" component of
the actus reus.  Quite simply, an attempted murderer is, if caught and
convicted, a ""lucky murderer"".  Therefore, it would seem logical that
the requisite mens rea for a murder conviction, as described
in Martineau, must be the same for a conviction of attempted murder. 
However, logic is not sufficient reason to label something a
""constitutional requirement"".  As I have stated in
Vaillancourt, the principles of fundamental justice require a
minimum degree of mens rea for only a very few offences.  The
criteria by which these offences can be identified are, primarily, the stigma
associated with a conviction and, as a secondary consideration, the penalties
available.

 

    The
stigma associated with a conviction for attempted murder is the same as it is
for murder.  Such a conviction reveals that although no death ensued from the
actions of the accused, the intent to kill was still present in his or her
mind.  The attempted murderer is no less a killer than a murderer:  he may be
lucky -- the ambulance arrived early, or some other fortuitous circumstance --
but he still has the same killer instinct.  Secondly, while a conviction for
attempted murder does not automatically result in a life sentence, the offence
is punishable by life and the usual penalty is very severe.

 

    It
should be noted that, as a basis for a constitutionally required minimum degree
of mens rea, the social stigma associated with a conviction is the
most important consideration, not the sentence.   Few offences have a high
minimum sentence such as that for murder.  For some offences, there is a high
maximum and a low minimum penalty available; for other offences, the maximum
penalty is much reduced and there is no minimum imposed whatsoever.  In either
situation, the fact that a lesser sentence is available or imposed, by statute
or through the exercise of judicial discretion, in no way ends the inquiry.  
The sentencing range available to the judge is not conclusive of the level of mens rea
constitutionally required.  Instead, the crucial consideration is whether there
is a continuing serious social stigma which will be imposed on the accused upon
conviction.

 

    For
example, the offence of theft in the most serious circumstances is punishable
by a maximum of ten years or, in less serious circumstances, a maximum of two
years if the Crown proceeds by indictment; if the Crown proceeds summarily, the
maximum is six months.  The constitutional mens rea
requirement would not, under s. 7 , be triggered by any punishment within these
ranges which the sentencing judge decided to impose.  Whether the actual or
available punishment is severe or not, the social stigma associated with being
labelled dishonest will be automatically and unavoidably imposed upon
conviction.  It is because of this stigma that the principles of fundamental
justice will require a minimum degree of mens rea, that
is, as I said in Vaillancourt, at p. 653,
""proof of some dishonesty"".

 

    For
these reasons, the mens rea for attempted murder cannot, without
restricting s. 7  of the Charter , require of the accused less of a
mental element than that required of a murderer under s. 212 (a)(i),
that is, subjective foresight of the consequences.  While Parliament, as
I have already implied, could well extend our definition of attempted murder in Ancio to
include the unsuccessful murderers of s. 212 (a)(ii),
it cannot go further and include objective foreseeability as being sufficient
for a conviction without restricting s. 7  of the Charter .

 

    Step
Two:  Mens Rea for Attempted Murder Pursuant to s. 21(2) 

 

    Having
completed the initial step of the inquiry, one can proceed to the second step
in determining the requisite mens rea for the conviction of a party
pursuant to s. 21(2)  on a charge of attempted murder.  When the principles of
fundamental justice require subjective foresight in order to convict a
principal of attempted murder, that same minimum degree of mens rea is
constitutionally required to convict a party to the offence of attempted
murder.  Any conviction for attempted murder, whether of the principal directly
or of a party pursuant to s. 21(2) , will carry enough stigma to trigger the
constitutional requirement.  To the extent that s. 21(2)  would allow for the
conviction of a party to the offence of attempted murder on the basis of
objective foreseeability, its operation restricts s. 7  of the Charter .

 

Section 1 
Analysis

 

    Given
the finding that s. 7  is restricted in the present case, can that restriction
be found to be a reasonable limit demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society?  The section 1  analysis to be followed in answering this
question has been set out in the decision of this Court in R. v.
Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103.

 

    In
determining the importance of the legislative objective, it is necessary to
focus on what exactly needs to be justified in each particular case.  At this
stage, the finding that the offence of attempted murder requires, as a
principle of fundamental justice, a minimum degree of mens rea is not
in issue, but merely triggers the restriction under s. 21(2) .  The requisite mens rea for
attempted murder is not the issue undergoing the s. 1  test because the current
legislation for attempted murder, as interpreted by this Court in Ancio, meets the
constitutional requirement of subjective foresight, i.e., a specific intent to
kill.

 

    Given
that a minimum degree of mens rea (subjective foresight) is
constitutionally required to convict a principal of the offence of attempted
murder, the restriction of s. 7  in this case is in convicting, through the
operation of s. 21(2) , a non-principal who does not have that same degree of mens rea.  It is
not the legislative objective of s. 21(2)  as a whole which this Court must
scrutinize, but only the legislative objective of that portion of s. 21(2)  that
restricts the accused's rights under s. 7  of the Charter  in
issue in the present case.  This differential treatment of parties and
principals charged with attempted murder is the restriction which must
undergo the s. 1  test.

 

    In
this case, the objective of such a differentiation is to deter joint criminal
enterprises and to encourage persons who do participate to ensure that their
accomplices do not commit offences beyond the planned unlawful purpose.  This
is a legislative objective of sufficient importance to justify overriding the
rights of an Accused under s. 7  of the Charter .

 

    The
next question to be addressed is whether the means by which Parliament has
chosen to achieve that purpose are reasonable and justified, that is, if they
are proportional to the objective they are meant to achieve.

 

    First,
a rational connection must be shown between the legislative objective and the
restriction.  By operation of s. 21(2)  with respect to attempted murder, any
person involved with others in an unlawful purpose is held responsible for the
acts of all accomplices, whether or not that person actually foresaw that the
accomplice would try to kill someone in furtherance of the unlawful purpose. 
The objective of the legislation is that this possibility of conviction through
s. 21(2)  will make parties more responsible for the actions of their
accomplices.  Clearly, then, there is a rational connection between the
restriction and the legislative objective.

 

    However,
even though Parliament has sought to achieve an important legislative objective
by enacting the restriction in issue in this appeal and even though such
restriction is rationally connected to that objective, I am of the view that it
does not satisfy the proportionality test because it unduly impairs an
accused's rights under s. 7  of the Charter  (see
Vaillancourt, supra, at p. 651).

 

    The
objective component of s. 21(2)  unduly impairs rights under s. 7  of the Charter  when it
operates with respect to an offence for which a conviction carries severe
stigma and for which, therefore, there is a constitutionally required minimum
degree of mens rea.  The words ""ought to know""
allow for the possibility that while a party may not have considered and
accepted the risk that an accomplice may do something with the intent to kill
in furtherance of the common purpose, the party, through this negligence, could
still be found guilty of attempted murder.  In other words, parties could be
held to be criminally negligent with respect to the behaviour of someone else. 
For most offences under the Criminal Code , a person is only
convicted for criminal negligence if consequences have ensued from their
actions.  While a person may be convicted, absent consequences, for criminal
negligence (e.g., dangerous operation of a motor vehicle), none of these forms
of criminal negligence carry with them the stigma of being labelled a
""killer"".  In a situation where s. 21(2)  is operating in relation to
the offence of attempted murder, no consequences have resulted from the actions
of the party and yet the party could be convicted of this offence and suffer
severe accompanying stigma and penalty.

 

    Because
of the importance of the legislative purpose, the objective component of s.
21(2)  can be justified with respect to most offences.  However, with respect to
the few offences for which the Constitution requires subjective intent, the
stigma renders the infringement too serious and outweighs the legislative
objective which, therefore, cannot be justified under s. 1 .

 

Conclusion

 

    I
would, therefore, as did the Court of Appeal, declare inoperative the words
""or ought to have known"" when considering under s. 21(2)  whether a
person is a party to any offence where it is a constitutional requirement for a
conviction that foresight of the consequences be subjective, which is the case
for attempted murder.  Once these words are deleted, the remaining section
requires, in the context of attempted murder, that the party to the common
venture know that it is probable that his accomplice would do something with
the intent to kill in carrying out the common purpose.

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal.  I would restrict my answers to the constitutional
questions as follows:

 

    1.Does
s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code  contravene the
rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Yes, on charges where subjective foresight is a
constitutional requirement, to the extent that a party may be convicted if that
person objectively ""ought to have known"" that the commission of the
offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose.

 

    2.If
the answer to question 1 is in the affirmative, is s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  justified under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

No.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    L'HEUREUX-DUBÉ J. --
Having had the advantage of the reasons of my colleague, Chief Justice Lamer,
and given my position in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000, and R. v. Rodney, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000, released concurrently, I cannot completely agree either with his reasons
or with his answers to the constitutional question although I concur in his
ultimate disposition of this appeal.

 

    The
sole issue in this case is the constitutionality of s. 21(2) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  This appeal does not challenge
the constitutionality of s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code .  Therefore, my colleague's oblique reference to Martineau is
somewhat inapposite.  In that decision, a minimum standard of subjective
foresight for murder was imposed based on the severity of punishment and the
stigma associated with that crime.  I disagreed that those factors operated to
render an objective foreseeability standard unconstitutional, and I certainly
do not believe that they are importable to the crime that is at issue in the
present appeal.

 

    In
this case, the accused were charged with attempted murder.  Such an
offence must be treated differently, especially as regards the connection
between actus reus and mens rea, than the crime of murder.

 

    Chief
Justice Dickson framed the constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.Does s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code 
contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is in the affirmative, is s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  justified under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    Section
21  of the Criminal Code  reads:

 

21. (1) Every one is a party to an offence who

 

                                   (a)actually
commits it,

 

(b)does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding
any person to commit it, or

 

(c)abets any person in committing it.

 

    (2)
Where two or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful
purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of them, in carrying out
the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have
known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of
carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence.

 

    The
Ontario Court of Appeal held that s. 21(2) cannot operate in a manner so as to
impose a constitutionally lower mens rea requirement, i.e.,
objective foreseeability, on a party than the Criminal Code  imposes
on the principal who actually committed or attempted to commit the criminal
offence, i.e., subjective foresight in the case of attempted murder.  (I agree
with the caveat that Lamer C.J. himself puts in his reasons when he discusses
the application of R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636, in relation to the Court of Appeal's determination as regards a party to any
offence.)  This is in contrast to Rodney and Martineau, where
the issue was the application of s. 21  to the crime of murder, for which,
according to my reasons in Martineau, I believe a test of objective
foreseeability is appropriate.  In Martineau, I did not have to
address s. 21  because only paragraphs 21(1) (a) and (b) were
included in the jury charge in conjunction with s. 213 (a). 
Unlike s. 21(2), these provisions do not invoke the objective foreseeability
standard at stake in the present case.

 

    Only
the offence of attempted murder is at issue in this appeal, and it is
defined by s. 222  of the Criminal Code :

 

    222. 
Everyone who attempts by any means to commit murder is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for life.

 

    As
this Court held in R. v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R.
225, a conviction for attempted murder requires proof of the specific intent to
kill.  No lesser mens rea will suffice.  Parliament has decided
to create a distinct offence for attempted murder, recognizing that the results
of criminal acts are not to be ignored.  The death of a victim renders a
standard of objective foreseeability constitutionally permissible.  When the
attempt does not result in death, logic as well as principles of fundamental
justice enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
dictate that the specific intent to commit the attempted murder crime must be
conclusively proven.  As I said in Martineau at p. 000:

 

If both
components, actus reus as well as mens rea, are
not considered when assessing the level of fault attributable to an offender,
we would see manslaughter and assault causing bodily harm as no more worthy of
condemnation than an assault.  Mere attempts would become as serious as full
offences.

 

    When
mere attempts are at issue, mens rea assumes a dominant role.  The
rationale for invoking a test of subjective foresight for attempted murder does
not stem from the crime's relationship to the crime of completed murder, but
rather from its connection to crimes of attempt generally.  Therefore, I do not
choose to follow my colleague's dialectic on the impact of fundamental justice,
or of constitutional compulsion upon Parliamentary sovereignty when legislating
with respect to these crimes.  The motivation for requiring subjective
foresight for attempt crimes radiates from the primacy of the mens rea
component, not from any potential penalties or social stigma that might attend
conviction for the completed offence.

 

    Part
of the policy justification for enacting s. 213 (a),
invoked in Martineau, was that the act of killing cannot
be disassociated from the mental element that motivated it.  An exclusive
examination of intent would ignore the fact that someone has been unlawfully
killed.  In the aftermath of such a killing it is appropriate to ask whether
such a killing was objectively foreseeable, given the circumscribed list of
predicate offences under s. 213 , coupled with the intent to inflict bodily
harm.  For mere attempts, no other unlawful act is necessary.  Intent is what
is being punished by s. 222 , not the act itself.  The mens rea
criteria for the full offence of murder and mere attempt are necessarily
different.  As McIntyre J., for the Court, held in Ancio at pp.
247-49:

 

Indeed, because the crime of attempt may be complete
without the actual commission of any other offence and even without the
performance of any act unlawful in itself, it is abundantly clear that the
criminal element of the offence of attempt may lie solely in the intent.

 

                                                                        .
. .

 

The
completed offence of murder involves a killing.  The intention to commit the
complete offence of murder must therefore include an intention to kill.  I find
it impossible to conclude that a person may intend to commit the unintentional
killings described in ss. 212  and 213  [now ss. 229 and 230] of the Code.  I am
then of the view that the mens rea for an attempted murder cannot be
less than the specific intent to kill.

 

    After
citing this authority, the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded at p. 133:

 

. . . in
so far as s. 21(2) permits a conviction of a party for the offence of attempted
murder on the basis of objective foreseeability, a lesser degree of mens rea than is
required for the principal, it is contrary to the principles of fundamental
justice.  Nor do we think that this departure from the principles of
fundamental justice can be saved by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    The
solution adopted by the Court of Appeal, at p. 134, was to read down the
provision as follows:

 

    Thus,
on a charge of attempted murder, where s. 21(2) is invoked to determine the
liability of a party to the offence, the words of s. 21(2), ""ought to have
known"", must be held to be inoperative and cannot be resorted to by the
trier of fact to determine the guilt of such an accused person. 

 

    The
words ""ought to know"" are not to be read out of the section in all
cases.  This measure of objective foreseeability is certainly appropriate when
the mens rea of the principal can be ascertained according to an
objective standard as well.  For example, a party to a completed murder
can be convicted under s. 21(2) in its present form, if, as in Martineau and Rodney, the
stringent criteria of s. 213 (a), including the
objective foreseeability of death, have all been proven.  That is precisely the
""guaranteed minimum"" degree of mens rea
prescribed by this Court in R. v. Vaillancourt, supra.

 

    However,
in the present case no killing took place.  The crime was one for which the
specific intent of the principal had to be shown.  In those instances where the
principal is held to a mens rea standard of subjective foresight, the
party cannot constitutionally be convicted for the same crime on the basis of
an objective foreseeability standard.  In this regard the actus reus
component of the offence cannot be ignored.  Policy considerations addressed in Martineau justify
treating completed killings more harshly than attempted ones.  If someone who
attempts to kill cannot be convicted unless the Crown proves that he had the
specific intent to do so, then he who accompanied the principal cannot be
convicted if the Crown merely shows that the attempted murder was objectively
foreseeable.

 

    Therefore,
I would dismiss this appeal and answer the constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code  contravene the
rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Yes, in so far as a party can be convicted on the basis
that he or she ought to have known that an offence was a probable result of the
common purpose, in cases where a subjective standard is constitutionally
required for the principal; as a result, the words ""ought to know""
are inoperative in cases, and only in those cases, where subjective foresight
is constitutionally required of the principal.

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is in the affirmative, is s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  justified under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

In those aforementioned instances, the violation is not
justified under s. 1 .

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    SOPINKA J. -- I
have had the opportunity of reading the reasons for judgement herein prepared
by Chief Justice Lamer and Justice L'Heureux-Dubé. 

 

    I
concur in the result reached by Lamer C.J. and L'Heureux-Dubé J.  I disagree
with the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal that there is a principle of
fundamental justice whereby in all cases the level of mens rea
possessed by the principal offender must also be possessed by the party.   I
agree with Lamer C.J. that the correct constitutional principle is that if
social stigma and other factors require the principal offender to possess a
constitutional minimum mind state in order to be convicted of an offence, then
a party under s. 21(2)  must possess that same minimum mind state.  

 

    The
majority of the Court in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000, concludes that murder is a special offence requiring subjective foresight
of death.  In my reasons in Martineau I explain why it is unnecessary to
determine this issue beyond applying  R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 636.   Assuming that the majority in Martineau is
correct, it would follow that subjective foresight is a constitutional
requirement for attempted murder.  On that basis, applying the constitutional principles
relating to s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, formulated by Lamer C.J., the party must be shown to have the same mental
state.

    Respondent,
a 17‑year‑old who had been living in a common law relationship and
who had fathered a child, was tried in adult court and convicted of first
degree murder.  After a lengthy evening interrogation at the police station, he
made an oral inculpatory statement and was then asked if he wanted an adult
relative present.  The relative attended and was present for about three
minutes of the interrogation.  J.T.J. was charged with murder and informed of
his right to counsel.  His clothing was seized and hair and finger nail scrapings
were taken before his lawyer arrived after midnight.  The lawyer spoke with
J.T.J. and then with the adult relative.  The police again interrogated J.T.J.
and neither his lawyer nor the adult relative was present.  Indeed, the police
this time did not ask him if he wished to have an adult relative present. 
J.T.J. made an oral inculpatory statement during this interrogation but twice
refused to make a written statement.  En route to a
youth detention facility in the very early morning after almost nine hours of
custody, the police stopped at site of the crime and asked more
questions.  J.T.J. responded by nodding or pointing, coupled with some
verbal responses.

 

    The
verdict was overturned on appeal and a new trial directed.  J.T.J. was again
found guilty of first degree murder and for a second time launched an
appeal.  On this occasion the appeal was allowed in part and a verdict of
manslaughter was substituted for that of first degree murder.  The Crown
appealed and respondent cross‑appealed.

 

    The
constitutional questions before this Court queried whether s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  contravened ss. 7  and/or 11(d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and, if so, whether it was justified
by s. 1 .  Also at issue was whether the provisions of s. 56 of the Young
Offenders Act had been complied with so that the statements made by
respondent could be admitted.

 

    Held
(L'Heureux‑Dubé J. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed and the
cross‑appeal allowed.  The first constitutional question should be
answered in the affirmative, the second in the negative.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ.:  Section 213 (a) was
unconstitutional for the reasons given by Lamer C.J. in R. v.
Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000.

 

    Parliament,
in enacting s. 56 of the Young Offenders Act,
recognized the problems and difficulties that beset young people when
confronted with authority.  The section is to protect all young people
of 17 years or less and must be applied uniformly without regard to the
characteristics of the particular young person.  Notwithstanding their bravado,
young people would not appreciate the nature of their rights to the same extent
as would most adults and are more susceptible to subtle threats arising from
their surroundings and from persons in authority.  It is just and appropriate
that young people be provided with additional safeguards before their
statements should be admitted.  Under s. 56(2) no statement given
by a young person to a person in authority is admissible without compliance
with its enunciated requirements.  These requirements are eminently fair
and reasonable.

 

    J.T.J.'s
statements complied with s. 56(2)(a)
because they were voluntary.  They also complied with s. 56(2)(b)(i) and
(ii) in that J.T.J. was told that he was under no obligation to give a
statement and that any statement given by him might be used as evidence.  None
of the statements made by J.T.J., however, complied with either s. 56(2)(b)(iii) or
(iv).  He was not told that before a statement was made that he had the right
to consult counsel or an adult relative and neither counsel nor an adult person
was present when he made any of his statements.

 

    J.T.J.'s
first statement was inadmissible in that it was not spontaneous and therefore
within the purview of s. 56(3).  J.T.J. was only a suspect when it was
made.  The police, if they had wished to obtain a statement from J.T.J. at that
time, should have complied with the provisions of s. 56(2), particularly
since they were familiar with its requirements.  And, they should have
advised J.T.J. once again of his right to have either an adult or his lawyer
present if they wished to obtain a statement from J.T.J. by their continued
questioning.  Both he and his lawyer were entitled to expect that the police
would comply with the provisions of s. 56.

 

    J.T.J.'s
refusal to give a written statement did not demonstrate that he was aware of
his rights and had either waived them or did not wish to exercise them.  It
could just as effectively indicate that he was not fully aware of his rights
and that he believed an oral statement was not of the same significance as a
written statement.

 

    The
statement made up of gestures and verbal responses made en route to the
youth detention centre were inadmissible for want of compliance with
s. 56(2).  The gestures and verbal responses are all an integral part of
the final statement given in response to continued police questioning and
cannot be separated the one from the other.

 

    Per Sopinka
J.:  For the reasons expressed in R. v. Martineau, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 000, the constitutional questions should be answered in the same
manner as Cory J.  For the reasons given by Cory J., the statements made to the
police by J.T.J. are inadmissible and a new trial should be ordered on the
charge of manslaughter given the way in which the case was presented.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé J. (dissenting):  For the reasons stated in R. v.
Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  does not violate ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

    All
the evidence at issue would have been admissible were it not for J.T.J.'s age. 
There was strict compliance with all the substantial procedural protection
afforded adults through basic principles of fundamental justice entrenched in
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

    The
importance of the dispositions of the Young Offenders Act cannot
be overemphasized.  Police must be particularly vigilant to observe the rights
of suspected young offenders, recognizing their tender years and susceptibility
to influence.

 

    Young
offenders suspected of a criminal offence should be treated in a manner
befitting their age.  The term ""young persons"" cannot be interpreted
in static isolation; the spirit of the Act reflects the evolution of the
maturation process.  Certain relevant ""indicia of adulthood""
must be considered, especially when dealing with an offender approaching the
end of his or her term of protection under the Act.  While principles of
fairness require that s. 56 be applied uniformly, the totality of
circumstances of the particular case must be taken into account when measuring
compliance with the Young Offenders Act.  Such an
interpretation is consistent with a liberal construction of the Act.  In crimes
involving young offenders, the fear is that the ""totality of circumstances""
approach does not provide a minimum of consultation with either an adult or
counsel, and that even under the per se approach, consultation with an adult
may not be sufficient.  J.T.J.  had both.  Therefore, even under the most
stringent of per se standards, the accused in the present case was extended
every procedural protection.

 

    The
accused was relatively mature, well apprised of his predicament and alerted to
the dangers of answering certain questions after he had received explicit
warnings from both the police and his lawyer.  The indicia of his adulthood do
not excuse non-compliance with the Act.

 

    The
accused's willingness to respond can be considered ""constructive
desire"" given all of the preceding events and the continued presence of J.T.J.'s
adult relative at the police station.  Having regard to the totality of
circumstances, it must have been clear to the accused that he could decline to
comment in the absence of his lawyer just as he refused to sign the written
waiver.  His pattern of behaviour reflected a deliberate and considered
decision‑making process indicating a conscious choice to proceed with his
statement in the absence of his counsel.

 

    The
police have no discretion regarding compliance under the Act.  The legislation
itself, however, provides a means by which any impugned statements can be
assessed as to whether they were made ""voluntarily, knowingly, and
intelligently"".

 

    Holding
a third trial in this case would ignore the spirit of the Young
Offenders Act, generate palpable disrespect for the criminal justice
system and cast serious aspersions on the benefits and balances inherent in the
Act.

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ. was
delivered by

 

    CORY J. --
The prime concern on this appeal is whether the provisions of s. 56 of the Young
Offenders Act, S.C. 1980‑81‑82‑83, c. 110, as
amended, were met so that the statements made to the police by J.T.J. could be
admitted.

 

Factual
Background

 

    The
crime committed in this case was violent and brutal.  The facts pertaining to
it are both depressing and enraging.

 

    Shortly
after 8:00 p.m. on Friday evening September 13, 1985, a three‑year-old
girl was pulled into a garage and sexually assaulted.  Because she cried, her
skull was smashed with a 50‑pound cinder block.  She died instantly. 
Head hair similar to that of J.T.J. and that of the victim were found on the
cinder block close to the child's body.  A pubic hair similar to that of J.T.J.
was located on the garage floor in the area where the body was found.  Fibres
similar to those found in the clothing that J.T.J. wore at the time were found
on the body of the victim and on her clothing.

 

    At
the time of the crime, J.T.J. was 17 years old and as a young person came
within the provisions of the Young Offenders Act.  The day
following the murder, at about 7:10 p.m., the police arrived at the house where
J.T.J. was living and took him down to the police station for questioning. 
They did not advise him as to their reasons for picking him up.  At 7:30
p.m. he was placed in an interrogation room.  The police then left him alone to
get a coffee.  They offered a cup to the accused which he accepted.  They then
questioned him for some time and finally left him at 10:23 p.m.

 

    At
11:05 p.m. the police team came back into the interview room.  They accused him
of lying to them.  He was asked if he remembered anything at all about the
little girl.  J.T.J. replied that he had grabbed her, taken her to a garage down
the lane and then blacked out.

 

    It
was only then that the police asked if he wanted to have his uncle present and
he replied that he did.  The police left the interview room and arranged for
the attendance of the ""uncle"", who was in reality a cousin with whom
the accused was living.  At this time J.T.J. was charged with the murder of the
little girl and informed of his right to retain and instruct counsel.  J.T.J.
indicated that he wished to retain counsel.  His ""uncle"" appeared to
approve this decision.  It is worth noting that the uncle was only with the
appellant for three minutes throughout the entire period of the police
interrogation.

 

    J.T.J.
was taken to a telephone in order to call a lawyer.  He then was taken back to
the interview room a few minutes after the call was made.  His clothing was
seized together with some hair samples and finger nail scrapings.

 

    At
12:23 a.m. a lawyer arrived and spoke to J.T.J.  At 1:09 a.m. the lawyer left
J.T.J. in the interview room and went to talk with the adult uncle/cousin,
H.J.  At 1:28 a.m. the appellant J.T.J. was taken to be fingerprinted and
photographed.  When the necessary process was completed, he was once again
returned to the interview room.  At 1:50 a.m. the police re‑entered the
room and took the routine background information from him.  At 1:55 a.m. they
asked J.T.J. if he wished to make a written statement and he refused.  The police
then began to question him regarding his activities on the night of the
murder.  The police concede that they did not ask him if he wished to have his
cousin or lawyer present.  J.T.J. then made an inculpatory statement.  When the
oral statement was completed, the police again asked J.T.J. if he wished to
make a written statement.  He said he would think it over.  The police left for
a very few minutes.  When they returned at 2:10 a.m. he once again refused
to make a written statement.

 

    At
3:40 a.m. he was put into a police car to be transferred to a youth detention
facility.  On route, the police stopped the car in front of the building where
the little girl had been killed.  J.T.J. was asked further questions such as
the route he had taken to the scene of the killing and the door by which he
left the garage.  He was then taken to the garage itself and asked further
questions to which he responded by nodding or pointing, coupled with some
verbal responses.

 

    J.T.J.
was tried in an adult court and convicted of first degree murder.  This verdict
was overturned on appeal and a new trial was directed.  At the second trial the
accused J.T.J. was again found guilty of first degree murder and for a second
time launched an appeal.  On this occasion the appeal was allowed in part and
the majority of the Court of Appeal substituted a verdict of manslaughter for
that of first degree murder.

 

Decision
in the Court of Appeal (1988), 50 Man. R. (2d) 300

 

    Huband
J.A., writing for the majority, was of the view that the oral statement which
was made in response to police questioning at 1:55 a.m., subsequent to the
accused's having consulted with counsel, was not admissible as the requirements
set out in s. 56 of the Young Offenders Act had not been met. 
However, he concluded that the gestures and statements made by the accused at
the scene of the crime were admissible.  In the result, he would have
substituted a verdict of manslaughter for that of murder.

 

    O'Sullivan
J.A. indicated that he would have found both the oral statement and the
subsequent gestures and statements made at the scene of the crime to be
inadmissible.  However, as both Huband J.A. and Monnin C.J.M. would have
admitted the gestures, he agreed with the conclusion reached by Huband J.A.
that a verdict of manslaughter should be substituted for that of murder.

 

    Monnin
C.J.M. considered that there had been substantial compliance with s. 56 so
as to render admissible the statements and the gestures.  He would have
dismissed the appeal.

 

Issues

 

    The
constitutional questions were stated as follows by Dickson C.J. in his order of
October 4, 1989:

 

1.Does s. 213(a) of the Criminal
Code  (now s. 230 (a) of the Criminal
Code , R.S.C., 1985) contravene the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by s. 7  and/or 11(d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  (now s. 230 (a) of the Criminal
Code , R.S.C., 1985) justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    In
addition to the constitutional questions, there is the issue as to whether the
provisions of s. 56 of the Young Offenders Act had
been complied with so that the statements made by J.T.J. could be admitted.

 

Requirements
of the Young Offenders Act

 

    Section
3 of the Young Offenders Act sets out the aim
of the legislation.  It reads as follows:

 

    3. (1)  It is hereby recognized and
declared that

 

(a) while young persons should not in all instances be
held accountable in the same manner or suffer the same consequences for their
behaviour as adults, young persons who commit offences should nonetheless bear
responsibility for their contraventions;

 

(b) society must, although it has the responsibility to
take reasonable measures to prevent criminal conduct by young persons, be
afforded the necessary protection from illegal behaviour;

 

(c) young persons who commit offences require supervision,
discipline and control, but, because of their state of dependency and level of
development and maturity, they also have special needs and require guidance and
assistance;

 

(d) where it is not inconsistent with the protection of
society, taking no measures or taking measures other than judicial proceedings
under this Act should be considered for dealing with young persons who have
committed offences;

 

(e) young persons have rights and freedoms in their own
right, including those stated in the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  or in the Canadian Bill of Rights, and in
particular a right to be heard in the course of, and to participate in, the
processes that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons should
have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms;

 

(f) in the application of this Act, the rights and
freedoms of young persons include a right to the least possible interference
with freedom that is consistent with the protection of society, having regard
to the needs of young persons and the interests of their families;

 

(g) young persons have the right, in every instance where
they have rights or freedoms that may be affected by this Act, to be informed
as to what those rights and freedoms are; and

 

(h) parents have responsibility for the care and
supervision of their children, and, for that reason, young persons should be
removed from parental supervision either partly or entirely only when measures
that provide for continuing parental supervision are inappropriate.

 

    (2)
This Act shall be liberally construed to the end that young persons will be
dealt with in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1).

 

    Section
56 of the Act expands upon these principles in the context of statements made
by youths to persons in authority.  In 1985 that section read as follows:

 

    56. (1) Subject to this section, the law
relating to the admissibility of statements made by persons accused of
committing offences applies in respect of young persons.

 

    (2) No oral or written statement given by a young
person to a peace officer or other person who is, in law, a person in authority
is admissible against the young person unless

 

(a)the statement was voluntary;

 

(b) the person to whom the statement was given has, before
the statement was made, clearly explained to the young person, in language
appropriate to his age and understanding, that

 

(i) the young person is under no obligation to give a
statement,

 

(ii) any statement given by him may be used as evidence
in proceedings against him,

 

(iii) the young person has the right to consult another
person in accordance with paragraph (c), and

 

(iv) any statement made by the young person is required
to be made in the presence of the person consulted, unless the young person
desires otherwise;

 

(c)  the young person has, before the statement was made,
been given a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent, or in
the absence of a parent, an adult relative, or in the absence of a parent and
an adult relative, any other appropriate adult chosen by the young person; and

 

(d) where the young person consults any person pursuant to
paragraph (c), the young person has been given a reasonable
opportunity to make the statement in the presence of that person.

 

    (3) The requirements set out in paragraphs 2(b), (c) and (d) do not
apply in respect of oral statements where they are made spontaneously by the
young person to a peace officer or other person in authority before that person
has had a reasonable opportunity to comply with those requirements.

 

    (4) A young person may waive his rights under
paragraph (2)(c) or (d) but any such
waiver shall be made in writing and shall contain a statement signed by the
young person that he has been apprised of the right that he is waiving.

 

    (5)
A youth court judge may rule inadmissible in any proceedings under this Act a
statement given by the young person in respect of whom the proceedings are
taken if the young person satisfies the judge that the statement was given
under duress imposed by any person who is not, in law, a person in authority.

 

    By
its enactment of s. 56, Parliament has recognized the problems and
difficulties that beset young people when confronted with authority.  It may
seem unnecessary and frustrating to the police and society that a worldly wise,
smug 17‑year‑old with apparent anti‑social tendencies should receive
the benefit of this section.  Yet it must be remembered that the section is to
protect all young people of 17 years or less.  A young person is
usually far more easily impressed and influenced by authoritarian
figures.  No matter what the bravado and braggadocio that young people may
display, it is unlikely that they will appreciate their legal rights in a
general sense or the consequences of oral statements made to persons in
authority; certainly they would not appreciate the nature of their rights to
the same extent as would most adults.  Teenagers may also be more susceptible
to subtle threats arising from their surroundings and the presence of persons
in authority.  A young person may be more inclined to make a statement, even
though it is false, in order to please an authoritarian figure.  It was no
doubt in recognition of the additional pressures and problems faced by young
people that led Parliament to enact this code of procedure.

 

    It
is also not without significance that prior to the passage of the Young
Offenders Act courts had recognized that the confessions of young
people should not be treated in the same manner as those of adults.  For
example, in Re A, [1975] 5 W.W.R. 425, the Alberta
Supreme Court suggested a number of safeguards before an admission of a young
person would be deemed to be admissible, including the requirement that an
adult relative accompany a young person to the place of interrogation and that
a caution be given in words that the young person would understand.  The courts
have thus extended certain protections to young persons when dealing with the
police and the Act has simply expanded upon and codified that practice.

 

The
Application of s. 56

 

    Section
56 itself exists to protect all young people, particularly the shy and the
frightened, the nervous and the naive.  Yet justice demands that the law be
applied uniformly in all cases.  The requirements of s. 56 must be
complied with whether the authorities are dealing with the nervous and naive or
the street‑smart and worldly‑wise.  The statutory pre‑conditions
for the admission of a statement made by a young person cannot be bent or
relaxed because the authorities are convinced, on the basis of what they
believe to be cogent evidence, of the guilt of the suspect.  As soon as the
requirements are relaxed because of a belief in the almost certain guilt of a
young person, they will next be relaxed in the case of those whom the
authorities believe are probably guilty, and thereafter in the case of a
suspect who might possibly be guilty but whose past conduct, in the opinion of
those in authority, is such that he or she should be found guilty of something
for the general protection of society.  Principles of fairness require that the
section be applied uniformly to all without regard to the characteristics of
the particular young person.

 

    It
is just and appropriate that young people be provided with additional
safeguards before their statements should be admitted.  Section 56(2) to (6)
inclusive specify the additional protection which must be provided to all young
people under the age of eighteen.

 

The
Application of s. 56(2)

 

    When
considering the application of s. 56(2), it must be remembered that it
begins with the admonition that no statement given by a young person to
a person in authority is admissible unless the subsequent requirements
enunciated are complied with.  A brief review of those requirements shows that
they are eminently fair and reasonable.

 

    Section
56(2)(a) states that the statement must be voluntary.

 

    Section
56(2)(b) requires the person to whom the statement is given to
clearly explain to the young person in language appropriate to his or her age
and understanding that (i) there is no obligation to give a statement; (ii) the
statement may be used as evidence in proceedings against the young person;
(iii) he or she has the right to consult an adult person; and (iv) that any
statement made by the young person is required to be made in the presence of
the person consulted unless the young person desires otherwise.

 

    Section
56(2)(c) provides that before the statement is made the young
person must be given a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel or a
parent or, in the absence of a parent, an adult relative or any other
appropriate adult chosen by the young person.

 

    Section
56(2)(d) provides that where the young person consults any
person pursuant to para. (c), the young person must have been given a reasonable
opportunity to make the statement in the presence of that person.

 

    Have
these requirements been met in this case?  There can be no doubt that in this
case the statement was voluntary and thus s. 56(2)(a) was
complied with.  Yet, I cannot accept that all of the requirements of
s. 56(2)(b) were met.  Of course there is no question that J.T.J.
was told that he was under no obligation to give a statement and, further, that
any statement given by him might be used as evidence.  Although the police
omitted to add the words ""in proceedings against you"", nothing can
turn on that omission.  Thus s. 56(2)(b)(i) and
(ii) were fulfilled.  However, in my view neither s. 56(2)(b)(iii)
nor (iv) were complied with in regard to any of the statements which were made
by J.T.J.  That is to say, J.T.J. was not told that before a statement was made
he had the right to consult counsel or an adult relative.  Further, neither
counsel nor an adult person was present when he made any of his statements.

 

    J.T.J.
made three inculpatory statements while he was in the custody of the police.
The first was made at 11:05 p.m., the second at 1:55 a.m. and the third
statement, comprised of words and gestures made at the scene of the crime, at
3:45 a.m.  It was argued on behalf of the Crown that the first statement made
at 11:05 p.m. was spontaneous and therefore came within the purview of
s. 56(3).  I cannot accept that contention.  The facts are such that it
could not be said that J.T.J. was anything other than a suspect in the eyes of
the police at the time the statement was made.  He had been held in custody by
the police primarily in the same interview room for four hours.  During
this time, he had been questioned at length by the police.  Thereafter he was
left alone for a short time.  The police then returned and confronted him with
the allegation that he had been lying.  It was only at this point that J.T.J.
made the inculpatory first statement.

 

    By
this time J.T.J. was obviously a suspect, if not the prime suspect.  Nor, in
light of the continued questioning by the police, could his statement have been
considered to be spontaneous.  If the police had wished to obtain a
statement from J.T.J. at 11:05 p.m. when they re‑entered the interview
room, then they should have complied with the provisions of s. 56(2),
particularly since they were admittedly familiar with its requirements. 
The first statement must be deemed inadmissible.

 

    Even
stronger reasons support the conclusion that the statement made at 1:55 a.m.
was inadmissible.  The police had advised counsel, who had earlier attended and
given advice to J.T.J., that they were going to continue the interrogation.  If
such was their intention, then they were duty bound to again comply with the
requirements of s. 56.  On every occasion when he had been asked whether
he wished to have an adult in attendance or to obtain the services of a lawyer,
J.T.J. had replied affirmatively.  This therefore gives a strong indication
that he would, if properly advised, have availed himself of the opportunity to
have a lawyer or adult present during this next session of questioning.

 

    There
can be no question that if the police wished by their continued questioning to
obtain a statement from J.T.J., then he should have been advised once again of
his right to have either his cousin or lawyer present.  A mistake was made. 
The police were aware of the requirements of s. 56 yet saw fit to ignore
them.  No matter how worldly wise J.T.J. may have been, by the time of his
second statement he must have been a tired 17‑year‑old after
spending nearly seven hours in police custody.  He was entitled to be advised
of his rights.  Both he and his lawyer were entitled to expect that the
police would comply with the provisions of s. 56.

 

    The
Crown argues that the fact that J.T.J. refused to give a written statement
demonstrates that he was aware of his rights and either waived them or did not
wish to exercise them.  This submission cannot be accepted.  The evidence that
J.T.J. refused to give a written statement can be used just as effectively as
an indication that he was not fully aware of his rights and that he believed an
oral statement was not of the same significance as a written statement.

 

    It
was also argued that there was substantial compliance with s. 56(2) so as
to make the statements of J.T.J. admissible.  I cannot accept that contention. 
Two of the most important requirements were not met.  To repeat, J.T.J. was not
advised of his right to counsel, nor of his right to have counsel or an adult
present when he made his statements.  In these circumstances, there cannot
be said to have been substantial compliance with s. 56(2).

 

    Lastly,
the statement made up of gestures and verbal responses made at 3:45 in the
morning must be held to be inadmissible.  By now the accused had spent almost
nine hours in custody.  Once again the verbal responses must be held to be
inadmissible as there was no compliance with s. 56(2).  Nor can I in some
way separate the gestures from the verbal statement.  The gestures and verbal
responses are all an integral part of the final statement given in response to
continued police questioning.  The Crown readily conceded that if the statement
made at 1:55 a.m. was deemed to be inadmissible, then this later statement must
as well be deemed inadmissible, including both the oral responses and the gestures. 
The Crown was correct to make such a concession.

 

    In
the result, all three of the statements made by J.T.J. to the police are
inadmissible.

 

Section
213 (a) of the Criminal
Code 

 

    It
was also argued that s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  contravened the provisions of s. 7  of the Charter .  For
the reasons given by Lamer J. in R. v. Martineau, I
agree that s. 213 (a) must be held to be unconstitutional. 

 

Disposition

 

    In
the result, I would dismiss the appeal, allow the cross‑appeal and direct
a new trial of J.T.J. on the charge of manslaughter.  It was argued that if the
statements were held to be inadmissible, an acquittal should be entered.  I
cannot accept that submission.  There is, in my view, evidence upon which a
jury properly instructed could properly convict J.T.J. on the charge of
manslaughter.

 

    The
answers to the constitutional questions are:

 

1.Does
s. 213(a) of the Criminal Code  (now
s. 230 (a) of the Criminal Code ,
R.S.C., 1985) contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or
11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A. Yes

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  (now s. 230 (a) of the Criminal
Code , R.S.C., 1985) justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    A.
No.

J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    L'HEUREUX‑DUBÉ J.
(dissenting) -- Ruby Adriaenssens was killed at the age of three.  Her body was
found abandoned in a garage, nude from the waist down.  She was dressed in a
red and white T‑shirt.  Light blue panties lay at her feet.  Her rectum
had been bruised and torn.  The injuries to the anal area were consistent with
those sustained in a sexual attack.  Blood was observed on the left side of her
head as well as around the right ear.  The death resulted from massive
fractures on both sides of the skull and a broken neck, consistent with her
head's having been squashed against the ground with a heavy object.  

 

    J.T.J.
was originally invited to the local police station by the police as a witness. 
However, his testimony soon provided details that could only be known by the
perpetrator of the crime, such as, ""Yeah.  Like I said he came back and
said he saw this little girl on the stairs.  He took her to a garage and
she was crying for her grandmother.""   Then at one point he blurted out, 
""Yeah.  I grabbed her.  I took her to a garage down the lane.  I can't
remember that well.  I blacked out.""  

 

    The
police immediately ceased their questioning, located J.T.J.'s closest adult
relative in Winnipeg, H.J., and brought him to the police station.  They
further informed the accused of his right to retain and instruct counsel.  He
did so.  His lawyer, Brenda Keyser, arrived at the building and met with the
accused for 37 minutes.  Thereafter she consulted with H.J. before
departing.  H.J. remained in the building.

 

    The
police continued to question the accused and asked him whether he would like to
make a written statement concerning the events of the night in question.  The
accused responded:  ""No. She told me not to.""  The police then
divulged some of the evidence which they had obtained and asked him additional
questions.  The accused replied willingly, disclosing how he had seized
the child from the steps of an apartment building and took her down a lane and
into a garage.  There, he sexually assaulted the child who was screaming and
crying for her grandmother.  The accused then revealed that, as he feared
someone was approaching, he bludgeoned the child with a brick in order to
silence her.

 

    J.T.J.
was then taken from the police station to a detention facility for young offenders. 
On route, the police stopped in front of the apartment building where the child
had resided.  When asked from what door he exited with the little girl, the
accused indicated and replied, ""That one"".  He then showed the police
the course he had taken with the child to the garage where the killing took
place.  Once there he identified for the police the concrete block that he had
used to silence the child.

 

    J.T.J.
was charged with first degree murder, and although 17 years old, the case was
transferred to adult court pursuant to s. 16(2) of the Young
Offenders Act, S.C. 1980‑81‑82‑83,
c. 110.  He was convicted before judge and jury for first degree murder. 
On appeal his conviction was overturned and a new trial ordered.  The Court of
Appeal held that those statements made while J.T.J. was still regarded as a
witness should have been excluded.  The Court of Appeal also held, however,
that the statements and gestures communicated while J.T.J. was a suspect,
excluded by the trial judge, ought to have been admitted.

 

    The
second trial was also held before a judge and jury, and similarly resulted in a
conviction for first degree murder.  The Court of Appeal, however, reversed its
original assessment, and held that only the gestures, and not the statements,
can be admitted under the Young Offenders Act.  It therefore
reversed the judgment of the lower court, and substituted a conviction for
manslaughter.

 

    The
present appeal is taken from this second decision of the Manitoba Court of
Appeal, and it raises two distinct issues; the constitutionality of
s. 213(a) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, as well as the exclusionary rules
prescribed by s. 56 of the Young Offenders Act.  I
have had the advantage of the opinion of Justice Cory, and with respect I
cannot agree with his disposition of either issue.  For the reasons stated in R. v.
Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, heard and released concurrently,
I am of the view that s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  does not violate ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  In that
case I found that an objective foreseeability test of death was
constitutionally valid for the crime of murder, and I distinguished this
Court's decision in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636.

 

    Hence,
the focus of the present appeal is the applicability of s. 56 of the Young
Offenders Act.  The provision reads as follows:

 

    56. (1)  Subject to this section, the
law relating to the admissibility of statements made by persons accused of
committing offences applies in respect of young persons.

 

    (2) No oral or written statement given by a young
person to a peace officer or other person who is, in law, a person in authority
is admissible against the young person unless

 

(a) the statement was voluntary;

 

(b) the person to whom the statement was given has, before
the statement was made, clearly explained to the young person, in language
appropriate to his age and understanding, that

 

(i) the young person is under no obligation to give a
statement,

 

(ii) any statement given by him may be used as evidence
in proceedings against him,

 

(iii) the young person has the right to consult another
person in accordance with paragraph (c), and

 

(iv) any statement made by the young person is required
to be made in the presence of the person consulted, unless the young person
desires otherwise;

 

(c) the young person has, before the statement was made,
been given a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent, or in
the absence of a parent, an adult relative, or in the absence of a parent and
an adult relative, any other appropriate adult chosen by the young person, and

 

(d) where the young person consults any person pursuant to
paragraph (c), the young person has been given a reasonable
opportunity to make the statement in the presence of that person.

 

    (3) The requirements set out in paragraphs (2)(b), (c) and (d) do not
apply in respect of oral statements where they are made spontaneously by the
young person to a peace officer or other person in authority before that person
has had a reasonable opportunity to comply with those requirements.

 

    (4) A young person may waive his rights under
paragraph (2)(c) or (d) but any such
waiver shall be made in writing and shall contain a statement signed by the
young person that he has been apprised of the right that he is waiving.

 

    (5)
A youth court judge may rule inadmissible in any proceedings under this Act
statement given by the young person in respect of whom the proceedings are
taken if the young person satisfies the judge that the statement was given
under duress imposed by any person who is not, in law, a person in authority.

 

    It
is incontrovertible that were it not for J.T.J.'s age, all the evidence at
issue would have been admissible.  That is not to say that adults are not
afforded substantial procedural protection through basic principles of
fundamental justice entrenched in the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .  They are.  However, all of these safeguards were
strictly complied with in the present case.

 

    As
soon as J.T.J. began to make a statement that was somewhat inculpatory, the
police stopped him from proceeding further.  The interviewing officer
immediately told him, ""Hold on a minute.  I'll get your uncle.  Do you
want your uncle here?""  Clearly, J.T.J. was being made aware of his right
to consult an adult.  He chose to exercise that right.  The police summoned
H.J., the accused's closest adult relative in Winnipeg, his employer, and the
person in whose house the accused resided.  When the group reassembled, with
H.J. present, the accused was arrested, charged with first degree murder, and
advised of his right to retain and instruct counsel.  He was told that he was
not bound to say anything but that anything he did say would be taken down in
writing and might be used against him.  The accused explicitly acknowledged
that he understood these warnings, and he exercised his right to retain and
instruct counsel.  No further questioning took place until his lawyer arrived. 
The accused met with his lawyer for 37 minutes.  The lawyer also consulted
with H.J. before departing.

 

    This
procedure satisfies all the normal precautions mandated in order to preserve an
arrested person's rights.  However, when the arrested person is under 18
years of age, the Young Offenders Act applies as well. 
In this appeal two specific issues arise under the Act:  Were the procedural
requirements prescribed by the provision complied with by the interrogating
police officers, and are acts and gestures contemplated within the Act's
definition of ""oral or written statements""?  

 

    With
respect to the second aspect, two of the three Manitoba Court of Appeal judges
distinguished between the oral statements made at the police station and
gestures at the scene of the crime, ruling that the Young Offenders Act did not
affect the admissibility of the latter.  However, the appellant Crown concedes
that the gestures made by J.T.J. to police officers should not be excluded from
the protection of s. 56 on the ground that they were neither written nor
verbal statements.  Rather, it is argued that these actions ought to be
admitted, yet for the same reasons as the oral statements at the police
station.  Hence, it is not necessary to disturb this conclusion of the Manitoba
Court of Appeal, and the matter can be decided on the basis that all the
communications, oral statements as well as gestures, are to be considered
together.

 

    The
importance of the dispositions of the Young Offenders Act cannot
be overemphasized.  Police must be particularly vigilant to observe the rights
of suspected young offenders, recognizing their tender years and susceptibility
to influence.  Furthermore, young persons are characteristically more prone to
intimidation when facing police interrogators.  Their restraint and
abilities to preserve and act in their own best interest are somewhat
attenuated.  It is the responsibility of the police and other authority figures
to appreciate this discrepancy, and conduct themselves accordingly.  

 

    The Young
Offenders Act serves a dual role in this regard.  It establishes
critical guidelines and principles that direct police behaviour and gives
practical meaning to youth protection from potential transgressions in the
evidence gathering process.  The Act also formulates its own exclusionary
rules - clearly delineating what standards must be complied with in addition to
the existing constitutional controls.  These directives acknowledge that
young persons are not adults; their naivety and relative lack of experience
mandate that their rights be preserved with an extra measure of protection.

 

    However,
young offenders suspected of a criminal offence should also be treated in a
manner befitting their ages.  The Young Offenders Act makes
it clear that young persons should bear responsibility for their
contraventions.  The term ""young persons"" cannot be interpreted
in static isolation.  Adolescence cannot be viewed as a snapshot in time. 
Those youths between the ages of 12 and 18 cannot be aggregated and dealt with
uniformly without regard for the discrepancies in their faculties and
competence.

 

    The
spirit of the Act is intended to reflect the evolution of the maturation
process.  The Act establishes a spectral scheme ensuring that the
treatment of these young persons is commensurate with their abilities and
understanding.  The objectives and purposes of the Act were identified by then
Solicitor General Robert Kaplan as follows:

 

    They
must strike a balance between helping young offenders and protecting society
from harmful conduct.  They must safeguard the rights of young people in
conflict with the law, while discouraging offenders from committing further
crimes.

 

House of Commons Debates, May 12, 1981, at p. 9517.


 

    This
balancing process is fluid -- and as Mr. Wenman said during Parliamentary
debate:

 

Before this act is passed, the offenders are those
between 7 and 18 years of age.  After we pass this act, we are talking only
about a small part of that child‑adult grouping, and I refer
specifically now to 12 to 17‑year‑olds.  That is narrowing it
to a very particular group called adolescents.  We are now talking about
adolescent offenders.

 

    Who
and where are these adolescent offenders?  We can even narrow it a little more
than that.  Statistics show that the offenders to whom we refer specifically
within that 12 to 17‑year‑old grouping are 14 and 15 years old. 
Fifty‑six per cent of juvenile or adolescent crime is committed by 14 and
15‑year‑olds specifically.  [Emphasis added.]

 

House of Commons Debates, May 12, 1981, at p. 9517.

 

    Within
this ""child‑adult grouping"" there are those that are more
""child"" and those that are more ""adult"".  We should be
especially sensitive to 12‑ and 13‑year‑olds at the younger
end of the spectrum.  Their youth borders on that age considered too young to
be included within the scope of the Act entirely.  Conversely, 17‑year‑olds
are on the brink of adulthood, months away from attaining their full measure of
protection under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , but no
more.

 

    Hence
the need to consider certain relevant ""indicia of adulthood"",
especially when dealing with an offender approaching the end of his or her term
of protection under the Act.  Such an interpretation is consistent with a
liberal construction of the Act.  While a graduated scale may result in a
perceived curtailment of an older offender's rights, it also serves to increase
the protection extended to those who are in reality children.  While I agree
with my colleague's proposition at p. 000, that ""Principles of fairness
require that the section [s. 56] be applied uniformly"", the totality
of circumstances of the particular case must be taken into account when
measuring compliance with the Young Offenders Act.

 

    In The Young
Offenders Act:  Highlights (1981), the Solicitor General's Office detailed the
approach, now legislated within the Declaration of Principle of s. 3, that
the new Act was to take towards young offenders, at p. 4:

 

The philosophy of the new Act is expressed in a policy
section.  This section will serve as a guide to the Act's spirit and intent for
everyone concerned with its administration throughout Canada.  

 

The Act's approach blends three principles:  that young
people should be held more responsible for their behaviour but not wholly
accountable since they are not yet fully mature; that society has a right to
protection; that young people have the same rights to due process of law and
fair and equal treatment as adults, and these rights must be guaranteed by
special safeguards.  Thus the Act is intended to strike a reasonable and
acceptable balance between the needs of youthful individuals and the needs of
society.

 

In particular, the policy section states:

 

                                                                        .
. .

 

nYoung
offenders have special needs because they are dependents at varying levels of
development and maturity.  They therefore also require guidance and assistance. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    These
varying levels of development and maturity infuse the Act with a spirit of
flexibility and accommodation.  Young offenders have the same rights as
adults.  The Act ensures that the safeguards necessary to protect those
rights are not diluted.  The underlying principle is one of graduated
application depending on the particular needs of the young offender, and the parens
patriae duty of the state.

 

    Mr.
Hawkes commented on this statement of principle:

 

Which 17‑year‑old
youngsters require supervision, all those who break the law?  What positive
consequence is inherent in the concept of supervision?  What do we mean by
that?  In societal terms it means parole officers.  Historically, that has
been our method of supervision.  Has it worked?  I suggest the scientific
evidence would indicate that supervision is not necessarily the answer for all
these young offenders.  Do they all need discipline and control?  Are they
all in a state of dependence?

 

    House
of Commons Debates, May 12, 1981, at p. 9516.

 

    Originally,
the Bill proposed that the maximum age of 18 years could be lowered to 16 years
if any province so requested.  However, this latter component was removed due
to potential violations of s. 15  of the Charter , as provinces
would have varying ages of application.  See House of Commons Debates, May 15,
1981, at p. 9647, and May 29, 1981, at p. 10073.

 

    This
interpretation of the Young Offenders Act is also consistent
with the approach adopted in the United States.  The general rule that a
criminal suspect must be specifically warned of his Fifth Amendment rights to
silence and to counsel under the United States Constitution before
interrogation was established in Miranda v. Arizona, 384
U.S. 436 (1966).  These rights were extended to juveniles in In re
Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967).  Any waiver of these rights
would be invalid unless it was made ""voluntarily, knowingly, and
intelligently"".

 

    The
interpretation of that federal constitutional standard was clarified in Fare v. Michael
C., 442 U.S. 707 (1979), at pp. 724‑25 requiring a
consideration of the ""totality of circumstances"" in determining
whether rights were in fact waived ""voluntarily, knowingly, and
intelligently"":

 

We noted in North Carolina v. Butler, 441
U.S., at 373, that the question whether the accused waived his rights ""is
not one of form, but rather whether the defendant in fact knowingly and
voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the Miranda
case.""  Thus, the determination whether statements obtained during
custodial interrogation are admissible against the accused is to be made upon
an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding the
interrogation, to ascertain whether the accused in fact knowingly and
voluntarily decided to forgo his rights to remain silent and to have the
assistance of counsel.

 

                                                                        .
. . 

 

The
totality approach permits -- indeed, it mandates -- inquiry into all the
circumstances surrounding the interrogation.  This includes evaluation of the
juvenile's age, experience, education, background, and intelligence, and into
whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of
his Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights.

 

    In
the particular circumstances of that case, the United States Supreme Court
dealt with a murder conviction of a 16-year‑old juvenile, overturned by
the California Supreme Court which excluded the juvenile's confession.  The
United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, finding, at p. 726, that:

 

The
transcript of the interrogation reveals that the police officers conducting the
interrogation took care to ensure that respondent understood his rights. 
They fully explained to respondent that he was being questioned in connection
with a murder.  They then informed him of all the rights delineated in Miranda, and
ascertained that respondent understood those rights.  There is no
indication in the record that respondent failed to understand what the officers
told him.

 

    In
my view, the same holds true in the present case.  Moreover, the statements at
issue here were made following an audience with both an adult relative and
counsel.  Most states have incorporated the Fare v. Michael C. federal
constitutional ""totality of circumstances"" standard into their
""young offender"" statutes.  However, some have promulgated
legislation which prefers a per se approach whereby waivers are excluded
unless an adult was present to advise the juvenile prior to interrogation.  In State in
the Interest of Dino, 359 So.2d 586, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1047
(1978), the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that:

 

. . . in
order for the State to meet its heavy burden of demonstrating that a waiver is
made knowingly and intelligently, it must affirmatively show that the juvenile
engaged in a meaningful consultation with an attorney or an informed parent,
guardian, or other adult interested in his welfare before he waived his right
to counsel and privilege against self‑incrimination.

 

    Grisso,
""Juveniles' Capacities to Waive Miranda Rights:
An Empirical Analysis"" (1980), 68 Cal. L. Rev. 1134,
discusses both the ""totality"" and the ""per se""
approaches at pp. 1141‑42:

 

    Under the per se approach, the courts retain limited
discretion in determining whether the applicable per se requirements have been
satisfied.  Foremost among the criteria they must consider is whether the adult
was ""interested"" - genuinely concerned with the juvenile's welfare. 
They must also determine whether the adult was informed of the juvenile's
rights, whether the adult understood those rights, whether the child and the
adult had an adequate opportunity to confer in private, and whether the
conference was meaningful.

 

    The
per se approach has been criticized by some commentators for not going far
enough to safeguard the rights of juveniles, while others have claimed that, by
interfering with police activities, it goes too far.  On the one hand,
commentators have argued that requiring the presence of a parent at waiver
proceedings is not sufficient; his competing interests, emotional reactions to
his child's arrest, or intellectual incapacities may interfere with his ability
to provide the counsel and support needed by the child.  This criticism has
contributed to an emerging trend of statutory per se exclusion of confessions
made by juveniles without prior assistance of legal counsel.

 

    Grisso
also acknowledges that the per se approach has been frequently attacked
for unnecessarily restricting the prosecution of sophisticated juvenile offenders. 
This position is consistent with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Fare, where
it placed upon per se advocates the burden of proving that
the great majority of young offenders do not understand and appreciate the
rights they are being asked to waive.

 

    The
totality of circumstances approach has also recently been adopted by this Court
in R. v. Debot, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, at p. 1168, and endorsed by
Chief Justice Dickson, dissenting, in R. v. Greffe, [1990]
1 S.C.R. 755.  Both these cases dealt with the exclusion of evidence procured
during drug searches, and whether such exclusion would bring the administration
of justice into disrepute.  By analogy, the instant case deals with whether
compliance with the Young Offenders Act requires the
exclusion of those statements made by J.T.J. to the police.  In my view, the
integrity of the Act can only be preserved by admitting the evidence at issue.

 

    In
crimes involving young offenders, the fear is that the ""totality of
circumstances"" approach does not provide a minimum of consultation with
either an adult or counsel, and that even under the per se
approach, consultation with an adult may not be sufficient.  J.T.J. had both. 
Therefore, even under the most stringent of per se
standards, the accused in the present case was extended every procedural
protection.  Furthermore, the Crown is not arguing that the accused waived any
of his rights.  These rights were retained and exercised by J.T.J.
throughout.  Rather, the focus of attention revolves around his conduct after
he had invoked both his constitutional and statutory rights, and whether he was
in fact acting ""voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently"".

 

    J.T.J.
was 17 years old at the time of the offence.  Prior to that, he had lived in a
common law relationship for about 10 months.  That union produced a
child.  While he no longer resides with the mother, he had made sporadic
support payments.  J.T.J. was working as a roofer for his cousin H.J., who
was present at the police station and provided guidance and support.  When the
police advised him of his right to counsel, J.T.J. produced a solicitor's
business card from his pocket.  He subsequently consulted with his solicitor
for 37 minutes.  The solicitor either acknowledged the police's statement
that they would have to speak to J.T.J. some more, or told the police that her
client would not be making a statement.

 

    These
facts reveal that the accused was relatively advanced and well apprised of his
predicament.  His level of maturity would have alerted him to the dangers of
answering certain questions after he had received explicit warnings from both
the police as well as his solicitor.  These indicia of adulthood do not excuse
non-compliance with the Act.  Rather, they define with sharper resolution what
measures are necessary in order to extend the prescribed safeguards to this
particular young person, taking into account his age and level of
sophistication.

 

    In R. v. G. (1985),
20 C.C.C. (3d) 289, the British Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously
overturned the trial judge's decision to exclude evidence on the basis that
s. 56 of the Young Offenders Act had not been
complied with.  In that case, the accused actually had signed a waiver of his
rights, and his capacity to make that decision was at issue.  The Court of
Appeal pointed out that ""the trial judge found that the juvenile with whom
we are concerned was both mature and streetwise"", and that these factors
must be considered when applying the Act.

 

    If
one dissects the requirements prescribed by s. 56(2), it becomes clear
that there was indeed purposeful compliance in the present appeal:

 

(1)the statement must be voluntary [s. 56(2)(a)] --
all statements made by J.T.J. to the police were voluntary;

 

(2)the police must explain to the young person that he
is under no obligation to give a statement [s. 56(2)(b)(i)] --
that was done;

 

(3)the police must explain that any statement can be
used against the youth in proceedings against him [s. 56(2)(b)(ii)]  
-- that was also done;

 

(4)the police must further explain that he has a right
to consult with a lawyer or a parent, or in the absence of a parent, an adult
relative [s. 56(2)(b)(iii)] ‑‑ that was done as well;

 

(5)the police must also explain that any statement by
the young person is required to be made in the presence of the person
consulted, unless the young person desires otherwise [s. 56(2)(b)(iv)]
-- this is the focus of the dispute.

 

    The
majority at the Manitoba Court of Appeal found that this last requirement was
not met in this case.  I disagree.  Taking into account the aforementioned
indicia of adulthood, and having regard to the introductory words of
s. 56(2), I believe that all of the requirements of the provision have
been complied with.  The police must tender their explanations to the young
person ""in language appropriate to his age and understanding"". 
It is against this background that ""unless the young person desires
otherwise"" must be assessed.

 

     I
would like to emphasize that this does not repose discretion in the
police as to the degree of protection individual young offenders are entitled
to under the legislation.  It is not the province of the police to interpret
the Act.  Rather, if police conduct is subsequently challenged, the trier of
fact should determine whether, having regard to all the circumstances, the
rights owed to the young offender were properly complied with.

 

    As
Platt has written in Young Offenders Law in Canada (1989),
at pp. 15‑13 and 15‑14:

 

Since the test in s. 56(2)(b) is
subjective, the ""person in authority"" ought to find out what the
young person's background is regarding age, schooling and language skills.

 

                                                                        .
. .

 

...
rights and warnings must be explained in a way that is meaningful to the young
person before the court.  Each case must be looked at individually to
determine whether, upon a regard to the age and background of the young person,
s. 56(2)(b) was complied with. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    J.T.J.
was given every procedural protection up to the remarks at issue.  He was
offered both his right to have an adult present as well as his right to
counsel.  He exercised both these rights.  He had conferred with both his adult
relative and his lawyer.  He was told not to make any statements; he even
conveyed that message to the police expressly.  Therefore, when on the heels of
these admonitions he proceeded to respond voluntarily to subsequent questions,
it becomes difficult to argue that this was contrary to his alleged wishes.

 

    Moreover,
the fact that his solicitor counselled him not to sign any written statements
does not detract from the above proposition.  She could have very well been
ensuring that her client not waive his rights under s. 56(4).  These
waivers must be in writing.  They must also contain a statement signed by the
young person that he has been apprised of the right that he is waiving.  To
read these explicit requirements into s. 56(2)(b)(iv)
would render s. 56(4) a redundant provision.  J.T.J. was explicitly asked
whether he was willing to sign a waiver.  He declined.  Consequently his rights
were retained.  They were also observed.

 

    While
the accused did not specifically declare that,  ""Notwithstanding my right
to make any statements in the presence of my relative or my lawyer, I proclaim
my choice to proceed in their absence,"" such a declaration is not
required, and certainly not for an offender with J.T.J.' level of maturity. 
Given all of the preceding events, and the continued presence of H.J. at the
police station, the accused's willingness to respond can certainly be
considered ""constructive desire"".

 

    Huband
J.A., who wrote for the majority at the Manitoba Court of Appeal, originally
adopted this approach following J.T.J.'s first visit to the Manitoba Court of
Appeal (1987), 44 Man. R. (2d) 265, at p. 271:

 

    Under
s. 56(2)(b)(iv) any statement made by the young person is required
to be made in the presence of legal counsel, with whom the accused has
consulted, unless the young person desires otherwise.  In this case legal
counsel attended upon the accused.  Thereafter the accused refused to give a
written statement, but proceeded to answer police questions.  The accused
had full opportunity to make a statement in the presence of his legal counsel,
but obviously chose not to do so when she was present at the Public Safety
Building.  By volunteering information after she had left, I think it is clear
that, by his own choice, he responded to the questions without his lawyer being
present.  We know nothing of what took place in the interview between the
accused and legal counsel, but one might reasonably infer that the accused was
advised of his rights, including the right to maintain his silence, or
alternatively, if he were to give a statement, to make that statement in the
presence of his legal counsel.  Legal counsel was present at the Public Safety
Building, and if the accused had wished to make a statement in the presence of
his counsel it could have been done then.  He was afforded the right to make a
statement in the presence of counsel and chose not to do so.  He volunteered a
statement after his counsel had departed.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Bala,
""The Young Offenders Act: A Legal Framework"", in Hudson, Hornick and
Burrows, eds., Justice and the Young Offenders in Canada, wrote,
at p. 17:

 

    Section
56 is based on the recognition that young persons may lack the sophistication
and maturity to fully appreciate the legal consequences of making a statement,
and so require special protection when being questioned by police.  It is also
premised on the notion that some youths are easily intimidated by adult
authority figures, and may make statements that they believe those authority
figures expect to hear, even if the statements are false.  It is hoped that
consultation with a parent or lawyer will preclude the making of such false
statements.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Such
consultation was provided for.  The guidance and direction furnished by his
relative and his solicitor allowed the accused to make an informed decision. 
The ultimate choice was his own.

 

    In
the present appeal (1988), 50 Man. R. (2d) 300, Huband J.A. summarized his
earlier position at p. 307, yet felt compelled to reverse himself:

 

    After
having had the benefit of a meeting with his lawyer, the accused volunteered
answers to questions posed by the police.  It might be argued that having been
apprised of his rights, the accused obviously desired to make his statement by
way of answers to police questions without the benefit of the presence of legal
counsel.  That was my earlier impression.  But in the end that argument cannot
be sustained.  Under s. 56(2)(b) an explanation must be given to the young
person that his legal counsel is required to be present unless the accused
makes a conscious choice to proceed with the statement in the absence of his
counsel.

 

    Having
regard to the totality of circumstances it must have been clear to J.T.J. that
he could decline to comment in the absence of his lawyer just as he refused to
sign the written waiver.  His pattern of behaviour reflects a deliberate and
considered decision making process such that it cannot be argued that his was
not ""a conscious choice to proceed with the statement in the absence of
his counsel"".

 

    Huband
J.A. also raised s. 56(2)(d) relating to the
""reasonable opportunity to make the statement in the presence"" of his
lawyer and felt that was not complied with as ""the accused formed no
intention to make a statement during the time that his lawyer was
present"".  Yet that is not the thrust of the provision.  The accused knew
of those facts when the lawyer was present and could have easily revealed them
at that time.  However, the accused was not so inclined.  We can only speculate
whether this was a manifestation of counsel's instructions.  Yet his
subsequent intention cannot defeat the admissibility of the statements simply
because he had chosen or was advised not to disclose them at an earlier time.

 

    Platt
also discussed s. 56(2)(c) (the right of
consultation), s. 56(2)(d) (the reasonable
opportunity to make the statement), and s. 56(4) (the waiver of these
rights).  She concluded at p. 15‑19 that:

 

Presumably,
where a consultation has occurred pursuant to s. 56(2)(c), and the young
person is given a ""reasonable opportunity"" to make the statement in
the presence of the person consulted but declines to do so, no waiver need be
signed.  This is because, on the strict wording of s. 56(2)(d), the right need
only be waived where the young person does not wish to be ""given a
reasonable opportunity to make the statement in the presence of that
person"".

 

    Essentially,
Platt interprets this series of provisions as substituting the waiver
requirement with a reasonable opportunity to make the statement in the presence
of the person consulted.  While I do not believe that the waiver right was
supplanted in this case, the factual situation does promote the impression that
J.T.J. was afforded the reasonable opportunity to pronounce himself in the
presence of his relative or counsel.  If these provisions were interpreted so
as to insist that all statements made by accused persons be in the presence of
a relative or counsel, then as Monnin C.J.M. stated at the Court of Appeal, at
p. 308:

 

No
statement could ever be obtained without giving the young person a reasonable
opportunity to make that statement in the presence of a lawyer or the person
consulted.  If that is the law, police interrogation, which is legitimate and
proper procedure in criminal investigations, has received a death blow, and
interrogation in the presence of defence counsel will be an exercise in
futility.

 

    Such
a stultification of the criminal justice system would be inconsistent with the
objectives and purposes of the Young Offenders Act, as
discussed above.  O'Sullivan J.A., who concurred with Huband J.A., assumes that
J.T.J.'s willingness to answer questions exposes ""his lack of
intelligence, education and spirit"" to understand ""and appreciate the
warnings of his counsel of his right to `keep his mouth shut'"".  I do not
share that conclusion.

 

    The
evidence reveals that J.T.J. had the faculties to make an educated decision. 
The Act is not violated if the young person chooses to respond.  It is only
infringed if that choice was neither informed nor motivated by proper guidance
and direction.  The purpose of the consultation right is to elevate the young
person's capacities from potential youthful indiscretion to the balance and
discipline more common in adults.  Any margin of deficiency in this case
was certainly compensated for by the deliberate instructions on the part of the
police and their successful efforts to secure proper supervision.  It cannot be
argued that despite all these precautions, the fact that the accused tendered
statements of his own volition necessarily demonstrates a shortcoming in the
conduct of the police.

 

    I
must underscore once again that this conclusion does not emanate from a finding
that the police properly exercised their discretion regarding compliance under
the Act.  The police are vested with no such discretion.  However, the
legislation itself provides a means by which we can assess whether any impugned
statements were made ""voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently"".

 

    As
Monnin C.J.M. indicated at p. 317:

 

    The
accused had 37 minutes with Mrs. Keyser [his lawyer].  I can only assume
that she properly informed him of his rights including the right to make a
statement in her presence and to be given a reasonable opportunity to make such
a statement if he so wished in her presence as well as the right to stand
mute.  What is the value of the right to counsel if courts must assume and
infer that counsel did not adequately and properly inform or advise a client? 
There is no evidence on the record from the two police officers that they
offered the accused an opportunity to have Mrs. Keyser present when they
resumed their interrogation since they had already specifically told her
earlier that the accused would be given an opportunity to reply to the charge
of murder.  Counsel when so informed could easily have requested to be present
for the re‑interrogation.

 

    It
is apparent from the record, reviewed as a whole, that the police extended
meticulous consideration for the accused's rights under the Charter  and the Young
Offenders Act.  J.T.J. was provided with the opportunity to choose
how to conduct himself and with the partisan advisors to ensure that his
perspective was both developed and informed.  That having been accomplished,
the resulting evidence cannot be excluded merely because it reflects
unfavourably upon the accused.

 

    Monnin
C.J.M. concluded, at p. 321, that:

 

The
factual situation is clear.  There was a killing and the author of it was the
accused.  Two jury panels reached that conclusion without difficulty.  In
addition to that we have the voluntary statement of the young person admitting
that he committed the crime.  To reach any other conclusion but that of
guilty of murder is to ignore the real facts of this case.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

I would
go further.  In the particular circumstances of this case, holding a third
complete trial after two successive convictions for first degree murder would,
in my view, not only ignore the law, i.e., the
spirit of the Young Offenders Act, but would also
generate palpable disrespect for the criminal justice system and cast serious
aspersions on the benefits and balances inherent in the Act.  Moreover,
according to counsel for the respondent, ordering a new trial while excluding
all of the statements and gestures would compel the trial judge to withdraw the
case from a jury and direct that a verdict of acquittal be entered.  Faced only
with the independent circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution, all
charges would have to be dismissed.

 

    The Young
Offenders Act ensures that the rights of young persons are upheld by
extending to them additional safeguards that must be adhered to.  The barometer
of adherence must be calibrated according to the particular youth, having
regard to all of the surrounding factors and circumstances.  Ordering a
third trial would, in my view, subvert the interests of the justice system and
the protection of our youths.  Respect for the Act can only be preserved
through logical application.  Uniform implementation in all cases would ignore
the vast range of individuals who fall within the ambit of protection, and thus
frustrate the objectives and purposes of the Act itself.  

 

    Furthermore,
there was compliance in the present case.  As soon as J.T.J. became a
suspect, his closest adult relative in Winnipeg was brought to the public
safety building.  J.T.J. was granted and exercised his right to retain and
instruct counsel.  Following consultation with both of these individuals,
J.T.J. made incriminating statements voluntarily, on the basis of which he was
convicted of first degree murder twice.  The procedural requirements dictated
by the Act were observed, and in my view ordering a third trial would severely
undermine rather than preserve the utility of the Young Offenders Act.  I
would allow the appeal, dismiss the cross‑appeal, and restore the
conviction and sentence imposed at trial.

    SOPINKA J. -- I
have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Justices L'Heureux‑Dubé
and Cory.  I would answer the constitutional questions in the same manner as
Cory J., for the reasons I gave in R. v. Martineau, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 000.  I agree, for the reasons given by Cory J., that the statements
made to the police by J.T.J. are inadmissible and that there must be a new
trial.  I would have been inclined to direct a new trial on the original charge
of murder.  I am satisfied that we have the power to do so in this case
pursuant to s. 695(1)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .  Nonetheless, I agree with Cory J. that, in
view of the way in which the case was presented, a new trial should be directed
on the charge of manslaughter.

    Appellant
was convicted, under s. 214(5)  of the Criminal Code , of the
first degree murder of a woman who was killed while he attempted to commit a
sexual assault.  The jury was charged on ss. 212  and 213  in relation to
murder.  The conviction was upheld on appeal.  The constitutional questions
before this Court queried:  (1) whether s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  contravened ss. 7  and/or 11(d) of the Charter ; and,
(2) if so, whether it was justified by s. 1 ; (3) whether s. 214(5)  of
the Criminal Code  contravened s. 7  of the Charter ; and
(4), if so, whether it was justified by s. 1 .  A further issue was whether
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) should be applied.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.  The first constitutional question should be
answered in the affirmative, and the second and third in the negative; the
fourth needed not be answered.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ.:  For the reasons stated
in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  is of no force or effect.

 

    Section 214(5) 
is neither arbitrary nor irrational and therefore does not infringe upon
s. 7  of the Charter .  It does not result in punishment
disproportionate to the seriousness of the offences giving rise to the
sentences.  Only those who have committed the most serious crime in the Code with
the highest level of moral culpability are affected by Parliament's decision in
s. 214(5)  to impose a more serious punishment on those found guilty of
murder while committing certain listed offences.  This Court affirmed, in R. v. Paré, that
s. 214  is a classification section concerned with sentencing and does
not create a substantive offence.  No principle of fundamental justice prevents
Parliament from classifying murders done while committing certain underlying
offences as more serious, and thereby attaching more serious penalties to
them.  This distinction is neither arbitrary nor irrational.  The
relationship between the classification and the moral blameworthiness of the
offender clearly exists.

 

    Section 613(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code  should be applied and the verdict of the jury that the
appellant was guilty of first degree murder should be upheld notwithstanding
the error of leaving s. 213  with the jury.  The jury's verdict of murder
under s. 212 (a) was inescapable in light of the description of the
attack and the nature of the victim's injuries.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé J.:  For the reasons stated in R. v. Martineau, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 000, the first constitutional question should be answered in the
negative.  The second, accordingly, needed not be answered.  The third should
be answered in the negative.  Section 214(5) does not offend s. 7  of
the Charter .  Before s. 214(5) can apply, the accused must
first have been found guilty of murder.  It thus does not deprive an accused of
""life, liberty or security of the person"" in a manner which is
inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice.  Many factors enter
into a determination of an appropriate sentence and the degree of
blameworthiness is but one.  When all these factors are consolidated, it is
certainly appropriate for Parliament to impose its most severe punishment.  The
question is one of policy, to be determined by Parliament and its choice must
be upheld so long as it does not act irrationally or arbitrarily or in a manner
otherwise inconsistent with the fundamental principles of justice.

 

    Per Sopinka
J.:  The appeal must be dismissed pursuant to s. 613(1)(b)(iii). 
The reasons given in R. v. Martineau were applicable to
the constitutional questions relating to s. 213 (a).  The
reasons of Lamer C.J. with respect to s. 214(5) were agreed with, except
to the extent that those reasons rely on the view that murder, and hence first
degree murder, constitutionally requires subjective foresight of death.

offends the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

Facts

 

    The
appellant was convicted of the first degree murder of Lisa Clark, who died of
skull injuries and whose body had been burned.  The Crown's theory was that the
victim's death was caused while the appellant attempted to commit a sexual
assault.  In support of this theory, the Crown led the evidence of a fellow
prisoner who testified that while in prison the appellant told him that he had
run down the victim with his car as she was attempting to escape from his
sexual advances and then stripped her body and burned it.  Another witness
testified that the appellant denied making any sexual advances or assault upon
the victim, stating that she had fallen accidentally while helping him push‑start
his car, after which, in a panic, he burned her body.  The trial judge told the
jury that in order to find the appellant guilty of first degree murder, they
must find that murder was committed while committing a sexual assault or
attempting to commit a sexual assault.  The trial judge charged the jury on
ss. 212 and 213 in relation to murder.  The jury returned a verdict of
guilty of first degree murder.

Judgment
below

 

Court of
Appeal for British Columbia (1988), 30 B.C.L.R. (2d) 179

 

    The
only ground of appeal before the Court was whether the provision in
s. 214(5)  of the Criminal Code  that murder
committed in the course of committing or attempting to commit a sexual assault
is first degree murder, violates the appellant's rights under ss. 7  and
11 (d) of the Charter .  The appellant
made two arguments in this respect: first, that the principles established in R. v.
Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, apply to s. 214(5) ,
rendering it invalid, and second, that the arbitrary nature of the distinction
between first and second degree murder in s. 214(5)  is inconsistent with
ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

    In
respect of the first argument, the Court considered the applicability of this
Court's decision in Vaillancourt.  The Court of
Appeal held that Vaillancourt is concerned with
the elements essential to the creation of an offence, not with sentencing after
an offence has been established.  It expressed this view, at pp. 187‑88,
in the following way:

 

    The appellant, if he is to succeed in bringing his
challenge to s. 214(5) within the ambit of Vaillancourt, supra,
must establish that the classification of first and second degree murder
creates an offence lacking the necessary element of mens rea.  This he cannot
do.  First, s. 214(5) does not create an offence.  The Supreme Court of
Canada has held that the effect of s. 214(5) is to classify offences that
have been found to be murder under other provisions of the Code:  R. v.
Paré, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 618. . . .  This
decision makes it clear that s. 214(5) is not a substantive provision
creating a new offence, but rather merely classifies for purposes of sentencing
offences that have already been found to be murder under the Criminal
Code . . . .

 

    Second, the classification effected by s. 214(5)
does not exclude mens rea.  Rather, mens rea is presupposed by the existence of
a valid conviction for murder under s. 212  or 213  of the Criminal Code ,
without which s. 214(5)  does not come into play.

 

    Since
s. 214 is not concerned with defining the elements of an offence and does
not exclude mens rea, Vaillancourt has no
application.

 

    As
regards the appellant's second argument, the Court of Appeal held that the
sentencing scheme set up by s. 214(5)  and s. 669  of the Criminal
Code  meets the requirements of fundamental justice.  The
Court noted that s. 214(5)  is calculated to deprive a person convicted of
first degree murder of liberty beyond that of a person convicted of second
degree murder.  The issue is whether this distinction is contrary to the
principles of fundamental justice.  The Court of Appeal accepted that in a fair
and just penal system there should be a general correlation between the
imposition of harsh penalties and the seriousness of the offence and that
distinctions in sentencing schemes should not be arbitrary or irrational.  By
the same token, however, the Court of Appeal stated that many factors other
than the accused's degree of moral blameworthiness must be considered.  General
deterrence, the degree of the perceived danger to the public and the prevalence
of certain types of offences are a few of the factors that Parliament must
consider in developing a sentencing scheme.  The Court held, therefore, that
the fact that a harsher sentence may be imposed for one offence than for another
offence which is arguably more blameworthy, does not mean that the scheme that
permits the sentence violates s. 7  of the Charter .

 

    In
addition, the Court of Appeal relied on this Court's decision in R. v. Paré, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 618, for the view that there is a rational justification for the
distinction between first and second degree murder drawn by s. 214(5) of
the Code.  The following passage from Paré, at
p. 633 was quoted by the Court of Appeal:

 

The
offences listed in s. 214(5)  are all offences involving the unlawful
domination of people by other people. Thus an organizing principle for
s. 214(5)  can be found.  This principle is that where a murder is
committed by someone already abusing his power by illegally dominating another,
the murder should be treated as an exceptionally serious crime.  Parliament has
chosen to treat these murders as murders in the first degree.

 

The
Court of Appeal concluded that it could not, therefore, be contended that the
distinction is arbitrary and irrational.  As a result, as long as Parliament's
policy choice was not arbitrary or irrational, it must be respected.  The
appeal was, accordingly, dismissed.

 

Issues

 

    The
following constitutional questions were stated by Chief Justice Dickson:

 

1.Does s. 213(a) of the Criminal
Code  (as it read in November 1984) contravene the rights and
freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If the answer to question 1 is affirmative, is
s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code  (as it
read in November 1984) justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

3.Does s. 214(5) of the Criminal Code  (as it
read in November 1984) contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by
s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

4.If the
answer to question 3 is affirmative, is s. 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code  (as it read in November 1984) justified by s. 1  of
the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

Analysis

 

    For
the reasons I have stated in R. v. Martineau, s. 213(a) of the Criminal
Code  is of no force or effect, and the first two
constitutional questions should, therefore, be answered accordingly.  The third
and fourth constitutional questions require an analysis of s. 214(5)  of
the Criminal Code .  The main argument of the appellant, as regards his
constitutional challenge of the section, is that it is arbitrary and irrational
and thereby offends s. 7  of the Charter .  In my
view, this submission is answered by this Court's judgment in Paré, supra.  In
that case a unanimous seven person panel affirmed that s. 214  is a
classification section concerned with sentencing and does not create a
substantive offence.  Wilson J., speaking for the Court, put it this way at
p. 625:

 

It is
clear from a reading of these provisions that s. 214 serves a different
function from ss. 212  and 213 .  Sections 212  and 213  create the
substantive offence of murder.  Section 214 is simply concerned with
classifying for sentencing purposes the offences created by ss. 212  and
213 .  It tells us whether the murder is first degree or second degree.  This
view of s. 214 was expressly adopted by this Court in R. v.
Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 124 (per Dickson
J. (as he then was) at p. 140) and in Droste v. The Queen, [1984]
1 S.C.R. 208 (per Dickson J. (as he then was) at p. 218).

 

Indeed,
the appellant concedes that s. 214(5)  is a sentencing classification
provision.

 

    The
argument of the appellant suggests that the sentencing scheme is flawed and in
violation of s. 7  of the Charter  because it results
in the punishment of individuals that is not proportionate to the seriousness
of the offences giving rise to the sentences.  First, I must note that as
a result of this Court's decision in Martineau,
released concurrently, it can no longer be said that s. 214(5)  has the
potential to classify unintentional killings as first degree murder.  A
conviction for murder requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective
foresight of death.  Therefore, when we reach the stage of classifying murders
as either first or second degree, we are dealing with individuals who have
committed the most serious crime in our Criminal Code , and
who have been proven to have done so with the highest level of moral
culpability, that of subjective foresight.  Section 214(5)  represents a decision
by Parliament to impose a more serious punishment on those found guilty of
murder while committing certain listed offences.

 

    This
leads me to a second point, namely a consideration of the underlying rationale
of s. 214(5) .  Again, I refer to the decision of this Court in Paré, at
pp. 632‑33:

 

All murders are serious crimes.  Some murders,
however, are so threatening to the public that Parliament has chosen to impose
exceptional penalties on the perpetrators.  One such class of murders is
that found in s. 214(5) , murders done while committing a hijacking, a
kidnapping and forcible confinement, a rape, or an indecent
assault. . . .

 

The
offences listed in s. 214(5)  are all offences involving the unlawful
domination of people by other people.  Thus an organizing principle for
s. 214(5)  can be found.  This principle is that where a murder is
committed by someone already abusing his power by illegally dominating another,
the murder should be treated as an exceptionally serious crime.  Parliament has
chosen to treat these murders as murders in the first degree.

 

I can
find no principle of fundamental justice that prevents Parliament, guided by
the organizing principle identified by this Court in Paré, from
classifying murders done while committing certain underlying offences as more
serious, and thereby attaching more serious penalties to them.  In the case of
the distinction between first and second degree murder, the difference is a
maximum extra fifteen years that must be served before one is eligible for parole. 
This distinction is neither arbitrary nor irrational.  The section is based on
an organizing principle that treats murders committed while the perpetrator is
illegally dominating another person as more serious than other murders. 
Further, the relationship between the classification and the moral
blameworthiness of the offender clearly exists.  Section 214 only comes
into play when murder has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  In light of Martineau, this
means that the offender has been proven to have had subjective foresight of
death.  Parliament's decision to treat more seriously murders that have been
committed while the offender is exploiting a position of power through illegal
domination of the victim accords with the principle that there must be a
proportionality between a sentence and the moral blameworthiness of the
offender and other considerations such as deterrence and societal condemnation
of the acts of the offender.  Therefore, I conclude that in so far as
s. 214(5)  is neither arbitrary nor irrational, it does not infringe upon
s. 7  of the Charter .  I note that in this appeal there
was no argument made as regards s. 12  of the Charter ,
although that issue was raised in a case heard and disposed of concurrently, R. v.
Luxton, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000.

 

    The
remaining issue in this case is whether s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  should be applied.  On the facts of this case I would
apply s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , and
uphold the conclusion of the jury that the appellant was guilty of first degree
murder.  I first note that the trial judge instructed the jury on s. 212(a) of the Code. 
Further, in order to convict the appellant of first degree murder, the jury
must have found that the appellant caused the death of the victim in the course
of a sexual assault.  The only evidence before the jury as to a sexual assault
was the testimony of the witness Barr to whom the appellant made certain
statements.  Accordingly, it is clear that the jury must have also
accepted the testimony of Barr as to how the appellant killed the victim. 
According to Barr, the appellant told him that he went with the victim to a
cabin where he grabbed her and attempted to force her to perform an act of
fellatio.  The victim resisted, there was an argument and she ran away.  The
appellant got in his car and ran over her.  He stopped the car, got out and
smashed her head with a rock.  The appellant further told Barr that he took the
body down a trail and hid it.  He then went to buy gas and oil from a Canadian
Tire store, got a shovel from his father, put the body in a pit and set it
ablaze.  Therefore, even with the error in leaving s. 213  with the jury, I
am convinced that no jury acting reasonably could have returned any verdict
other than guilty of murder.  It is plain from the jury's verdict that it
rejected the possibility that the appellant killed the victim after the
commission of the sexual assault, and rather found that the sexual assault and
the killing were part of one continuing sequence of events so as to form a
single transaction.  It is not conceivable that the jury, accepting Barr's
evidence to convict the appellant of first degree murder, could have rejected
his evidence as to how the appellant caused the victim's death.  The nature of
the injuries suffered by the victim coupled with the description of the attack
by the appellant on the victim leave me with no doubt that a reasonable jury
could come to any other conclusion than a verdict of guilty of murder pursuant
to s. 212 (a).

 

    I
would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal and answer the constitutional questions
as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 213(a) of the Criminal Code  (as it
read in November 1984) contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by
s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.  Yes.

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  (as it read in November 1984) justified by s. 1  of
the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

A.  No.

 

3.Does
s. 214(5) of the Criminal Code  (as it read in
November 1984) contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  of
the Charter ?

 

A.  No.

 

4.If the
answer to question 3 is affirmative, is s. 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code  (as it read in November 1984) justified by s. 1  of
the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

A.In light of the answer to question 3, this question
does not have to be answered.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé
J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    L'HEUREUX‑DUBÉ J. --
While I agree with Chief Justice Lamer's resolution of this appeal, given my
position in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
000, released concurrently, I wish to add the following remarks, particularly
regarding s. 214(5) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34.

 

    As
the facts and relevant legislation have been recounted by my colleague, I will
not restate them.  The following constitutional questions were framed by Chief
Justice Dickson: 

 

1.Does s. 213(a) [now
s. 230(a)] of the Criminal Code  (as it
read in November 1984) contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by
ss. 7  and/or 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If the answer to question 1 is affirmative, is
s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code  (as it
read in November 1984) justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

3.Does s. 214(5) [now s. 231(5)] of the Criminal
Code  (as it read in November 1984) contravene the rights and
freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  of the Charter ?

 

4.If the
answer to question 3 is affirmative, is s. 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code  (as it read in November 1984) justified by s. 1  of
the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    For
the reasons stated in Martineau, I am of the view that the first
question must be answered in the negative, and therefore the second question
need not be answered.  I would also answer question 3 in the negative, relying
principally on McLachlin J.A.'s (now of this Court) opinion, writing for the
British Columbia Court of Appeal (1988), 30 B.C.L.R. (2d) 179.

 

    In Martineau, the
sole issue was the constitutionality of s. 213(a). 
Under s. 213(a), a whole series of requirements must be met before an
accused can be convicted for murder.  While I disagreed with my colleague's
introduction of subjective foresight of death as the exclusive constitutional
standard to be applied for the crime of murder, I do agree with his assessment
in R. v. Luxton, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, released concurrently, that
""[t]he distinction between first and second degree murder only comes into
play when it has first been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender
is guilty of murder"".

 

    In
order to be found guilty of first degree murder under s. 214(5) , the
offender must have committed murder while ""abusing his power by illegally
dominating another"":  R. v. Paré, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
618, at p. 633.  This is in addition to the stringent criteria for the
crime of murder itself; either subjective foresight of death, and/or the
commission of a predicate crime included in a circumscribed list of offences
under s. 213, combined with the concomitant intentional infliction of
bodily harm resulting in death.  When all of these factors are consolidated, it
is certainly appropriate for Parliament to impose its most severe punishment.

 

    After
citing this Court's decision in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 636, McLachlin J.A. held, at pp. 187‑88 that:

 

. . . Parliament cannot, in the absence of moral
blameworthiness established by the objective foreseeability of killing,
make homicide murder.  However, Parliament may, in the same circumstances,
impose heavy sentences equivalent to those imposed for murder, where this is
necessary to deter particular types of conduct.

 

    The appellant, if he is to succeed in bringing his
challenge to s. 214(5) within the ambit of Vaillancourt, supra,
must establish that the classification of first and second degree murder
creates an offence lacking the necessary element of mens rea.  This he cannot
do.  First, s. 214(5) does not create an offence. . . .

 

    Second,
the classification effected by s. 214(5) does not exclude mens rea. 
Rather, mens rea is presupposed by the existence of a valid conviction for
murder under ss. 212  or 213  of the Criminal Code , without which
s. 214(5)  does not come into play.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    McLachlin
J.A. also addressed, at p. 189, the contention that s. 214(5) is
inconsistent with ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  because
the distinction between first and second degree murder is arbitrary and
unrelated to the moral blameworthiness of the accused:

 

    I note
initially that it is only s. 7  of the Charter  which is of concern in this
case.  The presumption of innocence enshrined in s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
can play no role because before s. 214(5)  can come into play the accused
must first have been found guilty of murder.  Thus, the only question is
whether s. 214(5)  deprives an accused of ""life, liberty or security
of person"" in a manner which is not consistent with the principles of
fundamental justice.

 

    With
respect to this latter issue of sentencing and its affiliation to moral
blameworthiness, McLachlin J.A. concluded at pp. 189‑90 that:

 

. . . it must be recognized that many factors other than
the accused's degree or [sic] moral blameworthiness must be considered by Parliament
in establishing a sentencing scheme.  General deterrence, the degree of
perceived danger to the public and the prevalence of certain types of offences
are only some of the other considerations which Parliament may properly
consider.  It follows that the mere fact that a harsher sentence may be imposed
for one offence than for another offence which is arguably more blameworthy
does not mean that the scheme that permits the sentence violates s. 7  of
the Charter . . . .

 

Many
factors entered into the determination of an appropriate penalty for a
particular offence; the degree of blameworthiness is only one.  The question
is one of policy, to be determined by Parliament.  So long as Parliament does
not act irrationally or arbitrarily or in a manner otherwise inconsistent with
the fundamental principles of justice, its choice must be upheld. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    I
agree with the above characterization of both the legislation and Parliament's
prerogative with respect to establishing a sentencing scheme.  Therefore, while
I concur with Lamer C.J.'s ultimate disposition, I would dismiss the appeal for
the reasons of the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  I would answer the
constitutional questions posed as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 213(a) [now s. 230(a)] of
the Criminal Code  (as it read in November 1984) contravene the rights and
freedoms guaranteed by ss. 7  and/or 11(d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.No.

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is affirmative, is s. 213 (a) of the Criminal
Code  (as it read in November 1984) justified by s. 1  of
the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

A.This question need not be answered.

 

3.Does
s. 214(5) [now s. 231(5)] of the Criminal Code   in
November 1984) contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  of
the Charter ?

 

A.No.

 

4.If the
answer to question 3 is affirmative, is s. 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code  (as it read in November 1984) justified by s. 1  of
the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with the
Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

A.This
question need not be answered.

following are the reasons delivered by

 

    SOPINKA J. ‑‑
I agree with Chief Justice Lamer that the appeal must be dismissed pursuant to
s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34.  With respect to s. 213 (a), I
would answer the constitutional questions in the manner proposed by Lamer C.J. 
I would do so for the reasons I gave in R. v. Martineau, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 000.  With respect to s. 214(5) , I agree with Lamer C.J. except
to the extent that he relies on the view that murder, and hence first degree
murder, constitutionally requires subjective foresight of death.

    The
accused was charged with four offences, including having care or control of a
motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 234(1)  of the Criminal
Code .  At trial, the police testified that the accused was
found in the driver's seat of a stolen automobile which, while under his
control, backed up a short distance.  In defence, the accused testified that he
was so drunk he could not recall the evening's events.  The trial judge
acquitted the accused on the four charges on the ground that the accused was so
intoxicated that he could not form the required intent to commit the
offences.  The Crown appealed the acquittal on the s. 234(1)  charge. 
The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty. 
This appeal is to determine (1) whether intoxication is a defence to a charge
of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired; (2) if the defence
is excluded, whether such exclusion infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ; and, if so, (3) whether the
infringement is justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per
Sopinka, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.:  The Crown's contention that drunkenness
could not serve as a defence under s. 234(1) of the Code because
of the presumption created by s. 237(1)(a) must
be rejected.  Since the Crown chose not to assert the presumption at trial, but
rather relied exclusively on evidence that the accused had exercised care or
control under s. 234(1) (a), it cannot be
allowed to assert that presumption on appeal.  To do so would result in the
accused being deprived of the opportunity to make the full answer and defence
that could have been made if it had been raised at trial.  Intention to set the
vehicle in motion is relevant to s. 237(1)(a); it is
not relevant to s. 234(1) .

 

    The
defence of intoxication is excluded under s. 234(1) of the Code.  In
enacting s. 234(1) , Parliament has posited impairment as an essential
element of the offence and must be taken to have eliminated the availability of
a defence of lack of intent based on the same impairment which it has made
culpable.  It is impossible to speak of a defence which also constitutes an
element of the offence.  The exclusion of the defence of intoxication renders
irrelevant the general intent / specific intent issue.

 

    Even
if the accused is too drunk to know that he is assuming care and control of the
motor vehicle, the exclusion of intoxication as a defence under s. 234(1) 
does not constitute a limitation on the accused's right to make full answer and
defence under ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter , since
the mens rea of the offence lies not in the intention to assume care
or control of a motor vehicle, but in voluntarily becoming intoxicated.  This interpretation
recognizes that intoxication is excluded as a defence to impaired driving since
it is the very gravamen of the offence.  This state of the law was not changed
by this Court's decision in Toews.

 

    Per Wilson
and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.:  Impairment cannot be a defence to the offence of
having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired under s. 234(1) 
of the Criminal Code .  Impairment, as opposed to non‑impairment,
cannot be at one and the same time an essential element of the offence and a defence
to the offence.

 

    The
unavailability of the defence of intoxication in the context of s. 234(1) 
does not constitute an infringement of ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  Where
intoxication to the point of impairment is an essential element of an offence
of general intent, i.e. part of the actus reus, the denial of the
intoxication defence in relation to that offence does not give rise to a
constitutional violation.  The section 234(1)  offence is one of general
intent requiring only a minimal mens rea ‑‑ the
intent to assume care or control after the voluntary consumption of alcohol or
a drug.  The requirement of impairment is an element of the actus reus. 
No viable defence to a charge under s. 234(1)  is foreclosed by the
section, and no conviction can take place under the section despite a
reasonable doubt as to the volitional nature of the accused's act.  It is the
act of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired, and
not the simple act of having care or control, that must be volitional in order
that the actus reus of this offence be established.  To
establish the actus reus, the Crown does not have to establish
an intent to do it, but merely that the accused was aware that he was doing
it.  The conscious doing of an act encompasses the intention to do it and
constitutes the minimal mens rea for general intent offences. 
When a person voluntarily consumes alcohol to the point of impairment and has
care or control of a motor vehicle while in that condition, there is no doubt
about the volitional nature of his act of becoming impaired.  The accused's
impairment is the gravamen of the offence under s. 234(1) , and it is this
which must be the result of an act of volition.  Under the section, the act of
having care or control and the state of voluntary impairment are undoubtedly
required to be contemporaneous.

 

    Crimes
in which intoxication is part of the actus reus,
therefore, are in a different category from crimes in which intoxication is
relevant to the mental element only.  There is no unconstitutionality in the
creation of the former type of offence.  However, if the unavailability of the
defence of intoxication should constitute an infringement of an accused's
constitutional rights, it would only be in cases of extreme intoxication
verging on automatism, and such an infringement would be justified under
s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Per La
Forest J.:  Section 234(1) of the Code prohibits the act
of having care or control of a motor vehicle while the perpetrator of that act
is impaired.  The mens rea of the offence is the intention to
assume care or control of the vehicle.  Judicial construction also requires
that the impairment be voluntary.  Since Parliament has made it an offence to
commit an act while impaired, it would be inconsistent for Parliament to have
also considered that impairment (including intoxication) could be relied on by
the defence.

 

    Section
234(1)  does not violate s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  With
respect to s. 11 (d), the constitutionality of s. 234(1) , qualified as
it is by s. 237(1) of the Code, has been accepted
by this Court in Whyte.  With respect to s. 7 , a person
can only come within the ambit of s. 234(1)  if his intoxication is
voluntary.  It follows that s. 234(1)  will only be applied where the
assumption of the care or control of a vehicle while impaired can truly be said
to be the responsibility of the accused in an ultimate sense, even if there is
a question as to whether he was capable, because of intoxication, of forming
the requisite intent as of the moment when care or control was actually
assumed.  Further, the mens rea requirement under s. 234(1)  is
very low.  It will seldom be the case that a person who has the care or control
of the motor vehicle be found so intoxicated as to have been incapable of
satisfying the very low mens rea requirement of s. 234(1) .  This
very low mental requirement is necessary if Parliament is to be able to create
effective offences respecting impaired driving.  The creation of such offences
is obviously in the public interest, an interest which is encompassed in the
""principles of fundamental justice"" mentioned in s. 7  of the Charter .

 

    Per Lamer
C.J.:  The offence of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired
contrary to s. 234(1) of the Code is one of general
intent requiring only a minimal mens rea.  A general intent
offence is one in which the only intent involved relates solely to the performance
of the act in question with no further ulterior intent or purpose.  The mental
element of the s. 234(1)  offence ‑‑ the intent to assume care
or control after the voluntary consumption of alcohol or a drug ‑‑
is defined by referring directly to the actus reus. 
No further intent is required apart from the intent to do the actus reus. 
Since the offence is one of general intent, it follows that no defence of
intoxication can negate the mens rea of the offence.  The question is
still open, however, as to whether intoxication giving rise to a state of
insanity or automatism could negate the mens rea of this
offence.  There is no need to decide this issue in this case.

 

    The
unavailability of the defence of intoxication for general intent offences is a
limit to the rights of an accused entrenched in ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  This
defence is an important and valuable one for an accused in cases where, but for
a rule preventing him from resorting to it, such a defence would have succeeded
in raising a reasonable doubt as to voluntariness, an element essential to the
commission of the actus reus.  The limit on the accused's
fundamental rights is the result of the judge‑made rule that a defence of
intoxication is unavailable or that any consideration of intoxication is made
irrelevant in cases of general intent offences.  In the context of
drinking and driving offences, such a limit is demonstrably justifiable under
s. 1  of the Charter .  First, the objective of taking away
the defence of intoxication is of sufficient importance to justify restricting
the rights contained in ss. 7  and 11 (d).  The
measure is part of the scheme set up by Parliament to protect the security and
property of the public and is aimed at securing the conviction of the impaired
persons who are in care or control of a motor vehicle.  Second, the measure is
proportional to the ends s. 234(1) (a) is
designed to attain.  There is a rational connection between the restriction on
the fundamental rights and the objective.  The unavailability of the defence of
intoxication is logical and necessary to suppress all the effects of
intoxication on the road.  Further, the measure does not represent an
overkill.  The rule does not impose a conviction on an intoxicated person found
to have care or control but who is completely blameless.  Involuntary
intoxication is left unpunished as is also an involuntary taking, care, or
control, due to factors other than intoxication.

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    CHIEF JUSTICE LAMER -- This
case raises the issue of whether someone accused pursuant to s. 234  (now
s. 253) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired, and to whom
s. 237 (now s. 258) of the Criminal Code  applies, can raise
a defence of intoxication.

 

I - The
Facts

 

    In
the early hours of April 27, 1985, in the Township of Michipicoten, Ontario, an
automobile was stolen by two unidentified persons.  About twenty minutes later,
the police located the vehicle and found the appellant sitting in the driver's
seat and another person sitting beside him.  The investigating officer was not
sure whether the vehicle was in motion when he located it. However, he
testified that while he got out of the police car and approached the vehicle,
he saw the appellant gesturing as if putting it in reverse and, in effect, the
vehicle moved back about one foot.  The key was in the ignition and the
ignition was on.  The passenger was found in possession of an additional set of
keys in his pocket.  The appellant and the passenger were immediately arrested
by the police.

 

    It
is common ground that the accused had been drinking heavily in the hours which
preceded his arrest.  He testified that he had no recollection of any of the
events that took place between midnight and the moment he was awakened in his
cell, late that morning.

 

    The
appellant was acquitted of the four counts of which he was charged: robbery
contrary to s. 303 of the Code, theft of the car contrary to s. 294(a) of the Code,
possession of the car contrary to s. 312(1)(a) of the Code and
care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 234 of the Code.  The
Crown has only appealed the acquittal on the s. 234  charge, that is,  having
care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired.

 

II - Judgments
in the Courts Below

 

    The
trial judge found that the appellant was very intoxicated.  He acquitted the
appellant on the four counts as he was of the opinion that his degree of
intoxication prevented him from forming the required mental element in respect
of the offences with which he was charged.  The trial judge did not however
proceed to an analysis of the elements of the offence of having care or control
of a vehicle while impaired and did not consequently relate the effect of the
defence of intoxication to any of these elements.

 

    The
sole ground of appeal raised by the Crown before the Ontario Court of Appeal
was that a defence of self-induced intoxication on a charge of care or control
of a motor vehicle while impaired is not available to an accused.  The Court of
Appeal held that intention to drive is not an essential element of the offence
under s. 234 . The Crown need only prove that the accused had care or control of
a motor vehicle while impaired.  The offence was regarded as a general intent
offence, for which the Crown need not prove that the assumption of care or
control was motivated by any particular purpose.  It further held not only that
voluntary intoxication is not a defence to a crime of general intent but also
that it can form the mens rea of such an offence.  The Court of
Appeal accordingly allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and entered a
verdict of guilty:  (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 533, 45 M.V.R. 28, 18
O.A.C. 31.

 

III - The
Relevant Legislation

 

    This
appeal involves s. 234 of the Code which creates the
offence of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired and the
presumption created under s. 237 of the Code.  These
sections read as follows:

 

    234. (1) Every one who, while his ability
to drive a motor  vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor
vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion
or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable

 

(a) for a first offence, to a fine of not more than two
thousand dollars and not less than fifty dollars or to imprisonment for six
months or to both;

 

(b) for a second offence, to imprisonment for not more
than one year and not less than fourteen days; and 

 

(c) for
each subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not more than two years and not
less than three months.

 

    237. (1) In any proceedings under section
234  or 236 ,

 

(a) where
it is proved that the accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the
driver of a motor vehicle, he shall be deemed to have had the care or control
of the vehicle unless he establishes that he did not enter or mount the vehicle
for the purpose of setting it in motion; 

 

IV - Analysis

 

    The
appellant submits that the crime of having care or control of a motor vehicle
while impaired is a crime of specific intent in the sense that s. 234(1) (a)
requires a further purpose to the mere intent to ""use ... the car, its
fittings or equipment"".  He argues that this specific intent is the intent
to use the car, its fittings or equipment for the purpose of operating the car
as a motor vehicle, as opposed to the intent to use the car as a bedroom, for example. 
The importance of classifying a crime as one of specific rather than general
intent resides in the availability of the defence of intoxication for specific
intent crimes.

 

General or Specific Intent Crimes and the Availability of a Defence of
Intoxication

 

    The
difficult task of formulating a meaningful distinction between specific intent
and general intent crimes was addressed by this Court in R. v.
George, [1960] S.C.R. 871, where Fauteux J. explained at p.
877:

 

In
considering the question of mens rea, a distinction is to be made between
(i) intention as applied to acts considered in relation to their purposes and
(ii) intention as applied to acts considered apart from their purposes.  A
general intent attending the commission of an act is, in some cases, the only
intent required to constitute the crime while, in others, there must be, in
addition to that general intent, a specific intent attending the purpose for
the commission of the act.

 

    Recently,
in R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, a majority of this Court
reaffirmed the desirability of keeping the distinction between specific intent
crimes and general intent crimes as well as the consequences that flow from it
with regards to the availability of a defence of intoxication to negate the mens rea. 
McIntyre J. gave the following explanation of the distinction at p. 863:

 

The
general intent offence is one in which the only intent involved relates solely
to the performance of the act in question with no further ulterior intent or
purpose....  A specific intent offence is one which involves the performance of
the actus reus, coupled with an intent or purpose going beyond the
mere performance of the questioned act.

 

    In
the same decision, Wilson J. was of the view that only a minimal intent was
involved in proving the mens rea of general intent crimes and that in
these cases, ""intentional and voluntary"" had to be opposed to
""accidental or involuntary"" (p. 883).

 

    It
is of no use here to repeat the thorough analysis made by some of the members
of this Court in Bernard as regards the desirability of the
distinction, the fact being that Bernard reaffirms it as it
reaffirms the consequences that flow from it.  The question, therefore, simply
becomes whether s. 234(1) (a) is an offence of specific intent or general intent.

 

    That
the intention to set a vehicle in motion is not an element of the offence of
having care or control of a motor vehicle while one's ability to drive is
impaired has been affirmed in Ford v. The Queen, [1982]
1 S.C.R. 231.  Proof of lack of intent to set the motor vehicle in motion is
only relevant to prevent the Crown from benefiting from the presumption of s.
237(1)(a).  This Court has recently reaffirmed these findings in R. v.
Toews, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 119, and R. v.
Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3.

 

    The mens rea and the actus reus of the
offence of care or control of a motor vehicle while one's ability to drive was
impaired were examined in Toews and the following conclusion was
reached at p. 124:

 

Similarly,
the mens rea for having care or control of a motor vehicle is the
intent to assume care or control after the voluntary consumption of alcohol
or a drug.  The actus reus is the act of assumption of care
or control when the voluntary consumption of alcohol or a drug has impaired
the ability to drive.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
mental element of this offence is therefore defined by referring directly to
the actus reus.  No further intent is required apart from the intent
to do the actus reus which strongly indicates that this
offence falls within the category of general intent offences.  It has also been
stated by Dickson C.J., speaking for the Court in Whyte, that
the intent required under this offence is a minimal one.  That case was dealing
with the constitutionality of the presumption of care or control contained in
s. 237(1)(a) considered in the light of s. 11 (d) in the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The Chief Justice stated at p. 22:

 

In my
view, we must recognize that Parliament was faced with a difficult task in
defining drinking and driving offences.  The very fact that consumption of
alcohol is an element of these offences renders problematic the element of
intention.  Justice precludes undue reliance upon strict or absolute
liability.  Social protection precludes undue emphasis upon the mental element
to these offences.  Parliament has decided to define the offence in terms
of ""care or control"".  As I have already noted, this Court has held
that the Crown need not prove that the accused had an intention to drive or to
set the vehicle in motion in order to secure a conviction for ""care or
control"".  The mens rea
requirement for the offence of care or control is a minimal one and it
has not been argued here that this constitutes a departure from the
requirements of s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Charter . 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    Furthermore,
the submission of the appellant whereby the intent of the offence should be
defined as the intent to use the car, its fittings or equipment for the purpose
of operating the car as a motor vehicle runs counter to the clear pronouncement
of this Court to the effect that the intention to set it in motion is not an
element of this offence.  Using a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle is another
way of saying using a motor vehicle to set it in motion, since the main
characteristic that distinguishes a motor vehicle from other objects or places
is the ability to use it for transportation, that is, to set it in motion. 
Such a proposition would be the equivalent of accepting that the appellant must
have had the intention to set the motor vehicle in motion in order to contravene
to s. 234(1) (a), a proposition that was rejected in Ford.

 

    The
law, however, is not deprived of any flexibility and does not go so far as to
punish the mere presence of an individual whose ability to drive is impaired in
a motor vehicle.  In fact, Toews stands for the proposition that when
a person uses a vehicle in a way that involves no risk of putting it in motion
so that it could become dangerous, the courts should find that the actus reus was not
present.  In that case, the accused was acquitted because he was sleeping on
the front seat, in a sleeping bag with his head near the passenger's door.  The
Court did not base its decision on the absence of mens rea that
would derive from the accused's intent to use the vehicle for another purpose
than to use it as a motor vehicle, that is to use it as a bedroom.  Rather, it
held at p. 127:

 

It has
not been shown ... that the respondent performed any acts of care or control
and he has therefore not performed the actus reus.

 

    For
these reasons, I am of the view that the offence of having care or control of a
motor vehicle while one's ability to drive is impaired is a general intent
offence.  It follows, as was decided by a majority of this Court in Bernard, that
no defence of intoxication can negate the mens rea of this
offence, although the question is still open as to whether intoxication giving
rise to a state of insanity or automatism could achieve such a result.

 

    The
trial judge found that the appellant was very intoxicated.  However, the
appellant did not prove, on a balance of probabilities, that his intoxication
was so great as to constitute insanity or automatism, nor was a state of
insanity or automatism found by any of the judges in the courts below.  On the
facts of this case, I see no need to address the issue concerning the relevance
of intoxication to negate the mens rea where such
intoxication verges on insanity or automatism.  I would therefore conclude that
the first submission of the appellant must fail.

 

The Charter 
Issues

 

    This
leaves us with the question as to whether the principle that a person accused
of having breached s. 234(1) (a) cannot raise
intoxication either as a defence or as a factor to be considered in deciding if
all the elements constituting the offence are present, is contrary to the Charter .  More
particularly, the appellant argues that this rule infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  In
all fairness to the judge and justices of the courts below who did not address
this issue, I must point out that it seems to have been argued, as an
afterthought and for the first time, only before this Court.  As a result, we
have not had the benefit of hearing full argument on the point, nor have we had
the benefit of the views of the judge and justices in the courts below.  In my view,
however, the constitutional validity of denying a defence of intoxication, or
denying any relevance to intoxication, in considering the commission of the
offence defined in s. 234(1) (a) is an important
question that this Court should address now.

 

    The
legal implication of classifying an offence as a general intent offence
combined with the removal of the defence of intoxication when intoxication is
self-induced will, in certain circumstances, leave the trier of fact with no
choice but to convict the accused even though there was a reasonable doubt
whether, due to intoxication, the accused's act was voluntary.  By the same
token, the Crown would be relieved from proving beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus of a
general intent offence since a reasonable doubt as to voluntariness arising
from intoxication would be discarded from consideration from the outset.  I am
of the view that the fact that a conviction may follow notwithstanding the
existence of a reasonable doubt as to voluntariness, an element essential to
the commission of the actus reus, is a limit to the
rights guaranteed to the accused by ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

    McIntyre
J. examined in Bernard whether the unavailability of the
defence of intoxication infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  He
was of the opinion that excluding the defence of intoxication for all general
intent offences did not offend either section.  With respect, I cannot agree.

 

    Wilson
J., in the same case, also addressed the Charter  issues
involved by stating that no defence of intoxication is available for general
intent offences.  She was of the opinion that evidence of intoxication should
go to the trier of fact only in cases where there is evidence of extreme
intoxication involving an absence of awareness akin to a state of insanity or
automatism because only in such cases would such evidence of intoxication be
capable of raising a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the minimal intent
required for general intent offences.

 

    With
respect for the contrary view, I find it difficult to deny generally a defence
of intoxication on the grounds that, in fact, only in very rare situations will
it succeed in actually raising a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of
fact.  Denying the availability of a defence of intoxication in the cases where
such a defence would have failed anyway in raising a reasonable doubt as to an
element of the offence is of no real and practical importance to an accused. 
However, it is an important and valuable defence for the accused in cases
where, but for a rule preventing the accused from resorting to the defence of
intoxication, such a defence would have succeeded in raising a reasonable doubt
as to the existence of an element of the offence.

 

    In
cases where a reasonable doubt would have been raised as to the existence of
the mental element particular to the offence in question, McIntyre J. in Bernard would
have substituted for it the blameworthy mental state that springs from
voluntary self-intoxication.  However, in cases where resort to the substituted mens rea was
necessary for blameworthiness to be proven, Wilson J. decided to leave the
question open as to the constitutional validity of denying a defence of
intoxication.  Indeed, she stated at p. 889:

 

    It
is, in my view, not strictly necessary in this case to address the
constitutionality of substituting self-induced intoxication as the mens rea for the
minimal mens rea requirements of general intent offences.  This issue
would, in my view, only arise in those rare cases in which the intoxication is
extreme enough to raise doubts as to the existence of the minimal intent which
characterizes conscious and volitional conduct.

 

My
colleague, in obiter, adds the following comment as regards
whether by using a substituted form of mens rea s. 11 (d) of the Charter  would
be infringed (at p. 890):

 

In my
tentative view, it is unlikely that in those cases in which it is necessary to
resort to self-induced intoxication as the substituted element for the minimal
intent, proof of the substituted element will ""inexorably"" lead to
the conclusion that the essential element of the minimal intent existed at the
time the criminal act was committed.  But I prefer to leave this question open
as it is unnecessary to decide it in order to dispose of this appeal.

 

    I
conclude, therefore, that only a minority in Bernard
expressed a conclusive opinion as to the constitutionality of the rule denying
a defence of intoxication for all general intent offences.  In cases where the
intoxication would succeed in raising a reasonable doubt as to an element of a
general intent offence, the question is, in my opinion, still open for this
Court to decide.

 

    I am
of the view, as indicated above, that the unavailability of the defence of
intoxication for general intent offences as interpreted by the courts is a
limit on the rights of an accused entrenched in ss. 7  and 11 (d), and
that such a restriction can only stand if it survives a s. 1  analysis.

 

    We
are not in a position to, nor should we in any event, proceed to a s. 1 
analysis of the restriction for all general intent offences.  Of course, if
this were done and the restriction were found to be ""demonstrably
justified"", this would end the matter.  But I think it preferable to
proceed on a section by section approach, this case putting in issue the
restriction as regards s. 234 .

 

    Therefore,
for the purpose of this analysis I will assume, without deciding that, as a
general rule, s. 1  would not save the limit on fundamental rights that is the
result of the judge-made rule that a defence of intoxication is unavailable or
that any consideration of intoxication is made irrelevant in cases of general
intent offences.  That being deemed, I am nonetheless of the opinion that, in
the context of drinking and driving offences, such a limit can be demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society.

 

    Any
analysis as to whether a restriction to rights guaranteed by ss. 7  and 11 (d) is
salvaged by s. 1  of the Charter  involves the application of the
decision of this Court in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
103.  Unfortunately, the parties did not adduce any evidence nor did they
address s. 1 .  However, I think that we can take judicial notice of the danger
and disastrous results when drinking and driving are combined.

 

    The
first criterion stated in Oakes is that the objective of the measure
that restricts a guaranteed right or freedom must be ""of sufficient
importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or
freedom"" (p. 138). It is important, in a s. 1  analysis, to identify with
precision the measure which is the object of scrutiny and to focus on that
measure to determine if it is justified ""in a free and democratic
society"".  The measure that is under consideration here is the taking away
of the defence of intoxication and the irrelevancy of intoxication as a factor
to be considered in determining whether all the elements of s. 234(1) (a) are
present.  We are not concerned in the present case with the testing of s.
234(1) (a) under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    We
must therefore start by identifying the objective of this measure.  Taking away
the defence of intoxication is designed to secure the conviction of those
individuals who would be so intoxicated as to be able to raise a reasonable
doubt as to the voluntariness of having care or control.  In other words, this
measure aims at ensuring that the most drunk will be convicted.  The object of
the unavailability of the defence of intoxication is that of ensuring that no
one will escape conviction who is found impaired and who has taken care or control
of a motor vehicle as long as impairment was the result of voluntary
intoxication.

 

    The
next step is to assess whether such objective is of sufficient importance to
warrant overriding the rights protected in ss. 7  and 11 (d).  The
measure is part of the scheme set up by Parliament to protect the security and
property of the public that are put to risk by persons whose ability to drive
is impaired but who are, in any event, in care or control of a motor vehicle. 
In Saunders v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 284, this Court held
(at p. 289):

 

    Obviously,
every one agrees that the true object of the provisions of ss. 222 and 223 [a
prior version of the drinking and driving or care or control offences] is to
cope with and protect the person and the property from the danger which is
inherent in the driving, care or control of a motor vehicle
by anyone who is intoxicated or under the influence of a drug or whose ability
to drive is impaired by alcohol or a drug.

 

The
social concern, common to the ""drinking and driving"" family of
offences, is the severe risk to life, security or property of the public that
is posed by persons whose ability to drive is impaired, but who are
nevertheless in control of a motor vehicle.  This concern was recognised by
this Court to be of great importance in Curr v. The Queen, [1972]
S.C.R. 889, R. v. Hufsky, [1988] 1 S.C.R.
621, R. v. Thomsen, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640, and in Whyte, supra, at p.
27.  No one will dispute the importance of the objective of the offences
themselves that will secure conviction of the impaired persons who are in care
or control, even in cases where impairment is not all that great.  A
fortiori, a measure ensuring that the most drunk, and by
implication the ones representing the greatest threat to public safety, be convicted
is of sufficient importance to justify restricting the rights contained in ss.
7  and 11 (d).  In my view, the first criterion of the Oakes test is
therefore met.

 

    The
second criterion stated in Oakes requires that the means chosen to
attain this objective be proportional or appropriate to these ends.  A measure
will be said to satisfy this criterion when it is rationally connected with the
objective it is designed to achieve, when it impairs the fundamental right or
freedom which it limits as little as possible, and when there is a
proportionality between the effects of the measure limiting such right or
freedom and the objective identified as having sufficient importance.

 

    A
rational connection must therefore be found between the restriction on the
fundamental right, namely the removal of the defence of intoxication, and the
objective set out above.  Obviously, convicting all drivers whose ability to
drive is impaired, whether they voluntarily took care or control of the motor
vehicle or not, is rationally connected with the objective of ensuring that
impaired drivers are off the road whatever their degree of intoxication.  As
part of the more general scheme put in place by Parliament to deal with the
problem of drinking and driving, the availability of the defence of
intoxication would defeat its purpose.  Intoxication, the source of danger s.
234  is designed to address, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the
Crown.  By the same token, however, it could defeat the Crown's case by establishing
beyond a reasonable doubt a valid defence.  In cases of serious intoxication,
the Crown would be confronted with an unbearable burden.  The unavailability of
the defence of intoxication is a logical and necessary feature to the
achievement of suppressing all the effects of intoxication on the road.  I
therefore conclude that the removal of the defence of intoxication satisfies
the first aspect of the proportionality criterion.

 

    I am
also of the view that the unavailability of the defence of intoxication does
not represent an overkill, in terms of the limit on the rights in question,
especially in the light of the very serious problem caused by the
""drinking and driving"" family of offences.  The rule does not impose
a conviction on an intoxicated person found to have care and control but who is
completely blameless:  involuntary intoxication is left unpunished as is also
an involuntary taking, care, or control, due to factors other than
intoxication.  On the other hand, Parliament had to respond to the serious
threat that is posed by persons in care or control of a motor vehicle while
their ability to drive is impaired.  Such persons can reasonably be held
responsible when they voluntarily consume intoxicating substances and risk
putting the public safety in danger by assuming care or control of a motor
vehicle, whether they intended to assume care or control or whether
intoxication did not allow them to realize what they were doing.  By
voluntarily taking the first drink, an individual can reasonably be held to
have assumed the risk that intoxication would make him or her do what he or she
otherwise would not normally do with a clear mind.  I therefore conclude that
the unavailability of the defence of intoxication is a measure that is
proportional to the ends s. 234(1) (a) is designed to
attain.

 

V - Conclusion

 

    I
would therefore dismiss this appeal.

 

//Wilson J.//

 

    The
reasons of Wilson and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. were delivered by

 

    WILSON J. - I
have had the benefit of the reasons of my colleague Chief Justice Lamer in this
appeal and I am of the view that impairment, as opposed to non-impairment,
cannot be a defence to the offence under s. 234 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, of having care or control of a
motor vehicle while impaired.  Impairment cannot be at one and the same time an
essential element of the offence and a defence to the offence.

 

    Does
the fact that Parliament has foreclosed the availability of this defence give
rise to a constitutional violation?  It is on this point that my reasons
diverge from those of my colleague.  In my view, the unavailability of the
defence of intoxication in the context of s. 234 does not give rise to an
infringement of an accused's ss. 7  and 11 (d)
rights.

 

    In R. v.
Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, this Court held that denying the
defence of intoxication in the case of an offence of general intent does not
violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  at
least in so far as cases not involving ""substituted"" mens rea are
concerned.  Accordingly, if Lamer C.J.'s reasons in this case are not confined
to ""substituted""  mens rea cases, which they do not appear to
be, it would appear that he is reopening the issue in Bernard.  While
this is, of course, perfectly open to him to do, I tend to the view that Bernard was
correctly decided.  I remain of the view that intoxication falling short of
insanity or automatism is not a defence to crimes of general intent.  The
defence of intoxication is, of course, available in the case of crimes of
specific intent.

 

    Bernard did not
deal with the question whether a constitutional infringement takes place when
Parliament has made impairment an ingredient of the offence.  It dealt only
with the availability of the defence of intoxication to negate mens rea in the
context of the common law distinction between crimes of general and crimes of
specific intent.  In that case, Dickson C.J. (with whom Lamer J. (as he then
was) concurred) expressly exempted from his comments regarding the
unconstitutionality of the denial of the intoxication defence in relation to
crimes of general intent those offences in which intoxication is an element of
the offence.  He said at p. 842:

 

    I
wish to make clear at the outset, however, that nothing in these reasons is
intended to apply with respect to the quite distinct issues raised by offences,
such as driving while impaired, where intoxication or the consumption of
alcohol is itself an ingredient of the offence.  The mens rea of such
offences can be left for consideration another day.

 

That
other day arrived when this appeal was heard.

 

    It
seems to me that the rationale behind Bernard is not
readily transferable to the situation where Parliament has made intoxication to
the point of impairment an essential ingredient of the offence.  I do not believe
for the reasons which follow that this gives rise to a constitutional
violation.

 

    Intoxication
has traditionally been viewed as relevant to mens rea. 
Certainly this was so in Bernard where, as already mentioned, it was
held that the defence of intoxication was available only in relation to crimes
of specific intent and not to crimes of general intent.  The rationale in
support of this finding was that intoxication could affect a person's ability
to foresee the consequences of an act, which is a requirement for crimes of
specific intent, but that, generally speaking, intoxication could not deprive a
person of the ability to know that he or she was committing the act, which is
the minimal requirement for crimes of general intent.

 

    This
traditional view stems from an appreciation of the level of intoxication
required to support the defence.  The same level of intoxication may operate to
negate the specific intent necessary to ground conviction for some offences but
be insufficient to negate the general intent required for others.  This does
not mean, however, that more severe levels of intoxication might not in some
circumstances raise a doubt as to whether that general intent motivated an
accused's acts.  The common law disallowed the defence of drunkenness in such
circumstances, I believe, on policy grounds, because to allow it would result
in the danger of average degrees of intoxication being considered as a defence
to a great many crimes.

 

    Voluntariness
is an aspect of the actus reus rather than the mens rea of an
offence.  It is a minimal requirement of the criminal law that acts in order to
be considered criminal must be conscious acts.  The same act to outward
appearance may be either an act of volition or an accident or mistake.  Yet the
legal implications are quite different.  In a sense it may seem artificial to
distinguish between volition and intention and say that the former pertains to
the actus reus and the latter to the mens rea of the
offence.  It might appear to make more sense to say that the conscious doing of
an act encompasses the intention to do it and therefore constitutes the minimal mens rea for
general intent offences.  If the act was accidental it lacked volition and
therefore the actus reus was not established.  By the same
token it also lacked intention so that the mens rea was not
established.  In either case it cannot meet the tests for criminality.

 

    The
criminal law does, however, distinguish between acts that are purely physical
and acts that are accompanied by mental processes and it treats acts of
volition as purely physical.  To establish the actus reus the
Crown does not have to establish an intent to do the act, merely that the
accused was aware that he was doing it.  In other words, the criminal law
contemplates that while acts which are intentional must necessarily be
volitional, acts which are volitional need not necessarily be intentional.  The
classic example is the woman who shoots a supposed intruder only to discover
later that the intruder was her husband who had returned home earlier than
expected.  Her act was unquestionably an act of volition but it was prompted by
mistake.  She had no intention to shoot her husband.

 

    I
agree with Lamer C.J. that the offence under s. 234 of the Code is an
offence of general intent requiring only a minimal mens rea.  I
disagree with him, however, that a conviction may take place under the section
despite a reasonable doubt as to the volitional nature of the accused's act. 
It is the act of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired
and not the simple act of having care or control that must be volitional in
order that the actus reus of this offence be established.  I
agree with my colleague that if it were the simple act of having care or
control that we were concerned about, such an act might be shown not to be
volitional if the accused was intoxicated to a very high degree.  He might
then, due to the effects of alcohol, truly not know what he was doing.  But
when a person voluntarily consumes alcohol to the point of impairment and has
care or control of a motor vehicle while in that condition, it seems to me that
there can be no doubt about the volitional nature of his or her act of becoming
impaired.  We are talking about self-induced intoxication to the point of
impairment.  It cannot be open to an accused to argue that due to his
impairment he was not aware of being impaired when he had care or control of
the motor vehicle.  The accused's impairment is the gravamen of the offence
under s. 234(1) .  And it is this which must, in my opinion, be the result
of an act of volition.  Nor is there any need to resort to the dubious concept
of ""substituted"" mens rea in such circumstances.  The act of
having care or control and the state of voluntary impairment are undoubtedly
required to be contemporaneous under this section.

 

    It
seems to me, moreover, that if my colleague is speaking of impairment to an
extent that could deprive the accused's act of its volitional character, he
must be speaking of a state of extreme impairment verging on automatism and, at
most, the section would violate the Charter  only to the extent
it deprived an accused in that condition of the defence of lack of volition. 
This would be consistent with the view I expressed in Bernard that
intoxication to that extreme degree could also negate the required minimal
mental element.

 

    The
problem at common law with denying the defence of intoxication for all crimes
of general intent is that it deprives an accused of the opportunity to raise a
reasonable doubt as to the presence of the mental element of the offence. 
According to this Court's reasons in R. v. Whyte, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 3, such a denial amounts to a violation of s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  In Bernard the actus reus was an
assault of a sexual nature causing bodily harm.  Intoxication was relevant only
to the presence or absence of mens rea, i.e. the intention
to commit the assault.  I expressed serious reservations in that case that
self-induced intoxication can be substituted for the intent required to be
present at the time the offence is committed.  I did not have to reach a
conclusion on that question since I found that the required mens rea for
sexual assault could readily be established by inference from the accused's
act.  In other circumstances, however, an accused may be intoxicated to such a
degree that he or she is incapable of forming even the minimal intent to do the
act, i.e. where he or she is in a mental state akin to insanity or automatism. 
I concluded that it would only be in those circumstances and not in the case of
ordinary drunkenness that the denial of the defence of intoxication could
result in an infringement of an accused's constitutional rights.

 

    The
question whether the requirement of impairment in s. 234 of the Code is an
aspect of the actus reus of the offence or the mens rea seems
to me to be relevant to any determination of the section's constitutionality. 
I do not find that my colleague has taken an unequivocal position on this and
it may be important in light of the existing jurisprudence.

 

    The mens rea and actus reus of the
offence of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired were defined
by this Court in R. v. Toews, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
119, as follows at p. 124:

 

. . .
the mens rea for having care or control of a motor vehicle is the
intent to assume care or control after the voluntary consumption of alcohol or
a drug.  The actus reus is the act of assumption of care or
control when the voluntary consumption of alcohol or a drug has impaired the
ability to drive.

 

By this
definition the mental element of the offence under s. 234(1)  includes the
voluntary consumption of alcohol but the actus reus
requires the voluntary consumption of alcohol to the point of impairment. 
The distinction appears to make sense in that alcohol consumption to the point
of impairment could well negate the intent to have care or control of the motor
vehicle and result in the absence of mens rea whereas
simple consumption might not.  The actus reus requires impairment
by alcohol and not just the prior consumption of alcohol.  By making the
requirement of impairment an element of the actus reus rather
than the mens rea of the offence Parliament has avoided
the vicious circle which would otherwise be inherent in the offence.

 

    Given
the way in which Parliament has framed s. 234 of the Code, it
seems to me to be an open question whether or not a constitutional violation is
involved in the operation of the section.  Clearly the Crown, in order to
obtain a conviction, must prove care or control of the motor vehicle by the
accused at a time when he was impaired by alcohol or a drug.  The mens rea of the
offence is the intention to assume care or control of the motor vehicle after
the voluntary consumption of alcohol or a drug.  What then are the defences
open to the accused?  It seems to me that they are that he did not have care or
control of the motor vehicle or that, if he did, he was not impaired at the
time.  The accused might also seek to defend on the basis that, while he had
not consumed enough alcohol prior to assuming care or control of the motor
vehicle to result in impairment, he had consumed enough to render himself
incapable of forming the necessary intent to assume such care or control. 
However, it seems to me that, if I am correct in characterizing the offence in
s. 234(1)  as an offence of general intent, this defence would fail.

 

    With
all due respect to those who think differently, I am of the view that no viable
defence to a charge under s. 234(1)  is foreclosed by the section.  To hold
otherwise is to say that the legislature violates the Charter  if it
purports to make engaging in certain types of conduct while impaired offences
under the Criminal Code  and must justify
the creation of such offences under s. 1 .  I cannot accept that result.  I
think that Dickson C.J. was correct in indicating in Bernard that
crimes in which intoxication is made an element of the offence, i.e. part of
the actus reus, are in a different category from crimes in which
intoxication is relevant to the mental element only.  I find no
unconstitutionality in the creation of the former type of offences.

 

    In the
event, however, that I am wrong in my approach to the constitutional issue, I
would find an infringement only in cases of extreme intoxication verging on
automatism and would justify such infringement under s. 1  of the Charter  for the
reasons given by my colleague.  I wish, however, to add one observation.

 

    Some
commentators have suggested that the creation of an offence of ""dangerous
intoxication"" would resolve the constitutional problem of intoxicated
offenders because the elements of that offence would be more in keeping with
accepted fundamental principles of criminal liability.  I am not sure that such
a generalized offence would achieve the desired result.  I think the courts
would still have to determine whether the denial of an accused's opportunity to
question the presence of an essential element of the offence in different
contexts was constitutional.  Parliament has, in my view, attempted to resolve
the problem in s. 234 by creating the offence of care or control of a
motor vehicle while impaired.  It has, in other words, criminalized the
act of becoming impaired in a particular circumstance, i.e. in the context of
having care or control of a motor vehicle.  I think it was open to Parliament
to, in effect, create an offence akin to ""dangerous intoxication"" but
contextualized to the care or control situation.  This may, indeed, be the
preferred route to follow.  Impairment in different contexts poses different social
evils.  In my view it is not only open to, but perhaps incumbent upon,
Parliament to take account of those differences and to fashion offences in
response to specific social needs.

 

    For
the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

 

//La Forest
J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    LA FOREST J. -- I
have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my colleagues, Chief Justice
Lamer and Justices Wilson and McLachlin.  I too would dismiss the appeal.  I
would do so for the following reasons.

 

    Section
234(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, prohibits the act of having care or control of a motor vehicle while the
perpetrator of that act is impaired by alcohol or a drug.  The mens rea is the
intention to do that act, i.e., to assume care or control of the vehicle. 
Judicial construction also requires that the impairment be voluntary (R. v. Toews, [1985]
2 S.C.R. 119, at p. 124).  I reach my conclusion about the mens rea of the
offence as a matter of statutory interpretation, not on the basis of any
generalized doctrine of general intent.  Since Parliament has made it an
offence to commit an act while impaired, it would be inconsistent, as McLachlin
J. observes, for Parliament also to have considered that impairment (including
intoxication) could be relied on by the defence.

 

    The
question, then, is whether, in light of ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , it is open to Parliament to create a
criminal offence precluding reliance on intoxication.  With respect to s. 11 (d), I
would have thought that the constitutionality of s. 234(1) , qualified as it is
by s. 237(1) , had been definitively accepted in this Court's decision in R. v.
Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3.  This leaves the question whether
s. 234(1)  violates s. 7 .  In my view, it does not.  First, I recall again that
a person can only come within the ambit of s. 234(1)  if his or her intoxication
is voluntary; see R. v. Toews, supra, at p.
124.  It follows that s. 234(1)  will only be applied where the assumption of
the care or control of a vehicle while impaired can truly be said to be the
responsibility of the accused in an ultimate sense, even if there is a question
as to whether he or she was capable, because of intoxication, of forming the
requisite intent as of the moment when care or control was actually assumed. 
This assuages much of the concern I might otherwise have had as to whether a
conviction under s. 234(1)  violated some principle of ""fundamental
justice"".  The offence, as my colleague McLachlin J. notes, is in a sense
directed to control drunkenness in a dangerous setting.

 

    Secondly,
it will seldom be the case that a person who has the care or control of a motor
vehicle will be found to be so intoxicated as to have been incapable of
satisfying the very low mens rea requirement of s. 234(1) (see R. v.
Whyte, supra, at pp. 22-27).  A very low mental
element requirement is necessary if Parliament is to be able to create any
effective offences in respect of driving while under the influence of alcohol
or drugs.  And since, as my colleagues have demonstrated, it is obviously in
the public interest that Parliament does create such offences, I find little
difficulty in concluding that s. 234(1) is consistent with the ""principles
of fundamental justice"".  I would in this regard refer to what has been
said in other cases respecting the need to recognize that the ""principles
of fundamental justice"" encompass the public's interest, as represented by
the state, as well as the interests of the accused; see R. v.
Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at pp. 327 and 329; R. v.
Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, at pp. 403-5; my reasons in R. v.
Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at p. 745 (dissenting on another
point); see also R. v. Jones, [1986] 2 S.C.R.
284, at p. 304, per La Forest J. (Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. concurring),
and my reasons in Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of
Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 425, at p. 539.

 

    Interpreting
the provision as I do, I am of the view that s. 234(1) does not violate s. 7  or
s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  It thus becomes
unnecessary to consider s. 1  of the Charter .

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

    The
reasons of Sopinka, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

    MCLACHLIN J. -- 
This case raises the question of the constitutionality of s. 234 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.   Unlike my colleague, Lamer
C.J., whose reasons I have had the opportunity of reading, I am of the view
that s. 234 of the Code does not violate ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

The
Issues

 

    The
police testified that the accused was observed at the wheel of a motor vehicle
which, while apparently under his control, backed up a short distance.  The
accused was inebriated at the time.  The accused testified that he was so drunk
he could recall nothing of the evening's events.  The question is whether his
drunkenness can serve as a defence to a charge under s. 234(1)  of the Criminal
Code  that he had ""care or control"" of a motor
vehicle while impaired.

 

    Crown
counsel argued that drunkenness could not serve as a defence because of the
presumption created by s. 237(1)(a) of the Code.  I
cannot accept this submission in view of the fact that the Crown chose not to
assert this presumption at trial, but rather chose to rely exclusively on
evidence that the accused had exercised care or control under s. 234(1)(a) of the Code.  To
allow the Crown to assert the presumption on appeal would result in the accused
being deprived of the opportunity to make the full answer and defence that
could have been made if it had been raised at trial.  Intention to set the
vehicle in motion is relevant to s. 237(1)(a); it is
not relevant to s. 234(1) :  R. v. Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
3; R. v. Toews, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 119; and Ford v. The Queen, [1982]
1 S.C.R. 231.  Had s. 237(1)(a) been raised at
trial by the Crown, the accused might have chosen to adduce evidence on the
absence of intention to set the vehicle in motion.  It follows that to allow
the Crown to assert the applicability of s. 237(1)(a) for
the first time during an appeal would violate the accused's s. 7  right to
a fair trial and to make a full answer and defence. 

 

    This
leaves the argument on s. 234(l).  The appellant's argument has two prongs. 
First, it is suggested that the offence of having care or control of a motor
vehicle while in an inebriated condition is a specific intent offence, to which
the defence of drunkenness would be available.  Alternatively, the appellant
submits that if the offence is one of general intent, to which the defence of
drunkenness is not available, this violates ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  and is
not saved by s. 1 .

 

    In
view of my conclusion on the second issue, it is unnecessary to consider the
first, although if it were, I would agree with Lamer C.J. that the offence
would be one of general intent.

 

Short
Answer

 

    It
is my conclusion that Parliament has stipulated that intoxication cannot be a
defence to a charge under s. 234(1) of the Code,
rendering irrelevant the general intent - specific intent issue.  This
exclusion of intoxication as a defence does not, however, constitute a
limitation on the right of the accused to make full answer and defence under
ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter , since the mens rea of the
offence lies not in the intention to assume care or control of a motor vehicle,
but in voluntarily becoming intoxicated.

 

Analysis

 

Whether the Exclusion of Consideration of Intoxication on the Issue of
the Mental Element of a Crime Offends ss. 7 or 11(d) of the Charter?

 

    (a) 
The Relevant Charter Provisions

 

    This
case raises the question of the relationship of ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter . 
Section 7  provides that a person shall not be deprived of life, liberty or
security of the person except in accordance with the ""principles of
fundamental justice"".  These ""principles"" include the
requirement that a guilty mind be proven as an essential element of the
offence:  Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
486.  Section 11 (d) presumes an accused to be innocent ""until proven
guilty according to law"", thereby requiring the trier of fact to be
satisfied as to the existence of all of the essential elements of the offence. 
These essential elements include not only those set out by the Legislature in
the provision creating the offence but also those required by s. 7  of the Charter :  R. v.
Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636.  The argument that convictions
should not be possible where there is doubt as to the mental element of an
offence can be cast under both ss. 7  and 11 (d).  This
conjunction is not remarkable, given the close relationship between the broad
guarantees in s. 7  and the more specific guarantees which follow it:  Re B.C.
Motor Vehicle Act, supra.

 

    There
is no doubt that the charge puts in question the accused's liberty and security
of person.  The real question is whether the unavailability of the defence of
drunkenness deprives the accused of ""liberty and security of the
person"" in a way which violates ""the principles of fundamental
justice"", and hence violates the presumption of innocence.

 

    (b) 
Definition of the Problem

 

    The
fundamental principle raised by my colleague, Lamer C.J., is the right of a
person not to be convicted for a crime unless he or she intended to commit the
crime.  This principle is one of long‑standing; it has long been
recognized that it would be contrary to justice to convict an individual of a
criminal offence in the absence of proof of the element of mens rea. 
Recognition of this principle was the basis of this Court's decision in Vaillancourt, supra.

 

    Lamer
C.J. sees the issue in this case as a conflict between the fundamental
principle that one cannot be convicted of a crime without a guilty mind, and
the judge‑made rule that voluntary intoxication which may

in fact
affect that guilty mind, can be considered only in crimes of ""specific
intent"".

 

    I
view the issue differently.  As I see it, this case does not raise the
constitutionality of the judge‑made rule making evidence of impairment
irrelevant on offences of ""general intent"".  Rather, the only
question before the Court is the constitutionality of s. 234(1)  of the Criminal
Code  ‑‑ the offence commonly referred to as
impaired driving.  I read this section as excluding the defence of impairment. 
The judge‑made ""general intent"" rule never comes into play
because Parliament has enacted its own specific rule on the availability of the
defence of impairment ‑‑ a rule limited to impaired driving. 
Therefore, as I view the case, the only question is whether Parliament's
legislative exclusion of impairment as a defence in the case of impaired
driving violates the Charter .

 

    My
conclusion that Parliament has specified that impairment cannot be raised as a
defence in the case of impaired driving is based on my understanding of the
offence defined by s. 234(1)  of the Criminal Code .

 

    The
argument can be summarized as follows:  s. 234(1)  makes it an offence to drive
or to assume care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or a
drug.  Impairment being an essential element of the crime, it is illogical and
contradictory to suppose that Parliament intended that its express aim of
making such impairment criminal should be

defeated
by an unexpressed implication of law that the same impairment may provide an
effective defence.

 

    Our
criminal law is founded on the concept that the Crown must prove all elements
of an offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  The accused, while he or she need
prove nothing, may raise defences ‑‑ circumstances which whether
proved by the Crown or by the accused, cast a reasonable doubt on whether the
offence is established.  The essence of a defence such as that raised in this
case is that it negatives an element of the offence.  It says that what is
required to prove the offence has not been established.  Because a defence is
the obverse or negative of an aspect of the offence, it is impossible to speak
of a defence which also constitutes an element of the offence.  To do so is to
posit an inherently contradictory offence and to grossly distort what is meant
by ""offence"" and ""defence"" in criminal law.

 

    The
offence of impaired driving or impaired care or control of a motor vehicle
postulates impairment as one of its essential elements.  The Crown must prove
impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is illogical to suppose that the same
impairment which constitutes an essential element of the offence can serve as a
defence.  Parliament has said that it is a crime to be impaired and drive or
assume care or control of a motor vehicle.  How can Parliament be taken to have
said in the same metaphorical breath that it may not be a crime (the effect of
the defence) to drive or assume care or control of a motor vehicle, by reason
of the fact that one is impaired?  Where impairment is not an essential element
of an offence, there is no contradiction involved in saying that the intent
necessary for criminal culpability may not have been established beyond a
reasonable doubt because of impairment.  Where, on the other hand, Parliament
has posited impairment as an essential element of the offence, it must be taken
to have eliminated the availability of a defence of lack of intent based on the
same impairment which it has made culpable.

 

    Failure
to recognize the inherent contradiction involved in the proposition that an
essential element of an offence may also be a defence leads to absurdity.  It
leads, for example, to the conclusion that the more impaired a person is, the
more likely he or she is to be acquitted of the offence of impaired driving. 
That a person should be too impaired to be convicted of impaired driving
strikes most people as ridiculous.  It represents, in short, a contradiction in
terms.

 

    Failure
to recognize the inherent contradiction involved in saying that a central
element of an offence may also serve as a defence also contradicts our
fundamental notions of the nature of a criminal trial.  It puts the Crown in
the position of proving both the offence and the defence.  On the other side of
the contest, it involves contradictory defences.  Lack of impairment is clearly
a defence, but so too is impairment.

 

    I
conclude that to posit a defence of impairment to a charge under s. 234 (l)
of the Criminal Code  is to posit an internally and impossibly inconsistent
offence of a sort not known to criminal law.  Parliament not having indicated
such a defence is available, it must be taken as having ruled it out since it
cannot logically co‑exist with the offence.  As Dickson C.J. stated
in R. v. Whyte, supra, at p. 22:  ""The very fact that
consumption of alcohol is an element of these offences renders problematic the
element of intention.""  In view of this observation, it is not surprising
that in R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, Dickson C.J. (dissenting) explicitly
excluded offences of which intoxication was an element from his reasons holding
unconstitutional the common law rule prohibiting consideration of impairment
except on offences of specific intent.

 

    My
aim to this point has been to define the offence of impaired driving or care or
control of a motor vehicle as I think Parliament must have intended it to be
defined, to the end of showing that the issue in this case is not the general
one of the constitutionality of the elimination of the defence of impairment
from all crimes save those of specific intent, but rather the
constitutionality of Parliament legislatively precluding a defence of
impairment in the case of a crime which posits impairment as one of its
essential elements.  The question is whether the creation of such an
offence violates the Charter  because, by its very nature, it
precludes the defence of impairment and thus may permit conviction where there
is a reasonable doubt as to an accused's intention to drive or assume care or
control.

 

    The
problem of the intoxicated offender, viewed generally, involves two opposing
values, both of which have been recognized by our system of justice ‑‑
the right not to be convicted absent proof of intention to commit the crime,
and the public interest in not excusing persons who commit crimes by reason of
voluntary drunkenness from the criminal consequences of their acts.  In
enacting s. 234(1) of the Code, Parliament has made impairment
itself an element of the offence notwithstanding the possible absence of
criminal intent, thus giving paramountcy to the public interest.

 

    There
are three possible legal solutions to the problem of the intoxicated offender: 
see C. N. Mitchell, ""The Intoxicated Offender ‑‑ Refuting
the Legal and Medical Myths"" (1988), 11 Int. J.L. Psychiatry 77, at
pp. 77‑78.  The first is the approach presently employed in Canada,
England and the United States under which the law denies, in whole or in part,
a mitigating role to intoxication even if the mental element of an offence may
be absent because of voluntary alcohol or drug use.

 

    The
second avenue is to permit evidence of intoxication to be weighed with other
evidence in determining whether the intoxication actually eliminated or
compromised the required mental element. This is the approach which has been
adopted in Australia and New Zealand and advocated in this Court in dissent by
Dickson J. in Leary v. The Queen, [1978]
1 S.C.R. 29, and by Dickson C.J., Lamer J. and La Forest J. in Bernard,
supra.

 

    The
third alternative referred to in the literature is legislative.  It is often
seen as involving enactment of legislation to permit consideration of
intoxication on the issue of criminal intent, while creating a new offence in
the nature of ""dangerous intoxication"".  In England this approach was
recommended in the Butler Report, the Report of the
Committee on Mentally Abnormal Offenders (Cmnd 6244
(1975)), and by Professors Glanville Williams and J. C. Smith in their minority
recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee Fourteenth Report:
Offences against the Person (Cmnd 7844 (1980)).  An offence of this type has been
in force for many years in s. 323(a)(i) of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch):  see
J. Herrmann, ""Causing the Conditions of One's Own Defense:  The Multifaceted
Approach of German Law,"" [1986] B.Y.U. L. Rev. 747. 
In the common law jurisdiction of Bophuthatswana the Criminal Law
Amendment Act 14 of 1984 in s. 1 , discussed in A. St. Q. Skeen,
""Intoxication is No Longer a Complete Defence in Bophuthatswana:  Will
South Africa Follow Suit"" (1984), 101 S.A.L.J. 707,
followed the German provision fairly closely and by enacting the Criminal
Law Amendment Act 1 of 1988 the South African legislature followed suit four years
later:  see A. Paizes, ""Intoxication Through the Looking-Glass""
(1988), 105 S.A.L.J. 776.

 

    A
number of proposals for reform have suggested that Canada should employ a
dangerous intoxication offence to resolve the anomalies which exist in the
present approach to the use of drunkenness as a defence:  see P. B. Schabas,
""Intoxication and Culpability:  Towards an Offence of Criminal
Intoxication"" (1984), 42 U.T. Fac. L. Rev. 147,
T. Quigley, ""Reform of the Intoxication Defence"" (1987), 33 McGill
L.J. 1.

 

    In
the case at bar, we are concerned with a legislative attempt to deal with a
specific form of dangerous impairment.  Because Parliament has acted, options
one and two are not available.  The legislative treatment is confined to the
offence of impaired driving, and it does not posit recklessness as an element. 
Nevertheless, within the limited scope of the provision, s. 234  may be viewed
as an attempt by Parliament to create a type of ""drunk and dangerous""
offence somewhat akin to that proposed by the third option.  The next question is
whether this attempt runs afoul of ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

    (c) 
Are ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter 
Violated?

 

    If
the mental element of an offence is compatible with the unavailability of the
defence of impairment, then the absence of that defence constitutes no
violation of the Charter .  On the other hand, if the mental
element of the offence is one to which the defence of impairment might be
relevant, the absence of that defence will constitute a violation of the Charter .  The
question is which of these two categories s. 234(1)  falls into.

 

    In R. v. King, [1962]
S.C.R. 746, it was held that the mental element involved in the offence of
impaired driving was voluntary intoxication.   It was this that provided the
guilty mind fundamental to the offence.   On this view, the unavailability of
drunkenness as a defence cannot constitute a violation of the accused's right
to make full answer and defence.   Even if the accused is too drunk to know
that he or she is assuming care and control of the motor vehicle, that does not
matter, since the mental element of the offence lies in voluntarily becoming
intoxicated.  This interpretation recognizes that intoxication is excluded as a
defence to impaired driving since it is the very gravamen of the offence.

 

    It
is argued, however, that this state of the law was changed by this Court's
decision in Toews, supra.   I cannot accept
that submission.   Toews did not hold that voluntary
intoxication might serve as a defence to the offence of impaired driving.   Toews held
only that in circumstances where an accused was found sleeping in a sleeping
bag on the front seat of the vehicle with his head on the passenger side of the
vehicle, ""[i]t has not been shown ... that the [accused] performed any
acts of care or control and he has therefore not performed the actus
reus"" (p. 127).   The facts of Toews require
no broader interpretation than this and logic, in my view, precludes it, given
that impairment is a specific element of the offence of s. 234  of the Criminal
Code .    I cannot conclude that the Court in Toews
intended to alter the long-standing principle that the mental element of the
offence of s. 234 of the Code lies in voluntarily becoming
intoxicated -- not in the knowing assumption of care and control of a motor
vehicle which is capable of being negated by the very impairment which is the
gravamen of the offence.

 

    For
these reasons I conclude that the accused's rights under ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  were
not infringed.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

    Constitutional
law -- Charter of Rights  -- Right of Canadian citizen to remain in Canada --
Extradition -- Conspiracy to import drugs into U.S.A. from Canada -- Actions of
accused taking place in Canada -- Offence existing under both U.S. law and
Canadian law -- Whether or not extradition of Canadian citizen under these
circumstances an infringement of citizen's right to remain in Canada -- If so,
whether or not extradition justifiable under s. 1 of the Charter --
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , ss. 1 , 6(1) .

 

    Extradition
-- Canadian citizens involved in conspiracy to import drugs into U.S.A. from
Canada -- Actions of accused taking place in Canada ‑‑ Offence
existing under both U.S. law and Canadian law -- Whether or not extradition of
Canadian citizen under these circumstances an infringement of citizen's right
to remain in Canada -- If so, whether or not extradition justifiable under
s. 1 of the Charter.

 

    Appellants
are Canadian citizens who were arrested in Canada for separate offences
pursuant to warrants issued under the Extradition Act  and the
Extradition Treaty between Canada and the United States.  Both were alleged to
have participated in a conspiracy to import and distribute heroin in the United
States; El Zein was also alleged to have imported heroin into the United
States.  The appellants' actions which related to the alleged offences took
place when they were in Canada and appellants could have been tried under
Canadian law.  The United States sought extradition, committal for extradition
was ordered in each case and applications for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid
were dismissed.  The Quebec Court of Appeal quashed the committals.  The
constitutional questions before this Court queried (1) whether the surrender of
a Canadian citizen to a foreign state constituted an infringement of the
s. 6(1)  Charter  right to remain in Canada and, (2) if
so, whether surrender here constituted a reasonable limit on that right under
s. 1 .

 

    Held (Wilson
and Sopinka JJ. dissenting):  The appeals should be allowed; both
constitutional questions should be answered in the affirmative.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and Cory JJ.:  The
extradition of a Canadian citizen prima facie infringes the
citizen's right to remain in Canada as guaranteed by s. 6(1)  of the Charter  -- a
right to be interfered with only if justified as being required to meet a
reasonable state purpose.  This Charter right would have
been drafted differently if it were to include only protection from expulsion
and banishment or exile.  Its central thrust, nevertheless, is against exile
and banishment for the purpose of excluding membership in the national
community.  Extradition is not directed to that purpose and lies at the outer
edges of the core values being protected by the provision.

 

    The
objectives underlying extradition are pressing and substantial and are
sufficiently important to make it a reasonable limit -- within the meaning of
s. 1 and assuming the other requirements of s. 1 are met -- to the Charter  right
set out in s. 6(1) .  The investigation, prosecution and suppression of
crime for the protection of the citizen and the maintenance of peace and public
order is an important goal of all organized societies.  The pursuit of that
goal cannot realistically be confined within national boundaries.  The
objectives of extradition go beyond that of suppressing crime,
simpliciter, and include bringing fugitives to justice for the
proper determination of their guilt or innocence in a proper hearing.

 

    An
extradition may be rationally connected to the objectives underlying
extradition notwithstanding the fact that Canada has sufficient interest to
prosecute for the same acts.  It is often better that a crime be prosecuted
where its harmful impact is felt and where the witnesses and the persons most
interested in bringing the criminal to justice reside.

 

    The Oakes test
should not be applied in an overly rigid and mechanistic fashion:  the language
of the Charter  invites a measure of flexibility.  While the rights
guaranteed by the Charter  must be given priority in the
equation, the underlying values must be sensitively weighed in a particular
context against other values of a free and democratic society sought to be
achieved by the legislature.

 

    Extradition
impairs the right under s. 6(1)  as little as is reasonably possible. 
Extradition practices have been tailored as much as possible for the protection
of the liberty of the individual and accord the same kinds of rights (though in
a necessarily attenuated form) as are afforded to an accused under ss. 7 
and 11  of the Charter .  The important and substantial
objectives which underlie extradition and which are essential to the
maintenance of a free and democratic society warrant this somewhat peripheral Charter 
infringement.

 

    In
the case at bar, respondents were physically present in Canada when they
allegedly participated in the transactions in respect of which they stand
charged.  These alleged transactions, however, were of a transnational nature. 
While continued physical presence in Canada may be relevant under ss. 1 
and 6  of the Charter , the locus of wrongdoing is not.  The
right to remain in Canada, furthermore, is not more affected by the alleged
crime's being committed outside Canada as opposed to inside Canada.

 

    A
general exception for a Canadian citizen who could be charged in Canada would
unduly interfere with the objectives of extradition.  Considerations relating
to effective prosecution, the availability of evidence, initiative for
investigation and to the impossibly difficult task of determining the country
best suited to try the case by judicial examination, go beyond mere
administrative convenience and touch the very purpose underlying extradition. 
In particular, the interests of society in bringing a fugitive to justice at a
trial where his or her guilt or innocence can be properly determined would be
seriously impaired.  Such an approach, moreover, would weaken the system
generally, and so the objectives it serves, by sapping the trust and good faith
that must exist between nations and their officials and law enforcement
agencies at many levels.

 

    Justification
for the limitation of the right under s. 1  is not vitiated by the fact
that the question of whether or not extradition will take place is left to the
discretion of the Attorney General of Canada or of a province.  The principal
discretion involved is whether or not to prosecute and the reasons justifying
that discretion underlie the discretion of deciding whether or not a Canadian
should be prosecuted in Canada or abroad.  In exercising this discretion, a
citizen's s. 6(1)  rights must be given due weight.  In practice, the decision
whether to prosecute or not to prosecute in this country and allow the
authorities in another country to seek extradition, is made following
consultations between the appropriate authorities in the two countries when
various factors, including nationality, are considered in weighing the
interests of the two countries in the prosecution.

 

    The
executive discretion to surrender was of little relevance here.

 

    Per Wilson
J. (dissenting):  Section 6(1)  of the Charter  was
designed to protect the right of a Canadian citizen to choose of his own
volition to enter, remain in or leave Canada.  The language of s. 6(1)  is clear
and unambiguous.  Had it been the intention that s. 6(1)  address only a
citizen's right not to be exiled or banished, the section would have been
framed in more specific terms.

 

    The
locus of the wrongdoing is very relevant in any attempt to justify extradition
as a reasonable limit on a Canadian citizen's right to remain in Canada.  It is
often the key factor connecting the accused to the requesting state.  The right
of a citizen to remain in Canada need not be violated when the crime has been
committed by a Canadian in Canada and is punishable by Canadian law.  He can be
brought to justice right here.  It is otherwise when the crime has been
committed in the requesting state.  The argument for extradition being a
reasonable limit under s. 1  is clearly much stronger in the latter case.  More
persuasive reasons than convenience of prosecution are required to justify the
violation of a right expressly guaranteed to Canadian citizens in the Charter .  This Charter right
is not a trivial one nor can its breach be viewed as peripheral.

 

    The
executive branch of government in exercising its discretionary powers as to
whether or not to extradite or whether or not to prosecute is bound by the Charter .  It
has no discretion as to whether or not it will respect guaranteed rights.  Its
discretion is limited by the Charter  and not vice versa.

 

    The
control of trans‑border crime is of sufficiently pressing and substantial
concern to warrant a legislative limit on the citizen's right to remain in
Canada.  The proportionality test, however, was not met.  Extradition, while it
may be rationally connected in general to the objective of controlling trans‑border
crime, does not impair the s. 6(1)  right ""as little as possible""
on the particular facts of these appeals.  The objective could have been
achieved by prosecuting respondents in Canada and so have avoided a
contravention of s. 6(1)  of the Charter 
entirely.  A flexible approach might be taken with respect to proportionality
in some cases but careful scrutiny of a legislative scheme should not be
abandoned where that scheme directly abridges a guaranteed right, particularly
in relation to an aspect of the criminal law.

 

    The
comity of nations fostered by extradition would not be adversely affected if
extradition were to be denied in cases such as the present.

 

    Per Sopinka
J. (dissenting):  For the reasons given by Wilson J., extradition of a citizen
who can be tried in Canada is not a reasonable limit and extradition in this
case would constitute a breach of s. 6(1)  which has not been justified
under s. 1  of the Charter .  The implications arising from the
majority decision, however, need be expressed.

 

    The
infringement of s. 6(1)  of the Charter  resulting from
extradition is not peripheral:  countries to which a Canadian can be extradited
do not recognize the presumption of innocence or the right to remain silent; do
not permit bail; have no independent bar; and still retain the death penalty
for a number of offences.  Any enforceable rules of law designed to protect the
citizen make no distinction as to the nature of the requesting state.  Further,
little protection can be afforded by matters considered at the time of treaty
negotiations because many of the treaties are old and the political and legal
nature of many states has drastically changed in the interim.

 

    The
practice that the decision to extradite is made after consultations between the
authorities of Canada and the requesting state is only a practice and is not
reviewable unless a discretion was exercised for an improper or arbitrary
motive.  It is neither ""a limit prescribed by law"" nor crafted to
lessen the impact of a breach of s. 6(1)  and so cannot justify that breach.

 

    A
decision to prosecute in Canada will not protect the citizen against
extradition unless the treaty confers a discretion in Canada not to extradite
its own citizens.  This discretion is a political matter.  Accordingly, whether
a decision to prosecute will avail will depend on the general policy of the
Canadian government.  This policy is not expressed in any instrument having the
force of law.

 

    A
law cannot be salvaged by relying on the discretion of the prosecutor not to
apply the law where it would result in a violation of the Charter .  Such
discretion is not circumscribed by guidelines enforceable at law.

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and Cory JJ.
was delivered by

 

    LA FOREST J. --
The principal issues in each of these appeals are set forth in the
constitutional questions as follows:

 

    1.Does the surrender of a Canadian citizen to a
foreign state constitute an infringement of his right to remain in Canada as
set out in s. 6(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

    2.If
the surrender of such citizen constitutes a prima facie
infringement of his right to remain in Canada, does the surrender of respondent
in the circumstances of this case constitute a reasonable limit under s. 1  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Background

 

    Mr.
Cotroni, a Canadian citizen, was arrested in Canada on August 30, 1983,
pursuant to a warrant issued under the authority of the
Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21, and the Extradition Treaty
between Canada and the United States, CTS 1976.  The United States requested
the extradition of Mr. Cotroni on a charge in that country of conspiracy to
possess and distribute heroin.  All his actions relating to the alleged
conspiracy took place while he was in Canada.

 

    In
brief, the conspiracy alleged involved the importation and sale of the drug to
alleged accomplices of Cotroni in the United States.  Delivery of the drug and
payment would appear to have taken place in Canada, although most of the
prosecution witnesses and the documentary evidence are in the United States. 
The accused's personal involvement was effectively confined to giving
instructions to his accomplices in the United States and one in Canada by
telephone in Montréal.

 

    The
extradition judge, Phelan J., ordered the committal of the accused for
surrender.  Cotroni then applied for the issue of a writ of habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid before Mackay J., but this
application was dismissed.

 

    Cotroni
then appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec on a variety of grounds, most of
which are irrelevant to this appeal; see (1986), 2 Q.A.C. 280.  All but one of
these were dismissed.  However, the court (Bisson, Jacques and LeBel JJ.A.)
allowed the appeal and quashed the order of committal on the ground that the
extradition of Cotroni infringed s. 6(1)  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and was not, in the particular circumstances of the
case, justifiable as a reasonable limit under s. 1 .

 

    LeBel
J.A. (with whom Bisson J.A. concurred) noted that Cotroni could be prosecuted
in Canada as well as in the United States, and that the most important elements
of the crime had taken place in Canada.  Consistent with that court's earlier
judgment in the El Zein case, he concluded that extradition
under these circumstances did not meet the test set forth by this Court in R. v.
Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103.  While the objectives sought by
extradition, the maintenance of law and order and the suppression of crime on
the international level in accordance with Canada's international obligations,
were sufficient to warrant interference with a Charter  right,
these objectives could be met without infringing the right guaranteed by s.
6(1) .  Cotroni could be prosecuted in this country, so his extradition would be
unreasonable and disproportionate.  Jacques J.A., who had delivered the opinion
of the court in El Zein, expressed similar views.

 

    The
facts of the El Zein appeal are rather similar and raise
the same constitutional issues.  On March 16, 1984, Mr. El Zein, a Canadian
citizen, met two individuals in Montréal and gave them a package containing 700
grams of heroin.  The two individuals were later arrested by the American
customs authorities at the Champlain, New York border crossing, and the 700
grams of heroin were seized.

 

    On
December 17, 1984, Mr. El Zein was arrested under a warrant issued pursuant to
the Extradition Act  and the Extradition Treaty between Canada and the
United States.  The United States requested his extradition for importation of
heroin, conspiracy to import and conspiracy to traffic.  As in the Cotroni case,
all of El Zein's personal involvement concerning the alleged offences took
place in Canada.

 

    Following
the extradition hearing, El Zein was committed for surrender by Downs J. of the
Quebec Superior Court.  An application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid
was dismissed by Phelan J., but on appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal (1986),
29 C.C.C. (3d) 560, (Bisson, Jacques and LeBel JJ.A.) this decision was
reversed and the appellant was released.

 

    Jacques
J.A., who gave the principal judgment, held that the extradition of a Canadian
citizen for a crime under a foreign law does not constitute a reasonable limit
to the right of a citizen to remain in Canada where the facts on which the
charge is based occurred in Canada and constitute a crime here.  In his view,
extradition under these circumstances did not meet either the test of
rationality or minimum impairment set forth in R. v. Oakes, supra.  The
objective sought -‑ the suppression of crime -‑ could be achieved
in this case by prosecuting the respondent in Canada where, for all practical
purposes, the act charged occurred.

 

    Leave
to appeal to this Court from both decisions was then sought and granted.

 

Section
6(1)  of the Charter 

 

    Section
6(1)  of the Charter  provides that ""Every citizen of
Canada has the right to . . . remain in . . . Canada"".  The courts below
held that extraditing a Canadian citizen constitutes an infringement of this
right by forcing a citizen to leave Canada, and justification for extradition,
therefore, had to be sought under s. 1 .  This had, in effect, been conceded by
counsel for the United States.

 

    In
this Court, however, counsel argued for a flexible, purposive approach which,
he maintained, should lead to the conclusion that s. 6(1)  would only apply when
a Canadian citizen is threatened with exile, banishment or expulsion.  Section
6(1)  should not apply, the argument continues, unless governmental action
arbitrarily or totally deprives a citizen of his or her right to remain in Canada. 
Extradition is not aimed at the deprivation of the right; it is temporary in
nature and does not affect citizenship.  It has existed in this country for
over a hundred years.

 

    In
support of this proposition, counsel cited an extract from Hansard of a committee
hearing in which the Deputy Minister of Justice and an opposition member
indicated their view that the right under s. 6(1)  was not absolute and did not
protect against extradition.  The extract (Debates of the House
of Commons, January 1981, 46:118) reads:

 

    Mr. Tassé:  Perhaps I might
mention that we do not see Clause 6 as being an absolute right:  I will give
you an example of a situation where a citizen would, in effect, lose his right
to remain in the country:  that would be by virtue of an order under the
Extradition Act :  if someone committed an offence in another country and he is
sought in this country, he could be surrendered to the other country.

 

    The same thing would apply in the case of countries
belonging to the Commonwealth to which the Extradition Act  does not apply, but
the Fugitive Offenders Act does apply.  In that situation a Canadian would not
have the right to remain in the country by virtue of the offences he might have
committed in another country and for which he is sought so that justice could
be applied.

 

    Mr.
Epp:  Mr. Tassé, I do not think that is really what we are dealing with. 
That is not arbitrary and under the Extradition Act  there is a process to which
the person is entitled before that extradition order can in fact be finalized.

 

    The
committee debates are certainly of interest, but as the Court observed in Re B.C.
Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at pp. 508-9, they can only be
accorded minimal weight in interpreting the Charter .  In
fact, whatever weight one accords to the statements here, they give no
enlightenment on whether the right itself should be restricted or whether
extradition should be dealt with as a reasonable limitation to that right under
s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    In
approaching the matter, I begin by observing that a Constitution must be
approached from a broad perspective.  In particular, this Court has on several
occasions underlined that the rights under the Charter  must be
interpreted generously so as to fulfill its purpose of securing for the
individual the full benefit of the Charter 's protection (see
the remarks of Dickson C.J. in Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984]
2 S.C.R. 145, at pp. 155-56; R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R.
295, at p. 344).  The intimate relation between a citizen and his country
invites this approach in this context.  The right to remain in one's country is
of such a character that if it is to be interfered with, such interference must
be justified as being required to meet a reasonable state purpose.

 

    This
is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the words ""right to . . .
remain in . . . Canada"".  Section 6(1)  is phrased in broad terms.  It does
not state that a citizen has the right not to be arbitrarily expelled from
Canada; it instead guarantees the right to remain in Canada.  Had the intention
of the Charter  been solely to protect a person from being expelled,
banished or exiled, it could have been so framed.

 

    This
approach is fortified by the fact that in enacting this clause several familiar
models appear to have been ignored.  The Canadian Bill of
Rights, R.S.C. 1970, App. III, for example, more narrowly
protects a person from exile (s. 2(a)), and the European
Convention on Human Rights, 4th Protocol, Article 3, paragraph 1, states that a
national shall not be ""expelled"".  The Explanatory Reports
on the Second to Fifth Protocols to the European Convention for the Protection
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1971) explains
that ""It was understood that extradition was outside the scope of this
paragraph.""  This approach is consistent with the International Covenant
on Political Rights, Article 12, which contains no right to remain in one's own
country, although it contains all the other rights listed in ss. 6(1)  and 6(2) (a) of the Charter .  A
similar approach was adopted in Articles 2 and 3 of the Fourth Protocol to the
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  In the
light of these precedents, one would have thought these more specific words would
have been used rather than according a general right to remain in Canada if a
completely restricted right had been intended.  I, therefore, conclude that
extradition prima facie infringes upon the
right guaranteed by s. 6(1)  of the Charter .

 

    That
having been said, it seems to me that these precedents also reveal that the
infringement to s. 6(1)  that results from extradition lies at the outer edges
of the core values sought to be protected by that provision.  European
authorities especially make a sharp distinction between expulsion and
extradition; see Brickman v. Federal Republic of Germany, App.
1, No. 6242/73, C.D. 46, at pp. 202 and 210; P. Van Dijk and G. J. H. Van Hoof, Theory and
Practice of the European Convention on Human Rights (1984), at p.
368.  Like the international and constitutional documents I have referred to,
the central thrust of s. 6(1)  is against exile and banishment, the purpose of
which is the exclusion of membership in the national community.  While I would
not wish to trivialize the effects of extradition on the individual, it is
clear that extradition is not directed to the purpose.  The words of Griffiths
L.J. in contrasting extradition and deportation in R. v. Governor of
Pentonville Prison, ex parte Budlong, [1980] 1 All E.R.
701, are relevant here.  He said at p. 716:

 

I regard extradition as far more closely analogous to
the implementation of domestic criminal law than to deportation.  It is in no
true sense a banishment from our shores as is deportation . . . .

 

    An
accused may return to Canada following his trial and acquittal or, if he has
been convicted, after he has served his sentence.  The impact of extradition on
the rights of a citizen to remain in Canada appears to me to be of secondary
importance.  In fact, so far as Canada and the United States are concerned, a
person convicted may, in some cases, be permitted to serve his sentence in
Canada; see Transfer of Offenders Act, S.C. 1977-78, c.
9.

 

    What
is more, as I will attempt to demonstrate, extradition serves to promote a
number of values that are central to a free and democratic society.  These are
considerations, however, that are relevant to the question whether and to what
extent the Extradition Act  and the treaty it
implements can be saved under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Before
considering s. 1 , however, I should point out that the conclusion that
extradition infringes upon s. 6(1)  of the Charter  is in
accord with previous judicial authorities.  In Re Federal Republic
of Germany and Rauca (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 385, the Ontario Court of Appeal
held that extradition prima facie violates a
citizen's right to remain in Canada as guaranteed by s. 6(1)  of the Charter .  The
court went on, however, to find that it was a reasonable limit under s. 1 .  In Canada v.
Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, this Court, though in obiter,
endorsed the approach taken in Rauca, supra, in the
following passage at p. 520:

 

    As
will be evident from what I have already said, I am far from thinking that the Charter  has no
application to extradition.  The surrender of a person to a foreign country may
obviously affect a number of Charter  rights.  In Rauca, supra, for
example, the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized that extradition intruded on a
citizen's right under s. 6  to remain in Canada, although it also found that the
beneficial aspects of the procedure in preventing malefactors from evading
justice, a procedure widely adopted all over the world, were sufficient to
sustain it as a reasonable limit under s. 1  of the Charter . 
Section 6  was not raised in this case, though Schmidt is a Canadian citizen, no
doubt because her counsel believed, as I do, that it was properly disposed of
in the Rauca case.

 

    I
turn, then, to examine whether the assumption made in  Canada v.
Schmidt that extradition can be justified under s. 1  of the Charter  can be
supported.

 

Section
1  of the Charter 

 

    Section
1  of the Charter  ""guarantees the rights and
freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law
as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society"".  As we
saw, it was held in Re Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca, supra, (a holding
approved, if obiter, by this Court in Canada v.
Schmidt, supra) that extradition in general
constitutes a reasonable limit within s. 1  to the right to remain in Canada set
out in s. 6(1)  of the Charter .  The court stated in Re Federal
Republic of Germany and Rauca, at p. 406:

 

When the rationale and
purpose of the Extradition Act  and treaty under
it are looked at (having in mind that crime should not go unpunished), Canada's
obligations to the international community considered and the history of such
legislation in free and democratic societies examined, in our view, the burden
of establishing that the limit imposed by the Extradition Act  and the
treaty on s. 6(1)  of the Charter  is a reasonable one demonstrably justified in
a free and democratic society has been discharged by the respondents.

 

The
court in that case was also of the view that even if the alleged crime could be
prosecuted in Canada, the extradition of the accused would still be a
reasonable limit on his right to remain in Canada.  It stated, at p. 405:

 

    Counsel
for the appellant suggested that there was a possibility that the appellant
could be prosecuted in Canada for the crimes with which he had been charged. If
there was this alternative, the argument was that extradition was not a reasonable
limit on the appellant's right as a citizen to remain in Canada.  This
submission was not pressed strongly and, like the Chief Justice of the High
Court, we are not persuaded that there is, at present, a right to prosecute the
appellant for the recited crimes in Canada.  Even if there were such a right to
prosecute, in light of the described purpose and reason for and lengthy history
of extradition, it would not turn a reasonable limit on the citizen's right to
remain in this country into an unreasonable limit.

 

The
appellant naturally relies on these authorities.

 

    Because
of these authorities, the respondent Cotroni tended to shy away from contesting
the general proposition that extradition constituted a reasonable limit on the
right to remain in Canada, but stressed instead that it was not a reasonable
limit under the circumstances of this case.  Nonetheless, the argument advanced
on behalf of the respondent El Zein that Canadian citizens should be tried in
Canada for crimes committed abroad rather than be subjected to extradition
really raises the general issue, and I shall therefore approach it frontally.

 

    It
is now well established that the onus of justifying a law creating a limitation
to a Charter  right lies with the party seeking to uphold that
limitation, here the appellant; see R. v. Oakes, supra, which
sets forth criteria for determining whether such a limitation is reasonable
within s. 1  of the Charter .  These criteria were recently
summarized by Dickson C.J. in R. v. Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
3, at p. 20, as follows:

 

There
are two major criteria.  First, the objective which the measure responsible for
the limit on a right or freedom is designed to serve must be sufficiently
important to permit overriding the constitutionally-protected right or freedom
(Oakes, supra, at p. 138).  Second, to show that
the measures are reasonable and demonstrably justified requires an analysis of
the proportionality of the measures (Oakes, supra, at p.
139).  There are three components to the proportionality test:  the measures
must be carefully designed to achieve the objective of the legislation, with a
rational connection to the objective.  The second component is that the measure
should impair the right or freedom as little as possible.  Finally, there must
be proportionality between the effects of the impugned measures on the
protected right and the attainment of the objective.

 

    No
one denies that the first criterion in R. v. Oakes, supra, is
satisfied in these cases.  The objectives sought by the legislation, the
parties agree, relate to concerns that are pressing and substantial.  The
investigation, prosecution and suppression of crime for the protection of the
citizen and the maintenance of peace and public order is an important goal of
all organized societies.  The pursuit of that goal cannot realistically be
confined within national boundaries.  That has long been the case, but it is
increasingly evident today.  Modern communications have shrunk the world and
made McLuhan's global village a reality.  The only respect paid by the
international criminal community to national boundaries is when these can serve
as a means to frustrate the efforts of law enforcement and judicial authorities. 
The trafficking in drugs, with which we are here concerned, is an international
enterprise and requires effective tools of international cooperation for its
investigation, prosecution and suppression.  Extradition is an important and
well-established tool for effecting this cooperation.

 

    The
importance of extradition for the protection of the Canadian public against
crime can scarcely be exaggerated.  To afford that protection, there must be
arrangements that ensure prosecution not only of those who commit crimes while
they are physically in Canada and escape abroad, but also of those whose acts
abroad have criminal effects in this country.  This requires reciprocal
arrangements with other states seeking similar objectives.  As I noted in Libman v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 178, at p. 212, it would be a sad
commentary on our law if it was limited to the prosecution of minor offenders
while permitting more seasoned criminals to operate on a world-wide scale.

 

    What
is more, I do not think that the free and democratic society that is Canada,
any more than any other modern society, should today confine itself to
parochial and nationalistic concepts of community.  Canadians today form part
of an emerging world community from which not only benefits but responsibilities
flow.  This is consistent with the approach taken by this Court in Libman v.
the Queen, supra, at p. 214, where after stating that
we should not be indifferent to the protection of the public in other
countries, I added, at p. 214:

 

In a
shrinking world, we are all our brother's keepers.  In the criminal arena this
is underlined by the international cooperative schemes that have been developed
among national law enforcement bodies.

 

In a
similar vein, Lord Salmon in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Doot, [1973]
A.C. 807, in a passage (at p. 834) cited with approval in Libman v.
The Queen, at pp. 197-98, stated:

 

    I do
not believe that any civilised country, even assuming that its own laws do not
recognize conspiracy as a criminal offence, could today have any reasonable
objection to its nationals being arrested, tried and convicted by English
courts in the circumstances to which I have referred.  Today, crime is an
international problem -‑ perhaps not least crimes connected with the
illicit drug traffic ‑- and there is a great deal of cooperation between
the nations to bring criminals to justice.  Great care also is taken by most
countries to do nothing which might help their own nationals to commit what
would be crimes in other countries:  see, for example, section 3(2) of the
Dangerous Drugs Act 1965.

 

As he
made clear elsewhere (at p. 831), the fact that the relevant ""crimes were
more likely to ruin young lives in the United States of America than in this
country . . ."" is not of any great moment.

 

    There
is another aspect respecting the objectives of extradition worth mentioning. 
As I earlier indicated, these objectives go beyond that of suppressing crime,
simpliciter, and include bringing fugitives to justice for the
proper determination of their guilt or innocence.  (Indeed most extradition
cases, like the case here, involve accused, rather than convicted persons.) 
Extradition thus shares one of the basic objectives of all criminal
prosecutions:  to discover the truth in respect of the charges brought against
the accused in a proper hearing.  This is one of the ""interests of
society"" referred to by Dickson C.J. in R. v. Oakes, which
must, under s. 1  of the Charter , be balanced against the interest of
the individual.

 

    These
various objectives are, in my view, sufficiently important to warrant the
existence of a reasonable limit to the Charter  right
set out in s. 6(1) , assuming such limit, here extradition, meets the other
relevant requirements for the application of s. 1 .

 

    Counsel
for the respondents argue, however, that the extradition of the respondents in
the circumstances of this case fails to meet the test of proportionality, the
second major criterion enunciated in R. v. Oakes.  To
begin with, they say, such a measure is not rationally connected with the
objectives sought to be attained.  The respondents are Canadians and, they add,
all their actions relating to the charges were committed in Canada (an
assertion, however, that must be tempered by what I shall have to say later). 
From this they conclude that, rationally, the offences should be prosecuted
here.

 

    I do
not doubt that Canada has a sufficient interest to warrant its prosecuting the
respondents.  The activities of which they are accused constitute serious
antisocial acts that would permit prosecution under several criminal
provisions.  But as is clear from Libman v. The Queen, supra, more
than one country may have jurisdiction to prosecute an accused for a crime. 
There are also sufficient links to the United States to warrant that country to
prosecute.  In fact, the injurious effects of the crime would be felt in that
country, for it is there that the illicit drugs would be distributed.  Nor is
that all.  It appears that in both cases most, if not all, of the evidence and
many of the witnesses are located in the United States.  As the appellants
point out, the discovery of the crimes, the police inquiries and the legal
proceedings relating to these cases all originated there.  Without the
intervention of the United States, the crimes might never have been discovered.

 

    I
see nothing irrational in surrendering criminals to another country, even when
they could be prosecuted for the same acts in Canada.  It is often better that
a crime be prosecuted where its harmful impact is felt and where the witnesses
and the persons most interested in bringing the criminal to justice reside, and
what I have said about where the witnesses and evidence are located certainly
makes it rational in the present case.

 

    The
more serious attack of the respondents is based on the second component of the
proportionality test.  In R. v. Oakes, supra,
Dickson C.J. observed that ""the means, even if rationally connected to the
objective . . . should impair `as little as possible' the right or freedom in
question"".  The objective of transnational crimes, the respondents say,
can, in the circumstances of the present cases, be achieved without infringing
on the right set forth in s. 6(1)  of the Charter  by
prosecuting them in Canada.

 

    The
difficulty I have with this approach is that it seeks to apply the Oakes test in
too rigid a fashion, without regard to the context in which it is to be
applied.  It must be remembered that the language of the Charter , which
allows ""reasonable limits"", invites a measure of flexibility.  As I
noted in R. v. Jones, [1986] 2 S.C.R.
284, at p. 300:

 

    Though
the Charter  protects the individual from compulsion or restraint in
violation of his rights, and a court must, as Dickson J. noted in R. v. Big
M Drug Mart Ltd. [[1985] 1 S.C.R. 295], at p. 344, interpret the rights
it enshrines in ""a generous rather than a legalistic"" fashion, the
protection accorded them, as he has also noted, can only be ""within the
limits of reason"" (see Hunter v. Southam Inc. [[1984] 2 S.C.R.
145], at p. 156).

 

    In R. v.
Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, four of the seven judges expressly
accepted a flexible approach to the proportionality test.  Having referred to R. v.
Oakes and a number of earlier cases, Dickson C.J. (speaking
for himself, Chouinard and Le Dain JJ.) observed at p. 768 that the Court had
stated that ""the nature of the proportionality test would vary depending
on the circumstances"".  He continued at pp. 768-69:

 

Both in
articulating the standard of proof and in describing the criteria comprising
the proportionality requirement the Court has been careful to avoid rigid and
inflexible standards.

 

The
Chief Justice then went on to accept a flexible approach to the proportionality
test on the basis that ""Legislative choices regarding alternative forms of
business regulation do not generally impinge on the values and provisions of
the Charter "" (p. 772).  Though I was prepared to go further, I
was in complete agreement with all of this (p. 792).

 

    In
the performance of the balancing task under s. 1 , it seems to me, a mechanistic
approach must be avoided.  While the rights guaranteed by the Charter  must be
given priority in the equation, the underlying values must be sensitively
weighed in a particular context against other values of a free and democratic
society sought to be promoted by the legislature.  As the Ontario Court of
Appeal put it in Re Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca, supra, at p.
401:  ""In approaching the question objectively, it is recognized that the
listed rights and freedoms are never absolute and that there are always
qualifications and limitations to allow for the protection of other competing
interests in a democratic society.""

 

    Turning
specifically to extradition, the first point to note is that the interference
with the right guaranteed by s. 6(1)  is not, as previously mentioned, central
to the concerns addressed by that provision.  Furthermore, as is indicated in Canada v.
Schmidt, supra, extradition practices have been
tailored as much as possible for the protection of the liberty of the
individual.  It accords the same kinds of rights (though in a necessarily
attenuated form) as are afforded to an accused under ss. 7  and 11  of the Charter .  As
against this somewhat peripheral Charter  infringement must
be weighed the importance of the objectives sought by extradition -‑ the
investigation, prosecution, repression and punishment of both national and
transnational crimes for the protection of the public.  These objectives, we
saw, are of pressing and substantial concern.  They are, in fact, essential to
the maintenance of a free and democratic society.  In my view, they warrant the
limited interference with the right guaranteed by s. 6(1)  to remain in Canada. 
That right, it seems to me, is infringed as little as possible, or at the very
least as little as reasonably possible.

 

    The
foregoing conclusion is supported by the history of extradition in this
country.  Because of the facility with which criminals can escape from one
country to the other, Canada and the United States have always been in the
forefront of the development of this procedure.  This special vulnerability ‑-
strongly accentuated today -‑ made it imperative that little leniency be
accorded citizens in this regard; see Re Burley (1865),
60 B.F.S.P. 1241, at p. 1261, per Richards J.  For
well over one hundred years, extradition has been part of the fabric of our
law.  Though this does not exempt it from Charter 
scrutiny, nevertheless, as the Ontario Court of Appeal noted in Re Federal
Republic of Germany and Rauca, supra, at p.
404: ""the Charter  was not enacted in a vacuum and the
rights set out therein must be interpreted rationally having regard to the then
existing laws and, in the instant case, to the position which Canada occupies
in the world and the effective history of the multitude of extradition treaties
it has had with other nations"".  As that court also observed (pp. 404-5),
the remarks taken from Hansard, previously cited, at least indicate that the
problem was not absent from the minds of those charged with approving the
language of the Charter .

 

    This
seems to me to be fully in accord with the following remarks of Dickson J. in R. v. Big
M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p. 344, regarding the manner in
which the Charter  should be interpreted:

 

The
interpretation should be, as the judgment in Southam
emphasizes, a generous rather than a legalistic one, aimed at fulfilling the
purpose of the guarantee and securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charter 's
protection.  At the same time it is important not to overshoot the actual
purpose of the right or freedom in question, but to recall that the Charter  was not
enacted in a vacuum, and must therefore, as this Court's decision in Law
Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R.
357, illustrates, be placed in its proper linguistic, philosophic and
historical contexts.

 

    The
approach I have adopted is akin to that followed by three members of this
Court, the Chief Justice, Lamer J. and myself, in R. v. Jones, supra.  That
case concerned the pastor of a fundamentalist church who educated his children
in the church basement and refused either to send his children to a public
school as required by the Alberta School Act or to seek an
exemption from that requirement as permitted by the Act if the school
authorities determined that the children were receiving ""efficient
instruction"".  He argued, inter alia, that the
requirement to seek an exemption infringed against his freedom of religion
guaranteed under s. 2 (a) of the Charter .  Four of the
judges (Beetz, McIntyre, Wilson and Le Dain JJ.), found it unnecessary to
consider a s. 1  defence because, in their view, the appellant's religious
rights had not been infringed, although Wilson J. added that such a defence
would have failed for lack of evidence.  The other three judges, however,
decided the case on the basis that the appellant's religious rights had been
infringed but held that the intrusion was of a minimal or peripheral
character.  His rights were, therefore, reasonably limited by the requirement
that the education be certified as efficient because of the interest of the
province, which the Court found compelling, in the ""efficient
instruction"" of the young (p. 299).

 

    While
the infringement in the present case would not appear to be as peripheral to
the core rights protected by s. 6(1)  of the Charter  as to
be described as minimal, it should be observed that the members of the Court
who relied on s. 1  in R. v. Jones also stated that
the same reasoning would apply to somewhat more intrusive situations, making it
clear, however, that reasonable accommodation would have to be made and, in
particular, that ""it would be necessary to delicately and sensitively
weigh the competing interests so as to respect, as much as possible, the
religious convictions of the appellant as guaranteed by the Charter "" (p.
298).

 

    As I
noted earlier, the extradition arrangements we are considering here have sought
to respect both the right to remain in Canada and the requirements of due
process as much as possible.

 

    As
earlier noted, however, the respondents did not rely so much on the argument
that extradition should not apply to citizens generally as upon the special
circumstances of these cases.  Indeed, the respondent Cotroni does not appear
to deny that, in general, extradition is a reasonable limit on a citizen's right
to remain in Canada.  Both respondents argue, however, that extradition is not
a reasonable limit in the circumstances of these particular cases, i.e., cases
which present a situation where (1) the accused is a Canadian citizen; (2) the
conduct of the accused with respect to the alleged crime took place entirely in
Canada; and (3) the accused could be charged with the offence under Canadian as
well as United States law.

 

    Before
going on to more general considerations respecting these submissions, I wish to
make a few specific observations about them.  In the first place, I think the
manner in which the second point is put places a rather misleading colouration
on what occurred in these cases.  The respondents were undoubtedly physically
present in Canada when, as it is alleged, they participated in the acts in
respect which they are charged with the relevant offences.  But the
transactions in which they are alleged to have been engaged in were
transnational in nature.  The allegations are that they were designed and put
into effect in cooperation with associates in the United States to have impact
in that country.  As such, the United States, as well as Canada, could properly
exercise jurisdiction in respect of the alleged offences. 

 

    Drug
traffickers organize their affairs on the basis of the international market for
narcotics.  Modern communication means the territoriality of wrongdoing is no
longer the determining factor for criminal law jurisdiction over international
crime.  Why should the territoriality of the wrongdoing be so important under
constitutional law?  Indeed the locus of the wrongdoing seems irrelevant to the
s. 6(1)  Charter  right which purports to allow Canadian citizens to
remain physically in Canada.  My view is that while continued physical presence
in Canada may be relevant under ss. 1  and 6  of the Charter , the
locus of wrongdoing is not.

 

    A
second observation I wish to make is that the sole difference between the
situation in these cases and that approved in the passage in Re Federal
Republic of Germany and Rauca, supra, at p.
405, last cited, is that the acts personally committed by Rauca took place
entirely outside Canada.  I am unable to understand, however, how the right to
remain in Canada is more affected in one case than the other.  Moreover, if the
generally recognized limit does not apply where the accused may be prosecuted
in Canada, it is difficult to see why Canada should be able to extradite any
Canadian, for it may under international law prosecute crimes by Canadians wherever
committed.  Why should it not take that step to avoid violating the
constitutional right accorded by s. 6 ?

 

    I
turn now to more general considerations.  Extradition, we saw, has been a major
tool of international cooperation in bringing fugitives to justice and
combatting crime.  But for a system of extradition to be effective, reliance
must be placed on the initiative and cooperation of law enforcement and
judicial and administrative bodies at many levels and in many countries.  A
general exception for a Canadian citizen who could be charged in Canada would,
in my view, interfere unduly with the objectives of the system of extradition. 
It would often occur, for example, that a person could not be convicted in
Canada because of lack of evidence here.  Again, what initiative would law
enforcement agencies in one country have to investigate a crime that could not
be successfully prosecuted?  As well, there are many cases where all the
conspirators should be tried together.  These are only a few of the difficulties
that would arise.  On the other hand, to require judicial examination of each
individual case to see which could more effectively and fairly be tried in one
country or the other would pose an impossible task and seriously interfere with
the workings of the system.  The present case itself is an illustration of many
of the practical considerations that should be borne in mind in considering the
matter.  As already mentioned, the alleged crimes were discovered in the United
States, the investigations and legal proceedings originated there, and most of
the witnesses and other evidence are in that country.  Indeed, the impact of
the crimes would primarily be felt in that country.  These and other factors
strongly militate against the view advanced by the respondents.

 

    These
considerations go beyond mere administrative convenience.  They go to the very
purpose for which a system of extradition is put in place.  In particular, the
interests of society in bringing a fugitive to justice at a trial where his or
her guilt or innocence can be properly determined would be seriously impaired. 
Such an approach, moreover, tends to weaken the system generally, and so the
objectives it serves, by sapping the trust and good faith that must exist
between nations and their officials and law enforcement agencies at many
levels.  In Canada v. Schmidt, supra, the
Court noted at p. 524:

 

The
present system of extradition works because courts give the treaties a fair and
liberal interpretation with a view to fulfilling Canada's obligations, reducing
the technicalities of criminal law to a minimum and trusting the courts in the
foreign country to give the fugitive a fair trial . . . .

 

    A
comment I made in R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., supra, (now
approved by a majority of this Court: see R. v. Schwartz, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 443, at p. 488) seems appropriate here.  I stated at pp. 794-95:

 

Given
that the objective is of pressing and substantial concern, the Legislature must
be allowed adequate scope to achieve that objective.  It must be remembered
that the business of government is a practical one.  The Constitution must be
applied on a realistic basis having regard to the nature of the particular area
sought to be regulated and not on an abstract theoretical plane.  In
interpreting the Constitution, courts must be sensitive to what Frankfurter J.
in McGowan, supra, at p. 524 calls ""the practical
living facts"" to which a legislature must respond.

 

    The
foregoing considerations are relevant to the respondent El Zein's submission
that there was a readily available substitute for extradition that would not
infringe on the right of a citizen to remain in Canada.  Canada, he maintained,
could adopt the practice followed by some European countries of refusing
extradition and prosecuting their own nationals for crimes wherever committed. 
In a recent article, J. G. Castel and Sharon A. Williams, ""The Extradition
of Canadian Citizens and Sections 1  and 6(1)  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms "", in The Canadian Yearbook of International
Law, vol. 25 (1987), at pp. 268-69, the authors recount the widespread
criticism of this practice.  ""This attitude of lack of faith and actual
distrust"", they observe, ""is not in keeping with the spirit behind
extradition treaties.""  They further observe that prosecution by the
requested state does not constitute an acceptable substitute for extradition. 
At pages 268-69, they state:

 

. . . even where the requested state has jurisdiction to
prosecute based on the nationality of the fugitive, it places the fugitive in a
privileged position, as the state of nationality has no real interest in
prosecuting him or her for an offence in a foreign state, perhaps against
foreign persons, with remote sources of evidence and general lack of contact
with the scene of the crime.  The practical objections that can be raised
constitute a grave handicap to both prosecution and defence counsel.  Shearer
suggests that:  ""[W]here the result is the acquittal of the accused -‑
the chances of which are substantially increased by trial under such conditions
-‑ the charge can all too easily be made by the authorities of the locus
delicti that the prosecuting State performed its duty without
effort or enthusiasm.""

 

    As I
noted earlier, extradition is now part of the fabric of our law.  The countries
where the system we are invited to adopt exists have a completely different
criminal justice system, the inquisitorial system, which includes quite
different rules and practices for obtaining and presenting evidence.  To apply
the concept in relation to those countries would require a substantial
revamping of our system in a manner that would probably not meet Charter 
requirements.  Cooperation with common law countries would be seriously limited
as well.  If a prosecution was held here, witnesses would frequently be
required from those countries.  Reciprocity would be expected for similar
prosecutions there, but this might well require that Canadians be compelled to
leave Canada for the purpose, a procedure that, if the rigid approach advanced
is taken, would itself involve infringement of the s. 6(1)  right.

 

    Apart
from these difficulties, what the respondent El Zein really asks the Court to
do is to decide which of two systems should be adopted for the fulfillment of a
legislative objective where many imponderables must be considered.  I need not
dwell on the appropriateness of this course, however, because for reasons I
have already given, there are many cases where it is preferable for an accused to
be tried in a foreign country rather than in Canada that can only be determined
by prosecutorial discretion in a specific context.  A system under which each
country would prosecute its own nationals would simply not be effective.  It
would invite disagreement between the two countries to the detriment of
international cooperative schemes for the prosecution and suppression of crime.

 

    Counsel
for the respondent, however, argued that the limitation on the right under s.
6(1)  could not be justified under s. 1  because the question whether extradition
will take place or not is left completely to discretion and there are no
criteria set forth for the exercise of that discretion.  This argument was
recently dealt with and rejected by Hanssen J. in a case very similar to the
present, United States of America v. Swystun (1987),
50 Man. R. (2d) 129.  When analyzed, it is clear that the principal discretion
involved is that of the Attorney General of Canada or of a province, as the
case may be, to prosecute or not to prosecute.  The effective enforcement of
criminal law would be impossible if someone were not vested with that
discretion (see Smythe v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R.
680, at p. 686), and this Court has on at least two occasions indicated that
prosecutorial discretion is consistent with Charter 
requirements of fundamental justice; see R. v. Lyons, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 348; R. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
387, at p. 411.  The same reasons underlie the necessity for permitting a
discretion to decide whether a Canadian should be prosecuted in Canada or
abroad.  Of course, the authorities must give due weight to the constitutional
right of a citizen to remain in Canada.  They must in good faith direct their
minds to whether prosecution would be equally effective in Canada, given the
existing domestic laws and international cooperative arrangements.  They have
an obligation flowing from s. 6(1)  to assure themselves that prosecution in
Canada is not a realistic option.  As the Court observed in R. v.
Beare, supra, at p. 411, ""if, in a particular
case, it was established that a discretion was exercised for improper or
arbitrary motives, a remedy under s. 24  of the Charter  would
lie . . . .""

 

    In
practice, the decision whether to prosecute, or not to prosecute in this country
and allow the authorities in another country to seek extradition, is made
following consultations between the appropriate authorities in the two
countries.  The factors that will usually affect such a decision were recently
considered by Hanssen J. in United States of America v. Swystun, supra, at pp.
133-34.  These factors include:

 

‑where was the impact of the offence felt or
likely to have been felt,

 

‑which jurisdiction has the greater interest in
prosecuting the offence,

 

‑which police force played the major role in the
development of the case,

 

‑which jurisdiction has laid charges,

 

‑which jurisdiction has the most comprehensive
case,

 

‑which jurisdiction is ready to proceed to trial,

 

‑where is the evidence located,

 

‑whether the evidence is mobile,

 

‑the number of accused involved and whether they
can be gathered together in one place for trial,

 

‑in what jurisdiction were most of the acts in
furtherance of the crime committed,

 

‑the nationality and residence of the accused,

 

‑the
severity of the sentence the accused is likely to receive in each jurisdiction.

 

As
Hanssen J. observed, at p. 134, "". . . it is apparent from an examination
of the factors listed above that although a fugitive may not have personally
performed any act in the foreign jurisdiction in furtherance of the crime with
which he is charged, that jurisdiction, for a variety of reasons may still be
the most effective place for him to be prosecuted.""

 

    As I
noted earlier, the effective prosecution and the suppression of crime is a
social objective of a pressing and substantial nature, and it is imperative
today that this objective be effectively pursued on the international as well
as on the national plane.  In doing this, I am satisfied that some infringement
of the right of s. 6(1)  is warranted.  Speaking specifically of transnational
crimes, Hanssen J., in a passage with which I am in entire agreement, stated at
p. 133:

 

I am
satisfied that this objective is of sufficient importance to warrant overriding
the constitutionally protected right of a citizen to remain in Canada even when
all of the alleged acts constituting the crime took place in Canada and also
constitute a crime which can be prosecuted here.  A general policy of refusing
to extradite our citizens in such cases would reduce the effectiveness of
extradition as a major tool in combatting transnational crime.  The mere fact
that a fugitive may be prosecuted in Canada does not necessarily lead to an
effective and efficient prosecution even when all of the constituent elements
of the crime occurred in Canada.

 

    Counsel
for El Zein also drew attention to the executive discretion to surrender, but I
do not think it is of much relevance here.  In the absence of proceedings
against the accused in this country, Canada is under an international
obligation to surrender a person accused of having committed a crime listed in
an extradition treaty if it meets the requirements of the treaty, in particular
presenting sufficient evidence before a judge to satisfy the requirements of a prima
facie case.  There is, it is true, some discretion in the
federal government under the treaties to refuse surrender, for example, where
the crime is one of a political character.  There may, as well, be cases where
the government, for high political purposes or for the protection of an
accused, may be prepared not to conform with a treaty.  But this executive
discretion would rarely be exercised and is impossible to define in the
abstract.   That is scarcely surprising.  The extradition process is not
arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations.  As was noted in Canada v.
Schmidt, supra, at p. 515, the procedure is tailored
with an eye to the liberty of the individual.

 

    I
might add that I find the argument that the fact that the executive discretion
to refuse surrender and the duty to present requests for extradition in court,
both fall within the responsibilities of the Minister of Justice, somehow
create an unacceptable conflict to have no merit.  Of no substance either is
the contention that the executive power to surrender, which is derived from the
treaty, is not a ""law"" within the meaning of s. 1  of the Charter  and so
cannot justify the infringement of a Charter  right. 
The executive power and the treaty derive their validity, for purposes of
domestic law, from s. 3 of the Extradition Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. E-21.

 

Secondary
Issues

 

    In
addition to the constitutional questions already discussed, the respondents
raised a number of secondary issues.

 

    One
issue raised by the respondent Cotroni is whether it was necessary for the
appellants to produce the tapes of intercepted telephone communications rather
than the transcripts.  On this issue it is sufficient to say that I agree with
the conclusion reached on this point by the courts below.  It raises no
jurisdictional point and the weight to be attached to the evidence was for the
extradition judge to determine.

 

    For
his part, the respondent El Zein briefly questioned the jurisdiction of the
United States in respect of the offences he is alleged to have committed, but
here too I think the issue was properly decided in the courts below,
specifically by Downs J.

 

    Finally,
counsel for El Zein argued that the type of crime of which his client was
charged now carried a minimum penalty of ten years and that such a penalty had
been held to violate the Charter  in R. v. Smith (Edward
Dewey), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045.  The reason the provision in
that case was struck down was because its breadth was such that it could apply
to persons in circumstances that would constitute cruel and unusual
punishment.  It is not for this Court to pass upon the validity of the laws of
other countries.  If, it is true, the power to surrender were exercised in
respect of a person for whom such a penalty would constitute cruel and unusual
punishment, the courts could review the matter; see Canada v. Schmidt, supra, at pp.
523-24.  But that is not this case.  There is nothing in the record to indicate
that the accused in any way fitted the description of the individual postulated
in R. v. Smith (Edward Dewey) (p. 1053) -- 
""a young person . . . caught with only one, indeed . . . his or her first
`joint of grass'"".

 

Disposition

 

    For
these reasons, I would allow the appeals, reverse the judgments of the Court of
Appeal and restore the judgments of the superior court on habeas
corpus.  The respondents should be committed for surrender
pursuant to the orders of the extradition judges, which should be restored.

 

    I
would answer both constitutional questions in the affirmative.

 

//Wilson J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    WILSON J.
(dissenting) -- I have had an opportunity to read the reasons for judgment of
my colleague Justice La Forest and, while I agree with him that the
respondents' rights under s. 6(1)  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  have been infringed, I am unable to accept his
conclusion that their extradition to the United States in the circumstances of
this case constitutes a reasonable limit which can be demonstrably justified in
a free and democratic society under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

1.  The
Facts

 

    The
facts of these cases may be summarized briefly as follows:

 

    (A)Mr. Cotroni

 

(i)                         Mr. Cotroni is a Canadian
citizen;

 

(ii)on August 30, 1983 he was arrested in Canada
pursuant to a warrant issued under the Extradition Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. E-21, and the Extradition Treaty between Canada and the United States,
C.T.S. 1976;

 

(iii)the warrant alleged that Mr. Cotroni participated
in a  conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin in the United States;

 

(iv)all of Cotroni's actions relating to the alleged
conspiracy took place in Canada and at no time did Cotroni leave Canada.

 

 

(B)  Mr. El Zein

 

(i)Mr. El Zein is a Canadian citizen;

 

(ii)on December 17, 1984 he was arrested in Canada
pursuant to a warrant issued under the Extradition Act  and the
Extradition Treaty between Canada and the United States;

 

(iii)the warrant alleged that El Zein had imported
heroin into the United States and that he participated in a conspiracy to
import and distribute heroin in the United States;

 

(iv)all
of El Zein's actions relating to the allegations took place in Canada and at no
time did El Zein leave Canada.

 

    The
extradition of each accused to the United States was sought on the ground that
the drug enforcement laws of the United States extend beyond the territorial
boundaries of the United States where the object of the illegal activity is to
bring the drugs into the United States.  Canada has similar legislation
governing the importation of drugs into and the exportation of drugs out of Canada. 
It is common ground that each accused could have been charged by Canadian
authorities with violating s. 423(1)(d) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, and s. 5 of the Narcotic
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1.

 

2.  The
issues

 

    At
their respective extradition hearings both Cotroni and El Zein were committed
for surrender to the United States.  Both appealed their committals, first
unsuccessfully to the Quebec Superior Court and then successfully to the Quebec
Court of Appeal, on the basis that their extradition to the United States
violated s. 6(1)  of the Charter .  The United States asked for and was
granted leave to challenge the findings of the Quebec Court of Appeal in this
Court.  The following constitutional questions were set by Justice Lamer:

 

1.  Does the surrender of a Canadian citizen to a
foreign state constitute an infringement of his right to remain in Canada as
set out in s. 6(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.  If
the surrender of such citizen constitutes a prima facie
infringement of his right to remain in Canada, does the surrender of respondent
in the circumstances of this case constitute a reasonable limit under s. 1  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

3.  Section
6(1)  of the Charter 

 

    Section
6(1)  of the Charter  provides:

 

                            6. (1) 
Every citizen of Canada has the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada.

 

    In
the Quebec Court of Appeal it was conceded by counsel for the United States
that the extradition process as contemplated by the Extradition Act  and the
Extradition Treaty between Canada and the United States violated s. 6(1)  of the Charter . 
However, on appeal to this Court, counsel for the United States argued that the
rights enumerated in the Charter , even without reference to s. 1 , were
not absolute but were subject to internal qualifications and limits.  Counsel
therefore interpreted s. 6(1)  narrowly as solely designed to deal with
circumstances in which a Canadian citizen was threatened with exile, banishment
or expulsion.  Extradition of a citizen did not, therefore, violate s. 6(1) .

 

    This
Court has, on several occasions, set forth the guidelines to be employed in
construing Charter  provisions.  In R. v. Big
M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344, Dickson J., as he then
was, stated:

 

In Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R.
145, this Court expressed the view that the proper approach to the definition
of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter  was a
purposive one.  The meaning of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter  was to
be ascertained by an analysis of the purpose of such a guarantee; it was
to be understood, in other words, in the light of the interests it was meant to
protect.

 

    In
my view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or
freedom in question is to be sought by reference to the character and the
larger objects of the Charter  itself, to the language chosen to
articulate the specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the
concepts enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the
other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated within the text
of the Charter .  The interpretation should be, as the judgment in Southam emphasizes,
a generous rather than a legalistic one, aimed at fulfilling the purpose of the
guarantee and securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charter 's
protection.  At the same time it is important not to overshoot the actual
purpose of the right or freedom in question, but to recall that the Charter  was not
enacted in a vacuum, and must therefore, as this Court's decision in Law
Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R.
357, illustrates, be placed in its proper linguistic, philosophic and
historical contexts.

 

    Applying
these guidelines, it is my view that s. 6(1)  of the Charter  was
designed to protect a Canadian citizen's freedom of movement in and out of the
country according to his own choice.  He may come and go as he pleases.  He may
elect to remain.  Although only Canadian citizens can take advantage of s. 6(1) 
the right protected is not that of Canadian citizenship.  Rather, the right
protected focuses on the liberty of a Canadian citizen to choose of his own
volition whether he would like to enter, remain in or leave Canada.  Support
for this interpretation is found in the language of the other subsections of s.
6  and in the heading of s. 6  ""Mobility Rights"".

 

    In
my view, the language of s. 6(1)  is clear and unambiguous.  Had it been the
intention that s. 6(1)  address only a citizen's right not to be exiled or
banished, the section would have been framed in more specific terms.  Indeed,
the more specific terminology of exile and expulsion are used in both the Canadian
Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, App. III, and the European
Convention on Human Rights.

 

Canadian Bill of Rights

 

    2.  Every law of Canada shall, unless
it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall
operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed
and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the
abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein
recognized and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed
or applied so as to

 

(a)
authorize or effect the arbitrary detention, imprisonment or exile of any
person;

 

European Convention on Human Rights

 

Protocol 4, Article 3, paragraph 1:

 

1.  No
one shall be expelled, by means either of an individual or of a collective
measure, from the territory of the State of which he is a national.

 

    Accordingly,
I conclude that the extradition of a Canadian citizen violates his right to
remain in Canada as guaranteed by s. 6(1)  of the Charter .

 

4.  Section
1  of the Charter 

 

    Section
1  of the Charter  provides:

    1.  The Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms
set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can
be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

    The
focus of the Charter  is on the protection of the
enumerated rights and freedoms from governmental intrusion.  As Dickson C.J.
stated in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
103, at p. 136:

 

The
underlying values and principles of a free and democratic society are the
genesis of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter  and the
ultimate standard against which a limit on a right or freedom must be shown,
despite its effect, to be reasonable and demonstrably justified.

 

    This
point was also made in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985]
1 S.C.R. 177, wherein I stated at p. 218:

 

It seems
to me that it is important to bear in mind that the rights and freedoms set out
in the Charter  are fundamental to the political structure of Canada
and are guaranteed by the Charter  as part of the supreme law of our
nation.  I think that in determining whether a particular limitation is a
reasonable limit prescribed by law which can be ""demonstrably justified in
a free and democratic society"" it is important to remember that the courts
are conducting this inquiry in light of a commitment to uphold the rights and
freedoms set out in the other sections of the Charter .

 

    Given
this focus, governmental limits on protected rights and freedoms can only be
legitimized in the clearest of cases.  It is simply not enough to override a
constitutionally protected right or freedom for the legislation to be designed
to serve a particular state objective.  Rather, the state objective must take
cognizance of and be tailored to the rights and freedoms on which it impinges. 
It was with these considerations in mind that this Court in R. v.
Oakes outlined the criteria which must be met before
legislation infringing upon a guaranteed right or freedom can be saved by s.
1 .  It bears repeating (pp. 138-39):

 

    To establish that a limit is reasonable and demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society, two central criteria must be
satisfied.  First, the objective, which the measures responsible for a limit on
a Charter  right or freedom are designed to serve, must be
""of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally
protected right or freedom"":  R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p.
352.  The standard must be high in order to ensure that objectives which are
trivial or discordant with the principles integral to a free and democratic
society do not gain s. 1  protection.  It is necessary, at a minimum, that an
objective relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and
democratic society before it can be characterized as sufficiently important.

 

    Second,
once a sufficiently significant objective is recognized, then the party
invoking s. 1  must show that the means chosen are reasonable and demonstrably
justified.  This involves ""a form of proportionality test"":  R. v. Big
M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p. 352.  Although the nature of the proportionality
test will vary depending on the circumstances, in each case courts will be
required to balance the interests of society with those of individuals and
groups.  There are, in my view, three important components of a proportionality
test.  First, the measures adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the
objective in question.  They must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on
irrational considerations.  In short, they must be rationally connected to the objective. 
Second, the means, even if rationally connected to the objective in this first
sense, should impair ""as little as possible"" the right or freedom in
question:  R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p.
352.  Third, there must be a proportionality between the effects of the
measures which are responsible for limiting the Charter  right
or freedom, and the objective which has been identified as of ""sufficient
importance"".

 

    The
Ontario Court of Appeal was the first appellate court in Canada to consider the
application of s. 1  of the Charter  to the law of extradition.  In Re Federal
Republic of Germany and Rauca (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 385, that court
considered a situation in which the West German authorities had requested
extradition of a Canadian citizen for crimes he had committed during World War
II prior to his becoming a Canadian citizen in territory occupied by Germany. 
The Court of Appeal held, at p. 406, without the benefit of this Court's
decision in R. v. Oakes:

 

    It
is not necessary to turn to lengthy dictionary definitions of the words
""demonstrably justified"".  They are words of common understanding and
usage and they place a significant burden on the proponents of the limiting
legislation.  When the rationale and purpose of the
Extradition Act  and the treaty under it are looked at (having in mind
that crime should not go unpunished), Canada's obligations to the international
community considered and the history of such legislation in free and democratic
societies examined, in our view, the burden of establishing that the limit
imposed by the Extradition Act  and the treaty on
s. 6(1)  of the Charter  is a reasonable one demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society has been discharged by the respondents.

 

The
Ontario court in obiter dicta, at p. 405,
speculated as to what the outcome of the case would have been if the accused
could have been prosecuted in Canada for his crimes:

 

    Counsel
for the appellant suggested that there was a possibility that the appellant
could be prosecuted in Canada for the crimes with which he had been charged. 
If there was this alternative, the argument was that extradition was not a
reasonable limit on the appellant's right as a citizen to remain in Canada. 
This submission was not pressed strongly and, like the Chief Justice of the
High Court, we are not persuaded that there is, at present, a right to
prosecute the appellant for the recited crimes in Canada.  Even if there
were such a right to prosecute, in light of the described purpose and reason
for and lengthy history of extradition, it would not turn a reasonable limit on
the citizen's right to remain in this country into an unreasonable limit. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    A
majority of this Court, also in obiter dicta, has given support
to the conclusion in Re Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca that
extradition of a Canadian citizen who has committed an offence in a foreign
jurisdiction meets the criteria of s. 1  of the Charter .  In Canada v.
Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, La Forest J., for the majority,
stated at p. 520:

 

In Rauca, supra, for
example, the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized that extradition intruded on a
citizen's right under s. 6  to remain in Canada, although it also found that the
beneficial aspects of the procedure in preventing malefactors from evading
justice, a procedure widely adopted all over the world, were sufficient to
sustain it as a reasonable limit under s. 1  of the Charter . 
Section 6  was not raised in this case, though Schmidt is a Canadian citizen, no
doubt because her counsel believed, as I do, that it was properly disposed of
in the Rauca case.

 

It
should be noted that in neither Rauca nor Schmidt was the
Ontario Court of Appeal or this Court dealing with the extradition of a
Canadian citizen for acts committed within Canada for which the accused could
be prosecuted in Canada.  This is before us for the first time.  In both Rauca and Schmidt the
acts were committed in the requesting state, the typical extradition context.

 

    Since
it was not necessary to my decision in Schmidt I did
not express an opinion as to the soundness of the proposition stated in
absolute form in Rauca that extradition was per se a
reasonable limit justified under s. 1  because I was not sure that it should not
be subject to qualification in some circumstances.  In other words, it seemed
to me unwise and unnecessary to state this as a bald and absolute proposition
and preferable, while acknowledging that in general extradition is a reasonable
limit, to deal with particular circumstances on a case by case basis.  It was
my view that there might well be circumstances in which extradition might not
be a reasonable limit under s. 1 .  The present appeals illustrate the problem
about which I was concerned.  Even if extradition is a reasonable limit demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society where a Canadian citizen commits an
offence within the territorial boundaries of a foreign state, and I
think that it clearly is, that does not dispose of the present appeals.  In
these appeals we must take into account the fact that the accused are Canadian
citizens, that their alleged wrongful conduct took place entirely within
Canada, and that such conduct gives rise to offences for which the accused can
be charged and prosecuted in Canada.  It is in that factual context that the Oakes test
must be applied.

 

    I
emphasize that we are dealing in these cases with a very narrow issue.  We are
not dealing with circumstances in which a Canadian citizen who has committed an
offence in a foreign country seeks to resist extradition on the basis of his
right under s. 6(1)  of the Charter  to remain in Canada.  Such a claim
would, in my opinion, fail.  While extradition infringes the rights of Canadian
citizens under s. 6(1) , the law of extradition has been held to be and, in my
view, is in those circumstances a reasonable limit on that right which can be
justified in a free and democratic society.  The crucial question before us in
these cases is whether extradition is a reasonable limit on the Canadian
citizen's constitutionally guaranteed right to remain in Canada where his
wrongful conduct took place wholly within Canada and constitutes an offence for
which he can be charged and prosecuted here.  I believe that these facts are
relevant to the balancing exercise to be undertaken under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    My
colleague takes the position that the locus of the accused's wrongdoing is
irrelevant under both s. 6(1)  and s. 1  of the Charter .  I
must respectfully disagree.  I believe that the locus of the wrongdoing is very
relevant when extradition to a foreign country is sought to be justified as a
reasonable limit on a Canadian citizen's right to remain in Canada.  Indeed,
the locus of the wrongdoing is frequently the key factor connecting the accused
to the requesting state.  A Canadian citizen who leaves Canada for another
state must expect that he will be answerable to the justice system of that
state in respect of his conduct there.  There can be no doubt as to the real
interest of a requesting state in bringing to justice Canadians who have
committed crimes within its (the requesting state's) territory.  The question
is whether that interest weighs as heavily under s. 1  when the crime was
committed by a Canadian within Canadian territory.

 

    It
is not necessary in order that the appellants in this case be brought to
justice that they be extradited to the United States.  They can be brought to
justice right here.  It is alleged, however, that it would be more convenient
if they were prosecuted in the United States and that Canada will appear to be
uncooperative if it refuses to extradite them.  In my view, it would require
far stronger reasons than those to justify the violation of a right expressly
guaranteed to Canadian citizens in the Charter .

 

    I
may say that I view with some alarm my colleague's characterization of the
proposed extradition of the respondents as a ""peripheral"" violation
of s. 6(1) .  If one characterizes a complete denial of the citizen's right to
remain in Canada under s. 6(1)  as a ""peripheral"" violation, then, of
course, one has already pre-judged the s. 1  issue.  I would, however,
respectfully suggest that such an approach represents a novel departure from
the Court's traditional approach to the balancing process called for under s. 1 
and one that could pose a very serious threat to the protection for the citizen
which the Charter  was intended to provide.

 

    It
was also strenuously argued before us that the decision whether or not to
extradite an accused at the behest of a requesting state is a matter of
ministerial discretion and that the decision whether an accused should be
prosecuted in Canada or elsewhere is a matter of prosecutorial discretion.  The
underlying premise of this submission seems to be that the executive branch of
government in exercising such discretionary powers is not bound by the Charter . 
Section 32(1)  of the Charter  seems to be a complete answer to this
submission.  I would refer also to the statement of Dickson J. in Operation
Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, at p. 455:

 

I have
no doubt that the executive branch of the Canadian government is duty bound to
act in accordance with the dictates of the Charter .

 

The Charter  is part
of the constitution of Canada which is declared to be the supreme law of the
country in s. 52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  It is
insupportable to suggest that the Attorney General of Canada or any other
official of government has a discretion whether or not to respect the rights
guaranteed under it.

 

    It
would, moreover, be my view that countries with which Canada has extradition
treaties might be expected to have confidence in the Canadian system of justice
to deal responsibly with its own citizens committing crimes within its own
borders.  Conversely, Canada might be expected to repose a similar confidence
in the justice systems of the countries with which it has undertaken treaty
obligations.  Mutual respect for each other's system in dealing with their own
nationals committing crimes within their own territories would appear to make eminent
good sense.  This is not, after all, the primary focus of extradition and
Canada would, in my view, have to have a very good reason for abdicating its
public responsibility to deal with its own nationals committing crimes within
its own territory.  I say this quite apart from Canada's obligation to respect
the constitutional rights of its citizens although the latter is, of course,
the paramount issue raised in these appeals.

 

    I do
not view the right of Canadian citizens to be tried here (where this is
possible) in preference to trial in a foreign jurisdiction as a trivial one. 
The system of justice in the United States, which happens to be the requesting
state in this case, may be very similar to our own and the proceedings there
may closely parallel the proceedings here.  But this will not necessarily be so
in the case of all requesting states.  The right in some cases may be a very
valuable one indeed.

 

    I
return then to the application of R. v. Oakes to the narrow
issue in these cases.  The first criterion identified by Dickson C.J. in that
case was that the governmental objective in limiting the right be in response
to a pressing and substantial concern.  I agree with my colleague, La Forest
J., that the control of trans-border crime is, indeed, of sufficient importance
to warrant a legislative limit on a constitutionally protected right.  States
can no longer live in ""splendid isolation"".  Modern technology allows
for almost instantaneous world-wide communication and same-day world-wide
travel and transportation.  Criminals take advantage of this advanced
technology, particularly in the area of drug trafficking, and effective means
are accordingly required on an inter-state level to combat this problem.  As La
Forest J. points out in his reasons, extradition is an important and
well-established tool for the suppression of trans-border crime.  It therefore
meets the first criterion set out in R. v. Oakes.

 

    The
first criterion in R. v. Oakes having been
satisfied, the legislative limit must next pass the proportionality test. 
First, the scheme must be rationally connected to the objective.  At the Quebec
Court of Appeal in Re El Zein and The Queen (1986), 29 C.C.C.
(3d) 560, Jacques J.A. felt that no such rational connection existed.  He
stated at p. 567:

 

    (TRANSLATION)
According to the criteria of reasonableness laid down by the Supreme Court in
the Oakes decision, this measure is not rationally connected to
the objective pursued, namely, the suppression of transborder crime  --  the
facts took place in Canada; these facts constitute a crime in Canada as well as
in the United States.  Those are the two premises.  Their rational conclusion
is not extradition and a trial in the United States, but rather a trial in
Canada, because it is Canada which has the duty to preserve public order and to
repress crime within its borders.  The connection with the United States is
only incidental and not necessary.

 

    I
share the concerns of Jacques J.A. but I believe that they are better dealt
with under the second tier of the proportionality test.  It is generally
accepted that more than one state can have an interest in prosecuting the acts
of a particular individual.  In such cases both states have jurisdiction to try
the accused for the offence.  Canada obviously has a vital interest in
controlling criminal activity within its own borders.  At the same time, on the
facts of these appeals, the harm resulting from the commission of the offences
would have been more acutely and immediately felt within the United States.  I
would conclude, therefore, that the means employed, i.e., extradition are
rationally connected to the objective of controlling trans-border crime.

 

    In
my view, however, the scheme of extradition, on the particular facts of these
appeals, cannot pass the second tier of the Oakes
proportionality test which requires that the means, even if rationally
connected to the objective, impair ""as little as possible"" the right
in question.  The objective of controlling trans-border crime could have been
achieved by prosecuting Cotroni and El Zein in Canada under s. 423  of the Criminal
Code  and s. 5 of the Narcotic Control Act.  The
prosecution of Cotroni and El Zein in Canada would have avoided a contravention
of s. 6  of the Charter  entirely.

 

    Counsel
for the United States urged that there were legitimate reasons for the
prosecutions to take place in the United States as opposed to Canada.  The
crimes were uncovered by United States authorities, the investigation and legal
proceedings were initiated there, most of the witnesses and evidence is there
and the impact of the crimes would primarily have been felt there.  We were
referred to United States of America v. Swystun (1987),
50 Man. R. (2d) 129, which highlighted several factors to be taken into account
in determining the appropriate jurisdiction for a prosecution.  I do not for a
moment doubt that the United States has an interest in prosecuting crimes whose
impact is felt there.  Nor do I question that the United States may be the more
convenient forum for the prosecution of these particular offences.  However, in
my opinion, these considerations are more apposite to the question of whether
the legislative means are rationally connected to the objective than to the
question of whether the right is impaired as little as possible.  As I mentioned
earlier, the focus of the Charter  is the protection of rights and
freedoms fundamental to a free and democratic society.  Limits on those rights
must be confined to those which are reasonable and justified in that kind of
society and should not be based merely on considerations of administrative
convenience.  As I stated in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, supra, at pp.
218-19, in the context of whether the procedures for the adjudication of
refugee status claims set out in the Immigration Act, 1976
violated the Charter :

 

The issue in the present case is not simply whether the
procedures set out in the Immigration Act, 1976 for the
adjudication of refugee claims are reasonable; it is whether it is reasonable
to deprive the appellants of the right to life, liberty and security of the
person by adopting a system for the adjudication of refugee status claims which
does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

    Seen
in this light I have considerable doubt that the type of utilitarian
consideration brought forward by Mr. Bowie can constitute a justification for a
limitation on the rights set out in the Charter . 
Certainly the guarantees of the Charter  would be illusory
if they could be ignored because it was administratively convenient to do so. 
No doubt considerable time and money can be saved by adopting administrative
procedures which ignore the principles of fundamental justice but such an
argument, in my view, misses the point of the exercise under s. 1 .  The
principles of natural justice and procedural fairness which have long been
espoused by our courts, and the constitutional entrenchment of the principles
of fundamental justice in s. 7 , implicitly recognize that a balance of
administrative convenience does not override the need to adhere to these
principles.  Whatever standard of review eventually emerges under s. 1 , it
seems to me that the basis of the justification for the limitation of rights
under s. 7  must be more compelling than any advanced in these appeals.

 

Although
these comments were made with reference to a violation of s. 7  of the Charter  and not
s. 6 , I believe they reflect a proper approach to the interpretation and
application of s. 1 .

 

    In
coming to this conclusion I am not unmindful of the comments of La Forest J.
that a flexible approach should be taken in some cases to the proportionality
test in R. v. Oakes.  However, this does not seem to me to be one of those
cases.  It is one thing to temper scrutiny of legislation and relax the general
approach to ""fine tuning"" when dealing with alternate forms of
business regulation (see R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd.,
[1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, per Dickson C.J., at p. 772) and another thing entirely to
abandon careful scrutiny of a legislative scheme which directly abridges a
guaranteed right particularly in relation to an aspect of the criminal law.

 

    Furthermore,
in my opinion, the comity of nations fostered by extradition is not adversely
affected by the result I have reached.  United States law enforcement agencies
will continue to monitor the United States borders to prevent the importation
of illegal drugs and these agencies will continue to cooperate with Canadian
law enforcement agencies.  Information will be shared and support will be given
not only between law enforcement agencies but also between prosecutors.  I
would respectfully adopt the words of Jacques J.A. in Re El Zein
and The Queen, supra, at pp. 568-69:

 

(TRANSLATION) Mere
courtesy, or co-operation in combating crime, among various countries, does not
justify this extradition because the end sought through this co-operation can
be attained while still respecting the right of a citizen to remain in his
country.

 

I
conclude, therefore, that on the particular facts of these appeals extradition
cannot be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

5.  Disposition

 

    I
would dismiss both appeals on the ground that extradition violates s. 6(1)  of
the Charter  and is not saved by s. 1  in circumstances where the
accused is a Canadian citizen, where his conduct took place wholly within
Canada, and where his conduct constitutes an offence for which he can be tried
and prosecuted both in Canada and in the requesting state.

 

    I
would answer the constitutional questions in each of these appeals as follows:

 

Question 1

 

Does the
surrender of a Canadian citizen to a foreign state constitute an infringement
of his right to remain in Canada as set out in s. 6(1)  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer

 

Yes.

 

    Question
2

 

If the
surrender of such citizen constitutes a prima facie infringement of
his right to remain in Canada, does the surrender of respondent in the
circumstances of this case constitute a reasonable limit under s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

    Answer

 

No.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    SOPINKA J.
(dissenting) --  I concur in the conclusion reached by my colleague Justice
Wilson and her reasons.  Inasmuch, however, as I have concerns about the
implications of the majority decision for the rights of a citizen to be tried
in this country which are not limited to those cases in which all relevant acts
have been committed here, I have decided to express these concerns separately.

 

    Although
the principal argument in this case was that extradition in the circumstances
herein was not a reasonable limit, the respondent El Zein raised the general
issue that extradition of a citizen is not a reasonable limit with respect to the
right to remain in Canada which is guaranteed under s. 6(1)  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  As a result, the reasons of my
colleague Justice La Forest address the general issue and reach the
conclusion that extradition of a citizen is itself a reasonable limit on the
rights conferred by s. 6(1)  of the Charter , even
when under the laws of Canada the citizen could be prosecuted here.

 

    In
balancing the seriousness of the Charter  breach against the
object to be achieved, my colleague classifies the infringement to s. 6(1) 
resulting from extradition as peripheral.  I cannot agree with this
characterization when viewed against the spectrum of nations to which a citizen
can be extradited.  Our citizens may be extradited not only to the United
States but to countries where systems are radically different and whose laws
provide none of the traditional protections for persons charged.  If, for
example, a Canadian citizen who is presumed to be innocent under our laws is
extradited to a country that does not recognize the presumption of innocence,
requires the accused to testify, does not permit bail, has no independent bar
and imposes the death penalty for a number of different offences, I would
consider the consequences of the breach of the citizen's right to remain in
Canada as more than peripheral.  Indeed, it is tantamount to banishment.

 

    And
yet, such limits as exist contained in any enforceable rules of law designed
for the protection of the citizen make no distinction between the petty drug
trafficker who is extradited to the United States and a citizen who is
extradited for a capital offence in the circumstances described above.

 

    Counsel
for the respondent, El Zein, submitted that in this situation a Charter  breach
cannot be justified on the basis of prosecutorial discretion for which there
are no criteria.  In dealing with this submission, my colleague refers to the
decision of Hanssen J. in United States of America v. Swystun (1987),
50 Man. R. (2d) 129, and the alleged practice that obtains with respect to the
decision whether to prosecute in Canada.  The practice to which Hanssen J.
refers was presumably based on evidence adduced before him.  His statement
appears to be a finding of fact.  That evidence does not appear to have been
presented in this case but, in any event, accepting that this is the practice,
it is just that -- a practice.  The reasons of Hanssen J. do not disclose if it
is recorded in any writing.  The passage from the reasons of Hanssen J.,
paraphrased in my colleague's reasons, appears at p. 134:

 

In
practice, both the decision as to whether or not to prosecute in Canada and
whether or not to extradite to the requesting state are made following
consultations between the appropriate authorities in Canada and the appropriate
authorities in the requesting jurisdiction.  The factors which will usually
affect such a decision are those which I mentioned earlier.

 

    Departure
from this practice would not be reviewable unless, as pointed out by my
colleague, ""it was established that a discretion was exercised for
improper or arbitrary motives"".  It is, therefore, difficult to accept
that a breach of a Charter  right can be justified by offering
the citizen the protection of this practice.  In my opinion, these are not
""limits prescribed by law"".  Nor are they carefully crafted to lessen
the impact of a breach of s. 6(1) .

 

    The
prosecutorial discretion referred to in the Swystun case, supra, is not
found in the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
E-21, but in the general discretion of the Crown to decide, as in any case,
whether to prosecute.  Indeed, even a decision to prosecute in Canada will not
protect the citizen against extradition unless the treaty confers a discretion
in Canada not to extradite its own citizens.  Such a provision exists in a
number of treaties.  It is not, however, a discretion conferred on a prosecutor
but is a matter of political discretion.  Accordingly, whether a decision to
prosecute will avail will depend on the general policy of the Canadian
government.  This policy is not expressed in any instrument having the force of
law.

 

    In
my opinion, avoidance of a Charter  violation cannot be delegated to a
prosecutor whose conduct is not circumscribed by guidelines which are
enforceable in a court of law.  I agree with the following statement of Lamer
J. in a different context in  R. v. Smith (Edward Dewey), [1987] 1 S.C.R.
1045, at p. 1078:

 

    In
my view the section cannot be salvaged by relying on the discretion of the
prosecution not to apply the law in those cases where, in the opinion of the
prosecution, its application would be a violation of the Charter .  To do
so would be to disregard totally s. 52  of the Constitution Act,
1982  which provides that any law which is inconsistent with
the Constitution is of no force or effect to the extent of the inconsistency
and the courts are duty bound to make that pronouncement, not to delegate the
avoidance of a violation to the prosecution or to anyone else for that matter. 

 

    It
might be said that some protection is afforded in the extradition treaties in
that the Canadian government would have considered the matter of the political
and legal systems of the requesting state at the time of negotiation. 
Unfortunately, many of these treaties pre-date 1926 and some pre-date 1900. 
Furthermore, they were not negotiated by Canada but by Great Britain.  The
political nature of the country and certainly its legal system may have
drastically changed in the interim.

 

    In Canada v.
Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, my colleague,
La Forest J., acknowledged that in some circumstances the manner in
which the requesting state proposed to deal with a fugitive might constitute a
breach of the rules of fundamental justice.  If the judgment in this case
justifies the extradition of a citizen in general as a reasonable limit, I have
difficulty in appreciating how it could in any case constitute a breach of
fundamental justice.  Accordingly, even the door that was left open in Canada v.
Schmidt, supra, may now have been closed.  I
therefore conclude that extradition of a citizen who can be tried in Canada, in
the present state of the law of extradition, is not a reasonable limit and that
extradition in this case would constitute a breach of s. 6(1)  which has
not been justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

on appeal from the court of appeal for
ontario

 

    Criminal
law -- Criminal negligence -- Mens rea -- Impaired driver playing chicken with
hayride -- Persons killed and injured -- Whether subjective test as to
accused's state of mind, in addition to objective test as to state of accused's
driving, to be considered in determining mens rea -- Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, ss. 202(1), 203.

 

    Appellant,
who had been drinking, struck and killed four young people taking part in a
hayride, and injured a fifth.  The hayride involved three tractors each towing
a wagon with bales of hay along a public road.  Four or five of the young
people had been running alongside the wagons or had been running from one wagon
to another when appellant came upon the hayride.  Appellant drove behind the
hayride, passed it, turned around and deliberately approached the hayride at
high speed on the wrong side of the road.

 

    At
trial before judge and jury, the appellant was found not guilty of four counts
of causing death by criminal negligence and one count of causing bodily harm by
criminal negligence, but guilty of five counts of the included offence of
dangerous driving.  The charge to the jury did not specifically mention the
objective test for criminal negligence but did convey that the mens rea
required for proof of the commission of the offence could be found in the
accused's conduct.  In clarifying the test for mens rea, the
trial judge directed the jury to look at the objective driving and also to the
accused's state of mind as to whether he had deliberately assumed the risk. 
The Crown appealed the acquittals on the charges of criminal negligence.  The
Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

 

    At
issue here is whether the requisite mens rea for criminal
negligence is to be determined only by an objective test based on the activity
giving rise to the charge or whether a subjective test as to the voluntary
assumption of risk on the part of the accused is also required.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Wilson and La Forest JJ.:  Criminal negligence requires both the
conduct addressed by the objective test and a subjective mental element which
is the minimal intent of awareness of the prohibited risk or wilful blindness
to the risk.  The jury properly instructed as to the minimal intent
requirements of awareness or wilful blindness to the prohibited risk would not
necessarily have returned a verdict of acquittal.

 

    Per
McIntyre and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ.:  The mens rea which
the Crown must prove in criminal negligence cases, as in other offences, is to
be found in the conduct of the accused.  Criminal negligence is shown where 
the Crown proves conduct on the part of the accused which shows a marked and
substantial departure from the standard of behaviour expected of a reasonably
prudent person in the circumstances.  The objective test is to be applied
whether the acts are ones of commission or omission; criminal negligence does
not involve a subjective element requiring the deliberate assumption of risk by
the accused.

 

    Per Lamer
J.:  The appeal should be dismissed for the reasons set out by McIntyre J.
subject to the observations made in R. v. Tutton.

//Wilson J.//

 

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Wilson and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

    WILSON J. --
Although I find myself in respectful disagreement for the reasons I gave in R. v.
Tutton, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 000, with my colleague Justice
McIntyre in so far as he adopts an objective test for criminal negligence, I
agree with him that this appeal should be dismissed and the Court of Appeal's
order for a new trial affirmed.

 

    In
my view the trial judge's final instruction to the jury was in error as to the
degree of mens rea required under s. 202 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  When the jury asked the trial
judge to explain the moral difference between dangerous driving and causing
death by criminal negligence, the trial judge instructed the jury that the subjective
element in criminal negligence was ""a deliberate and wilful assumption of
the risk involved in driving in the manner in which he was driving"". 
Later in his reply to the jury he repeated that the subjective element in
criminal negligence was ""assumption and deliberate assumption of the
risk"".  Although I believe there is a subjective element to criminal
negligence, the judge in this case placed much too high an onus on the Crown to
prove elements of deliberation and wilfulness.  For the reasons I gave in R. v.
Tutton I am of the view that the mental element in criminal
negligence is the minimal intent of awareness of the prohibited risk or wilful
blindness to the risk.

 

    The
trial judge's erroneous instructions to the jury were given near the close of
the trial and they were crucial because they were in response to a question
from the jury.  The facts of the case also suggest that, had the jury been
instructed as to the minimal intent requirements of awareness or wilful
blindness to the prohibited risk, they would not necessarily have returned the
verdict of acquittal on the charges of causing death by criminal negligence: 
see Vézeau v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.

 

//McIntyre J.//

 

    The
reasons of McIntyre and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. were delivered by

 

    MCINTYRE J. --
This appeal comes before this Court as of right pursuant to s. 618(2)(a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,  At trial before judge and jury
the appellant was found not guilty of four counts of causing death by criminal
negligence and one count of causing bodily harm by criminal negligence, but
guilty of five counts of the included offence of dangerous driving.  The Crown
appealed the acquittals on the charges of criminal negligence.  The Ontario
Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.  It is from this
Order that the present appeal is taken.

 

    The
events giving rise to this appeal occurred on September 8, 1984.  Between
approximately 3:15 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on that day the appellant consumed about
five bottles or tins of beer at a fall fair in the arena at Drayton, Ontario.  
At about 7:00 p.m. he consumed two more bottles of beer.  At about 8:20 p.m. on
the same day the Bethel Mennonite Church hayride commenced.  The hayride was
made up of three tractors each of which towed one wagon containing bales of
hay.   The wagons proceeded along the public road, one after the other, and
some forty or fifty people, mostly young, rode in the wagons.  The accused
accompanied by two friends followed the wagons in his car.  He had a bottle or
tin of beer in his hand while driving.  Evidence was given by certain witnesses
that some of the hayride participants, four or five in number, were walking or
running along the road beside the wagons and moving from the second wagon to
the first wagon.  The appellant drove past the wagons and he and his passengers
testified that in passing the vehicles they did not observe anyone on the
roadway.  Having passed the hayride, the appellant proceeded some distance down
the highway and there turned his car around and drove back along the road
towards the now oncoming hayride.  The appellant gave evidence that at this
time he said to his companions: ""Let's see how close we can get."" 
One of the passengers testified that the accused had said:  ""Let's play
chicken.""  The accused drove toward the hayride on the left side of the
road.  He was thus heading directly for the hayride vehicles and travelling on
their side of the road.  The posted speed on the road was 50 m.p.h.   The
accused testified that he was travelling at approximately 70 m.p.h.  Other
estimates of the speed, drawn from the evidence given at trial, vary from 50 to
90 m.p.h.  The appellant at this time was driving without his headlights.  He
was using only fog lights though the state of light was such that headlights
would ordinarily have been required.  He continued in the left lane approaching
the hayride until he was, according to the evidence, some 150 feet from the
leading tractor, at which time he swerved into the right lane to pass the
hayride.  As he passed the wagons he struck five members of the hayride party
who were on the roadway running along beside the wagons.  Four were struck by
the car and killed;  one was injured, suffering a fractured leg.  After the
impact the appellant brought his vehicle to a halt and removed a cooler of beer
from the trunk and threw it into the adjacent field.

 

    Evidence
was given at trial of blood alcohol readings taken after the accident.  They
showed that the appellant's blood alcohol level was something in excess of 80
milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, and expert evidence was to
the effect that the appellant's blood alcohol would have been approximately 110
to 112 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood at the time of the
accident.  The appellant and his passengers testified that they had not
expected to find any of the hayride party on the road, and the appellant
testified to the effect that he was not aware of the presence of anyone on the
road until the accident occurred.

 

    The
offence of causing death by criminal negligence with which the appellant was
charged is created by s. 203  of the Criminal Code , which
is in these terms: 

 

    203.  Every
one who by criminal negligence causes death to another person is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

 

Criminal
negligence is defined in s. 202(1) of the Code in
these terms:

 

    202. (1) Every one is criminally negligent
who

 

(a) in doing anything, or

 

(b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do,

 

shows
wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.

 

The key
words in any consideration of this section are:  ""shows wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  The Code has
defined the concept of criminal negligence and the issue raised in this appeal
is how the Code definition should be applied.  More
particularly, how should a jury be instructed when it must consider a case
involving a charge of criminal negligence?

 

    The
crime of criminal negligence is a crime which, like other criminal offences,
requires proof by the Crown of a mens rea.  In instructing
the jury on this question, the trial judge set out the following test.  He
said:

 

    On all the evidence, after considering all the
circumstances, are you satisfied that the accused's conduct was such as to
amount to a wanton or reckless disregard for the safety of other persons?

 

    The driver of a motor vehicle on a public highway is
under a duty to take care in its operation so as to avoid injury to persons or
property of others, and if he fails in that duty and his acts or omissions are
of such a character as to show this wanton or reckless disregard for the lives
and safety of others then, according to the law, that conduct amounts to
criminal negligence.

 

    The
lack of intention to cause harm is not an answer to a charge of criminal
negligence.  What you are concerned with is the conduct of the accused at the
time of the accident or immediately prior thereto, and if that conduct, when
you view it objectively, shows a wanton and reckless disregard for the lives
and safety of others, then that is criminal negligence as defined in the
Criminal Code .

 

And he
added later:

 

    If
the evidence satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt that the driving behaviour
of the accused was a flagrant departure from normal driving standards, in the
absence of some explanation, some rational explanation, then the driving
conduct is properly characterized as criminal negligence.  Dangerous driving,
to give you a distinction between them, is conduct of a lesser nature and it
lacks that high degree of moral fault required for criminal negligence.

 

In this,
it is my opinion that the trial judge correctly dealt with the question.  He
was telling the jury that the mens rea required for proof
of the commission of the offence could be found in the conduct of the accused. 
He did not mention specifically the test which has become accepted in this and
most appellate courts in Canada, to the effect that criminal negligence is shown
where the Crown proves conduct on the part of the accused which shows a marked
and substantial departure from the standard of behaviour expected of a
reasonably prudent person in the circumstances, but in my view he conveyed in
the quoted words an adequate instruction.

 

    After
about two hours of deliberation the jury returned for further instructions and
put the following question to the trial judge:

 

What is
the moral difference between dangerous driving and criminal negligence.  We
want a clearer definition.

 

The
trial judge heard submissions from counsel on the question of the test for
determining the mens rea of criminal negligence and then gave
the jury a further direction in these terms:

 

    The position is that in dangerous driving the
intention or the state of mind, if you wish, of the driver is not important. 
You look objectively at the manner of driving.  You just look at the manner of
driving.

 

    Now,
when you go over to criminal negligence, you have to look at two things, the
objective driving, as you do for dangerous driving, and you also have to look
at the subjective element, that is the attitude, or what is in the mind of the
accused.  That is whether there is a deliberate and wilful assumption of the
risk involved in driving in the manner in which he was driving.  So that you
have in one, the dangerous driving, there is simply an objective standard, as
compared to what the prudent driver would do.  In the criminal negligence you
have that, plus the subjective element of assumption and deliberate assumption
of the risk.

 

The jury
then returned a verdict of not guilty on all the criminal negligence charges
but guilty of dangerous driving on all charges.

 

    In
the Court of Appeal (Martin, Thorsen and Cory JJ.A.) the Crown's appeal was
allowed and a new trial was ordered.  The judgment of the Court was written by
Cory J.A. (as he then was) and is now reported at (1986), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 327. 
Cory J.A. considered that the requisite mens rea for
criminal negligence may be objectively determined from the action or conduct of
an accused.  He considered that the trial judge in responding to the question
from the jury was in error in telling the jury that criminal negligence
involves a subjective element and requires the deliberate assumption of risk by
an accused.  He was also of the view that the trial judge's final instructions
placed too high an onus on the Crown, in requiring the application by the jury
of a subjective test for the determination of the required mens rea.  He
said, at p. 344:

 

    This
placed too high an onus on the Crown.  As indicated by Morden J.A. in R. v.
Sharp, supra, it would have been sufficient had
the trial judge simply read s. 202 of the Code to the
jury together with the instruction that the driving had to amount to a marked
and substantial departure from the standard of a reasonable driver.

 

    The
appellant argued in this Court that the Court of Appeal erred in adopting an
objective test in determining the mens rea of criminal
negligence.  It was argued that such a test was not in accord with the
authorities, and that a subjective test inquiring into the mind and mental
state of the accused was required.  It was also argued that the Court of Appeal
had erred in arriving at the conclusion that the Crown had satisfied the onus
that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same in the absence of the
error found in the charge to the jury.  In my view, neither of these arguments
can succeed.

 

    The
judgment of the Court of Appeal was based upon a detailed and careful review of
the history of the concept of criminal negligence as an element in the criminal
law and a full discussion of the differing views on the question.  I do not
feel that any useful purpose would be served by covering again the ground
already covered in the Court of Appeal.  It is my view that the subject has
been fully and adequately dealt with in the reported reasons and, with one
exception, I would adopt the reasons of the court which in my view otherwise
correctly state the law.

 

    In
limiting the application of the objective test to cases involving acts of
commission and in holding that an objective test will not suffice for cases
involving acts of omission, it is my view that Cory J.A. was in error.  It
would appear that in so doing he was following the judgment of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Tutton and Tutton (1985), 18 C.C.C.
(3d) 328, where Dubin J.A. drew a distinction between acts of commission and
omission, and held, at p. 345, that a subjective test should be used in cases
which were based on acts of omission.  I would, however, reject that view for
reasons which are expressed in the R. v. Tutton case in this
Court, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 000, and hold that an objective test must be applied in
cases based on an allegation of criminal negligence, whether by acts of
commission or omission.  In all other respects I would, as I have said, adopt
as my own the reasons for judgment of Cory J.A., dismiss the appeal, and confirm
the order for a new trial.

law -- Criminal negligence -- Necessaries of life ‑‑ Manslaughter
-- Diabetic child dying after insulin withdrawn by parents ‑‑ Parents'
action motivated by belief that son cured by Divine intervention ‑‑ Belief

    Respondents
were parents of a five‑year‑old diabetic.  They believed in faith
healing but their religious convictions did not prevent them from seeking and
acting on medical advice or from taking medicines.  As the result of the
intentional withholding of prescribed insulin upon the belief that the child
had been miraculously cured, the child died.

 

    Respondents
were charged with causing their son's death by criminal negligence in that they
denied him the necessaries of life without lawful excuse and thereby committed
manslaughter.  They raised the defence of an honest although mistaken belief in
the existence of a circumstance which would render their conduct non‑culpable. 
Respondents were convicted of manslaughter and appealed to the Court of Appeal
which set aside the convictions and directed new trials.  This appeal was taken
by leave.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

absence of proof of a blameworthy state of mind, either as an inference from
the nature of the act committed or by other evidence, does not sit comfortably
with the principles of penal liability and fundamental justice.  A serious
criminal offence, absent clear statutory language and purpose to the contrary,
should not be interpreted as an absolute liability offence.  Rather, the
presumption should be in favour of some degree of mental blameworthiness if the
text and purpose can support such an interpretation.

 

    Section
202  of the Criminal Code  is notorious in
its ambiguity; its interpretation depends on which words are emphasized.  Given
its fundamental ambiguity, it should be given the interpretation most consonant
not only with its text and purpose but also, where possible, with the broader
concepts and principles of the criminal law.

 

    The
phrase ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other
persons"" signifies more than gross negligence in the objective sense.  It
requires some degree of awareness or advertence to the threat to the lives or
safety of others or alternatively a wilful blindness to that threat which is
culpable in light of the gravity of the risk assumed.

 

    Conduct
that displays a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others
will constitute the actus reus of the offence under s. 202  and be prima
facie evidence of the accused's blameworthy state of mind.  A
person functioning with normal faculties of awareness and engaging in a grave
departure from the norm can be assumed to be either aware of the risk or
wilfully blind to it.  Proof of the conduct will cast an evidentiary burden on
the accused to explain why the inference should not be drawn.

 

    Malice
or intent in the sense of a mind directed to a purpose is not an element of s.
202 .  The fact that an accused may desire or calculate that his purpose can be
achieved without the realization of the risk does not relieve the accused of
liability under s. 202  if he either adverted to or became aware of the risk or
closed his eyes to the reality of it.

 

    This
Court has established that the criminal negligence prohibited under s. 202  is
advertent negligence.  The case for the adoption of an objective standard of
liability is not strong enough to justify a departure from established
principles.  Before overruling a previous decision, the Court should consider
the introduction of the Charter, the alteration of a precedent in
later authorities, the creation of uncertainty by the continued existence of
the precedent and whether overturning the precedent will expand the range of
criminal liability and work to the detriment of the accused.  A departure from
established principles is not justified in this case.

 

    Proof
of the mental element of advertence to the risk or wilful blindness to the risk
will not undermine the policy objectives of s. 202 .  The subjective test would
at most offer protection for those who due to some peculiarity or unexpected
accident commit conduct which, although wanton or reckless with respect to the
lives and safety of others, can be explained as inconsistent with any degree of
awareness of or wilful blindness to such a risk.

 

    A
subjective interpretation of s. 202  does not render superfluous the role of
manslaughter within the scheme of the Code's
homicide provisions.  The murder provisions will in general be available only
if a higher degree of intent is proven than awareness of or wilful disregard of
a risk to the lives and safety of others.

    Constitutional
issues did not arise in this case, and constitutional considerations would not
be precluded if a case involving constitutionality were to arise.

 

    Per
McIntyre and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.:  An objective test must be used in
determining criminal negligence.  It is the conduct of the accused, not his
intention or mental state, which is examined.  No distinction should be made
between any acts of commission or omission.  Section 202  clearly applies to a
person who is negligent in doing anything or in omitting to do
anything that is his duty and shows a wanton or reckless disregard for the
lives or safety of others.

 

    Negligence
is a factor that may lead to criminal liability.  It connotes the opposite of
thought‑directed action and precludes the element of positive intent to
achieve a given result.  Section 202 , therefore, restrains conduct and its
results; it punishes the consequence of mindless action and not the state of
mind.

 

    The
application of the objective test under s. 202  may not be made in a vacuum. 
The surrounding circumstances and the accused's perception of those facts must
be considered in order to determine whether or not his conduct was reasonable. 
Where an offence rests on the concept of negligence, honestly held belief in
circumstances which would afford a defence must, to be effective, be reasonably
held.

 

    Here,
the jury should consider respondents' belief that their son had been cured by
Divine intervention in light of the whole background of the case in order to
determine if it was honest and reasonable.  The jury would then have to
determine if their conduct represented a marked and significant departure from
the standard to be observed by reasonably prudent parents.

 

    Per Lamer
J.:  The reasons of McIntyre J. were agreed with, subject to certain
considerations.  Firstly, the application of the objective norm in s. 202  of the Criminal
Code  must make generous allowance for factors particular to
the accused such as youth, mental development and education.  Further,
Parliament did not determine the nature of the negligence required to ground
criminal liability when enacting s. 202  but merely defined the expression
""criminal negligence"" wherever used in the Code. 
Finally, the constitutionality of s. 205(5) (b) was
not in issue in this case.  Assuming without now deciding that it is a
principle of fundamental justice that knowledge of a likely risk or deliberate
ignorance thereof (foresight or wilful blindness) is an essential element of
the offence of manslaughter, the issue as to whether proof of the substituted
element of ""criminal negligence"" as defined by Parliament and interpreted
by this Court satisfies the test set out in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 636, does not arise.  This constitutional consideration is not to be
precluded by concurrence in McIntyre J.'s decision.

//Wilson J.//

 

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Wilson and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

    WILSON J. -- I
have had the benefit of the reasons of my colleagues Justices McIntyre and
Lamer and I agree with them that the appeal should be dismissed and a new trial
ordered because the trial judge's charge failed to make clear to the jury that
the Crown had the burden to prove all the elements of the offence of
manslaughter by criminal negligence.  I do not, however, agree with my
colleagues' conclusion that criminal negligence under s. 202 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, consists only of conduct in
breach of an objective standard and does not require the Crown to prove that
the accused had any degree of guilty knowledge.  I also have reservations
concerning the approach my colleagues suggest is available in order to relieve
against the harshness of the objective standard of liability which they find in
s. 202 and to ensure that the morally innocent are not punished for the
commission of serious criminal offences committed through criminal negligence.

 

    The
facts and the judgments below are fully set out in the judgment of my colleague
McIntyre J.  I wish only to emphasize two points.  The respondents' defence in
this case centred around their claim of honest but mistaken belief as to the
nature of their son's condition.  Although the respondents were aware that
their son was a diabetic who needed regular insulin injections, they claimed
that because of their religious convictions they sincerely believed that he had
been cured by divine intervention and were unaware of the serious nature of his
illness following the withdrawal of insulin. For example, in a statement
provided to the police shortly after her son's death from the complications of
diabetic hyperglycemia the respondent Carol Anne Tutton stated:

 

Complete
faith in Jesus and obedience to the word of God is the reason for our decision
to cease giving Chris insulin.  Since I have accepted Jesus as my personal
Saviour and Lord.  He has revealed himself to me in vision and spoke in words
of his own that Christopher is healed and further that complete faith in Him
not man's doctrine or shall I say the world's teachings will bring forth the
manifestation of this healing.  Standing on the promises of God and His holy
Word 100%, Wednesday, October 14, 1981 I did not administer Christopher
insulin.  Thursday and Wednesday Christopher ate, played normally although
Thursday evening he became sick to his stomach.  Friday I kept him home from
school and he kept liquids in his stomach.  Saturday morning until
approximately 1:00 PM he was resting comfortably.  I left him to make myself a
sandwich about five perhaps ten minutes, rechecked him and found him to be not
breathing.  My husband administered mouth to mouth resuscitation until the
police department arrived about five minutes later.

 

    The
second point which I wish to emphasize is that the Ontario Court of Appeal
((1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 328) would not have applied an objective standard of
liability in this case.  Dubin J.A. stated at p. 345:

 

    I do
not think, however, that a loving and caring parent who omits to seek medical
assistance because of the honest but mistaken belief that his or her child was
not in need of such assistance should be found to have shown a wanton or
reckless disregard for its life or safety merely because it can be said that
reasonable parents would have responded otherwise, or even that in omitting to
seek medical assistance, there was a marked and substantial departure from the
standard of care of reasonable parents.  In such a case, I think a distinction
should be made between acts of commission and acts of omission and, in the
latter case, a subjective test should be used.

 

The
Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury
that no mens rea was required for the crime of manslaughter by means of
criminal negligence.  Dubin J.A. stated at pp. 349-50:

 

    In this case, from the portion of the judge's charge
which I have reproduced above, the jury could not have helped but be under the
impression that a departure from the standard of care of reasonable parents
constituted a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of
Christopher.  Throughout, the test given was purely an objective one.  In the
portion of the charge that I have reproduced, no other definition of wanton or
reckless was provided to the jury.

 

    In my opinion, for a conviction of manslaughter in
this case, the jury had to be satisfied that the appellants, in failing to
administer insulin and/or to seek timely medical assistance, knew that there
was a risk to the life or safety of Christopher and unjustifiably took that
risk, or closed their minds to any such risk out of a disregard for his life or
safety.  It would have been open to the jury in this case to conclude, notwithstanding
the protestations of the parents, that they knew that Christopher had not been
cured, particularly having regard to what had transpired the year before, and
that they knew that there was a risk of harm in their failure to continue the
administration of insulin.

 

    It would also have been open to the jury to reject
the parents' testimony as to the child's condition following the withdrawal of
insulin, and to conclude that it was apparent to them that he needed medical
assistance at that time.

 

    Thus,
in considering the state of mind of the appellants, the jury were entitled to
take into consideration all the evidence.  What reasonable parents might have
done under the circumstances is only relevant in determining the state of mind
of the appellants.  But unless they were satisfied that the parents actually
knew of the risk of harm, or that they completely closed their minds to it out
of a disregard for the life or safety of Christopher, the jury could not
convict of manslaughter.

 

    For
convenience, I reproduce here the relevant sections of the Criminal
Code :

 

    197.  (1)  Every one is under a legal duty

 

(a) as a parent, foster parent, guardian or head of a
family, to provide necessaries of life for a child under the age of sixteen
years;

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

    (2)  Every one commits an offence who, being under a
legal duty within the meaning of subsection (1), fails without lawful excuse,
the proof of which lies upon him, to perform that duty, if

 

(a) with respect to a duty imposed by paragraph (1)(a) or (b),

 

(i) the person to whom the duty is owed is in destitute
or necessitous circumstances, or

 

(ii) the failure to perform the duty endangers the life
of the person to whom the duty is owed, or causes or is likely to cause the
health of that person to be endangered permanently; or

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

    202. (1)  Every one is criminally
negligent who

 

(a)  in doing anything, or

 

(b)  in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do,

 

shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons.

 

    205. (1)  A person commits homicide when,
directly or indirectly, by any means, he causes the death of a human being.

 

    (2) Homicide is culpable or not culpable.

 

    (3) Homicide that is not culpable is not an offence.

 

    (4) Culpable homicide is murder or manslaughter or
infanticide.

 

    (5) A person commits culpable homicide when he
causes the death of a human being, 

 

(a) by means of an unlawful act,

 

(b) by criminal negligence,

 

(c) by causing that human being, by threats or fear of
violence or by deception, to do anything that causes his death, or

 

(d) by wilfully frightening that human being, in the case
of a child or sick person.

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

    219.  Every
one who commits manslaughter is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable
to imprisonment for life.

 

    I
wish to deal first with the implications of my colleagues' approach in this
case.  By concluding that s. 202  of the Criminal Code
prohibits conduct and the consequences of mindless action absent any
blameworthy state of mind, they have, in effect, held that the crime of
criminal negligence is an absolute liability offence.  Conviction follows upon
proof of conduct which reveals a marked and substantial departure from the
standard expected of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances
regardless of what was actually in the accused's mind at the time the act was
committed.

 

    I
take as the point of commencement the following statement of Justice Dickson
(as he then was) in R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R.
1299, at pp. 1309-10:

 

Where the offence is criminal, the Crown must establish
a mental element, namely, that the accused who committed the prohibited act did
so intentionally or recklessly, with knowledge of the facts constituting the
offence, or with wilful blindness toward them.  Mere negligence is excluded
from the concept of the mental element required for conviction. Within the
context of a criminal prosecution a person who fails to make such enquiries as
a reasonable and prudent person would make, or who fails to know facts he
should have known, is innocent in the eyes of the law.

 

    In
sharp contrast, ""absolute liability"" entails conviction on proof
merely that the defendant committed the prohibited act constituting the actus reus of the
offence.  There is no relevant mental element. It is no defence that the
accused was entirely without fault.  He may be morally innocent in every sense,
yet be branded as a malefactor and punished as such.

 

This
Court made clear in Sault Ste. Marie and other cases
that the imposition of criminal liability in the absence of proof of a
blameworthy state of mind, either as an inference from the nature of the act
committed or by other evidence, is an anomaly which does not sit comfortably
with the principles of penal liability and fundamental justice:  see also Beaver v.
The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 531, Pappajohn v. The
Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, Sansregret v. The
Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, and R. v. Robertson, [1987]
1 S.C.R. 918.  This is particularly so in the case of offences carrying a
substantial term of imprisonment which by their nature, severity and attendant
stigma are true criminal offences aimed at punishing culpable behaviour as opposed
to securing the public welfare.  In the absence of clear statutory language and
purpose to the contrary, this Court should, in my view, be most reluctant to
interpret a serious criminal offence as an absolute liability offence.  As
Dickson J. stated in Sault Ste. Marie at p. 1326:

 

Offences
of absolute liability would be those in respect of which the Legislature had
made it clear that guilt would follow proof merely of the proscribed act.  The
overall regulatory pattern adopted by the Legislature, the subject matter of
the legislation, the importance of the penalty, and the precision of the
language used will be primary considerations in determining whether the offence
falls into the third category.

 

    In
this case there can be no doubt that we are dealing with a serious criminal
offence.  The appellants are charged with committing manslaughter by criminal
negligence.  Under s. 219 of the Criminal Code  then in
force they are liable to imprisonment for life.  Other offences committed by
means of criminal negligence are also serious.  For example, causing death by
criminal negligence is an indictable offence under s. 203 of the Code
carrying with it a liability to life imprisonment.  Causing bodily harm by
criminal negligence is an indictable offence under s. 204 of the Code
carrying a liability to ten years' imprisonment.  Criminal negligence in the
operation of a motor vehicle could be prosecuted under s. 233 of the Code then in
force as an indictable offence with a liability to five years' imprisonment.  Taking
the above considerations into account, can it be said that s. 202 of the Code creates
an absolute liability offence for which conviction will follow on proof of the
proscribed act without reference to the accused's state of mind?

 

     My
colleague McIntyre J. has concluded that upon the wording of s. 202  it is an
inescapable conclusion that Parliament intended liability to follow upon proof
of the act or conduct described in the section.  In particular, he stresses the
reference to conduct which shows wanton or reckless disregard for the
lives and safety of others and the fact that what is prohibited is criminal negligence.
McIntyre J. states at p. 000:

 

In
choosing the test to be applied in assessing conduct under s. 202  of the Criminal
Code , it must be observed at once that what is made criminal
is negligence.  Negligence connotes the opposite of thought-directed action. 
In other words, its existence precludes the element of positive intent to
achieve a given result.  This leads to the conclusion that what is sought to be
restrained by punishment under s. 202 of the Code is
conduct, and its results.  What is punished, in other words, is not the state
of mind but the consequences of mindless action.  This is apparent, I suggest,
from the words of the section, which makes criminal, conduct which shows
wanton or reckless disregard.  It may be observed as well that the words
""wanton or reckless"" support this construction, denying as they do
the existence of a directing mental state.  Nor can it be said that criminal
negligence, as defined in s. 202 , imports in its terms some element of malice
or intention.

 

    Section
202 of the Code is, in my view, notorious in its
ambiguity.  Since its enactment in its present form in the 1955 Amendments to the Criminal
Code  it has bedevilled both courts and commentators who have
sought out its meaning.  The interpretation put upon it usually depends upon
which words are emphasized.  On the one hand, my colleague's judgment
demonstrates that emphasizing the use of the words ""shows"" and
""negligence"" can lead to the conclusion that an objective standard of
liability was intended and that proof of unreasonable conduct alone will
suffice.  On the other hand, if the words ""wanton or reckless disregard
for the lives or safety of other persons"" are stressed along with the fact
that what is prohibited is not negligence simpliciter but
""criminal"" negligence, one might conclude that Parliament intended
some degree of advertence to the risk to the lives or safety of others to be an
essential element of the offence.  When faced with such fundamental ambiguity,
it would be my view that the court should give the provision the interpretation
most consonant, not only with the text and purpose of the provision, but also,
where possible, with the broader concepts and principles of the law:  see also R. v. Paré, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 618.  

 

    It
is obviously important to give meaning and effect to each word employed in s.
202 .  Under that section every one is criminally negligent who in doing or in
omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do shows wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  As I have stated, the
presumption when we are dealing with a serious criminal offence should be in
favour of a requirement of some degree of mental blameworthiness if the text
and purpose of the section are susceptible of such an interpretation.  This
Court, in its previous consideration of s. 202 , concluded that it was intended
to prohibit advertent negligence in the sense that the accused must be fixed
with an awareness of the risk that is being prohibited.  In O'Grady v.
Sparling, [1960] S.C.R. 804, Judson J., in comparing what is now
s. 202  with a provincial prohibition against driving ""without due care or
without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway""
stated at p. 808:

 

    There is a fundamental difference between the
subject-matter of these two pieces of legislation which the appellant's
argument does not recognize.  It is a difference in kind and not merely one of
degree.  This difference has been recognized and emphasized in the recent
writings of Glanville Williams on Criminal Law, para. 28, p. 82, and by J. W.
C. Turner in the 17th edition of Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law.  I adopt as
part of my reasons Turner's statement of the difference to be found at p. 34 of
Kenny:

 

    But
it should now be recognized that at common law there is no criminal
liability for harm thus caused by inadvertence.  This has been laid down
authoritatively for manslaughter again and again.  There are only two states of
mind which constitute mens rea, and they are intention and
recklessness.  The difference between recklessness and negligence is
the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is
a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence.  The
common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some
moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or
""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to
great confusion of thought and of principle.  It is equally misleading to speak
of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain
itself.

 

Despite
the sometimes confusing characterization of the distinct crime of dangerous
driving (which I note is not in issue on this appeal), the O'Grady v.
Sparling view of criminal negligence was affirmed by various
members of the Court in obiter comments in Mann v.
The Queen, [1966] S.C.R. 238, at p. 243, Binus v.
The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 594, at pp. 598 and 600, and Peda v.
The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 905, at pp. 911-12, 917-18 and 919-20. 
These cases are, in my respectful view, very relevant to the question that the
Court faces on this appeal.  They indicate that on previous occasions the Court
considered s. 202  susceptible of an interpretation in keeping with the general
principle that some degree of guilty knowledge is an element of all serious
criminal offences.  It is true that the offence of criminal negligence was not
directly in issue in these cases, but at no time did any member of the Court
suggest that the subjective approach to the interpretation of the offence of
criminal negligence in O'Grady v. Sparling was incorrect or
inconsistent with the statutory language or purpose.

 

    In Peda v.
The Queen Pigeon J., delivering a concurring judgment for himself
and Justice Ritchie, elaborated on the Court's interpretation of s. 202(1)
(then s. 191(1)) in O'Grady v. Sparling as follows at pp.
919-20:

 

    Therefore
the essential basis on which subsection 1 was held to be aimed at a kind of
negligence different from the negligence contemplated in the enactments of
regulatory authorities is that ""criminal negligence"" requires mens rea.  It
follows, of course, that inadvertent negligence is not criminal.  Because
negligence in the usual language includes both advertent and inadvertent
negligence, it is obvious that in charging a jury on an indictment for
""criminal negligence"" a judge must in some way explain adequately the
kind of negligence that is criminal and make it clear, but not necessarily in
those words, that inadvertent negligence is not criminal.  It may well be that
he can do it by using the language of s. 191(1), seeing that ""wanton or
reckless"" undoubtedly exclude mere inadvertence.

He then
stated at p. 920:

 

By virtue of s. 191(1), a conviction for ""criminal
negligence"" requires ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons"".  As against that, subs. 4 contemplates danger to
other persons only.  There is, therefore, ample room for distinction between
the two offences even excluding inadvertence from the lesser.

 

    However,
wantonness and recklessness of themselves clearly imply the exclusion of mere
inadvertence while ""dangerous driving"" does not necessarily.

 

Pigeon
J.'s interpretation of the criminal negligence provisions of the Code
stresses the phrase ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety
of other persons"" and the qualification of negligence by the word
""criminal"".  I would respectfully agree that these elements in the
section militate against a purely objective standard of liability.

 

    It
is my view that the phrase ""reckless disregard for the lives or safety of
other persons"" found in s. 202 , when read in the context of Canadian
criminal law jurisprudence, requires the Crown to prove advertence or awareness
of the risk that the prohibited consequences will come to pass.  This Court has
adopted a subjective approach to recklessness in Pappajohn v. The
Queen, supra,  and has reaffirmed this in the
recent case of Sansregret v. The Queen, supra.  In
doing so the Court has, I believe, implicitly rejected the view that failure to
give any thought to whether or not there is a risk can be substituted for the
mental state of recklessness as that view is articulated in the majority
decisions in Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis v. Caldwell, [1982]
A.C. 341 (H.L.), and R. v. Lawrence, [1982] A.C. 510
(H.L.)

 

    The
expression ""wanton"" disregard for the lives and safety of others is
perhaps less clear.  The word ""wanton"" taken in its acontextual sense
could signal an element of randomness or arbitrariness more akin to an
objective standard but, given the context in which it appears, coupled with the
adjective reckless, and its clear use to accentuate and make more heinous the
already serious matter of disregard for the lives or safety of others, I would
think that the preferable interpretation is that the word wanton was intended
to connote wilful blindness to the prohibited risk:  see P. J. T. O'Hearn
""Criminal Negligence: An Analysis in Depth"" (1964-65), 7 Crim. L.Q. 27, at
p. 411.

 

    In
short, the phrase ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of
other persons"" signifies more than gross negligence in the objective
sense.  It requires some degree of awareness or advertence to the threat to the
lives or safety of others or alternatively a wilful blindness to that threat
which is culpable in light of the gravity of the risk that is prohibited.

 

    In
recent years courts and commentators have sought to deal with those aspects of
s. 202  which seem to be in tension with a subjective standard. In his valuable
treatise Principles of Criminal Law (1986), Professor
Colvin has written at p. 120:

 

    The
reference to showing wanton or reckless disregard in s.
202  can be used to support the objective test.  It is submitted, however, that
it is wrong to interpret s. 202  as a complete definition of criminal negligence
which includes its mens rea.  The better interpretation is that
the section does no more than define the conduct which
is involved in criminal negligence.  Mens rea then remains to be
implied in accordance with general principles and this is in effect what the
Supreme Court did in O'Grady.  This construction is supported by
the statement in another Supreme Court case that ""conduct disclosing
wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others constitutes prima
facie evidence of criminal negligence"".  [Emphasis in
original.]

 

The
other Supreme Court case to which Professor Colvin refers is Arthurs v.
The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 287, in which Ritchie J. after examining
the wording of s. 202  stated, at p. 292:

 

. . .
conduct disclosing wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or  safety of
others constitutes prima facie evidence of
criminal negligence.

 

Ritchie
J. then went on to elaborate on what this test means in the context of deciding
whether the trial judge had erred in failing to outline a possible defence to
the jury.  He stated at p. 294

 

    I
think that the second question must be governed by the test which I indicated
at the outset, and that question therefore is whether the learned trial judge
failed to outline to the jury any theory of the defence which was consistent
with the appellant having acted otherwise than with wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives and safety of others.

 

What
emerges from the test outlined by Ritchie J. in Arthurs v. The Queen is, in
my view, a very workable test that is consistent with both the text and purpose
of s. 202  and with the basic principles of penal liability.  Conduct that
displays a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others will
constitute the actus reus of the offence under s. 202  and be prima
facie evidence of the accused's blameworthy state of mind. 
It can be assumed that a person functioning with normal faculties of awareness
and engaging in conduct which represents such a grave departure from the norm
is either aware of the risk or is wilfully blind to the risk.  Proof of the
conduct will, in other words, cast an evidential burden on the accused to
explain why the normal inference of conscious awareness or wilful blindness
should not be drawn.  The inference will arise in most cases because the intent
requirement under s. 202  is the minimal intent requirement of awareness or
advertence or wilful blindness to the prohibited risk.  As Ritchie J. noted in Arthurs v.
The Queen at p. 298 the more expansive intent requirement of
deliberation is not a necessary element of the offence set out in s. 202 .

 

    I
agree with my colleague McIntyre J. that malice or intent in the sense of a
mind directed to a purpose is not an element of s. 202 .  Moreover, the fact
that the accused may desire or calculate that his purpose can be achieved without
the realization of the risk does not relieve the accused of liability under s.
202  if he either adverted to or became aware of the risk to the lives or safety
of others or wilfully closed his eyes to the reality of that risk.

 

    The
approach to criminal negligence set out in Arthurs v. The Queen also
finds support in the subsequent case of Leblanc v. The Queen, [1977]
1 S.C.R. 339.  In that case the issue was whether evidence of similar facts was
admissible to prove the mens rea of an accused who was charged with
causing death by criminal negligence when he fatally struck a person while
making a low pass in a bush plane.  De Grandpré J. observed at p. 356 that
""in most cases, the fact itself proves the intent"" but that it
remained open to the Crown to prove the mens rea not
only on the basis of an inference from the commission of the act itself but
also by evidence such as the similar facts of previous low passes in order to
prove that the accused must have been aware of the risk created by such
dangerous methods of flying an airplane.  Dickson J., in dissent, approved of
the statement in Arthurs v. The Queen that conduct
disclosing a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others
constitutes prima facie evidence of
negligence but held at p. 346 that the evidence of similar facts was not
admissible because the ""mens rea of criminal
negligence is determined by an objective standard"".  I find a certain
ambiguity in this position because, in my respectful opinion, the mens rea of
advertent negligence can in most cases be determined by reference to an
objective standard without in the final analysis itself constituting an
objective standard.  Similarly, the dissent of Chief Justice Laskin in Arthurs v.
The Queen can also perhaps be reconciled with the Court's holding
in O'Grady v. Sparling that criminal negligence consists of
advertent negligence in so far as the Chief Justice's dissent stands for the
propositions that (1) the defence of accident designed to deny some necessary
mental element should have been explained to the jury (pp. 308-312) and (2) the
requirement of deliberation or in his words ""subjective intent"" was
not a necessary element of the offence of criminal negligence as set out by the
Court in O'Grady v. Sparling, Binus v.
The Queen, and Peda v. The Queen (pp. 306-307).  In
any event, I would respectfully agree with Professor Colvin's comment on this
Court's decision in Leblanc in ""Recklessness and Criminal
Negligence"" (1982), 32 U. of T. L.J. 345, at p. 356.

 

    The
decision of the majority in Leblanc establishes that O'Grady v.
Sparling remains good law on the mental element of criminal
negligence.  The test is subjective:  the actor himself must have known of the
risks of his conduct.  Those provincial appellate courts which have espoused an
objective test are in error.  This is not meant to suggest, however, that the
decisions in the particular cases were wrong.  The results would perhaps have
been the same even if a subjective test had been used.

 

    It
is my view that the jurisprudence of this Court to date establishes that the
criminal negligence prohibited under s. 202  is advertent negligence.  I would
not hesitate to depart from these precedents for solid reasons but I cannot,
with due respect to those who think otherwise, agree that the case for the
adoption of an objective standard of liability has been made out to the extent
required to justify a departure from this Court's previous decisions.  On the
standard required to justify a departure from the practice of stare
decisis, I find the comments of the Chief Justice in his
dissent in R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
833, at pp. 849-861, instructive. In R. v. Bernard the
Chief Justice suggests that before overruling one of its prior decisions the
Court consider the introduction of the Charter, the
attenuation of a precedent in later authorities, the creation of uncertainty by
the continued existence of the precedent and whether the overturning of the
precedent will expand the range of criminal liability and work to the detriment
of the accused.  Considering these factors in the case at bar, the burden to
justify such a departure would, in my view, be especially high given that O'Grady v.
Sparling has not been attenuated by the subsequent jurisprudence
of this Court and the effect of the change proposed here is to expand criminal
liability beyond its normal limits and to the detriment of the accused.  The
adoption of an objective standard also creates, in my view, both the
possibility of a Charter violation and uncertainty as to the
relevance of factors subjective to the accused under the new objective
standard.

 

    As I
have suggested above, the words of the section can reasonably bear an
interpretation which leaves room for the mental element of awareness or advertence
to a risk to the lives or safety of others or wilful blindness to such risk. 
Conduct which shows a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives and safety of
others will by its nature constitute prima facie
evidence of the mental element, and in the absence of some evidence that casts
doubt on the normal degree of mental awareness, proof of the act and reference
to what a reasonable person in the circumstances must have realized will lead
to a conclusion that the accused was aware of the risk or wilfully blind to the
risk.

 

    Professor
Glanville Williams in his work Criminal Law: The General Part (2nd
ed. 1961) explained the minimal nature of the mental element for advertent
negligence and the important evidentiary use of objective standards in
determining the subjective state of mind of what he terms advertent negligence.
He defined the requirement of recklessness in advertent negligence as follows
at pp. 53-55:

 

    If the actor foresaw the probability of the
consequences he is regarded as reckless, even though he fervently desired and
hoped for the exact opposite of the consequence, and even though he did his
best (short of abandoning his main project) to avoid it....  Recklessness is
any determination to pursue conduct with knowledge of the risks involved though
without a desire that they should eventuate.

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

. . .
recklessness may be a mere passing realization, instantly dismissed, which
leaves no mark upon conduct.

 

Likewise,
P. J. T. O'Hearn has indicated that the requirements of advertent negligence
encompass any consciousness of the prohibited risk or ""the mental state of
one who is doing what appears to be taking chances but who is blindly wilful in
doing so"":  ""Criminal Negligence: An Analysis in Depth"", supra, at p.
422.  To take account of the minimal nature of the mental element of
recklessness, Professor Williams explained in Criminal Law:  The
General Part, supra, at pp. 55-56:

 

    On
an issue of recklessness, these considerations may be put before the jury. 
There is no objection to instructing the jury to consider whether the defendant must have
foreseen the consequence, but it is fatally easy to confuse this with the
question whether the defendant ought as a reasonable
man to have foreseen it.  The latter question presupposes an objective test of
the reasonable man, and the accused person's actual foresight is immaterial. 
The former question is directed exclusively to the accused's actual foresight,
and the test of what a reasonable man would have foreseen is merely a step in
reasoning.  For example, it may be shown that the accused is mentally
subnormal, or that on the occasion in question he was drunk, or suffering from
some fear, anger, or other excitement which deprived him of the ability to look
circumspectly to the probable outcome of his conduct.  These facts would not,
according to the usual view, be relevant to an issue of inadvertent negligence,
if that were before the court; but they are very relevant to the issue of
recklessness.  They may lead the tribunal to decide that the accused did not
foresee the consequence, even though a person somewhat differently situated
would have foreseen it.  In short, a judgment of inadvertent negligence rests
merely on a comparison between the conduct of the accused and that of a
reasonable man, while a judgment of recklessness uses the concept of the
reasonable man only as a guide to what went on in the accused's mind, and only
so long as it can plausibly be assumed that the accused's mind accorded with
the normal at the time of his act.

 

I would
add that the importance of what the reasonable person would have foreseen to
the determination of whether a particular accused would have become aware or
wilfully blind to the prohibited risk will vary with the context.  For example,
in the case of a licensed driver engaging in high risk motoring, I am in
general agreement with Morden J.A. in R. v. Sharp (1984),
12 C.C.C. (3d) 428 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 434-35, that it is open to the jury to
find the accused's blameworthy state of mind from driving which shows wanton or
reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others subject to an explanation
in the evidence which would account for the deviant conduct such as a sudden
mechanical malfunction or a bee sting or other accident beyond the accused's
control.  I would think that in the driving context where risks to the lives
and safety of others present themselves in a habitual and obvious fashion the
accused's claim that he or she gave no thought to the risk or had simply a
negative state of mind would in most, if not all, cases amount to the culpable
positive mental state of wilful blindness to the prohibited risk.

 

    The
minimal nature of the requirement of a blameworthy state of mind and the
relevance of the objective standard as a rebuttable mode of proof suggests to
me that a holding that s. 202  requires proof of the mental element of
advertence to the risk or wilful blindness to the risk will not undermine the
policy objectives of the provision.  The loss in terms of deterrence and social
protection would seem to be negligible when the retention of a subjective
standard would at most offer protection for those who due to some peculiarity
or unexpected accident commit conduct which, although it shows a reckless or
wanton disregard for the lives or safety of others, can be explained as
inconsistent with any degree of awareness of or wilful blindness to such a
risk. Should social protection require the adoption of an objective standard it
is open to Parliament to enact a law which clearly adopts such a standard.  In
my respectful view this Court should not do it for them.

 

    I do
not think that a subjective interpretation of s. 202  renders the role of
manslaughter committed by means of criminal negligence superfluous within the
scheme of the homicide provisions of the Criminal Code .  The
murder provisions will in general be available only if a higher degree of
intent is proven than awareness of or wilful blindness to a risk to the lives
and safety of others.  For example ss. 212 (a) and (b)
involve the higher degree of mens rea of either meaning to cause death or
meaning to cause bodily harm with the knowledge that it is likely to cause
death and being reckless as to whether death ensues or not.  There may be some
overlap between the offence of committing culpable homicide by criminal
negligence and the murder offences found in ss. 212 (c) and
213  but these murder provisions seem to be a distinct part of the statutory
scheme in that they are addressed to the specific issue of killings which
result from either the pursuit of an unlawful object or the commission of
specified indictable offences.  Manslaughter by means of advertent criminal
negligence would still, in my view, have a role to play in prohibiting killings
done with a more minimal intent than required under ss. 212 (a) and (b) and in
contexts which would not be covered by ss. 212 (c) and
213 .

 

    In
recognition of the harshness of a uniform application of an objective standard
of criminal liability much of the recent work in criminal jurisprudence has
canvassed the possibility of introducing a subjective dimension into the
objective standard in order to relieve the harshness of imposing an objective
standard on those who, because of their peculiar characteristics, could not
fairly be expected to live up to the standard set by the reasonable person.  H.
L. A. Hart was perhaps the first to explore this possibility in his essay ""Negligence, Mens Rea and
Criminal Responsibility,"" in  Oxford Essays in Jurisprudence (1961)
(c. 2).  He recognized the dangers of the use of an objective standard at p.
47:

 

If our
conditions of liability are invariant and not flexible, i.e. if they
are not adjusted to the capacities of the accused, then some individuals will
be held liable for negligence through they could not have helped their failure
to comply with the standard.  In such cases, indeed,
criminal responsibility will be made independent of any 'subjective element': 
since the accused could not have conformed to the required standard.

 

In
response to this most legitimate fear, Professor Hart proposed the following
two-pronged test for criminal negligence:

 

(i)Did the accused fail to take those precautions which
any reasonable man with normal capacities would in the circumstances have
taken?

 

(ii)Could
the accused, given his mental and physical capacities, have taken those
precautions?

 

A
similar approach has been taken by the criminal law theorist George Fletcher.
Professor Fletcher also proposed that criminal liability for negligent conduct
be determined in a two step process: the first being the determination of
wrongdoing which in the case of the prohibition of negligence would proceed on
the basis of breach of an objective standard and the second being the process
by which the court determines whether it would be fair to hold a particular
accused responsible for the act of wrongdoing.  Professor Fletcher notes in Rethinking
Criminal Law (1978), at p. 511:

 

If the
law ignored the question of attribution, namely, the question whether
individuals were properly held accountable for their wrongful acts, the
criminal law undoubtedly would generate some unjust decisions.  If it were true
that the only relevant norms of the legal system were those of wrongdoing,
injustice would be inescapable in cases in which individuals could not but
violate the law.

 

See also
G. Fletcher, ""The Theory of Criminal Negligence: A Comparative
Analysis,"" 119 U. Pa. L.R. 401 (1971); A.
Stalker ""Can George Fletcher Help Solve The Problem of Criminal
Negligence"" (1982), 7 Queens L.J. 274.  Professor
Pickard has also adopted an approach to this issue similar to that of
Professors Hart and Fletcher.  She proposes in ""Culpable Mistakes and
Rape: Relating Mens Rea to the Crime"" (1980), 30 U. of T.
L.J. 75, at p. 79, to modify an objective standard of
unreasonableness so that ""the relevant characteristics of the particular actor,
rather than those of the ordinary person"" will be ""the background
against which to measure the reasonableness of certain conduct or
beliefs.""  Professor Pickard elaborates:

 

    This
individualized standard is neither 'subjective' nor 'objective.'  It partakes
of the subjective position because the inquiry the fact finder must conduct is
about the defendant himself, not about some hypothetical ordinary person.  It
partakes of the objective position because the inquiry is not limited to what
was, in fact, in the actor's mind, but includes an inquiry into what could have
been in it, and a judgment about what ought to have been in it.

 

    In
their judgments in this case my colleagues McIntyre and Lamer JJ. seem to have
adopted variations of the above developments.  McIntyre J., for example, states
at p. 000:

 

    The
application of an objective test under s. 202  of the Criminal Code ,
however, may not be made in a vacuum.  Events occur within the framework of
other events and actions when deciding on the nature of the questioned conduct
surrounding circumstances must be considered.  The decision must be made on a
consideration of the facts existing at the time and in relation to the
accused's perception of those facts.  Since the test is objective, the
accused's perception of the facts is not to be considered for the purpose of
assessing malice or intention on the accused's part but only to form a basis
for a conclusion as to whether or not the accused's conduct, in view of his
perception of the facts, was reasonable.

 

My
colleague then, however, goes on to suggest that the factual perceptions of the
accused must be not only honest but reasonable in order to be factored into the
assessment of the objective standard.  For example, he suggests that the
appellants in this case should not be held to the standard of honest but
mistaken belief in circumstances which would render their conduct not culpable
as set out in Pappajohn v. The Queen, supra, but
rather that their beliefs and perceptions in order to be considered must not be
negligently or unreasonably held.  To my mind, when the offence charged is
criminal negligence the distinction from Pappajohn v. The
Queen lies not in the introduction of an overriding standard
of reasonableness, as this in effect holds the accused simply to the standards
of what would be expected from the reasonable person, but rather in the degree
of guilty knowledge that must be proven.  Although a person may have an honest
yet unreasonable view of the circumstances which would render him or her in the
large sense blameless, this would not necessarily decide the relevant question
of whether he or she had any awareness of the prohibited risk or at some time
during the relevant transaction wilfully blinded him or herself to an otherwise
obvious risk.  To require, as does my colleague, that all misperceptions be
reasonable will, in my view, not excuse many of those who through no fault of
their own cannot fairly be expected to live up to the standard of the
reasonable person.

 

    My
colleague Lamer J. takes a somewhat different approach. He suggests at p. 000
that courts when applying the objective standard in s. 202  should make ""a
generous allowance"" for factors which are particular to the accused, such
as youth, mental development, education"".  I do not doubt that an
expansive application of this approach could relieve some of the harshness of
applying an objective standard to those who could not fairly be expected to
meet the standard and I am cautiously sympathetic to attempts to integrate
elements of subjective perception into criminal law standards that are clearly
objective:  see R. v. Vasil, [1981] 1 S.C.R.
469; R. v. Hill, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 313.  Despite this, the test proposed
by my colleague suffers, in my respectful view, from the various degrees of
over and under inclusiveness that would be expected from a test which is only a
rough substitute for a finding of a blameworthy state of mind in each case. 
For example, an instruction to the trier of fact that they are to hold a young
accused with modest intelligence and little education to a standard of conduct
that one would expect from the reasonable person of tender years, modest
intelligence and little education sets out a fluctuating standard which in my
view undermines the principles of equality and individual responsibility which
should pervade the criminal law.  It tells the jury simply to lower the
standard of conduct expected from such people regardless of whether in the
particular case the accused attained the degree of guilty knowledge that I have
set out above.  Professor Fletcher in ""The Theory of Criminal Negligence: 
A Comparative Analysis"" has termed the decision whether to make the
standard of liability more or less objective by including or excluding specific
personal characteristics a ""policy question"", ""a low visibility
device for adjusting the interests of competing classes of litigants"" and
I respectfully agree with the following criticism he makes of this process at
p. 408:

 

The
question in the criminal context is not one of adjusting the interests of
competing classes of litigants, but of justifying the state's depriving an
individual of his liberty.

 

Professor
Fletcher's solution to this problem, the introduction of a comprehensive range
of individualized excuses, is in my view far from realization in Canadian
criminal law jurisprudence and, as such, the concern he identifies of the
culpability of the individual is still, in my view, best served by continued
adherence to subjective standards of liability.

 

    One
problem with attempts to individualize an objective standard is that regard for
the disabilities of the particular accused can only be applied in a general
fashion to alter the objective standard.  It seems preferable to me to continue
to address the question of whether a subjective standard (a standard,  I might
add, that in its form is applied equally to all and consistent with individual
responsibility) has been breached in each case than to introduce varying standards
of conduct which will be only roughly related to the presence or absence of
culpability in the individual case.  Varying the level of conduct by factoring
in some personal characteristics may be unavoidable if the court is faced with
a clearly objective standard but it should, in my opinion, be avoided if the
more exacting subjective test is available as a matter of statutory
interpretation.  I have no doubt that factors such as the accused's age and
mental development will often be relevant to determining culpability but under
a subjective test they will be relevant only as they relate to the question of
whether the accused was aware of or wilfully blind to the prohibited risk and
will not have to be factored in wholesale in order to adjust the standard of
conduct that is expected from citizens.

 

    Attempts
to introduce subjective elements into objective standards risk not only being
overinclusive in the sense that they mandate a lowering of the objective
standard of liability on a characteristic by characteristic basis, they also
risk the danger of being underinclusive for those accused who have
idiosyncracies that cannot be articulated ex ante into
the necessarily limited list of personal characteristics which can be grafted
on to an objective standard. For example the characteristics listed by my
colleague Lamer J. would not relieve the harshness of the application of an
objective standard for a driver who because of a sudden injury or ailment drove
a motor vehicle in a fashion which showed a reckless or wanton disregard for
the lives and safety of others.  It would not matter that the particular
accused was not capable of adverting or wilfully closing his or her eyes to the
prohibited risk; the conduct in itself would have breached the objective
standard.

 

    The
limited range of personal characteristics which can be imported into a modified
objective standard is often justified by the notion that a thoroughly
subjective approach will allow those who deprive themselves of normal awareness
through voluntary intoxication or fits of temper to be exempted from criminal
liability.  My answer to this (it was also my answer in the cases of R. v.
Bernard, supra, and R. v. Quin, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 825) is that greater attention must be paid to the minimal levels of
guilty knowledge that are required for conviction of many offences of violence
under the Criminal Code .  It is, in my
respectful view, perfectly permissible for the trier of fact to reason from an
objective standard and ask the question: must not the accused have had the
minimal awareness of what he or she was doing?  The important point is that
this question is rebuttable and leaves room for acquitting an accused who for
whatever reason lacked the minimal awareness that would normally accompany the
commission of high risk or violent acts.

 

    I am
in complete agreement with what my colleague Lamer J. has to say concerning the
issue of constitutionality.  I would only add that in light of this Court's
decision in R. v. Stevens, [1988] 1 S.C.R.
1153, the Charter could not have been applied to the
tragic events culminating in Christopher Tutton's death on October 17, 1981.

 

    To
sum up, although I agree with my colleagues as to the proper disposition of
this appeal, I am unable to agree with their conclusion that the offence of
manslaughter by criminal negligence consists of conduct in breach of an
objective standard.

 

//McIntyre
J.//

 

    The
reasons of McIntyre and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. were delivered by

 

    MCINTYRE J. --
This appeal raises again the question of criminal negligence, as defined in s.
202 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, and the test to be applied by a jury in its application to a given case.

 

    The
respondents, Carol Anne Tutton and Arthur Thomas Tutton, were the parents of a
five-year-old child, Christopher Tutton, who died on October 17, 1981.  After a
trial before judge and jury, the Tuttons were convicted of manslaughter because
of his death.  They appealed the conviction.  The Court of Appeal (Dubin,
Goodman, Tarnopolsky JJ.A.) in a judgment written for the court by Dubin J.A.
(as he then was) allowed the appeals, set aside the convictions, and directed
new trials.  This appeal is taken by the Crown, by leave granted May 23, 1985.

 

    The
Tuttons, according to the evidence, which was unquestioned on this point, had a
good reputation in their community for honesty and integrity and, as well, they
were loving and responsible parents.  They were also deeply religious and they
belonged to a religious sect which believes in faith healing.  Their religious
convictions did not prevent them from seeking and acting on medical advice nor
from taking medicines, but they believed that Divine intervention could
miraculously effect cures for illnesses and ailments beyond the power of modern
medical science.

 

    In
April of l979, their family physician, a general practitioner named Love,
diagnosed the child, Christopher, as a diabetic and admitted him to hospital
where he remained for some weeks.  While the child was in hospital, his mother
attended classes at a diabetic education centre where she received instruction
regarding insulin injections and the impact of diet and exercise on diabetes
and diabetics.  She also attended in July of 1979 a full week of seminars at a
juvenile diabetic clinic to gain an understanding of her son's condition and to
learn how to deal with it.  There was then evidence upon which the jury could
conclude that Mrs. Tutton had made herself competent to deal with her child's
illness under general supervision from the family physician.

 

    Throughout
the son's illness, the Tuttons main concern was to find a cure for the boy. 
They both believed that there would be a spiritual cure.  They discussed this
possibility with Dr. Love who considered that there was no possibility of a
miraculous cure, and in November of 1979 a diabetic specialist from the Sick
Children's Hospital in Toronto advised the respondents that their son would
never be able to discontinue his insulin injections.  He told the respondents
not to discontinue the insulin treatments.  However, on October 2, 1980, Mrs.
Tutton stopped giving the child insulin in the belief that he was being healed
by the power of the Holy Spirit.  In two days, the child became quite ill and was
taken to a hospital emergency unit.  The physician who attended the child said
that on admission to hospital the child was dangerously ill, suffering from
diabetic acidosis, a potentially fatal disorder which was due to the absence of
insulin.  The doctor admonished the parents when he learned that they had
consciously withheld the insulin.  He told the parents that insulin would be
required by their son for life, and after this incident Mr. Tutton assured
the family physician that insulin would not be withheld in future without
consulting a doctor.  A year later, however, insulin was again stopped.  Mrs.
Tutton believed that she had a vision of God in which she was told that
Christopher was cured, that no more insulin was needed, and that God would take
care of her son.  The insulin injections were stopped on October 14, l981.  Mr.
Tutton did not know of the withdrawal of insulin until October 15 but on
learning of it he approved.  The child sickened quickly.  On October 17, he was
taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.  The forensic
pathologist who conducted a postmortem examination gave his opinion that death
was caused by complications of diabetic hyperglycemia.  The respondents were
jointly charged with manslaughter in an indictment which provided:

 

ARTHUR
TUTTON AND CAROL TUTTON stand charged that between the period of the 14th day
of October, 1981, and the 17th day of October, 1981, both dates inclusive, at
the Township of Wilmot, in the Judicial District of Waterloo, being the parents
of Christopher Tutton, they did cause the death of Christopher Tutton, age five
years, by criminal negligence, to wit, they did, without lawful excuse, omit to
provide necessaries of life to Christopher Tutton, which was their duty to
provide, thereby showing wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of
the said Christopher Tutton, and did thereby commit manslaughter, contrary to
the Criminal Code .

 

Particulars
were given in these terms:

 

It is further particularized that the said Arthur Tutton
and Carol Tutton failed, without lawful excuse, while their said son,
Christopher, was in necessitous circumstances,

 

(1) to provide insulin to him

 

(2) to
obtain timely medical assistance for him.

 

The
relevant statutory provisions which were considered in the courts below are set
out hereunder:

 

197. (1) Every one is under a legal duty

 

(a) as a parent, foster parent, guardian or head of a
family, to provide necessaries of life for a child under the age of sixteen
years;

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

    (2) Every one commits an offence who, being under a
legal duty within the meaning of subsection (1), fails without lawful excuse,
the proof of which lies upon him, to perform that duty, if

 

(a) with respect to a duty imposed by paragraph (1)(a) or (b),

 

(i) the person to whom the duty is owed is in destitute
or necessitous circumstances, or

 

(ii) the failure to perform the duty endangers the life
of the person to whom the duty is owed, or causes or is likely to cause the
health of that person to be endangered permanently;  or

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

202. (1) Every one is criminally negligent who

 

(a) in doing anything, or

 

(b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do,

 

shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons.

 

    (2)
For the purposes of this section, ""duty"" means a duty imposed by law.

 

    At
trial, the defence was that as far as the Crown's case rested on the failure to
provide insulin the Tuttons honestly believed that Christopher had been cured
by Divine intervention and, therefore, no further insulin was necessary.  This
would raise the defence of an honest though mistaken belief in the existence of
a circumstance or circumstances which, if present, would render their conduct
non-culpable.  It was also argued that as far as the Crown's case depended upon
a failure to provide timely medical assistance for their son, the parents were
unaware of the fact that he was seriously ill as a result of the withdrawal of
the insulin and, accordingly, their conduct in this regard could not be said to
exhibit a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of their son.

 

    The
judgment of the Court of Appeal is now reported at (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 328. 
Dubin J.A. after reviewing the facts noted that the indictment as drawn
involved two offences:  manslaughter, and failing to provide necessaries under
s. 197  of the Criminal Code .  He recognized
that this made for a difficult charge to the jury involving, as it did, a
charge of manslaughter in respect of which the onus of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt rested entirely upon the Crown, and, as well, a charge in
respect of which the Crown was required only to prove beyond reasonable doubt
the duty to provide necessaries and a failure to do so, following which to
escape conviction the accused was required to prove a lawful excuse on a
balance of probabilities.  Dubin J.A. in his reasons reproduced substantial
parts of the charge and concluded that the jury might well have been confused
as to the burden of proof and may have formed the impression that the accused
were under a burden to show an excuse, both with respect to the failure to provide
necessaries and to the charge of manslaughter.

 

    In
considering the charge, it seems to me, that in so far as it dealt with the
burden of proof on manslaughter it was an adequate statement of the law.  At
the risk of undue repetition, I will reproduce the manslaughter portion of the
charge referred to by Dubin J.A., at p. 335 in the report:

 

    To succeed on this indictment therefore the Crown
must satisfy you, beyond a reasonable doubt, of each and every one of these
following elements:--

 

    That it was the duty of the Tuttons to provide
Christopher with the necessaries of life;

 

    That they omitted to do so without lawful excuse;

 

    That in omitting to do so they showed wanton or
reckless disregard for the life or safety of Christopher;

 

and that
it was that omission or failure which did cause his death.

 

and,
further, he said:

 

    Another element which the Crown must establish is
that the accused omitted to provide Christopher with insulin and timely medical
assistance without lawful excuse.  Excuse of course means excuse in law.  A
lawful excuse might be that the person does not have the money to purchase
insulin or that because of some personal or physical incapacity he is unable to
obtain the insulin or that he or she did not know how to administer it.  It is
not a lawful excuse for a person to have religious beliefs that say it is wrong
to give insulin or that God has told them that it is not necessary to give
insulin to a child.  The law of this country is paramount and must be obeyed by
everyone without exception.

 

    To sum
up then.  To succeed on this indictment the Crown must satisfy you, beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Firstly, that it was the duty of the Tuttons to provide
Christopher with the necessaries of life, namely his daily injections of
insulin and timely medical assistance.  That they failed to do so without
lawful excuse.  That in omitting to do so they showed wanton or
reckless disregard for his life or safety.  That it was that omission or
failure which caused his death.  If the Crown has so satisfied you then you
will return a verdict of guilty on this indictment.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

Dubin
J.A. agreed that in that portion of the charge the onus to negate a lawful
excuse had been placed upon the Crown, but he then considered a further portion
of the charge, at p. 336, which is also reproduced below:

 

    Now I have already reviewed all of those essential
ingredients that make up this charge and I don't propose to go through them
with you again.

 

    The first two elements will give you no problem. 
Those two elements are that the accused are the parents of Christopher and he
was under the age of sixteen years.  That has been admitted.

 

    The next issue.  Has the Crown proved, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that they failed to provide him with the necessaries of
life.  I have already instructed you on the law on that issue.

 

    Finally the Crown must prove, beyond a reasonable
doubt, that their failure to provide their child with the necessaries of life
endangered his life.

 

    Now if the Crown does prove those items that is not
the end of the matter.  You have to go on and determine if the accused have
proved that they had a lawful excuse which would entitle them to be acquitted. 
The question of lawful excuse has already been discussed with you and as I
indicated to you it is to be determined on all of the facts of the circumstances
of this case.

 

    I have reviewed with you the evidence and the
explanation of the accused as to why they withdrew insulin from him and I have
also reviewed with you what constituted a lawful excuse.  I told you that the
burden would be on the accused to prove lawful excuse.  Parliament has enacted
that special provision.  But this burden on the accused is not as heavy as the
burden on the Crown.  The Crown has to prove all of the elements of the offence
beyond a reasonable doubt.  The burden on the accused, with respect to proving
lawful excuse, is only to show on a balance of probabilities that they had a
lawful excuse.

 

    So,
if on balance, it comes down in favour of the accused that they have proved
lawful excuse they are entitled to be acquitted.  If on balance it comes down
against them and they have not proved lawful excuse and the Crown having proved
everything that it has to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, you will then be
obliged to convict.  Now if the balance is so even on this issue of lawful excuse
that you cannot decide one way or the other then they have not discharged the
burden and they have not proved lawful excuse and you should convict. 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

Dubin
J.A. considered that the jury may have formed the impression from these
comments that, both with respect to the underlying question concerning the
provision of necessaries of life and the actual offence charged, manslaughter,
there was a burden on the accused to show on a balance of probabilities that
they had a lawful excuse.  He considered this resulted in reversible error and
on that basis a new trial would be required.

 

    I am
in agreement with him on that point because of the complications arising out of
the form of the indictment and the confusion concerning the burden of proof
which varied with different aspects of the offence charged.  In my view, this
would be sufficient to resolve the appeal, but because of the nature of this
case Dubin J.A. felt obliged to go further and deal with other issues raised by
the parties.  Some comment is required, then, from this Court.

 

    The
indictment and its particulars have been reproduced above and, of course, the
Crown is bound by what it has pleaded.  The Crown has alleged that the
appellants have caused the death of their son by criminal negligence and did
thereby commit manslaughter.  It has particularized its allegation in the
indictment and also in the particulars, alleging that the appellants without
lawful excuse did omit to provide necessaries of life to their son which it was
their duty to provide.  This failure is the basis of the allegation of wanton
or reckless disregard for the life or safety of their son and it is the sole
basis on which the charge of manslaughter may be supported.  It is therefore
clear that while the appellants are charged with the commission of one specific
offence, manslaughter, the Crown may only succeed in its proof by establishing
the commission of a different offence, provided for in s. 197(2)  of the Criminal
Code , and one in which a burden of proof relating to the
question of lawful excuse is imposed on the accused.

 

    The
task of a trial judge charging a jury in these circumstances would be difficult
and, in my view, it would be necessary to keep clearly separate the two
offences or the elements of the two offences which must be dealt with.  This
could be achieved by approaching the charge in two steps.  The first step, I
suggest, would be to deal with the underlying offence in s. 197(2) of the Code, for
under this indictment until this question is settled no approach can be made to
the crime of manslaughter actually charged.  The jury should be instructed on
the elements of the offence under s. 197  and told that for a conviction under
that section they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
appellants were under a duty to provide necessaries of life to their son, and
that they failed to do so without lawful excuse.  If they were not so
satisfied, they would acquit the accused and go no further, for the sole basis
of the manslaughter allegation would be gone.  If, however, they were to find
that the accused had failed to provide the necessaries without lawful excuse,
then it would be necessary for them to go further and consider whether in such
failure they had shown a wanton and reckless disregard for the life and safety
of their son.  If the jury were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that such
conduct had been shown and that it had caused the death of the child, they
would be obligated to convict of manslaughter, and on this indictment that is
the only way a conviction of manslaughter could be reached.  If, on the other
hand, the jury were not so satisfied, they would be required to acquit the
accused of the crime of manslaughter.  If, however, they were satisfied that
the necessaries of life had been withheld but in doubt as to whether the
deprivation was the cause of the son's death, they could in that case convict
of the included offence under s. 197 , otherwise they would acquit.  The
advantage, in my view, of putting the matter to the jury in this manner is that
it would clarify the separate issues and make it clear that in reaching a
conclusion on the offence of manslaughter, it is the conduct of the parents in
relation to the provision of necessaries and medical assistance which must be
considered in deciding if wanton and reckless disregard has been shown.

 

    In
reaching a conclusion as to whether the conduct of an accused person has shown,
within the meaning of s. 202  of the Criminal Code , wanton
or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons, the authorities
dictate an objective test:  see the review of the authorities on this subject
by Cory J.A. for the Court of Appeal in R. v. Waite (1986),
28 C.C.C. (3d) 326, approved in this Court, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 000.  Indeed, in
the Court of Appeal, Dubin J.A. accepted the objective test as one of general
application, but made an exception in cases where the conduct complained of
consisted of an act or acts of omission, as opposed to those of commission.  In
such cases, it was his view that occasions would arise where a subjective test
would be required where acts of omission were under consideration.  He
considered this was such a case.  It is my view, however, that no such
distinction as Dubin J.A. would adopt may be made.  I am wholly unable to see
any difference in principle between cases arising from an omission to act and
those involving acts of commission.  Indeed, the words of s. 202 of the Code make it
clear that one is criminally negligent who, in doing anything or in
omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  The objective test must,
therefore, be employed where criminal negligence is considered for it is the
conduct of the accused, as opposed to his intention or mental state, which is
examined in this inquiry.

 

    Our
concept of criminal culpability relies primarily upon a consideration of the
mental state which accompanies or initiates the wrongful act, and the
attribution of criminal liability without proof of such a blameworthy mental
state raises serious concerns.  Nonetheless, negligence has become accepted as
a factor which may lead to criminal liability and strong arguments can be
raised in its favour.  Section 202  of the Criminal Code  affords
an example of its adoption.  In choosing the test to be applied in assessing
conduct under s. 202 of the Code, it must be
observed at once that what is made criminal is negligence.  Negligence connotes
the opposite of thought-directed action.  In other words, its existence
precludes the element of positive intent to achieve a given result.  This leads
to the conclusion that what is sought to be restrained by punishment under s.
202 of the Code is conduct, and its results.  What is
punished, in other words, is not the state of mind but the consequence of
mindless action.  This is apparent, I suggest, from the words of the section,
which make criminal, conduct which shows wanton or reckless disregard. 
It may be observed as well that the words ""wanton or reckless""
support this construction, denying as they do the existence of a directing
mental state.  Nor can it be said that criminal negligence, as defined in s.
202 , imports in its terms some element of malice or intention.  This point was
made in the Crown's factum in paragraph 41, which provided, in part:

 

The
plain and ordinary meaning of the terms ""wanton"" and
""reckless"" when used in connection with the concept of negligence
would seem to include a state of being heedless of apparent danger.  Section
202(1) does not use the term ""reckless"" as an extended definition of
intention or malice, but rather employs the term as part of a definition of
conduct which amounts to ""negligence"" in a criminal context.

 

In my
view, then, an objective standard must be applied in determining this question
because of the difference between the ordinary criminal offence, which requires
proof of a subjective state of mind, and that of criminal negligence.  In
criminal cases, generally, the act coupled with the mental state or intent is
punished.  In criminal negligence, the act which exhibits the requisite degree
of negligence is punished.  If this distinction is not kept clear, the dividing
line between the traditional mens rea offence and the offence of criminal
negligence becomes blurred.  The difference, for example,  between murder and
manslaughter, both unlawful killings, is merely one of intent.  If the question
of an accused's intent had to be considered and separately proved in offences
under s. 202 of the Code, the purpose of the section would be
defeated because intentional conduct would perforce be considered under other
sections of the Code and s. 202 , aimed at mindless but
socially dangerous conduct, would have no function.  For these reasons, the
objective test should be employed and, in my view, the Court of Appeal was in
error in concluding in this case that a subjective test would be required.  The
test is that of reasonableness, and proof of conduct which reveals a marked and
significant departure from the standard which could be expected of a reasonably
prudent person in the circumstances will justify a conviction of criminal
negligence.

 

    In
reaching this conclusion, I am not overlooking the comments I made in Sansregret
v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, at pp. 581-82, which were cited
by counsel for the appellant.  In Sansregret v. The Queen, I
expressed the view that ""recklessness, to form a part of the criminal mens rea, must
have an element of the subjective"".  I then went on to say that,
""[i]t is in this sense that the term `recklessness' is used in the
criminal law and it is clearly distinct from the concept of civil
negligence"".  It was argued upon the basis of these words and later
comments on the nature of negligence in relation to the criminal law that a
subjective test should therefore be applied in considering the existence of
criminal negligence under s. 202 of the Code.  I
would reject that argument on the basis that the concept of recklessness there
described is not applicable in a case under s. 202 of the Code. 
Sansregret was charged with rape, a crime which involves positive mind-directed
conduct on the part of the accused which aims at the accomplishment of a
specific result.  It is a traditional mens rea offence
and a mental state must be proved, in that case an intention to persist with
his purpose despite the fact that the complainant's consent has been extorted
by threats and fear.  Recklessness on his part forms a part of the mens rea (the
blameworthy state of mind) and has to be proved on a subjective basis as part
of the mental element of the offence.  In this sense, the words in Sansregret
v. The Queen are apposite.  Section 202 , on the other hand, has
created a separate offence;   an offence which makes negligence -- the
exhibition of wanton or reckless behaviour -- a crime in itself and has thus
defined its own terms.  As noted by Cory J.A. in R. v. Waite, s. 202
of the Code was enacted in its present form as a codification of
the offence which had emerged in Canadian jurisprudence, and in respect of
which the necessary mens rea may be inferred on an objective basis
from the acts of the accused.

 

    The
application of an objective test under s. 202 of the Code,
however, may not be made in a vacuum.  Events occur within the framework of
other events and actions and when deciding on the nature of the questioned
conduct surrounding circumstances must be considered.  The decision must be
made on a consideration of the facts existing at the time and in relation to
the accused's perception of those facts.  Since the test is objective, the accused's
perception of the facts is not to be considered for the purpose of assessing
malice or intention on the accused's part but only to form a basis for a
conclusion as to whether or not the accused's conduct, in view of his
perception of the facts, was reasonable.  This is particularly true where, as
here, the accused have raised the defence of mistake of fact.  If an accused
under s. 202  has an honest and reasonably held belief in the existence of
certain facts, it may be a relevant consideration in assessing the
reasonableness of his conduct.  For example, a welder, who is engaged to work
in a confined space believing on the assurance of the owner of the premises
that no combustible or explosive material is stored nearby, should be entitled
to have his perception, as to the presence or absence of dangerous materials,
before the jury on a charge of manslaughter when his welding torch causes an
explosion and a consequent death.

 

    As
noted earlier, the Tuttons raised the defence of mistake of fact at trial. 
They argued that the failure to supply insulin was based upon the belief that
the child had been cured by Divine intervention and that the failure to provide
medical care in timely fashion was based upon the belief that the child was not
seriously ill, so medical assistance was not necessary.  The trial judge, it
was argued, was in error in telling the jury that for any such belief to be
effective as a defence it must have been reasonably held.  It was held in this
Court in Pappajohn v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R.
120, that an honest, though mistaken, belief in the existence of circumstances
which, if present, would make the questioned conduct non-culpable would entitle
an accused to an acquittal.  It was also held in Pappajohn v. The
Queen that the honest belief need not be reasonable, because
its effect would be to deny the existence of the requisite mens rea.  The
situation would be different, however, where the offence charged rests upon the
concept of negligence, as opposed to that of the guilty mind or blameworthy
mental state.  In such case, an unreasonable though honest belief on the part
of the accused would be negligently held.  The holding of such a belief could
not afford a defence when culpability is based on negligent conduct.  I would
therefore conclude that the trial judge made no error in charging the jury to
the effect that any mistaken belief which could afford a defence in a charge of
criminal negligence would have to be reasonable.

 

    In
the case at bar, then, the assertion of the Tuttons that they believed a cure
had been effected by Divine intervention and that insulin was not necessary for
the preservation of the child's life would have to be considered by the jury. 
The jury would have to consider whether such belief was honest and whether it
was reasonable.  In this, they would be required to consider the whole
background of the case.  They would have to take into account the experience of
the Tuttons with the child's illness;  the fact that they had seen the result
of the withdrawal of insulin on one occasion and that they had been informed of
its necessity for the continued care of the child;  and, that Mrs. Tutton had
received some formal instruction or training in dealing with diabetes and
diabetics.  They would, as well, have to consider whether the belief in a
miraculous cure leading to the conclusion that insulin and medical care were
not required, though honest, was reasonable.  Upon these facts and all others
concerning the matter which were revealed in the evidence, the jury would be
required to decide whether the refusal of insulin and medical attention
represented a marked and significant departure from the standard to be observed
by reasonably prudent parents.

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal and confirm the direction for a new trial.

 

//Lamer J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    LAMER J. -- I
have read the reasons of my colleague, Justice McIntyre, and I am in agreement
with them, subject to the following remarks.  I am of the view that, when
applying the objective norm set out by Parliament in s. 202 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, must be made ""a generous
allowance"" for factors which are particular to the accused, such as youth,
mental development, education (see Stuart, Canadian Criminal
Law: A Treatise (2nd ed. 1987), p. 194; see also Pickard,
""Culpable Mistakes and Rape: Relating Mens Rea to the Crime"" (1980),
30 U. of T. L.J. 75).  When this is done, as we are considering conduct
which is likely to cause death, that is high risk conduct, the adoption of a
subjective or of an objective test will, in practice, nearly if not always
produce the same result (see Colvin, ""Recklessness and Criminal
Negligence"" (1982), 32 U. of T. L.J. 345).

 

    I
should note that Parliament, when enacting s. 202, did not purport to determine
the nature of the negligence which is required when grounding  criminal
liability thereupon.  My understanding of s. 202 is that Parliament has in that
section simply defined the expression ""criminal negligence"" whenever
used in the Criminal Code .

 

    I
should finally mention that in this case the constitutionality of
s. 205(5)(b) was not in issue.  Indeed, assuming without now
deciding that it is a principle of fundamental justice that knowledge of a
likely risk or deliberate ignorance thereof (foresight or wilful blindness) is
an essential element of the offense of manslaughter, the issue as to whether
proof of the substituted element of ""criminal negligence"" as defined
by Parliament and interpreted by this Court satisfies the test set out in R. v.
Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, does not arise.  I therefore do
not by my concurrence feel precluded or limited when addressing such a
constitutional challenge, of course, if and when called upon to do so.

 

    I
would, as does my colleague McIntyre J., dismiss the appeal and let the order
for a new trial stand.

    Respondent
was arrested after pointing a loaded shotgun at a person and threatening to
""blow him away"".  He was acquitted of unlawful confinement contrary
to s. 247(2)  of the Criminal Code  which was the
offence the Crown may have had in mind when it charged him of using a firearm
while committing an indictable offence contrary to s. 83(1) (a).  The
trial judge, however, found respondent guilty under s. 83(1) (a), even
though the count disclosed no indictable offence, because he held that the
Crown had established that he had committed an assault as defined in the Code. 
Respondent pleaded guilty to possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to
the public peace, contrary to s. 85 of the Code, and
was found guilty of unlawfully pointing a firearm, contrary to s. 84(1) of
the Code.  The trial judge applied the Kienapple
principle in respect to these counts and entered no conviction.  The Court of
Appeal quashed the conviction under s. 83(1)  but made no disposition with
respect to the two for which no conviction had been entered.

 

    Two
issues were before this Court.  Firstly, whether a conviction can obtain under
s. 83(1) absent a conviction for the indictable offence whose commission
involved the use of a firearm.  Secondly, whether the Court of Appeal erred
when it did not enter the convictions for the two counts to which the Kienapple principle
had been applied when the conviction giving rise to its application was
overturned.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    A
conviction for an offence under s. 83(1) cannot stand alone.  This Court
has identified the purpose of this section as a measure to enable the Crown to
obtain additional penalties where a firearm is used during the
commission or the attempt to commit an offence.  This purpose can logically be
achieved only if a sentence is tacked on to a previous one.  A prerequisite,
therefore, is a sentence for the conviction of the underlying and distinct
offence, as opposed to only a finding of fact.  The conviction and sentence for
the underlying offence prerequisite to s. 83(1) need not be obtained and
imposed contemporaneously.  Furthermore, while it is desirable that the two
offences be in separate counts if in the same charge, they could well be both
in the same count.

 

    It
was not necessary to identify with certainty the underlying offence for
disposing of the case at bar.  If the offence of unlawful confinement was the
underlying offence that the Crown had in mind at the time of the laying of the
indictment, the Court of Appeal was justified in quashing the guilty verdict
pronounced with respect to s. 83(1) as the respondent had been acquitted
of the count of unlawful confinement.  Alternatively, the trial judge committed
an error in law in finding the accused guilty of having used a firearm while
committing an assault.  The accused was not charged with any count of assault,
either in that count or in a distinct count, and accordingly could not be
convicted of that offence.

 

    The
count, even though an accused may have been convicted of offences during which
he used a firearm, must clearly indicate the offence for which the accused
person is charged with having used a firearm.

 

    Section
623  of the Criminal Code  enables this Court
to remit the case to the trial judge for a determination of whether guilty
verdicts should be entered with respect to the two counts for which no
convictions had been entered and to make any order that the Court of Appeal
might have made.  Section 44 of the Supreme Court Act, which
states (with certain exception not applicable here) that ""No appeal lies
to the Supreme Court from a judgment or order made in the exercise of judicial
discretion"", does not affect this power.  It aims solely at preventing
parties from bringing an appeal from a purely discretionary decision.

 

    This
Court, while usually reluctant to intervene in a lower court's decision in the
context of a discretionary power, should do so here given that the Court of
Appeal neither addressed the question of whether or not it would be appropriate
to return the matter to the trial judge nor exercise its discretion one way or
the other.  The Court of Appeal, on allowing the appeal under s. 613(2),
might have ordered that the file be remitted to the trial judge pursuant to
s. 613(8).  This Court has the power to make this order by virtue of
s. 623 .

Introduction

 

    This
is an appeal by the Crown against a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario
which set aside Mr. Pringle's conviction for using a firearm while committing
an indictable offence, and entered an acquittal.  The Crown asks this Court to
restore the conviction or, in the alternative, if the acquittal is to be
upheld, to remit the case to the trial judge for the entering of convictions on
charges stemming from the same set of events.  These latter convictions were
not entered due to an application by the trial judge of the principle commonly
known as the Kienapple principle:  see Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.

 

The
Facts

 

    Mr.
Pringle suspected his wife of having an affair with her employer.  He went to
her place of employment with a loaded shotgun.  He confronted the employer with
the gun, pointed it at him and told him that he was going to ""blow him
away"".  He raised the gun but, when the employer moved towards him, he
brought the gun back down.  The police arrived, arrested him and charged him
with four counts.

 

The
Charge

 

    Count
1:  unlawful confinement of the employer, contrary to s. 247(2) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.

 

    Count
2:  using a firearm while committing an indictable offence, contrary to s.
83(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

    Count
3:  possession of a weapon (the shotgun) for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace, contrary to s. 85  of the Criminal Code .

 

    Count
4:  unlawfully pointing a firearm at the employer, contrary to s. 84(1)  of the Criminal
Code .

 

    Count
two did not disclose the indictable offence which the accused was alleged to
have committed while using the firearm.

 

    The
trial judge acquitted the accused of the first count, that of unlawful
confinement.  This acquittal was not appealed and is not before us.

 

    The
trial judge found the accused guilty of the second count on the basis that the
Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Pringle had committed
an assault as defined by s. 244(1) (b) or (c) of the Criminal
Code  as a result of Mr. Pringle's threat to shoot the
employer.

 

    Pringle
pleaded guilty to count three and the judge found him guilty on the fourth
count.  However, no convictions were entered pursuant to an application of the Kienapple
principle because of the conviction on count 2.  The Court of Appeal quashed
the conviction but made no disposition with respect to the two counts on which
the convictions were not entered pursuant to Kienapple v. The
Queen.

 

    The
only count on appeal below and in this Court is the count of using a firearm
while committing an indictable offence.

 

The
Issues

 

    There
are two issues before us:

 

    1. 
Can there be a conviction under s. 83(1)  without there first being a conviction
for the indictable offence during the commission of which it is alleged that a
firearm was used;

 

    2. 
Having entered an acquittal, was the Court of Appeal wrong in not making an
order in relation to counts three and four.

 

Relevant
Legislative Provisions

 

    The
legislative provisions pertinent to the disposition of this appeal are ss. 83 ,
613(1) (a), (2) , (8)  and 623(1)  of the Criminal Code  and s.
44 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
S-19.

 

Criminal
Code 

 

    83. (1)  Everyone who uses a firearm

 

(a)  while committing or attempting to commit an
indictable offence, or

 

(b)  during his flight after committing or attempting to
commit an indictable offence,

 

whether or not he causes or means to cause bodily harm
to any person as a result thereof, is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment

 

(c)  in the case of a first offence under this subsection,
except as provided in paragraph (d), for not more
than fourteen years and not less than one year; and

 

(d)  in the case of a second or subsequent offence under
this subsection, or in the case of a first such offence committed by a person
who, prior to the coming into force of this subsection, was convicted of an
indictable offence or an attempt to commit an indictable offence, in the course
of which or during his flight after the commission or attempted commission of
which he used a firearm, for not more than fourteen years and not less than three
years.

 

    (2)  A sentence imposed on a person for an offence
under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to any other punishment
imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or series of events
and to any other sentence to which he is subject at the time the sentence is
imposed on him for an offence under subsection (1).

 

    613. (1)  On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal

 

    (a)  may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that
it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside
on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

                                                                          . . . 

 

    (2) Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under
paragraph (1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and

 

    (a) direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be
entered, or

 

    (b) order a new trial.

 

                                                                          . . . 

 

    (8) Where a court of appeal exercises any of the
powers conferred by subsections (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order, in
addition, that justice requires.

 

    623. (1) 
The Supreme Court of Canada may, on an appeal under this Part, make any order
that the court of appeal might have made and may make any rule or order that is
necessary to give effect to its judgment.

 

Supreme
Court Act

 

    44. (1)  No
appeal lies to the Supreme Court from a judgment or order made in the exercise
of judicial discretion except in proceedings in the nature of a suit or
proceeding in equity originating elsewhere than in the Province of Quebec and
except in mandamus proceedings.

 

Decision
of the Court of Appeal  (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 150

 

    Dubin
J.A. (as he then was), with whom Thorson and Grange JJ. concurred, held that s.
83  was adopted to impose additional liability on an accused who used a firearm
while committing an indictable offence.  The purpose of its enactment was, as
stated by Dickson J. (as he then was) in McGuigan v. The Queen [1982]
1 S.C.R. 284, to change the common law rule against multiple convictions and
enable the Crown to obtain additional penalties where a firearm is used during
the commission of an offence.  Dubin J.A. also underlined the fact that s.
83(2) requires that the sentence for a conviction under s. 83(1)  must be served
consecutively to any other sentence arising from the same event or series of
events.  Consequently he held that in order for a person to be convicted of
using a firearm under s. 83(1)  there must be a conviction for the indictable
offence in which it is alleged that the firearm was used.

 

    Dubin
J.A. held that in this case the accused was not convicted of the offence of
unlawful confinement, the offence which the Crown had in mind when charging the
accused under s. 83(1) .  He further found that the accused was not charged or
convicted of assault, and therefore is presumed innocent of that offence in
light of s. 5(1)  of the Criminal Code .  Since, in his
opinion, a conviction for an offence under s. 83(1)  cannot stand alone, he
allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal.

 

Analysis

 

1.  Prior
Conviction as Condition Precedent under s. 83(1) 

 

    I am
in full agreement with Dubin J.A.

 

    The
text alone of s. 83(1)  does not permit one to determine with certainty if it is
necessary that the accused be found guilty of the underlying offence before he
can be found guilty of the offence of having used a firearm while committing
the underlying offence.

 

    The
Crown claims that this question must be answered in the negative since nothing
in the terms used in s. 83(1)  indicates that the legislator intended such a
requirement.  It claims, more precisely, that it would have been possible for
the legislator, if that had been his intention, to  indicate clearly the
necessity of a finding of guilt with respect to the underlying offence before
an accused could be found guilty of an offence under s. 83(1) .

 

    I
cannot share the Crown's opinion in this regard.  The fact that such a
requirement could have been expressly provided for does not automatically
imply that such a requirement does not exist where it has not been expressly
enacted.  In my view, we must take many factors into account when determining
whether the requirement exists or not, notably the nature and the purpose of
the legislative provision, the goal the legislator seeks to attain, the result
each solution would bring about, the wording of the section and, the
counterproductive result, as regards the purpose, a given interpretation would
result in.

 

    The
goal pursued by Parliament when enacting s. 83(1)  was, as underlined by Dubin
J.A. in the court of appeal, clearly identified by Dickson J. (as he then was)
in the case of McGuigan v. The Queen, supra, at p.
318:

 

    It
seems clear that what was intended in the enactment of s. 83  was to impose an
additional penalty for what is, in effect, an aggravated form of robbery. 
Robbery can be committed without either the possession or the use of a firearm. 
The ""use"" of a ""firearm"" is not an essential element of the
crime of robbery.  A person may be convicted of that crime in the absence of a
pistol, revolver or other firearms.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
purpose of this statutory disposition was to enable the Crown to obtain additional
penalties where a firearm is used during the commission or the attempt to
commit an offence.  The Crown argues that Dickson J.'s comments were only obiter since,
in that case, both the underlying offence (robbery) and the use of a firearm
during the commission of that offence were prosecuted and the accused was found
guilty of both.  I cannot accept this argument.  The comments of Dickson J.
were, under the circumstances of the case, more than an obiter.  In my
opinion, they were of general application and were necessary to the conclusion
he arrived at.  I do not contest the fact that this decision does not settle
the question raised in the case at bar.  Nonetheless, it is highly useful since
the goal and purpose of s. 83(1)  are well identified in it.  Indeed, it seems
to me indisputable that the goal and purpose of a provision remain the same,
generally speaking, notwithstanding the circumstances in which the provision is
relied upon.

 

    The
imposition of additional punishment, in this case minimum punishment, for using
a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence could have been achieved
by Parliament in more than one way.

 

    One
way would have been to do it through a sentencing provision, as the Code does
for certain repeat offenders.  Another way would have been to create an
aggravated form of offence, such as was done for aggravated assaults. 
Noticeable is the fact that the additional punishment for the aggravated
offence is obtained through the availability in either case of a higher maximum
penalty sometimes coupled with a minimum sentence.

 

    If
the Crown were right we would have an aggravated offence with a maximum penalty
(14 years) that is less than many indictable offences in the Code
(murder, burglary in a dwelling house, robbery and others) and a minimum (1
year) which, at least in the case of murder, is a lesser one.  The only way s.
83(1)  will logically achieve the purpose this Court has identified as being the
one Parliament is seeking, that is an additional penalty, is to provide
for a sentence that will be tacked on to a previous one.  This can only be
achieved by the prerequisite of a sentence for the underlying offence, and that
sentence can only be imposed (albeit a suspended sentence) if there has been a
distinct conviction and not only a finding of fact as would be sufficient if
the Crown's contention were right.

 

    I
should add that while the conviction and sentence for the underlying offence is
a prerequisite to those under s. 83(1) , this is not to say that they will not
be obtained and imposed contemporaneously as in this case.  Furthermore, while
it is always preferable that, if in the same charge, the two offences be in
separate counts, they could well be both in the same count.  Of course to meet
the prerequisite I have just set out, that is a distinct previous conviction,
the count would have to be a truly duplicitous count (not to be confused with a
multiplicitous count); that is the count would have to be worded in such a way
that it would be clear to the accused that he is in jeopardy of being found
guilty of two offences, clearly identified, the underlying offence and the
offence of having used a firearm while committing that offence.  A charge of
having used a firearm while committing an assault is not duplicitous but a
charge under s. 83  and cannot be dealt with unless there is another count and
conviction for assault.

 

    But
a charge of having committed an assault and of having used a firearm in the
commission thereof, contrary to ss. 244(1) (b) and 83 
of the Criminal Code  meets the requirement.  However, the judge must convict
for assault in order to convict for the use of the firearm.

 

    But
as I said, duplicitous counts are highly undesirable because of all kinds of
procedural complications and the better way is to have distinct counts or
charges.

 

    In
the case at bar, the underlying offence, in the context of the charge of having
used a firearm while committing a criminal offence, seems to be the offence of
unlawful confinement.  However, the terms used in the indictment do not permit
us to be certain in this regard.  Nonetheless, I am of the view that it is not
necessary to identify with certainty this underlying offence for disposing of
the case at bar.

 

    If
the offence of unlawful confinement was the underlying offence that the Crown
had in mind at the time of the laying of the indictment, the Court of Appeal
was justified in allowing the appeal and quashing the guilty verdict pronounced
with respect to s. 83(1)  since the respondent has been acquitted of the count
of unlawful confinement of Mr. Standish, the employer.

 

    If
the offence was not unlawful confinement, the trial judge has nevertheless
committed an error in law in finding the accused guilty of having used a
firearm while committing an assault.  The accused has not been charged with any
count of assault, whether in that count or in a distinct count, and, as such,
he could not have been and in fact has not been found guilty of such an
offence.

 

    Finally,
the Crown's argument to the effect that the Court of Appeal committed an error
of law in quashing the guilty verdict with respect to the offence under s.
83(1) , since the accused had been convicted of offences during which he used a
firearm, does not affect my conclusion.  This argument seems to me to be
without merit since, in my opinion, the count must clearly indicate the offence
during which the accused person is charged with having used a firearm. 
Furthermore, the fact that the Crown raises this question demonstrates the
importance of clearly identifying the underlying offence.  This illustrates one
of the many difficulties which could arise in the absence of a clear indication
concerning the underlying offence.

 

2.  Returning
the Matter to the Trial Judge

 

    The
Crown argues that the Court of Appeal, after having allowed the appeal and
quashed the guilty verdict with respect to the offence under s. 83(1) , should
have exercised its discretionary power conferred by virtue of s.
613(8)  of the Criminal Code  and should have
remitted the case to the trial judge for a determination whether guilty
verdicts should be entered with respect to counts 3 and 4.

 

    Guilty
verdicts were in fact pronounced with respect to these two offences but the
guilty verdicts were not entered against the respondent in view of the Kienapple
principle.  The guilty verdict pronounced with respect to the offence under s.
83(1)  having been quashed, the application of this principle is open to review.

 

    Section
623  of the Criminal Code  enables this
Court, in the opinion of the appellant, to remit the case to the trial judge
for a determination whether guilty verdicts should be entered with respect to
counts 3 and 4 since it states, among others things, that this Court may make
any order that the court of appeal might have made.

 

    The
Respondent, on the other hand, argues that this Court does not have this power
in view of s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act.  This section
states that ""No appeal lies to the Supreme Court from a judgment or order
made in the exercise of judicial discretion"" except in the case of
certains exceptions with which we are not concerned in the case at bar.

 

    Section
44 of the Supreme Court Act, in my view, aims
solely at preventing parties from bringing an appeal from a purely
discretionary decision.  In the case at bar, the Crown does not bring an appeal
from a discretionary decision.  It appeals from a judgment on the basis that it
involves an error of law and in the course of this appeal asks for a revision
of the exercise of a discretionary power ancillary to the contested decision. 
As such, s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act does not
constitute an impediment to the request made by the Crown.

 

    There
remains to be determined, since it is a matter of discretion,  whether this
Court should exercise its discretion in the way requested by the Crown.  This
Court is usually reluctant to intervene and to quash a decision handed down by
a lower court in the context of a discretionary power.

 

    However,
I am of the opinion that this Court should intervene given the circumstances of
this case.  The Court of Appeal did not exercise its discretion one way or the
other.  It seems rather that it did not even address the question whether it
would be appropriate to return the matter to the trial judge.  This is
understandable since it appears that no request in this regard was made by the
Crown and as well that no arguments concerning this question were made by the
parties.  As such, it is not a case where the appellant is unsatisfied with the
way the Court of Appeal exercised its discretion and asks this Court to
intervene.  Consequently, this Court, in my view, should feel free to intervene
and to exercise its own discretion as requested by the Crown.

 

    This
Court has the discretion and the power to make the order requested by the
Crown.  Section 613(8)  of the Criminal Code  clearly
gives this power to the Court of Appeal by stating that where the Court of
Appeal exercises any of the powers conferred by subss. (2), (4), (6) or (7), it
may make any order, in addition, that justice requires.  Section 623 of the Code, on the
other hand, states that this Court may make any order that the Court of Appeal
might have made.  Since the Court of Appeal might have ordered, upon allowing
the appeal under s. 613(2) , that the file, in virtue of s. 613(8) , be remitted
to the trial judge, this Court, by virtue of s. 623 , has the power to make this
order.

 

    Thus,
I am of the opinion that, given the circumstances of this case, we should, as
in R. v. Terlecki, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 483, in dismissing the appeal, order
that the file be remitted to the trial judge so that he may determine whether
to register a conviction on counts 3 and 4 or on one of them and if so, to
impose sentence.

 

    I
should finally mention the fact that the Crown did not bring an appeal from the
trial judge's decision not to enter the guilty verdicts with respect to counts
3 and 4 and, consequently, the application of the Kienapple
principle made by the trial judge to either or both those counts was and
remains beyond our reach.

 

    Accordingly,
I would dismiss the appeal against the acquittal and order that the file be
remitted to the trial judge for him to register a conviction or a stay in
accordance with Kienapple v. The Queen as regards counts
3 and 4 and then to impose sentence.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

 

    Constitutional
law -- Charter of Rights  -- Trial within reasonable time -- Pre-charge delay --
Whether pre‑charge delay relevant to determining if an accused's right to
be tried within reasonable time has been infringed ‑‑ Meaning of
the phrase a ""person charged with an offence"" in s. 11(b) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

 

    Criminal
law -- Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada -- Appeal where acquittal set
aside -- Court of Appeal vacating trial judge's order quashing an indictment

Court of Canada pursuant to s. 618(2)(a) of the Criminal Code.

 

    Following
a police investigation, the appellants were arrested without warrants on May 5,
1982.  They were released on the same day and no charges were laid against them
until January 14, 1983 when K was charged with theft and P with conspiracy to
commit theft.  The Crown explained that the time required to prepare its case
caused the delay in swearing the information.  After the preliminary inquiry, a
trial date was fixed for February 4, 1985.  At trial, the appellants moved
before plea to quash the indictment, on the ground that the delay in bringing
the case to trial constituted an infringement of their right to be tried within
a reasonable time guaranteed in s. 11 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The trial judge found that both
appellants and their families suffered serious trauma and public embarrassment
because of these arrests.  He held that while the time from the swearing
of the information to the date of trial did not amount to an unreasonable
delay, the delay of some eight months between arrest and release and the
swearing of the information was unreasonable and he quashed the indictment.  On
appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in
considering the pre‑information delay in deciding whether the appellants'
s. 11 (b) Charter  right had been infringed.  The Court
vacated the order quashing the indictment and a trial on the merits was
directed.  The appellants now purport to appeal to this Court as of right
pursuant to s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

    Held (Lamer
and Wilson JJ. dissenting):  The appeals should be dismissed.

 

    Per
McIntyre, La Forest and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.:  Section 618(2)(a) of the Code
provides an appeal for persons acquitted of an indictable offence whose
acquittal has been set aside in the Court of Appeal.  The appellants in this
case were not acquitted and, on the face of the Criminal Code , there
would appear to be no right of appeal.  However, if the trial judge had had the
benefit of the later decisions of this Court in Mills and Jewitt on this
question, it is reasonable to assume that instead of quashing the indictment he
would have ordered a judicial stay, which in accordance with Jewitt would
have been tantamount to an acquittal, and an appeal would thus have been open
under s. 618(2) (a) upon the reversal of the stay in the Court of Appeal. 
Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction exists for the
hearing of these appeals.

 

    Section
11  affords its protection after an accused is charged with an offence.  A
person is ""charged with an offence"" within the meaning of that
section when an information is sworn alleging an offence against him, or where
a direct indictment is laid against him when no information is sworn.  It
follows that the reckoning of time in considering whether a person has been
accorded a trial within a reasonable time under s. 11 (b) will
commence with the information or indictment, where no information has been
laid, and will continue until the completion of the trial.  Pre‑information
delay will not be a factor.  This construction is supported by the words of the Charter  and, as
well, upon a consideration of its organization and structure.  The specific
language of s. 11  should not be ignored and the meaning of the word
""charged"" should not be twisted in an attempt to extend the operation
of the section into the pre‑charge period.  Prior to the charge, the
rights of the accused are protected by general law and guaranteed by
ss. 7 , 8 , 9  and 10  of the Charter .  Here,
appellants' right to a trial within a reasonable time has not been infringed. 
The time from the swearing of the information to the date of trial did not
amount to an unreasonable delay.

 

    Per Lamer
J. (dissenting):  The time frame to be considered in computing trial within a
reasonable time generally runs only from the moment a person is charged.  A
person is charged under s. 11 (b) as of, (a) the
service of a summons, the execution of a warrant pursuant to the laying of an
information under s. 455.3  of the Criminal Code , or as
of the moment a person is informed by the authorities of their existence; or
(b) the issuance of an appearance notice under s. 451 of the Code or
release from custody under ss. 452 or 453 of the Code; or (c)
as of the arrest, in the case of all other arrested persons not covered by (a)
or (b).  This definition of a ""person charged"" makes no distinction
between an arrest with or without a warrant.  In both cases, the person
arrested enjoys the protection of s. 11 (b).  This
definition is also the most consistent with the rationale of s. 11 (b) as the
charge from which the ""reasonable time"" inquiry begins will
correspond to the start of the impairment of the accused's interests in the
liberty and security of the person.  The concept of the security of the person,
in the context of s. 11 (b), is not
restricted to physical integrity but encompasses protection against
""overlong subjection to the vexations and vicissitudes of a pending
criminal accusation"".

 

    Applying
the definition to these cases, the delay started when the appellants were first
arrested and released and the period between the arrest and the laying of the
charges should have been computed in determining whether or not they have been
tried within reasonable time.  There is no doubt that, from the moment of the
arrest, the appellants suffered a breach of their liberty as well as a
restraint of their security.  It is also obvious that that eight‑month
period between the arrest and the laying of the charges was in violation of
s. 11 (b).  The appellants did not consent to the delay and
tried to expedite the laying of the charges.  The Crown gave no reasonable
explanation to justify the delay.  On the contrary, its explanation was an
admission to the fact that they were not ready to charge and therefore should
not have arrested.  A stay of proceedings should be ordered.

 

    Per Wilson
J. (dissenting):  Since s. 11(b) of the Charter  is
designed to protect the liberty and security interests of the accused, the
relevant starting point for the running of time under the section should not be
upon the ex parte laying of the information before the
justice of the peace but rather when the impact of the criminal process is felt
by the accused through the service of process upon him in the form of a summons
or notice of appearance or an arrest with or without a warrant.  However, the
prejudice to the security interests of an accused arising purely from the fact
of the imposition of the process upon him should not be considered in assessing
the reasonableness of the delay.  The prejudice relevant under s. 11 (b) is the
prejudice arising from the delay and not the prejudice arising from the
imposition of the process.  Here, the appellants were prejudiced by the
delay between the arrest and the laying of the information and this prejudice
can be attributed to the delay and not simply to the imposition of the
process.  Although an arrest and the subsequent laying of the charges
would have affected their broad security interests at any time, the unjustified
delay in the bringing of specific charges substantially aggravated that
prejudice beyond what is acceptable or inherent in the criminal process itself.

//McIntyre J.//

 

                    The
judgment of McIntyre, La Forest and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. was delivered by

 

                    MCINTYRE J. --
The general issue on these appeals is whether the rights of the appellants
under s. 11 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
""to be tried within a reasonable time"" have been infringed.   More
specifically, the question is whether pre-charge delays should be included in
the calculation of whether there was an unreasonable delay in bringing the
appellants to trial.

 

                    The
appellants, Kalanj and Pion, were arrested without warrants on May 5, 1982.  
The police suspected Kalanj of stealing meat from his meatpacker employer and
delivering it to Pion, also in the meat packing business, for sale by Pion and
a division of the profits.   The arrest followed a detailed investigation by
the police which commenced in early March of 1982.  On March 17, 1982, the
police procured a judicial authorization to intercept the private
communications of Kalanj and other unknown persons, and proceeded to intercept
some sixty-five communications between March 18, 1982 and May 5, 1982.   
On the basis of information thus acquired, the police obtained and executed
search warrants and made the arrests.   Following their arrests, the appellants
were finger printed and placed in police cells but were released later the same
day.  They were told not to leave the city and were informed, as well, that
charges would be laid and that a summons would issue.   The arrests were made
at the appellants' places of business; they received wide publicity and there
can be no doubt that the appellants suffered grave embarrassment.  The trial
judge found that prior to being charged, but after arrest and release, both
appellants and their families suffered serious trauma and public embarrassment
because of these arrests.

 

                    On
January 14, 1983, some eight months and nineteen days after the arrests and
releases, an information was sworn alleging that the appellants had committed
the offences of theft and conspiracy to commit theft.  This delay in swearing
the information was said by the Crown to have been made necessary because of
the time required to prepare its case.   It was necessary to review a large
number of intercepted communications, to identify those which were relevant to
the various issues, and to have them transcribed.   Much police time, it was
said, was consumed in interviewing witnesses whose names became known to the
police because of the interceptions, and the matter was not ready for the
swearing of the information until January 14, 1983.

 

                    The
trial did not commence until February of 1985, some two years after the
information was sworn.   The appellants' first court appearance was on February
18, 1983, the purpose of which was to fix a date for the preliminary hearing.  
On that date the proceedings were adjourned until March 9, 1983 at the
request of counsel for the appellants, who wished to obtain particulars from
the Crown.  The particulars were supplied on March 30, 1983 and the case
was set over until April 13, 1983 to fix a date for the preliminary hearing. 
The preliminary hearing was set to run from September 6 to September 20,
1983.  It was adjourned twice:  once at the request of counsel for Kalanj, who
was engaged in another trial, and once because of problems caused by a strike
of government employees.  On April 17, 1984 the preliminary hearing
commenced and the appellants were committed for trial upon its conclusion in
late April.  On May 31, 1984 a trial date was fixed for February 4, 1985.

 

                    At
trial, the appellants moved before plea to quash the indictment, on the ground
that the delay in bringing the case to trial constituted an infringement of
their right to be tried within a reasonable time guaranteed in s. 11 (b) of the Charter .   The
trial judge found that while the time from the swearing of the information to
the date of trial did not amount to an unreasonable delay, the delay of some
eight months between arrest and release and the swearing of the information was
unreasonable.  He said:

 

                    I
have not up to now referred to the period of time between the formal laying of
the charges in January of 1983 and the trial in February of 1985.   It is my
view without reviewing what happened during that period that standing alone and
open to many criticisms this period nevertheless in itself does not disclose a
degree of unreasonableness so as to justify taking an extreme step such as the
quashing of the indictment.  My view is otherwise if the period prior to the
formal laying of the charge back to the arrests is considered.

 

He
quashed the indictment.

 

                    On
appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal (Craig, Macfarlane and McLachlin
JJ.A.) unanimously decided that the trial judge erred in considering the
pre-information delay in deciding whether the appellants' s. 11 (b) Charter  right
had been infringed: (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 136.  The order quashing the
indictment was vacated and a trial on the merits was directed. 

 

                    The
appellants now purport to appeal to this Court as of right pursuant to s.
618(2) (a) of the Criminal Code , which
provides an appeal for  persons acquitted of an indictable offence whose
acquittal has been set aside in the Court of Appeal.    The appellants were
not, however, acquitted:  the indictment upon which they were to stand trial
was quashed.   Section 605(1)(c) of the Code
permitted the Crown to appeal to the Court of Appeal, but s. 618(2) (a) does
not on its terms permit these appeals.   Section 602  of the Criminal
Code  provides that no appeals save those provided for in the Code shall
be taken in indictable offences.   On the face of the Criminal
Code  sections, there would then appear to be no right of
appeal.   

 

                    The
judgment at trial was released before the judgment of this Court in Mills v.
The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863.  In that case, Lamer J., though
dissenting on other grounds, considered that where a s. 11 (b) Charter  right
had been infringed the appropriate remedy would be a stay of proceedings.  In R. v.
Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, this Court held that a stay of
proceedings granted at trial was tantamount to an acquittal and therefore
subject to appeal by the Crown pursuant to s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code .  If the trial judge had had the benefit of the later
decisions on this question, it is reasonable to assume that instead of quashing
the indictment he would have ordered a judicial stay, which in accordance with Jewitt would
have been tantamount to an acquittal, and an appeal would thus have been open
under s. 618(2)(a) of the Code upon the reversal
of the stay in the Court of Appeal.   I am therefore of the view that in the
circumstances of this case jurisdiction exists for the hearing of these
appeals.

 

                    I
now turn to the main issue on the appeals.  Section 11 (b) of the Charter 
provides that ""Any person charged with an offence has the right ... to be
tried within a reasonable time"".   The section, it will be observed,
refers only to those persons who are ""charged"" with an offence.  The
question, then, which must be answered is:  When is a person ""charged with
an offence"" within the meaning of s. 11 (b)?

 

                    This
issue was considered by both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal.   The
trial judge seems to have concluded that ""the appellants were only charged
for the purposes of the Charter  when some justice signed the information in
January, 1983"".    He concluded, however, that the pre-charge delay could
be considered in deciding if an accused had been tried within a reasonable time
under s. 11 (b).  The Court of Appeal, on the other hand, held that s.
11 (b) is specifically and exclusively addressed to the delay
between the actual charge, which is the laying of the information, and the date
of the trial, and that s. 11 (b) may not be
invoked in response to a delay in laying a charge.  It was argued before this
Court that the Court of Appeal erred in its interpretation of s. 11 (b). 
Counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants were charged within
the meaning of s. 11 (b) at the time of their arrest and release and that,
accordingly, the entire period from May 5, 1982 until the commencement of the
trial on February 4, 1985 should be considered in deciding if the trial had
taken place within a reasonable time.

 

                    The
word ""charged"" or ""charge"" is not one of fixed or unvarying
meaning at law.   It may be and is used in a variety of ways to describe a
variety of events.   A person is clearly charged with an offence when a charge
is read out to him in court and he is called upon to plead.  Many authorities
support this view if authority is necessary:  see R. v. Chabot, [1980]
2 S.C.R. 985, and the cases cited therein.  A person could be considered in a
general or popular sense to be charged with an offence when informed by one in
authority that ""you will be summoned to court"" or upon an arrest when
in answer to a demand to know what all this is about an officer replies:
""You are arrested for murder"".  There are many other occasions when
in the popular mind a person may be said to be charged for, according to
Professor Mewett in An Introduction to the Criminal Process in Canada (1988),
the word ""charge"" has no precise meaning at law but merely means that
steps are being taken which in the normal course will lead to a criminal
prosecution.  However, despite what may be termed the imprecision of the word
""charge"" or the phrase ""a person charged"", the courts are
faced with the task of developing a meaning of the word as used in s. 11  of the Charter .

 

                    In
addressing this task, the courts have generally avoided the definite but
restricted definition to be found in Chabot, supra, and
have generally concluded that a person is charged with an offence within the
meaning of s. 11  of the Charter  when an information has been sworn
which constitutes an initiating step in court proceedings.   In R. v.
Boron (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 25 (Ont. H.C.), Ewaschuk J.
considered what he saw as three possible interpretations of the word
""charged"", and he concluded, at p. 31, that:

 

                    In
conclusion, I adopt the more prevalent view that the word ""charged""
in s. 11  of the Charter  refers to the laying of an information, or the
preferment of a direct indictment where no information has been laid.  In
consequence, the time-frame to be considered in computing trial within a
reasonable time only runs from the laying of a charge.  This general rule may
have certain exceptions which I deal with later.  Accordingly, the trial judge
erred in holding that the Charter  guarantees the right of a person to have
proceedings promptly instituted against a person charged with an offence.

 

He had
earlier said, at p. 28, referring to the old practice when a peace officer
making an arrest would say:  ""I charge you in the name of the Queen with
the murder of John Smith"":

 

However,
that interpretation of the word ""charged"" is somewhat antiquated in
light of s. 10 (a) of the Charter  which requires a peace officer on
arrest or detention to inform the person arrested or detained of the reason (or
reasons) therefor.   By contrast, the Crown prosecutor is assumed to be the
governmental official who decides the appropriate charge....

 

He also
rejected the idea that one is charged only when one appears in court to answer
the charge, in other words, the Chabot approach.   On
this basis, Ewaschuk J. concluded that the time period, which under s. 11 (b) of the Charter  must be
reasonable, is the period commencing with the swearing of the information or
the preferring of a direct indictment when an information has not been sworn
and concluding with the trial.   In this approach, pre-information delay would
not be a factor, but it will be observed that he allowed for an exception which
in some cases would permit consideration of pre-charge time.

 

                    The
proposition that an accused person is charged only when the information is
sworn has been accepted in a number of appellate court decisions.  In R. v.
Young (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 1, for example, the Ontario
Court of Appeal referred to the date of the information as being ""the time
that the respondent was charged"".  Dubin J.A., speaking for the court,
said that in that case there was no delay between the time of the charge, by
which he was referring to the time of the swearing of the information, and the
time of the trial, and therefore, s. 11 (b) had no
application.  See also: R. v. Belton (1982), 3 C.C.C.
(3d) 427 (Man.);  R. v. Heaslip (1983), 9 C.C.C.
(3d) 480 (Ont.);  Re Kott and The Queen (1983), 7 C.C.C.
(3d) 317 (Que.); and R. v. Devji (1985), 19 C.C.C.
(3d) 310 (B.C.)   This approach has also been adopted at the trial level:  Re Gray
and The Queen (1982), 70 C.C.C. (2d) 62 (Sask.);  R. v.
Belcourt (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 286 (B.C.); and R. v.
Davis (1988), 86 N.S.R. (2d) 284.  I would note here that the Criminal
Code  in s. 455 , for indictable offences, and in
ss. 723  and 724 , for summary conviction offences, speaks of the laying of an
information and requires, as well, that an information be sworn.    For the
purposes of this judgment, the terms ""laying an information"" and
""swearing an information"", having the same significance, are used
interchangeably.

 

                    As
has been said, the argument which the appellants have raised on this appeal is
that they were charged within the meaning of s. 11 (b) on the
date of the arrest, which was some eight months prior to the laying of the
information.  The appellants submit that this Court's decisions in Mills v.
The Queen, supra, and Carter v. The Queen, [1986]
1 S.C.R. 981, support this proposition.  Briefly, the argument is that Lamer
J.'s dissent in Mills (concurred in by Dickson C.J.) which
extended the meaning of ""charged"" was adopted by the majority in Carter.  In Mills, Lamer
J. expressed the view that the meaning of ""charged"" should be one
which is consistent with the aim and purpose of the section.  In his view, the
reasonable time under s. 11 (b) must be computed from the start of the impairment of
the accused's interest in the liberty and security of the person.  He therefore
considered that a person would be charged upon:

 

(a)  the service of a summons, the execution of a
warrant pursuant to the laying of an information under s. 455.3  of the Criminal
Code , or as of the moment a person is informed by the
authorities of their existence; or

 

(b)  the issuance of an appearance notice under s. 451
of the Code or release from custody under ss. 452 or 453 of the Code;  or

 

(c)  as of the arrest, in the case of all other arrested
persons not covered by (a) or (b).

 

(Mills, supra, at p.
946.)

 

 This
view did not attract the support or agreement of a majority of the Court.  On
the same day that the judgment in Mills was released the
Court released the judgment in Carter v. The Queen.    The
argument of the appellants is that in Carter Lamer
J. applied the definition of ""charge"" which he set out in Mills.  He
said, at p. 985:

 

                    The accused in this case was
""charged"" as of the service of a summons pursuant to the laying of
the information, which means that he was charged on January 28, 1983.

 

                    As
I have indicated in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
863, which has been handed down this same day, the time frame to be considered
in computing trial within a reasonable time generally  runs only from the
moment a person is charged.   In passing, I might add that I say
""generally"" because there might be exceptional circumstances under
which the time might run prior to the actual charge on which the accused will
be tried.   As an example, if the Crown withdraws the charge to substitute a
different one but for the same transaction, the computation of time might well
commence as of the first charge.  This is not in issue here and reference to
this situation is only illustrative of my resort to the word
""generally"".   Consequently, the period running from April 3, 1980 to
January 28, 1983, should not have been taken into consideration when assessing
the reasonableness of the delay under s. 11 (b).

 

And
later he said, at p. 986:

 

                    The
only period of time which may properly be considered in assessing whether or
not a violation of s. 11 (b) has occurred is that period running from January 28,
1983 to May 6, 1983, the date on which the inquiry into the reasonableness of
the delay began.   Only 3 1/2 months had elapsed and the applicant has not
suggested that this time span was in violation of s. 11 (b).   It
is obvious that the applicant was relying on the pre-charge delay;  in any
event, most of the post-charge delay was with the accused's consent, indeed a
good part of it was at his own request.

 

The
appellants submit that since Lamer J.'s reasons in Carter were
concurred in by seven judges of this Court, the majority of the Court adopted
the extended definition of ""charged"" advanced by Lamer J. in Mills.

 

                    A
similar argument was considered by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v.
Mackintosh (1988), 26 B.C.L.R. (2d) 1.  Macfarlane J.A., for
the majority, considered the minority views of Lamer J. in Mills and the
majority judgments in Carter, and stated at p. 11:

 

It is plain that a person is ""charged"" within
the meaning of s. 11 , when a formal charge (information or indictment) is laid,
and the accused is served with process.  That was so in Carter.  Lamer
J. said (at p. 985) of Carter:

 

The
accused in this case was ""charged"" as of the service of a summons
pursuant to the laying of the information, which means that he was charged on
January 28, 1983.

 

On this
basis, he concluded, at p. 11, that:

 

The
majority judgment in Carter is more confined in its treatment of
the definition of the word ""charged"" than it is in the minority
judgment of Mr. Justice Lamer in Mills.   I am unable to
construe the language of the majority judgment in Carter as
incorporating all of the minority views of Mr. Justice Lamer in Mills.

 

However,
after determining that a person is ""charged"" as of the laying of an
information, per this Court's decision in Carter,
Macfarlane J.A. then asked:  At what other time is a person
""charged""?   On the basis of the language used by the majority in Carter, he
concluded that a person may be charged, at ""the moment an actual charge is
laid, or in exceptional circumstances on some earlier date"".  In other
words, in Macfarlane J.A.'s view, the word ""charged"" should be given
a flexible definition, one which would vary depending on the circumstances of
the particular case.   Under this approach, ""charged"" in some
situations may mean the date the information is sworn but in others it would
refer to an earlier date.

 

                    With
all deference to contrary opinions, I am of the view that it cannot be said
that this Court in Carter adopted the minority view in Mills, on the
question of the extension of the meaning of the word ""charged""
developed by Lamer J.  In Carter, Lamer J., with the agreement of
seven judges who heard the case, clearly stated that an accused was charged
upon the swearing of the information, and Carter
supports the view that the pre-charge delay is not a factor for consideration
under s. 11 (b).   To this extent, then, I am in agreement with the
above quoted comments of Macfarlane J.A. in Mackintosh but,
with respect, I do not agree with the majority in that case that
""charged"" has a flexible meaning varying with the circumstances of
the case.   I would therefore hold that a person is ""charged with an
offence"" within the meaning of s. 11  of the Charter  when an
information is sworn alleging an offence against him, or where a direct
indictment is laid against him when no information is sworn.  It would follow,
then, that the reckoning of time in considering whether a person has been
accorded a trial within a reasonable time under s. 11 (b) will
commence with the information or indictment, where no information has been
laid, and will continue until the completion of the trial:  see R. v.
Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588, at p. 633, where La Forest J.
said:

 

The
question of delay must be open to assessment at all stages of a criminal
proceeding, from the laying of the charge to the rendering of judgment
at trial.  [Emphasis added.]

 

and see,
as well, Argentina v. Mellino, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
536, at p. 548, where the same judge said: 

 

It gives
a Charter  remedy for delay when a prosecution has been
initiated.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Pre-information
delay will not be a factor.                                  

 

                    This
construction is supported by the words of the Charter  and, as
well, upon a consideration of its organization and structure.  Section 11  is
one of eight sections grouped under the heading of ""Legal Rights"". 
Section 7  guarantees the general ""right to life, liberty and security of
the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice"".  This section applies at all
stages of the investigatory and judicial process.  Sections 8  and 9  afford
guarantees of rights of particular importance in the investigatory or
pre-charge stage, as does s. 10  which deals with rights upon arrest.  Section
11  deals with a later stage of the proceedings, that is, when judicial proceedings
are instituted by a charge.   Sections 12  and 13  deal with matters which follow
the trial, and s. 14  again refers to matters during trial.

 

                    In
dealing with s. 11 , it must first be recognized that it is limited in its terms
to a special group of persons, those ""charged with an offence"".  It
deals primarily with matters relating to the trial.  It is to be noted that s.
11  is distinct from s. 10  and serves a different purpose:  the two sections
must not be equated.  The framers of the Charter  made a
clear distinction between the rights guaranteed to a person arrested and those
of a person upon charge.  Sections 8  and 9 , as well, guarantee essential rights
ordinarily of significance in the investigatory period, separate and distinct
from those covered in s. 11 .  It has been said that the purpose of s. 11  should
be considered in deciding upon the extent of its application.  This purpose, it
has been said, is to afford protection for the liberty and security interests
of persons accused of crime.  While it is true that s. 11  operates for this
purpose, I emphasize that it does so within its own sphere.  It is not, nor was
it intended to be, the sole guarantor and protector of such rights.  As stated
above, s. 7  affords broad protection for liberty and security, while the other
sections, particularly those dealing with legal rights, apply to protect those
rights in certain stated circumstances.  Section 11  affords its protection
after an accused is charged with an offence.  The specific language of s. 11  should
not be ignored and the meaning of the word ""charged"" should not be
twisted in an attempt to extend the operation of the section into the
pre-charge period.   The purpose of s. 11 (b) is
clear.  It is concerned with the period between the laying of the charge and
the conclusion of the trial and it provides that a person charged with an
offence will be promptly dealt with.

 

                    The
length of the pre-information or investigatory period is wholly unpredictable. 
No reasonable assessment of what is, or is not, a reasonable time can be
readily made.  Circumstances will differ from case to case and much information
gathered in an investigation must, by its very nature, be confidential.  A
court will rarely, if ever, be able to fix in any realistic manner a time limit
for the investigation of a given offence.   It is notable that the law -- save
for some limited statutory exceptions -- has never recognized a time limitation
for the institution of criminal proceedings.  Where, however, the investigation
reveals evidence which would justify the swearing of an information, then for
the first time the assessment of a reasonable period for the conclusion of the
matter by trial becomes possible.   It is for that reason that s. 11  limits its
operation to the post-information period.  Prior to the charge, the rights of
the accused are protected by general law and guaranteed by ss. 7 , 8 , 9  and 10 
of the Charter .

 

                    I
acknowledge that in taking this position it may be said that I am departing
from the earlier judgments of this Court which have said that there will be
exceptional cases where pre-charge delays will be relevant under s. 11 (b).  In
my view, however, the departure is more apparent than real.   The exception
referred to by Lamer J. in Carter -- where two indictments are
preferred because of successful appeals after a first trial -- has been dealt
with in R. v. Antoine (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), and Re Garton
and Whelan (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. H.C.)  These cases
support the proposition that pre-charge delay is not relevant under s. 11 (b), by
holding that the time commences to run from the date the original information
was sworn. 

 

                    It
has been considered that special circumstances could arise which, in the
interests of justice, would require some consideration of pre-charge delay
because of prejudice which could result from its occurrence.  In my view,
however, the exceptional cases should be dealt with by reliance on the general
rules of law and, where necessary, the other sections of the Charter . This approach
would take account of and meet the concerns caused by the possibility of
pre-charge delays.  Delays which occur at the pre-charge stage are not immune
from the law outside the scope of s. 11 (b).  The Criminal
Code  itself in ss. 577(3)  and 737(1)  protects the right to
make full answer and defence should it be prejudiced by pre-charge delay. 
Section  455.1  provides for a prompt swearing of an information where an
appearance notice has been issued or an accused has been released from custody
under ss. 452  or 453 .   As well, the doctrine of abuse of process may be called
in aid and as early as 1844 the common law demonstrated that it was capable of
dealing with pre-information delays.  Baron Alderson in
R. v. Robins (1844), 1 Cox C.C. 114, in a case where nearly two
years had elapsed from the alleged commission of an offence before a complaint
was made to the justices, said:

 

I ought not to allow this case to go further.   It is
monstrous to put a man on his trial after such a lapse of time.   How can he
account for his conduct so far back?   If you accuse a man of a crime the next
day, he may be enabled to bring forward his servants and family to say where he
was and what he was about at the time;  but if the charge be not preferred for
a year or more, how can he clear himself?   No man's life would be safe if such
a prosecution were permitted.  It would be very unjust to put him on his trial.

 

                    His
Lordship then directed the jury to acquit the prisoner.

 

In
addition, given the broad wording of s. 7  and the other Charter 
provisions referred to above, it is not, in my view, necessary to distort the
words of s. 11 (b) in order to guard against a pre-charge delay.   In my
view, the concerns which have moved the Court to recognize the possibility of
special circumstances which would justify a consideration of pre-charge delay
under s. 11 (b) will thus be met.

 

                    In
the case at bar, both the courts below considered that the post-charge delays
were not such that they could be said to deprive the appellants of trial within
a reasonable time.   I am in agreement with this finding.   The trial judge,
however, considered the pre-charge delay of some eight months and concluded
that it was unreasonable and upon that conclusion found that s. 11 (b) had
been infringed.  In this, I, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, consider
that he was in error.  I would accordingly dismiss the appeals.

 

                    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

                    LAMER J.
(dissenting) -- My colleague Justice McIntyre has set out most accurately in
his reasons the facts and the proceedings, and has analyzed the judgments
below.  I would only add to the facts the following observation made by trial
judge Selbie:

 

                          One
or two more observations on the period in question.  I am satisfied that the
accused through their counsel did everything they could to determine their
position and have the charges formally laid so as to meet them.  I am not
satisfied that the authorities did all they could to expedite the inevitable,
that is, the formal laying of the charges.

 

                    The
real issue in these cases requires that we define when a person has become
""a person charged"".  As I have indicated in Mills v.
The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, and in Carter v. The Queen, [1986]
1 S.C.R. 981, the time frame to be considered in computing trial within a
reasonable time generally runs only from the moment a person is charged.  This
is the definition of the word ""charged"" I gave as most appropriate
under s. 11 (b) in Mills, at p. 946:

 

                    A person is charged as of,

 

(a) the service of a summons, the execution of a warrant
pursuant to the laying of an information under s. 455.3  of the Criminal
Code , or as of the moment a person is informed by the
authorities of their existence; or

 

(b) the issuance of an appearance notice under s. 451 of
the Code or release from custody under ss. 452 or 453 of the Code; or

 

(c) as
of the arrest, in the case of all other arrested persons not covered by (a) or
(b).

 

                    I
still think that this definition is the most consistent with the rationale of
s. 11 (b) as the charge from which the ""reasonable
time"" inquiry begins will correspond to the start of the impairment of the
accused's interests in the liberty and security of the person.  There will
also, in addition, be instances where a person might be considered as
""charged"" prior to the actual charge for which he is being prosecuted
or prior to his arrest without a warrant or a notice to appear.  But that is
not in issue here and should be left to another day.  

 

                    As
the issue was not live in Mills, I did not expand upon my reasons for
setting out the above definition of ""person charged"", beyond merely
stating its coherence with the rationale of s. 11 (b).  I
think it in order to do so now.

 

                    Generally
speaking, a charge begins with an information.  Unless the accused is present
at the time the information is laid, which very seldom occurs, the justice or
judge issues a warrant or a summons to get the accused before him to answer the
charge.  My brother McIntyre suggests that as of that moment the clock as
regards s. 11 (b) starts ticking.  I respectfully think that this is too
early.  Indeed, until the process is executed or until the accused has
knowledge of its existence, the ""impairment of the accused's
interest"" has not really begun.  Furthermore, one must acknowledge that in
certain cases a period of time will be needed because of the difficulties often
involved in tracing the accused.  This is why I chose, as a starting point,
service of the summons, execution of the warrant, but sometimes earlier, that
is if the accused is informed of the existence of the charge by the
authorities.  I still think that this is the better moment to start the
computation of time.  That is what I stated in my para. (a) of the definition. 
That paragraph applies to the process when there is a warrant or a summons
emanating from a judge.  In passing I should note that had the police in these
cases obtained a warrant, there would of necessity have been a charge, and the
clock would have started ticking as of the arrest, or even earlier, if one
adopts my brother McIntyre's view, that is as of the laying of the charge.  

 

                    But
when does the clock start when the police have issued a notice of appearance or
have arrested without a warrant, as they did in these cases?  I put the
following question right now.  Is there any reason why the clock should not
start as of the arrest, that is the time at which it would have started had the
police obtained a warrant (or as of the laying of the information as would have
it McIntyre J.)?  It would be indeed incongruous that, if you are arrested
pursuant to a warrant, you enjoy your s. 11 (b) rights
as of that moment, but not if arrested without a warrant!  

 

                    Arrests
with or without warrants are all governed by Chapter XIV of the Criminal
Code .  I will be referring to the law as it existed in
1982.  There have since been changes to Chapter XIV, but none are of any
relevance to these cases.  That Chapter is entitled ""Compelling Appearance
of Accused Before a Justice and Interim Release"".  The first section, s.
448 , defines an accused as including

 

(a) a person to whom a peace officer has issued an
appearance notice under section 451, and

 

(b) a
person arrested for a criminal offence;

 

I will
not go through the extensive and sometimes intricate scheme governing the
compelling of accused before a justice.  Essentially, our system is as
follows.  When possible, a warrant or a summons is obtained from a justice or a
judge.  To so obtain, the person seeking such a process must swear an
information, that is lay a charge.  Form 7 of the Code,
entitled ""Warrant for arrest"", sets out the form of a warrant in
which it is said:

 

                          This
warrant is issued for the arrest of A.B., of                             (occupation)                 
, hereinafter called the accused.

 

                    Whereas the accused has been charged
that (set out briefly the offence in respect of which the accused is charged);

 

                                                                          . . . 

 

                    This is therefore, to command you,
in Her Majesty's name, forthwith to arrest the said accused and to bring him
before (state court, judge or justice)                                                   
, to be dealt with according to law.

 

                    Dated this       day of           
A.D.       , at              .

Form 6,
setting out how to summon a person, uses essentially the same language:

 

                    Whereas you have this day been
charged before me that (set out briefly the offence in respect of which the
accused is charged);

 

                    This is therefore to command you, in
Her Majesty's name:

 

                    1.  to attend court on        ,
the         day of            A.D.      at             o'clock in the        
noon, at           or before any justice for the said (territorial
division) who is there, and to attend thereafter as required by
the court, in order to be dealt with according to law; and

 

                    2.  to appear on           ,
the           day of      A.D.     , at       o'clock in the       noon,
at         , for the purposes of the Identification of
Criminals Act .  (Ignore, if not filled in.)

 

                    You are warned that failure without
lawful excuse to attend court in accordance with this summons is an offence
under subsection 133(4)  of the  Criminal Code .

 

                    Subsection 133(4)  of the Criminal
Code  states as follows:

 

                    ""(4) Every one who is served
with a summons and who fails, without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies
upon him, to attend court in accordance therewith, is guilty of

 

                    (a) an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years, or

 

                    (b) an offence
punishable on summary conviction.""

 

                    Section 455.6  of the Criminal
Code  states as follows:

 

                    ""455.6  Where an accused
who is required by a summons to appear at a time and place stated therein for
the purposes of the Identification of Criminals Act , does
not appear at that time and place, a justice may issue a warrant for the arrest
of the accused for the offence with which he is charged.""

A Justice
of the Peace in and                             for                 or Judge

 

                    Since
the police do not always have the time to go and obtain a warrant or a summons,
Chapter XIV sets out a scheme under which the process is, but only for a very
short period of time, reversed.  I will not go into the various exceptions to
the general process which in any event have no bearing on what we are
discussing here.  Essentially, the police officer, before going to the judge,
will issue a notice to a citizen to the effect that he is going to go to a
judge and lay a charge that he identifies in his notice, and the citizen is
told by the peace officer in that notice that he will be committing an offense
against the Criminal Code  if he does not
attend court on the date set out in that notice.  If instead of giving a notice
the police officer chooses, in the appropriate case, to arrest without a
warrant, the matter is not different.  He can only arrest without a warrant if
he has, either caught the accused in the act of committing an indictable
offense, or, if he knows he committed the indictable offense, or has reasonable
and probable grounds to believe that he has committed it or is about to commit
an indictable offense or if he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe
there is a warrant for that person's arrest.  

                    When
he proceeds without a warrant, the law requires him to take the accused to the
justice or judge forthwith or at the latest within 24 hours or to release him
in the interim and give him a notice to appear.  Section 455.1 of the Code states
that:

 

                    455.1  Where

 

                    (a) an
appearance notice has been issued to an accused under section 451, or

 

                    (b) an
accused has been released from custody under section 452 or 453,

 

an
information relating to the offence alleged to have been committed by the
accused or relating to an included or other offence alleged to have been
committed by him shall be laid before a justice as soon as practicable
thereafter and in any event before the time stated in the appearance notice,
promise to appear or recognizance issued to or given or entered into by the
accused for his attendance in court. [Emphasis added.]

 

                    Also,
an accused, who has been arrested without a warrant and who has not been
released in the interim and given a notice, like the one referred to above,
will be charged when the officers in compliance with the law bring him before
the justice.  I should note right now that had the police in these cases
complied with the law, we would not be discussing s. 11 (b) as the
accused would have been charged within hours.  It is therefore obvious to me
that as of the moment of arrest a person is charged for the purposes of s. 11 (b) even
though the police have not laid a charge to obtain a warrant.  By arresting
without a warrant, they have, as a matter of law, undertaken to charge him
within hours.  This is why I see no reason in making a distinction between an
arrest with a warrant and one without, nor do the accused perceive any, or
those seeing accused being handcuffed and taken away.  If the law is respected,
the difference of time as regards the charge is one of hours.  On the other
hand, if the law is frustrated, as in these cases, it seems to me, with
respect, preposterous that the unlawful conduct of the police would have the
effect of depriving the citizen of the protection of s. 11 (b).

 

                    I
do not take issue with my brother McIntyre's concern for the courts not
limiting the time for investigating an offense.  With respect I do not think
that this is in any way suggested by my definition of a ""person charged'. 
If the police officers are acting according to our laws, they do not arrest,
with or without a warrant, until the conclusion of a concludent investigation,
if indeed an investigation be necessary.  Arrests, summons, notices, are not
investigatory instruments, but vehicles to court.  If an officer is not going
to  court because he does not have enough to go to court, his arrest is
premature, indeed unlawful.  

 

                    I,
therefore, for these reasons, reiterate my definition set out in Mills.  

 

                    I
find some comfort in the fact that it is in harmony with the position adopted
in Europe.  Indeed, this approach is consistent with the interpretation
developed by the European Court of Human Rights concerning Article 6(1) of
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, 213 U.N.T.S. 222 (1950).  That section reads as
follows:

 

                    (1)
In the determination of  . . .  any criminal charge against
him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time
by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.

 

In the Deweer case,
the European Court stated that, in criminal matters, the reasonable time may
start to run from a date prior to the seisin of the trial court, of the
tribunal competent for the determination of the criminal charge, for example,
the moment when preliminary investigations are opened, the moment of arrest, or
the moment when the person is officially notified that he will be prosecuted
(Eur. Court H. R., judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A No. 35, at p. 22). 
The Court even went further in the Eckle case (Eur. Court
H. R., judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A No. 51, at p. 33):

 

                    In
criminal matters, the ""reasonable time"" referred to in Article 6 {SS}
1 begins to run as soon as a person is ""charged""; this may occur on a
date prior to the case coming before the trial court ..., such as the date of
arrest, the date when the person concerned was officially notified that he
would be prosecuted or the date when preliminary investigations were opened ...
""Charge"" for the purposes of Article 6 {SS} 1, may be defined as
""the official notification given to an individual by the competent
authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence"", a
definition that also corresponds to the test whether ""the situation of the
(suspect) has been substantially affected"" . . . 

 

Finally,
the Court stated in the case of Foti and others (Eur.
Court H. R., judgment of 10 December 1982, Series A No. 56, at p. 18) that:

 

Whilst
""charge"", for the purposes of Article 6 {SS} 1, may in general be
defined as ""the official notification given to an individual by the competent
authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence"", it
may in some instances take the form of other measures which carry the
implication of such an allegation and which likewise substantially affect the
situation of the suspect . . . 

 

                    Coming
back to these cases, it seems that both appellants were released under the
condition that they would not leave the area.  However, neither of them was
formally charged until January 14, 1983, although on the day of the arrest,
Kalanj was told that he was being arrested for theft and Pion was told that he
was being arrested for conspiracy to commit theft.  In the months following the
arrest, both accused suffered financial, familial, social and health problems. 
It is obvious that in such a small community, they were ""the talk of the
town"", and that their conduct was as of the moment they were arrested of
common knowledge to the people of the area.  I note that they tried to expedite
the laying of charges but could not persuade the prosecution to do so.   They
suffered without a doubt a breach of their liberty as well as a restraint of
their security.  Concerning the concept of security of the person, I stated in Mills, supra, at pp.
919-20:

 

                    Additionally,
under s. 11 (b), the security of the person is to be safeguarded as
jealously as the liberty of the individual.  In this context, the concept of
security of the person is not restricted to physical integrity; rather, it
encompasses protection against ""overlong subjection to the vexations and vicissitudes
of a pending criminal accusation"" . . .  These include
stigmatization of the accused, loss of privacy, stress and anxiety resulting
from a multitude of factors, including possible disruption of family, social
life and work, legal costs, uncertainty as to the outcome and sanction.  These
forms of prejudice cannot be disregarded nor minimized when assessing the
reasonableness of delay.

 

                    Applying
the above definitions and comments to these instant cases, I am of the view
that the delay started when the appellants were first arrested and released
under the condition they would not leave the area.  This period is in fact the
only period on which the lower courts diverged as they both stated that all the
other delays were reasonable.  This is also the only time span that my brother
McIntyre considered as may have been violating the s. 11 (b)
right.  With my discussion in Mills in mind, it is obvious
that the eight months elapsed between the arrest and the ""formal
charge"" were in violation of s. 11 (b).  Not
only it cannot be said that the appellants consented to the delay occurring
between the arrest and the moment they were taken to court as both accused
tried to expedite the laying of charges although they could not persuade the
prosecution to do so, but the Crown has not given any reasonable explanation to
justify the said delay before taking the appellants to court.  In fact, the
Crown tells us that the investigation was not over, which, far from being a
justification of what they did, is, in my respectful view, an admission to the
fact that they were not ready to charge and therefore should not have
arrested.  But, as I said, in different terms, the Charter  is
there precisely to protect the citizen from this kind of situation and we would
be remiss if, by a definition, we were to put the victim of such conduct beyond
the shield of the Charter  while protecting those who are in no
need of its protection because the police proceeded lawfully.

 

                    As
this disposes of these cases, I do not need to analyze whether the subsequent
period has been satisfactorily explained or not.  

 

                    With
the greatest of respect, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia erred in law by considering the eight-month period elapsed between the
arrest and the laying of the charges as pre-charge delay.  The said period
should have been computed in determining whether or not the accused have been
tried within reasonable time.  I would consequently allow both appeals and
order a stay of proceedings against Pion and Kalanj.

 

//Wilson J.//

 

                    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

                    WILSON J.
(dissenting) -- I have had the benefit of the reasons of my colleagues,
Justices McIntyre and Lamer, in these appeals and find myself in agreement with
the position of Lamer J. on the main issue as to the time from which the
appellants' right to a trial within a reasonable time starts to run under s.
11 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .


 

                    I
believe that if s. 11 (b) is designed to protect the liberty and security
interests of the accused, and I think it is, then the relevant starting point
for the running of time under the section should not be upon the ex parte laying
of the information before the justice of the peace but rather when the impact
of the criminal process is felt by the accused through the service of process
upon him in the form of a summons or notice of appearance or an arrest with or
without a warrant.  This flexible approach to s. 11 (b) seems
to me most adequately to give effect to the obvious purpose of the provision.

 

                    I
do, however, have a significant point of disagreement with Lamer J. which I
feel obliged to address very briefly.  I do not agree with my colleague that
prejudice to the security interests of the appellants arising purely from the
fact of the imposition of the process upon them, i.e., that they became, in
Lamer J.'s colourful phrase, ""the talk of the town"", should be
considered in assessing the reasonableness of the delay.  As I indicated in Mills v.
The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, and again in R. v.
Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588, it is my view that the prejudice
we are concerned with is that arising from the delay and not from the
imposition of the process.  The latter prejudice arises whether there is delay
or not.  I do, however, think that the appellants were prejudiced by the delay
between the arrest and the laying of the information and that this prejudice
can be attributed to the delay and not simply to the imposition of the
process.  After their highly publicized arrests the appellants were forced to
live under a generalized cloud of suspicion and stigma for over eight months. 
Although an arrest and the subsequent laying of charges would have affected
their broad security interests at any time, the unjustified delay in the
bringing of specific charges, in my view, substantially aggravated that
prejudice beyond what is acceptable or inherent in the criminal process itself.

 

                    I
accordingly concur with Lamer J. in his proposed disposition of the appeals.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
ontario

 

    Constitutional
law -- Charter of Rights  -- Trial within a reasonable time -- Five‑year
period between charge and commencement of third trial ‑‑ Whether
accused's right to be tried within a reasonable time has been infringed --
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , s. 11 (b).

 

    Criminal
law -- Abuse of process -- Crown seeking to try accused for a third time on
same murder charge -- Five‑year period between charge and commencement of
third trial -- Crown objecting to accused's re-election for a trial before a
judge alone -- Crown not consenting to accused's plea to manslaughter --
Whether a third trial in these circumstances constitutes an abuse of process.

 

    Appellant
was charged with first degree murder on August 29, 1982 and convicted of second
degree murder in December 1983.  Thirteen months later, the Court of Appeal set
aside the verdict and ordered a new trial.  The second trial was set to
commence on January 7, 1986.  In December 1985, however, appellant's counsel
was removed from the record and appellant was granted an adjournment to April
21, 1986, as he had been unable to retain new counsel.  The jury failed to
reach a verdict at the second trial and a mistrial was declared.  The new
counsel then informed the appellant that he could no longer represent him in
proceedings held in Ottawa.  Appellant sought to obtain a change of venue to
Toronto but the application was opposed by the Crown and dismissed in August
1986.  In the interim, the third trial had been set for September 22, 1986.  At
that time, appellant was still without counsel and, despite the Crown's
objection, the trial was adjourned to November 10, 1986.  Appellant found and
ultimately retained a third counsel and, in order to accommodate counsel's
schedule, the trial date was postponed to April 21, 1987.  On that date, the
Crown objected to appellant's application to re‑elect to be tried before
a judge alone.  The same issue was before the Court of Appeal and the trial
judge adjourned the matter to await its decision.  At the onset of the third
trial, on October 26, 1987, appellant entered a plea of not guilty on the
charge of murder but guilty on the lesser included offence of manslaughter. 
The plea was not accepted by the Crown because the appellant would not agree to
a joint submission for a sentence of 15 years.  The appellant then brought
an application to stay arguing that (1) holding a third trial in the
circumstances would constitute an abuse of process and (2) his right to be
tried within a reasonable time guaranteed by s. 11 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  had been violated given the time
elapsed since the beginning of the proceedings.  The trial judge held that
appellant's s. 11 (b) right had been infringed and ordered a stay of
proceedings.  The Court of Appeal set aside the order staying the
proceedings and directed a new trial to proceed.

 

    Held
(Sopinka J. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and La Forest and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.:  A trial judge has a
discretion to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would
violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's
sense of fair play and decency and to prevent the abuse of a court's process
through oppressive or vexatious proceedings.  While the doctrine of abuse
of process is not limited to prosecutorial misconduct or improper motive, the
prosecution in this case did not constitute an abuse of process.  The judge's
power to stay proceedings may only be exercised in the clearest of cases. 


 

    The
main purpose of s. 11 (b) of the Charter  is to minimize the
adverse effect on the person charged resulting from the pending disposition of
an unresolved criminal charge.  The focus of the protection is the impairment
or prejudice arising from the delay in processing or disposing of the charges
against an accused and not the impairment or prejudice arising from the fact
that he has been charged.  The cut‑off point after which a delay becomes
unreasonable must be determined by balancing a number of factors including,
among the most important ones, the prejudice suffered by the accused, the
waiver of time periods, the inherent time requirements and the limitations on
institutional resources.  In deciding a s. 11 (b) claim,
the correct approach is to evaluate the reasonableness of the overall lapse of
time.  A piecemeal analysis is generally not appropriate.  As with other Charter 
guarantees, the individual claiming an infringement of his rights must persuade
the court that the circumstances fall within the scope of protection of the specific Charter 
provisions.  Under s. 11(b), the scope of protection is demarcated by the
reasonableness of the total lapse of time.  There is no reason to require as a
rule that the onus shift from the accused to the Crown at the threshold of
""prima facie unreasonability"".

 

    Proceeding
on the basis that s. 11 (b) of the Charter  extends to
appellate proceedings, appellant's right to be tried within a reasonable time
has not been infringed.  The total five‑year period resulted, for the
most part, from the choices made by appellant in the conduct of his defence, as
well as from the delays inherent in a trial, appeal and retrial on a murder
charge.  Appellant unequivocally requested, caused and consented to the delays
between the date initially set for the second trial and the onset of the
third.  During that period, several adjournments were granted to accommodate
appellant's need for legal representation.  While appellant had the right to be
represented by counsel of choice, the delays incurred in so doing could not be
invoked in this case in his s. 11 (b) claim.  The same
was true of the considerable delays resulting from appellant's pre-trial motion
to re-elect for a trial before a judge alone. For the purpose of assessing the
reasonableness under s. 11 (b),  an accused, and the Crown as well, must bear the
consequences of their tactical decisions in the conduct of the trial.  As
regards prejudice, assuming that such prejudice is relevant in a claim made
under s. 11 (b), there was no evidence in the record that appellant
would be prevented from having a fair trial.  Balancing the delays, the
prejudice to the appellant flowing from the passage of time, especially such
passage of time which is not attributable to him, the nature and reasons for
the delays, and the nature of the charge and other circumstances of the case,
it could not be concluded that the overall lapse of time brings the appellant
within the scope of s. 11 (b).

 

    Per Lamer
J.:  Section 11 (b) of the Charter  gives an accused
the right to be tried within a reasonable time.  The fundamental purpose of the
section is to protect the rights set forth in s. 7 .  The concept of
security of the person, in the context of s. 11 (b), is
not restricted to physical integrity but encompasses protection against
overlong subjection to the vexations and vicissitudes of a pending criminal
accusation.  Actual impairment of an accused's security interest need not be
proven to render s. 11 (b) operative.  An objective standard is the only
realistic means through which the security interest of the accused may be
protected under the section.  The impairment of the accused's defence is not a
factor to be considered under s. 11 (b).  The
accused's right to mount a full and fair defence is more properly related to
the right to a fair trial under s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

    To
determine whether an accused's right under s. 11 (b) has
been infringed, the court should adopt a reasonableness test which involves a
balancing of the inherent impairment of the accused's interest as of the moment
he is charged from the very fact of being prosecuted, such impairment becoming
increasingly pronounced with the passage of time, against three other factors
that may justify the delay, or continued impairment of the accused's
interests:  (1) waiver of time periods; (2) time requirements inherent in the
nature of the case, and (3) limitations to institutional resources.  The
facts relevant to the waiver of delays and limitations to institutional
resources, however, must be evaluated during the transitional period, which, in
this case, ended May 14, 1987 (the date the judgment of this Court in Rahey was
handed down), keeping in mind court practices on the part of counsel and of
court officials.  Indeed, it would be inaccurate to give meaning or the
same probative value to behaviour which occurred or court records which were
held prior to that judgment against a standard whose parameters were unknown to
all.  Finally, a finding that the delay involved is prima facie
excessive is not a condition precedent to the inquiry into reasonableness of
the delay.

 

    Here,
appellant's s. 11 (b) right has not been infringed.  Most of the delay is
easily explained by the fact that the appellant did not object to any of the
additional delays and in fact requested many of them.  During the transitional
period, where there is not an indication in the record of an objection by the
accused or defence counsel, that silence should generally be construed as
acquiescence in the delay.  There is therefore waiver as regards those periods
of time extending to May 14, 1987.  The delays requested by the appellant
during the same period, either when represented or not, constituted also a
waiver of time.  The appellant waived them clearly and unequivocally with full
knowledge of his rights and the courts carried out their duty to ensure to
their satisfaction that his waiver of time was clear, unequivocal and
informed.  Concerning the period extending from May 14, 1987 to October 26,
1987, the delays were also justified.

 

    Per Sopinka
J. (dissenting):  In the circumstances of this case, the Crown's actions in
prosecuting the case did not justify a stay of proceedings on the basis of an
abuse of process.

 

    Section
11 (b) of the Charter  extends the
procedural right to be tried within a reasonable time to appellate
proceedings.  The word ""tried"" must be interpreted in light of
the intention of the provision.  The purpose of s. 11 (b) is to
minimize the prejudice to an accused as a result of a criminal charge by
ensuring that proceedings are completed within a reasonable time.  Given that
the prejudice to the accused will persist until all appellate proceedings have
finished, s. 11 (b) would be a shallow and illusory right if it were
interpreted to apply only to the initial trial.

 

    Section
11 (b) is premised in part upon a desire to ensure that an
accused's liberty and security are not unduly violated as a result of a failure
to complete criminal proceedings within a reasonable time.  An accused alleging
a violation of s. 11 (b) must thus persuade the court that prima
facie the delay is unreasonable.  The Crown must then justify
the delay on the basis of any special features or circumstances of the case. 
The Crown can also justify the delay on the basis of conduct of the accused or
his counsel, including waiver of delays.  The Crown cannot, however,
justify long periods of systemic delay even if such delays are beyond the
control of the prosecution.  The accused's right to counsel is part of the
system and the failure or inability on the part of the accused to obtain
counsel cannot justify unreasonable delay unless such failure or inability is
attributable to the accused.  A failure by the Crown to displace the prima
facie case does not necessarily end the matter.  In assessing
the reasonableness of the delay, prejudice to the accused's liberty and
security interest resulting from the delay must be considered.  Prejudice to
the accused's ability to make a full answer and defence may also be relevant.

 

    In
this case, the appellant's right to be tried within a reasonable time has been
infringed.  The delay was prima facie unreasonable and
the Crown has failed to justify or satisfactorily explain substantial segments
of the five‑year period.  In particular, the appellant could not be held
solely responsible for the delays between the second trial in May 1986 and the
third trial in October 1987 and he did not unequivocally waive his right to a
prompt trial.  The Crown's objection to the appellant's application for a
change of venue, in light of appellant's well known difficulties in retaining
counsel, contributed to the delay.  The appellant was also reasonably diligent
in his attempt to find a lawyer but the Crown's insistence on unrealistically
short adjournments made it difficult for him to obtain counsel on such short
notice and hence caused new delays.  Further, the appellant's request to
re‑elect to appear before a judge alone was reasonable given his earlier
experience with jury trials and the Crown's refusal to consent contributed to
the mounting delay.  The appellant also demonstrated his sincerity in wanting
to conclude the proceedings by offering to plead guilty to manslaughter.  The
appellant has demonstrated prejudice to his liberty and security interests and
it is now highly unlikely that a fair trial is possible.  A stay of proceedings
should be ordered.

for a third time on a charge of murder.  The facts are set out in ample detail
by my colleague Justice Sopinka.  While I agree with him and with the courts
below that these facts do not disclose an abuse of process justifying a stay of
proceedings, I cannot share his opinion that s. 11 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  was infringed in the circumstances of
the present case.

 

Abuse of
Process

 

    In
considering the submission based on abuse of process at trial, Smith J.
directed himself as follows:

 

[T]he
residual discretion in a Court to stay proceedings must not only be sparingly
used, it must also be based on the prosecution being oppressive or vexatious, or
follow upon the violation of the principles of fundamental justice and fair
play or, again, there must be some other form of misconduct on the part of the
authorities or some ulterior motive.

 

    He
found that there was no evidence to indicate that the prosecution had been
""anything but fair and competent"".  He then went on to consider the
main element in the appellant's claim, namely, that, in the circumstances, an
abuse of process resulted from the Crown's objection to the appellant's
re-election to be tried by a judge without a jury, and from the Crown's refusal
to accept a plea of guilty of manslaughter in the absence of agreement on a
joint submission for a sentence of fifteen years.  Smith J. did not find the
Crown's position oppressive.  He commented as follows on the insistence that
there be a joint submission on sentencing:

 

    The
Crown ought not to be taken to task for doing that.  The Courts should
encourage pre-trial discussions which have become much more frequent and
numerous in recent years to the obvious benefit of the public.  Such
discussions are on their way to becoming completely institutionalized, at any
rate.  I feel compelled to say, though, that sentencing is for the courts and
joint submissions, as is well understood by both Crown and Defence, are never
binding upon the Court.

 

    The
Court of Appeal took a similar stand on this issue: (1988), 26 O.A.C. 389.  In
a unanimous decision, the Court (Cory J.A., as he then was, and Grange and
McKinlay JJ.A.) rejected the appellant's submission that the Crown's
requirement amounted to an abuse of process (at p. 395):

 

So far
as the Crown was concerned, the aspect of sentence was inextricably bound up
with the acceptance of the plea.  There was no duty or obligation upon the
Crown to accept the plea and the court should not impose such an obligation.

 

    As
well, the Court of Appeal rejected the contention based on the Crown's
objection to the re-election before a judge without a jury, holding properly
that ""[t]he Crown could reasonably and properly determine that the issue
should properly be determined by a jury as the representatives of the
community"" (p. 394).

 

    I am
in agreement with these findings in the courts below and would only add the
following remarks.

 

    A
trial judge has discretion to stay proceedings in order to remedy an abuse of
the court's process.  This Court affirmed the discretion ""where compelling
an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice
which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency and to prevent
the abuse of a court's process through oppressive or vexatious
proceedings"" (R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
128, at pp. 136-37, borrowing from R. v. Young (1984), 40 C.R.
(3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.))  The judge's power may be exercised only in the
""clearest of cases"" (Jewitt, supra, at p.
137).

 

    Under
the doctrine of abuse of process, the unfair or oppressive treatment of an
appellant disentitles the Crown to carry on with the prosecution of the
charge.  The prosecution is set aside, not on the merits (see Jewitt, supra, at p.
148), but because it is tainted to such a degree that to allow it to proceed
would tarnish the integrity of the court.  The doctrine is one of the
safeguards designed to ensure ""that the repression of crime through the
conviction of the guilty is done in a way which reflects our fundamental values
as a society"" (Rothman v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R.
640, at p. 689, per Lamer J.)  It acknowledges that courts must have the
respect and support of the community in order that the administration of criminal
justice may properly fulfil its function.  Consequently, where the affront to
fair play and decency is disproportionate to the societal interest in the
effective prosecution of criminal cases, then the administration of justice is
best served by staying the proceedings.

 

    Stays
for abuse of process are not limited to cases where there is evidence of
prosecutorial misconduct.  In delivering the reasons of the Court in R. v.
Keyowski, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, Wilson J. made it clear that all
relevant factors, including, but not restricted to, bad faith on the part of
the Crown, are to be considered (at p. 659):

 

To
define ""oppressive"" as requiring misconduct or an improper motive
would, in my view, unduly restrict the operation of the doctrine.  In this
case, for example, where there is no suggestion of misconduct, such a
definition would prevent any limit being placed on the number of trials that
could take place.  Prosecutorial misconduct and improper motivation are but two
of many factors to be taken into account when a court is called upon to
consider whether or not in a particular case the Crown's exercise of its
discretion to re-lay the indictment amounts to an abuse of process. 

 

    While
Wilson J. appears to contemplate that a sufficient number of trials may alone
render the prosecution ""oppressive"", she suggests later in her
reasons that the threshold is higher than two inconclusive trials (at p. 660):

 

A third
trial may, indeed, stretch the limits of the community's sense of fair play but
does not of itself exceed them.

 

    In
the present appeal, the evidence supports no suggestion of prosecutorial
misconduct or improper motive.  As well, in light of the comments in Keyowski with
respect to the number of trials, little weight can attach to the fact that the
Crown is attempting to try the appellant a third time.  Does the Crown's stand
with respect to the re-election and the plea tip the scales in favour of
prosecutorial oppression?  Under ss. 429 and 430 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, as they stood at the time
material to this appeal, ""an accused charged with murder anywhere in
Canada except Alberta had no choice but to be tried by a superior court of
criminal jurisdiction consisting of a judge of that court together with a
jury"" (R. v. Turpin (1987), 36 C.C.C.
(3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 293, appeal dismissed, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1296). 
Proceeding on the footing that the applicable provisions of the Code were
valid, the Crown objected to the proposed re-election on the ground that any
such re-election would have been contrary to ss. 429  and 430  of the Criminal
Code .  Such conduct does not in my view take the Crown's
adversarial position too far.  The Crown was entitled to conduct the
prosecution on the basis that the applicable dispositions of the Criminal
Code  were constitutionally valid.

 

    In
addition, s. 534(4)  of the Criminal Code  expressly
recognizes the Crown's option to refuse a plea of guilty to an offence other
than the offence charged:

 

                                   534. . . .

 

    (4) 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, where an accused . . . pleads
not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of any other offence arising out
of the same transaction, whether or not it is an included offence, the Court
may, with the consent of the prosecutor, accept such plea of guilty and,
if such plea is accepted, the court shall find the accused . . . not
guilty of the offence charged and find him guilty of the offence in respect of
which the plea of guilty was accepted and enter those findings in the record of
the court.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
requirement of prosecutorial consent is very strict and a plea of guilty which
is not accepted by the prosecution is a ""nullity"" (R. v.
Pentiluk (1974), 28 C.R.N.S. 324 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 328, reasons
of the Court delivered by Martin J.A.):

 

Where
the accused pleads not guilty to the offence charged but guilty to the included
offence, and the plea of guilty to the included offence is not accepted, the
only plea that has been made is one of not guilty.  The plea of guilty to the
included offence is not in accordance with the provisions of s. 534(6) [s.
534(4)  in R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34] and is a nullity.

 

    To
allow pleas of guilty to lesser offences to be recorded without the consent of
the Crown would be to negate the very premises of the administration of
criminal justice.  There can be no deterrence of crime nor any reinforcement of
fundamental social values if a person charged with committing a particular
offence is convicted and sentenced with respect to another offence of that
person's choice.  That is why the requirement of consent under s. 534(4)  of the Criminal
Code  is so strict.  Nevertheless, that provision furnishes
some tools for tailoring the generally cumbersome system of criminal justice to
the particular needs of individual cases.  It makes room for a rational
exercise by the Crown of its discretionary power, having regard to the
interests of society and of the accused in each particular case.

 

    These
are some of the considerations which explain why the Crown has a discretion to
accept pleas of guilty to lesser offences.  I do not believe that this
discretion shields the Crown from the application of the doctrine of abuse of
process.  There may be some cases in which the Crown is found to exercise this
discretion unreasonably or oppressively.   The Court of Appeal implicitly
contemplated such cases when it wrote that ""[t]he proper exercise of a
Crown discretion cannot amount to an abuse of process"" (p. 394).  In view
of the rationale underlying this discretion, however, one would expect such
cases to be exceptional.  The present appeal is not one of those exceptional
cases. The position of the Crown with respect to the plea has been consistent
throughout the proceedings.  There has been no abrupt change of position or volte-face, nor
did the Crown unfairly renege on expectations it had generated in the
appellant.

 

    For
these reasons, to hold a third trial in the circumstances would not in my view
""violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the
community's sense of fair play and decency"" nor would it constitute an
""abuse of a court's process through oppressive and vexatious
proceedings"".  The present case is not one of the ""clearest of
cases"" to which the Chief Justice referred in Jewitt, supra.

 

Right to
be Tried Within a Reasonable Time

 

    I
now turn to the question whether the appellant's right to be tried within a
reasonable time under s. 11 (b) of the Charter  was infringed.  At
the outset, counsel for the Crown conceded that ""the period of
approximately five years between the Appellant's arrest and the commencement of
his third trial was prima facie excessive and, as
such, it warranted examination by the learned trial judge"".  This
admission assumes that the protection afforded by s. 11 (b)
extends until the final adjudication of the charge.  The Crown made no
submissions to this Court on the question of whether this protection stops
after the person charged has been tried once within a reasonable time.  In R. v.
Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588, there were some comments
suggesting that the application of s. 11 (b) to
further proceedings such as appeals and retrials flows from the purpose of the
guaranteed right.  This is consistent with the views of the Supreme Court of
the United States that the speedy trial guarantee extends to delays
""occasioned by an unduly long appellate process"" (United
States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U.S. 302 (1986), at p. 312).  Lamer J. (the Chief
Justice concurring) stated that the computation ""must continue until the
end of the saga, all of which must be within a reasonable time"" (Rahey, supra, at p.
611).  La Forest J. (McIntyre J. concurring) remarked that the word
""tried"" used in s. 11 (b) ""means
""tried"" in the sense of ""adjudicated"" and thus clearly
encompasses the conduct of a judge in rendering a decision"" (p. 632).  The
parties argued this appeal on a footing consistent with the above views
expressed in Rahey.  Assuming without deciding that these
views support the position adopted by the parties in this appeal, I am disposed
to proceed on this basis.

 

Section
11(b) of the Charter

 

    Section
11 (b) of the Charter  states:

 


 
  
     11. 
  Any person charged with an offence has the right
   
                                  .
  . .
   
  (b)  to
  be tried within a reasonable time;
  
  
     11. 
  Tout inculpé a le droit: 
   
                                .
  . .
   
  b)
  d'être jugé dans un délai raisonnable;
  
 


 

 

    In
the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, the speedy trial
guarantee in the American Bill of Rights ""is designed to minimize the
possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but
nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while
released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and
the presence of unresolved criminal charges"" (United States v.
MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1 (1982), at p. 8, adopted in Loud Hawk, supra, at p.
311).  These words very aptly describe the main purpose for the right to be
tried within a reasonable time under s. 11 (b) of the Charter ,
namely, to minimize the adverse effect on the person charged resulting from the
pending disposition of an unresolved criminal charge.  The focus of the
protection is ""the impairment or prejudice arising from the delay in
processing or disposing of the charges against an accused and not the
impairment or prejudice arising from the fact that he has been charged"" (Rahey, supra, at p.
624, per Wilson J.)   The right recognizes that, with the
passage of time, subjection to a criminal trial gives rise to restrictions on
liberty, inconveniences and pressures detrimental to the mental and physical
health of the individual.

 

    The
protection afforded by s. 11 (b) of the Charter  is not
expressed in absolute terms.  That provision implicitly allows for a reasonable
exposure to the very dangers which are ultimately sought to be minimized.  Some
measure of impairment of the protected interests may validly result from the
prosecution of persons charged.  This in effect accommodates the important
community interest of preventing crime through the conviction of persons guilty
of a criminal offence.  For the Supreme Court of the United States, the right
to a speedy trial ""is necessarily relative.  It is consistent with delays
and depends upon circumstances.  It secures rights to a defendant.  It does not
preclude the rights of public justice"" (Beavers v. Haubert, 198
U.S. 77 (1905), at p. 87).

 

    Accordingly,
the cut-off point after which a delay becomes unreasonable must be determined
by balancing a number of factors.  A balancing approach was favoured by this
Court in Rahey, although not all concurring members
of the Court necessarily agreed on how the balancing was to be effected nor on
what were the specific factors to be considered.  I doubt there can ever be an
exhaustive and unanimous list of factors, but among the most relevant ones
considered by the courts generally, and in particular, by this Court in Rahey, are:
prejudice suffered by the accused, waiver of time periods, inherent time
requirements and limitations on institutional resources.  Certainly the
prejudice suffered by the accused is an important consideration.  While some
degree of impairment may necessarily result from the mere passage of time, in
my view, greater weight in the overall assessment of reasonableness should
attach to impairment resulting from delays not attributable to the person
charged.

 

    Waiver
involves a consideration of whether any delays were requested, caused or
consented to by the person charged.  Such delays as a rule do not weigh
meaningfully in favour of the unreasonableness of the overall time period and
""should normally be excluded from consideration when assessing
reasonableness"" (Rahey, supra, at p.
612, per Lamer J.)  In effect, when delays are caused, requested
or consented to by an accused, it may generally be assumed that the accused
benefits from the resulting protraction of the proceedings, although the
ultimate decision will of course have to be made having regard to all the
circumstances in each particular case.  This is not to say that an accused will
necessarily be at fault for contributing to the protraction of the
proceedings.  An accused has the right to make a full answer and defense and,
to this end, to choose the manner in which to exercise this right in accordance
with the law.  Neither for that matter will blame be imputed to the Crown or
the judicial system when a claim under s. 11 (b)
succeeds.  The Crown is free to use its prosecutorial discretion as it seems
fit, provided that it does not conduct the prosecution in an abusive manner. 
We are not here concerned with fault but with the reasonableness of the overall
delays in bringing an accused to justice.

 

    Also
relevant in the balancing test is a consideration of the ""time
requirements inherent in the nature of the case"" and of any
""limitations to institutional resources"" (Rahey, supra, at p.
608, per Lamer J.)  The first of these factors is concerned with
an estimation of the total time which would be required to process the charge,
given, among others, the complexity and the nature of the case.  In assessing
the reasonableness under s. 11 (b) of the Charter ,
""one must overlook the lapse of time inherent in the case, together with
any resulting inconvenience to the accused"" (Rahey, supra, at p.
634, per La Forest J.)  The second element makes some allowance
for delays which may have been caused by any limitations on the resources of
the judicial system.

 

    In
deciding a claim made under s. 11 (b) of the Charter , the
correct approach is in my view to evaluate the reasonableness of the overall
lapse of time.  A piecemeal analysis is generally not appropriate.  In a case
where each individual period, taken in isolation from the others, may
constitute a reasonable delay, the total period may nevertheless be
unreasonable for the purpose of s. 11 (b).  The
case of Rahey illustrates the point.  While each adjournment initiated
by the judge was for a short period, the accumulation of all nineteen
adjournments over the span of eleven months was held to infringe s. 11 (b). 
However, nothing prevents a court from focussing on specific time periods which
may be significant in the overall assessment, as going to the weight to give to
specific delays, as opposed to their reasonableness.

 

    In
balancing the relevant factors, I cannot subscribe to the two-step onus
requirement suggested by my colleague Sopinka J.  As I understand his views,
once the person charged has satisfied the court that the total time is ""prima facie
unreasonable"", the onus then shifts to the Crown to justify the delay. 
However, as with other Charter  guarantees, the individual claiming
an infringement of his or her rights must persuade the court that the
circumstances fall within the scope of protection of the specific Charter  
provision.   Under s. 11(b) of the Charter , the scope of
protection is demarcated by the reasonableness of the total lapse of time.  It
may be that a de facto shift of the burden of proof occurs
in the minds of individual judges in the overall assessment of reasonableness. 
In this connection, Lamer J. remarked in Mills, supra, at pp.
942-43:

 

    I
hasten to add that a finding that the delay involved is prima
facie excessive is not a
condition precedent to the inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay, i.e.,
to the weighing and balancing of the four criteria elaborated above.  It is
simply an approximate point at which the courts may properly look to the Crown
to justify additional delay.  Such a period, of course, is, I should repeat,
no more than a reference point.  It may well be that a balancing of the
four criteria of reasonableness will lead to a finding of a violation for
lesser periods of delay.  Conversely, greater periods of delay may well be held
to be reasonable depending upon, once again, an assessment and a weighing of
the criteria.  What does happen, and that is a reality that must be
acknowledged, is that there comes a time when the judge turns from the
applicant to the Crown to be told what is exceptional in the case. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    Unlike
Sopinka J., I see no reason of principle or policy to enshrine in a rule such a de facto shift
or ""reference point"", especially at a threshold admittedly as
ambiguous as ""prima facie unreasonability"".  Some elements
relevant to the assessment can best be established by the person charged.  For
instance, if prejudice is an issue, then the person charged is best suited to
establish that element.  As remarked earlier, prejudice resulting from delay
requested, caused or consented to by the person charged may be weighed
differently from prejudice resulting from delay originating elsewhere. 
Accordingly, the courts might expect the person charged to give a prima
facie account of the causes for the delays.  As well, one
would expect the person charged, and not the Crown, to properly inform the
court as to what could have been the shortest possible delays in view of the
available institutional resources and as to what should be the best frame of
reference with which to compare the delays incurred in that person's case. 
Given the importance of the facts in individual cases where an unreasonable
interval of time is alleged, I am of the view that a more flexible or
functional approach is appropriate.

 

    In
light of this general framework, I now propose to consider the facts with a
view to assessing the reasonableness of the overall lapse of time in the
present case.  Since my assessment of the facts as they relate to a breach of
s. 11 (b) of the Charter  differs
substantially from that of my colleague Sopinka J., it is necessary for me to
consider them in some detail.  I hasten to point out that while a consideration
of the facts may be necessary in the course of a determination whether the
right to be tried within a reasonable time was breached, that question is one
of law in the present case.  In this connection, I would adopt the following
remarks of the Court of Appeal (at p. 393):

 

    In the case before us, there are no findings as to
credibility and there are no facts in dispute.  Upon the same facts which were
before the trial judge, we cannot agree with his conclusion of law.

 

 

Assessment
of Reasonableness

 

    By
way of preliminary remark, I find that the Crown's actions show an overall and
sustained concern to proceed as quickly as possible.  In his oral pleading
before this Court, counsel for the appellant himself emphasized the Crown's
insistence on close trial dates.  The Crown never asked for an adjournment nor
brought any interlocutory proceedings.  It repeatedly objected to adjournments
requested by the appellant.  On the other hand, an examination of the
proceedings suggests that the appellant adopted a course of conduct not always
consistent with an assertion of his right to be tried quickly.  On several
occasions in these proceedings the appellant was not represented by counsel
when he appeared on dates set for trial.  This caused a number of adjournments
to be granted, as the courts may have been reluctant to proceed on a charge of
murder while the appellant did not have the benefit of counsel.  The reasons
for these adjournments play an important, albeit not necessarily conclusive,
role in solving the question at hand.

 

    The
first such incident occurred in November 1985.  The appellant's second trial
was set in June 1985 to proceed before Osborne J. on January 7, 1986.  But in
November 1985, Mr. Shore, who was counsel at the first trial and still counsel
of record, brought an application to be removed from the record.  The
application, after being refused once, was allowed on the ground that it had
been made clear to the court by the appellant that he did not wish to be
represented by Mr. Shore anymore.  On the January date scheduled for the second
trial, the appellant explained why he appeared without the benefit of counsel:

 

    Brian
Greenspan is willing to be retained.  It is just a matter of when he can be
available and when the court will be available.  As I said back in December --
actually it was in November.  It was in Assignment Court on November 15th, I
believe it was, and at that time the Crown was aware that I was attempting
to have Mr. Shore taken off the record and Mr. Greenspan put on the record
because at that time he had agreed to take the case.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
appellant preferred to be represented by Mr. Greenspan.  In granting the
appellant's request for an adjournment, Osborne J., who had previously allowed
Mr. Shore's application to be removed from the record, said:

 

    Mr.
Conway appeared at an Assignment Court in June of 1985.  At that time this date
for trial was set.  Some time between June and November 1985 Mr. Conway or his
father decided it would be appropriate Mr. Greenspan be retained.  Mr. Greenspan
has appeared for Mr. Conway before the Court of Appeal.  Further to that, Mr.
Conway's trial counsel, Mr. Shore, asked to be removed from the record.  I
exceeded [sic] to that request upon receiving
confirmation that Mr. Conway did not wish to be represented by Mr. Shore.  As I
indicated at that time, there is a difference between permitting a solicitor to
be removed from the record and forcing an accused to be represented by counsel
not of his choosing.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Consequently,
it was the appellant's late-in-the-day choice of counsel which caused the
removal of Mr. Shore from the record one month prior to the second trial and
which brought about the adjournment to April 21, 1986.

 

    There
is a second period of time, from May 1986 to November 1986, during which the
appellant was not successful in retaining a particular counsel.  After the
second trial, on May 1, Mr. Greenspan indicated to the appellant that he could
not represent him anymore in proceedings held in Ottawa.  As an appearance was
scheduled in Assignment Court at the end of the month to set the date of the
third trial, there was an immediate need for counsel. Nevertheless, the
appellant took the position that efforts should be made to move the proceedings
to Toronto, where Mr. Greenspan perhaps could be retained, before
finding and retaining counsel able to represent him in Ottawa.  This explains
why Mr. Greenspan was instructed to bring an application for a change of
venue.  If the application was successful, he could be retained by the
appellant.  Otherwise, the appellant would then look for and retain
another counsel.  The trial judge found as a fact that the decision to make the
application was taken ""[i]n the three-week interval that intervened
between May 26 and June 16, 1986"".  The application was heard and
dismissed on August 8, and, as a result, the appellant was still not
represented at the end of the summer.  In the June appearance in Assignment
Court, where the date of September 22, 1986 was set for the trial, Mr. Shore, who
spoke for (but did not represent) the appellant, explained:

 

    If
the trial is going to take place in Ottawa, the counsel will no doubt be
different than if the trial is going to take place in Toronto or in Kingston or
in Sudbury.  So, let's find out where the trial is going to take place. 
Mr. Greenspan is prepared to bring the application [for change of venue] in
July.  Once the locale is decided the appropriate counsel can be chosen by
Mr. Conway.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    In
the context of an application for a stay under s. 11 (b) of the Charter , this
""wait-and-see"" position adopted by the appellant is anything but an
assertion of his right to be tried quickly.  It is more akin to the assertion
of an unyielding desire to be represented by a particular counsel.  At this
juncture, I wish to add that the delays incurred by the appellant in securing
legal aid might have been significant in the overall assessment had the record
disclosed that such financial assistance had been initially sought prior to the
scheduled appearance in Assignment Court on May 26.  Difficulties in obtaining
legal aid did not prevent the appellant from instructing Mr. Greenspan to file
a motion for change of venue.

 

    While
an accused, in his dealings with the judicial process, benefits from the right
to counsel under s. 10 (b) of the Charter , this Court
remarked in  R. v. Ross, [1989] 1 S.C.R.
3, that the right to retain counsel has to be exercised with reasonable
diligence in light of the circumstances.  Delivering the reasons of the majority
of the Court, with all members of the Court concurring on this particular
point, Lamer J. wrote (at p. 11):  ""[A]ccused or detained persons have a
right to choose their counsel and it is only if the lawyer chosen cannot be
available within a reasonable time that the detainee or the accused should be
expected to exercise the right to counsel by calling another lawyer.""

 

    The
issue under s. 11 (b) in the present instance is not whether the appellant
had the right to be represented by a counsel of his choice:  he had that right
(Ross, supra).  Rather, the issue is whether,
having incurred considerable delays in so doing, the appellant can successfully
invoke such delays in his claim that his right to be tried within a reasonable
time has been infringed.  In my view, he cannot.  The adjournment of nearly
four months granted on January 7, 1986, was brought about by the appellant's
decision to change counsel one month prior to a trial date set some seven
months earlier.  It must have been patently obvious to everyone concerned at
the time that this change in position would jeopardize holding the trial as
scheduled.  Indeed, when the appellant appeared unrepresented on January 7,
Osborne J. felt he had no choice but to grant the adjournment requested by the
appellant since, in his view, to proceed on a charge of murder with an
unrepresented accused might result in invalidating the proceedings.  With
respect to the events of May 1986, after the second trial, as an appearance in
Assignment Court was scheduled at the end of the month, there was a short-term
need for counsel.  The appellant chose to hold-out and attempt to move the
proceedings to another city in order to accommodate his desire to be
represented by Mr. Greenspan, before even considering alternative choices for
counsel available in the Ottawa region.  Yet, there was a serious possibility
that the application for a change of venue would not be granted.  There was
also a virtual certainty that the application would not be decided for a number
of months.

 

    The
course of conduct adopted by the appellant is all the more fraught with
consequence by reason of warnings given to him when he appeared unrepresented
at dates set for his trial.  For instance, at the conclusion of the January
1986 appearance, Osborne J. explained to the appellant the urgency of his need
for legal representation:

 

                            HIS
LORDSHIP: . . . 

 

    Mr. Conway, would you stand up for a minute.  Let
there be no misunderstanding about this.  You have a problem.  The problem
focuses on your present circumstances which leave you unrepresented.  I want to
do what is reasonable, and I emphasize the word ""reasonable"" and give
you time to secure counsel.  You have until April 21st, 1986.  I find it
hard to believe that you will not be able to acquire competent counsel from
Ottawa or from outside Ottawa by that time.  You are on bail for
circumstances which I know nothing about.  You have complete flexibility in
obtaining counsel.  To put it as bluntly as I can, if you do not obtain
counsel by April 21st, that is your problem.  Subject to the views of the then
presiding trial judge the trial will proceed at that time.  We cannot let
the matter drag on any further.  It is as simple as that.  I ask you one
question.  Do you understand what I have said?

 

                            THE
ACCUSED:  Yes.

 

    HIS
LORDSHIP:  Further to that, I would start now with or without the assistance of
your family and I would suggest you first determine whether Mr. Greenspan is
available as of April 21st. If he is not, immediately commence looking for
some other counsel.  Whether Mr. Shore will see fit to help you with those
endeavors is entirely up to him.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    This
warning was reiterated by Watt J. at the conclusion of the September 1986
appearance, where once again the appellant had appeared unrepresented on a
trial date set in the previous month of June:

 

    HIS LORDSHIP:  Well, Mr. Conway, this particular
matter has dragged on long enough.  You are going to have to do one of two
things, either get a lawyer or go it alone.  I think Mr. Morin's suggestion
that if anyone were to walk into his office, he would want some time to prepare
the case is one that is obviously reasonable.  I don't really think that his
suggestion of the length of time is unreasonable.  But I am telling you right
now, whether any of what my brother judges have said before has sunk in or not,
that when I fix a date for this trial it is going ahead and it is going ahead
whether or nor you have a lawyer.  Whether or not you get a lawyer is entirely
due to your own efforts.  If you are not prepared to expend those efforts to
get [a] lawyer to assist him as you can in the preparation of the case, you had
better be content to go your third trial by yourself [sic].  Do
you understand that?  [Emphasis added.]

 

    THE
ACCUSED:  Yes.

 

    After
January 7, 1986, and most assuredly since September 22, 1986, the appellant was
well aware of the possible consequences of his failure to secure counsel.  It
had been made clear to him that an uncompromising insistence on retaining
specific counsel could result in his having to undergo a trial with the
assistance of no counsel at all.

 

    On
September 22, 1986, being the date set for the third trial, as the appellant
was still unrepresented, Watt J. granted the adjournment requested by the
appellant and rescheduled the trial to commence on November 10.  Further
adjournments were requested by the appellant later in the fall of 1986, on
October 2, and again on November 4.  The appellant had found counsel, Mr.
Bayne, who expressed his availability to represent him, but could not take his
case before the following spring.  Speaking for (but not representing) the
appellant, in making the November 4 application for a remand of the trial date,
Mr. Bayne explained that he was starting a murder trial in January and could
not be ready before April.  He added that in the circumstances of the case it
would not be unreasonable to adjourn until April:

 

    I
point out that between the first and the second trials there is in excess of
two years and even after the Court of Appeal ordered the new trial in 1985 this
trial did not take place before fifteen months after and so in terms of
chronology this request would not be an unreasonable delay between the second
and third trial and frankly an accused person needs, simply in ordinary
circumstances, there is a need of time to catch his breath between trials. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    The
expression of a need to catch one's breath during six months is hardly an
assertion of the right to be tried quickly.  This is all the more true in light
of the fact that, to paraphrase Mr. Bayne, the appellant had already benefitted
from six months to ""catch his breath"".  As well, the statement that
this six-month delay ""in terms of chronology"" would not be an
unreasonable delay between the second and third trial"" suggests an
acquiescence in the reasonableness of all delays incurred thus far.  As noted
in the Court of Appeal (at p. 392):

 

    Significantly Mr. Bayne, when he made this request
for an adjournment, stated that it would not result in an unreasonable delay in
the proceedings and that the respondent needed a breathing spell between the
second and third trial.

 

    It
is to be noted that this comment appears to contradict the allegation that the
respondent was actively seeking to have a speedy trial of the charge.

 

    In
dealing with the request for an adjournment made by Mr. Bayne on November 4,
1986, the Crown and the court could not have been more accommodating to the
accused.  While objecting to the request for an adjournment, the Crown agreed
not to proceed until the end of a trial also scheduled to begin on November
17.  The adjournment was refused and the trial date of November 10 was left
""to stand"".  On December 4, the parties appeared before Watt J. for a
direction as to the commencement date.  The trial co-ordinator had informed the
solicitors of record that the date of April 21, 1987 had been set for the third
trial.  It appears that this date had been set at the request of the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario, himself petitioned to do so by Mr.
Greenspan.  In the December 4 appearance, the Crown objected to this postponement
of the trial date, while Mr. Bayne once again took the position that
""[t]he earliest reasonable commencement date would be April"" for the
third trial.  In confirming the date of April 21, 1987 for the third trial,
Watt J. said:

 

 

    There
can be little doubt that this case has taken an inordinate amount of time to
come to trial.  The harsh reality is, however, that in the event that an
earlier trial date is fixed than that suggested, the accused will go
unrepresented upon a third trial for second degree murder.  The likelihood of
appellate reversal and the consequent trauma of yet another, a fourth trial, is
of no little significance.

 

    I
cannot adhere to the view that the Crown can be said to have caused these
delays, nor can I attribute them to so-called systemic delays.  The
postponement of the trial date from September 22, 1986 to April 21, 1987 in
effect served to accommodate the schedule of the first counsel found by the
appellant since May 1, 1986 and to allow the appellant to prepare fully his
defense for the third trial.  In this connection, the record before this Court
contains affidavits signed by seven criminal lawyers from the Ottawa region. 
Six of them were approached by Mr. Bayne between October 1, 1986 and October
31, 1986 who inquired whether they would be available to represent the
appellant at his November 10, 1986 trial date.  All six answered that they
could not, due to the preparation time required for such a case and to prior
professional commitments.  One of the six also attested having been approached
by the appellant on August 8, 1986, with respect to the trial then scheduled
for September 22.  The seventh lawyer was approached by the appellant himself
""in mid-September of 1986"" and was asked if he was available to
represent the appellant ""on a second degree murder trial to begin within
the next six to eight weeks"".  He turned the appellant down for the same
reasons given by the others.  Some of these lawyers were approached three weeks
or less before the date set for trial.  These affidavits show that the
appellant began looking for an alternative choice of counsel only after the
application for a change of venue was dismissed, in mid-August of 1986, some
four months after being initially committed to Assignment Court to set a date
for his third trial.  The affidavits also establish that a more serious attempt
to retain counsel was made in the month of October, although then any
possibility of success was even slimmer given the time required to prepare the
case.  This evidence only shows that the appellant waited until the last moment
to seek legal representation and temporarily found himself trapped in a vicious
circle.  The net result was that the third trial was ultimately postponed until
April 21, 1987 to accommodate the appellant's need for legal representation.

 

    At
the onset of the third trial to be held before Callon J., on April 21, 1987,
the appellant informed the court that he would eventually be bringing a motion
to stay based on abuse of process.  He then told the court that the issue of
abuse of process was pending before this Court in the Keyowski case. 
Mr. Bayne further informed the court he would be making an application
re-electing to be tried before a judge sitting without a jury.  He informed
Callon J. that the issue whether a person accused of murder had a
constitutional right to be tried without a jury was to be heard in mid-May by
the Ontario Court of Appeal in the case of Turpin.  Mr.
Bayne added that he acted as counsel in that case.  There was discussion
between Mr. Bayne, the Crown counsel and the court to the effect that the Court
of Appeal might very well reserve judgment for a few months on an issue of this
importance.  Ultimately, Callon J. adjourned the matter ""as a necessity""
to Assignment Court on June 1, 1987, in an attempt to benefit from the views of
the higher courts on the two issues before him.  He said:

 

    Putting
it positively, it is appropriate to indicate that the trial has been adjourned
as a necessity, and certainly with some reluctance on my part, because of a
very important legal issue to be determined by the superior courts, namely, the
Ontario Appeal Court and the Supreme Court of Canada and if this court were to
proceed on issues that were at variance with those decisions, then the accused
would be exposed to a fourth trial . . . .

 

    On
June 1 the date for the commencement of the third trial was set for October 26,
1987, at which time the appellant offered a plea of guilty to the lesser
offence of manslaughter.  This plea was refused by the Crown who insisted on
proceeding with a trial on the charge of murder.  Mr. Bayne then brought the
motion to stay which gave rise to the present proceedings. 

 

    At
his appearance on April 21, 1987, being the previous date set for the third
trial, it was actually foreseen by Mr. Bayne that bringing a pre-trial motion
which would steer the proceedings into the midst of a heated Charter debate
on the right not to be tried by a jury was likely to postpone the trial for a
very considerable time.  As a matter of fact, there was an appeal to this Court
from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Turpin in
which judgment was released only recently.  The purpose of the pre-trial motion
was to avoid any risk of a second hung jury.  That may be a legitimate
purpose.  But, in retrospect, does the possibility of a second hung jury
outweigh two additional years of subjection to a pending trial?  That is the
course upon which the appellant chose to embark.  It is hardly consistent with
his claim today that such delays were unreasonable.  For the purposes of the
assessment of reasonableness under s. 11 (b) of the Charter , an
accused, and for that matter, the Crown as well, must bear the consequences of
their tactical decisions in the conduct of the trial.

 

    In Rahey, Lamer
J. stated (at p. 612):

 

If an
accused requests, causes or consents to a delay, it should normally be excluded
from consideration when assessing reasonableness, but such waiver must be
clear, unequivocal and informed.

 

    Although
technically the decisions and conduct of the appellant may amount to something
less than waiver, in my view, he in fact unequivocally requested, caused and
consented to the delays between the date initially set for the second trial and
the onset of the third.  In considering the issue of ""waiver"" in the
context of s. 11 (b), it must be remembered that it is not the right itself
which is being waived but merely the inclusion of specific periods in the
overall assessment of reasonableness.  Crucial to the exclusion of a time
period is ""the accused's awareness of the consequences"" (Clarkson v.
The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, at p. 394) of his decisions
causing delays to be incurred.  Any waiver is ""dependent upon it being
clear and unequivocal that the person is waiving the procedural safeguard""
(pp. 394-95).  I have no doubt that in the present case the words of Osborne J.
and Watt J. made the appellant sufficiently aware of the limit to which the
judicial process could stretch in order to accommodate his choice of counsel. 
The appellant understood the risks of having to undergo a trial by himself, yet
on January 7, September 22 and November 10, 1986, he appeared unrepresented as
a result of the less than diligent exercise of his right to counsel.  This
course of conduct is in my view tantamount to a waiver of the time periods
discussed above in the assessment of the reasonableness of the overall delay. 
At minimum, these intervals of time should not be used by the appellant to
support his claim that the charges laid against him have been standing for an
unreasonable period of time.  They were brought about by the accused through an
exercise of his right to counsel severely lacking in diligence and in full
awareness of the possible risks associated with lack of legal representation. 
These considerations go to the weight to be attributed to the periods from
January 7 to April 21, 1986 as well as the period between the end of second
trial (May 1, 1986) and the scheduled commencement of the third (October 26,
1987) in the assessment of the reasonableness of the overall delay.

 

    Much
of the delay that remains is in my view attributable to the time requirements
and the risks involved in the disposition of a charge of murder.  Early on in
these proceedings, there was a period of almost sixteen months between the
charge and the conviction and sentence resulting from the first trial.  The
preliminary hearing commenced in January 1983, roughly five months after the
laying of the charge.  In the appellant's words, the two court days originally
scheduled for the hearing ""were not sufficient"".  The hearing was
consequently adjourned and concluded the following May.  The record does not
disclose whether this circumstance results from the unavailability of court
rooms, the unavailability of key witnesses or some other reason.  While in
their appearance before this Court neither the Crown nor the appellant
accounted for this delay, it is relevant to the weight of this four-month
period that the judge presiding at the preliminary hearing is not empowered to
adjourn for more than eight clear days unless it is the case that ""the
accused, whether or not he is in custody, and the prosecutor consent to the
proposed adjournment"" (s. 465(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code ).  At the conclusion of the hearing, the appellant was
committed to trial.  He then brought an application to quash the committal. 
During the period from June 21 to December 2, 1983, at which time the
application was denied, the appellant requested and obtained adjournments of
his trial in order to allow the application to proceed.  I would not take this
period into account in assessing the overall reasonableness.  The trial
commenced on December 6, 1983 and a verdict of guilty of second degree murder
was soon thereafter returned by the jury, that is, on December 15, 1983.

 

    The
appeal that followed occupied the next thirteen months.  This appeal was
successful and a new trial was ordered.  While this additional delay is not
incurred in all cases, it is not unusual for a person convicted of murder to
avail himself of the right to appeal conferred by the Criminal
Code .  The right to appeal against a conviction is one of
the safeguards in the criminal justice system designed to ensure that persons
are not found guilty of an offence unless the case of the prosecution is
established beyond a reasonable doubt in full accordance with the law.  The
efficacy of this safeguard is maximized when the Court of Appeal exercises its
discretion to direct that a verdict of acquittal be entered in the record.  In
such a case, it is certain that no subsequent proceedings can be taken upon the
same charge.  But on appeal there is also the possibility of a new trial.  This
possibility is a concession to the societal interest in prosecuting persons
charged with an offence.  The option of granting a complete immunization
because of a legal error at trial may discourage courts from exercising their
power of review.  In this sense, the possibility of holding a new trial
""enhances the probability that appellate courts will be vigilant to strike
down previous convictions that are tainted with reversible error"" (United
States v. Tateo, 377 U.S. 463 (1964), at p. 466).  These are but some
of the considerations which come into play when weighing the delay incurred in
appellate review, assuming as I have for the purpose of this opinion that s.
11 (b) of the Charter  may apply although
the person charged was initially tried within a reasonable time.

 

    The
Court of Appeal recorded the appellant's acquiescence in the reasonableness of
the delays involved in the disposition of his appeal (at p. 391):

 

    It
should be noted that the respondent conceded that the appeal proceeded
expeditiously and that there was no undue delay occasioned by either party in
those appeal proceedings.

 

    Likewise,
no serious objection could be taken to the interval of less than one month
occupied by the second trial.

 

    It
is finally necessary to consider the prejudice suffered by the appellant.  The
appellant was imprisoned some thirteen months while the appeal was pending and
he was granted interim judicial release subject to bail conditions before and
after the successful appeal.

 

    I
consider it necessary to make two brief remarks in connection with the
assessment of prejudice in the present case.  First, the trial judge emphasized
the deterioration of the situation of the appellant's family.  He noted that
the family has ""expended in excess of $130 000 in legal fees"" and
that the ""family home has had to be sold"".   As well, he described in
detail the detrimental effect that the events since August 1982 have had on the
psychological and physical health of all members of the family.  Smith J. also
considered the effect the events had on the victim's family and concluded as
follows:

 

The
accused and his family are devastated as any close-knit family would be.  I do
not, in saying this, make light of the devastation visited upon the family of
the victim, Mr. Warren Leach, as a result of his untimely demise in this
fashion . . . .

 

    In
this connection, appellant made a number of submissions and adduced evidence
""as to the impact of the proceedings on individual members of the
Appellant's family"".

 

    While
the problems experienced by the appellant's family may have affected him to
some extent, the plight of the Conway family per se is of
no help in determining the matter at hand.  Nor for that matter is the
situation of the victim's family.  Understandably, these tragic events have
caused much grief and sorrow to be felt by a number of friends, family
relations and other persons.  However, it would most certainly strain the
integrity of the judicial process if, as part of a determination under s. 11 (b) of the Charter , courts
were to engage in a balancing of the financial and emotional loss incurred by
the respective families of the person charged and the victim.  The right to a
trial within a reasonable time seeks to prevent the overlong subjection of the
person charged to the pressures inherent to a pending criminal accusation.  The
prejudice suffered by that person alone is relevant to the inquiry.

 

    Second,
assuming for the present purposes only that such prejudice is relevant in a
claim made under s. 11 (b) of the Charter , there is in my
view no evidence suggesting that it is no longer possible for the appellant to
benefit from a fair trial before his peers.  The unanimous Court of Appeal
wrote (at p. 394):  ""There is not, in our opinion, any special prejudice
to the accused (in the sense of preventing a fair trial)"".  There is no
evidence that a witness for the defense is no longer available or can no longer
testify, nor can there be any suggestion that no impartial jury can be found,
should that be the route chosen for the third trial.  Though by reason of the
time elapsed the witnesses' recollection may be weaker, I see no reason to
presume, as my colleague Sopinka J., that ""the witnesses will have little
independent recollection of the events"" (p. 000).  The presence of
transcripts from the first two trials would in my view contribute to ensuring
the fairness of the trial in that all the evidence which is helpful to the
defense has been preserved.

 

    On
the whole I do not find it possible on the facts before us to hold that the
delays incurred in the course of the proceedings against the appellant are
unreasonable within the meaning of s. 11 (b) of the Charter .  I am
satisfied that the total five-year period is sufficiently explained by the
delays inherent in a trial on a charge of murder, appeal and retrial of that
charge, as well as by delays which were brought about by the appellant in his
time-consuming attempts at securing particular counsel as outlined above. 
Balancing the delays which occurred in the present case, the prejudice to the appellant
flowing from the passage of time, especially such passage of time which is not
attributable to him, the nature and reasons for the delays, and the nature of
the charge and other circumstances of the case, I cannot conclude that the
overall lapse of time brings the appellant within the scope of s. 11 (b).

 

    Commenting
on the appellant's course of conduct in the exercise of his right to counsel,
the Court of Appeal said (at pp. 392-93):

 

It seems
to be clear that the respondent did not, at any time between the 1st of May,
1986 and the 21st of April, 1987, assert a desire to have his trial brought on
in a prompt and speedy manner. It is perfectly reasonable and understandable
that he should be anxious to retain able and experienced counsel.  However, it
is scarcely reasonable to hold the system at fault for the delays occasioned by
the respondent's efforts to retain counsel and to provide such counsel with the
time required to prepare for and fit the trial into his or her schedule.  Those
delays should not be attributable to the Crown or be deemed to be
""systemic"" delays.  Particularly this is so as the respondent was at
all relevant times represented by counsel who did not at any time object to the
various adjournments and in fact actively sought them.

 

    It
would be, in my view, ironic indeed that the prosecution should be reproached
for its sustained insistence in bringing an accused to trial ""within a
reasonable time"", while an accused who chooses to trade delays for a
tactical advantage should, for that reason, succeed in invoking his s. 11 (b) Charter  right. 
At the end of the day in this particular case, a greater priority was attached
by the appellant to the retaining of specific counsel and to re-electing to be
tried without a jury than to a speedier adjudication.  Such conduct stops the
11(b) clock from ticking in favour of the person charged.

 

    To
conclude otherwise would open the door not only to abuses but to unfortunate
results as well, such as the possibility of systematic refusals by trial judges
to grant adjournments, thereby possibly resulting in the denial of legitimate
requests by an accused.  Such inflexible policies could not be in the best
interest of the administration of justice, just as such results could not be
within the intent and purpose of the right of an accused to be tried within a
reasonable time.

 

Disposition
of the Appeal

 

    In
agreement with a unanimous Court of Appeal, I would accordingly dismiss the
appeal.  This however does not end the matter since the appellant submits that,
should his appeal be unsuccessful, this Court should enter a verdict of
manslaughter and remand the matter for sentencing.  Assuming without deciding
that this Court has the discretion to make such an order, I would nevertheless
deny it.  To grant this alternative relief would amount to allowing the
appellant to circumvent the requirement of prosecutorial consent prescribed by
s. 534(4) of the Code.  As the Crown has not changed its
position with respect to the plea of guilty of manslaughter, it would still be
considered a nullity and could not be entered in the record if the appellant
offered it at trial.

 

//Lamer J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    LAMER J. --
The facts of this case are fully set out in the reasons of my colleague,
Justice Sopinka, and I will not repeat them here.

 

    This
appeal raises the same issue as that in Mills v. The Queen, [1986]
1 S.C.R. 863, and R. v. Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
588, that is, whether or not the accused's rights under s. 11 (b) have
been violated.

 

    In
my reasons for judgment in Mills, I gave my views as to what is the
nature of the right protected by that section as well as to what should be the
proper test to be followed when the court of competent jurisdiction is faced
with an alleged violation of the right to a trial within a reasonable delay.

 

    Section
11 (b) enunciates an individual right to be tried within a
reasonable time for all persons charged with an offence.  I wish to emphasize once
again that this right is, in its nature, an individual right and has no
collective rights dimension albeit society surely has an interest in the prompt
and effective prosecution of criminal cases.  The section is concerned with
ensuring respect for the interests of the individual and the societal interest
finds no expression in s. 11 (b) though,
evidently, incidental satisfaction (see  R. v. Turpin, [1989]
1 S.C.R. 1296, at p. 1311, judgment delivered on May 4, 1989).  In my view, the
fundamental purpose of s. 11 (b) is to secure,
within a specific framework, the more extensive right to liberty and security
of the person of which no one may be deprived except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice.  The purpose of s. 11 (b) can,
in other words, be ascertained by reference to s. 7  of the Charter . 
Section 11 (b) is designed to protect, in a specific manner and
setting, the rights set forth in s. 7 , though, of course, the scope of s. 7 
extends beyond those manifestations of the rights to liberty and security of
the person which are found in s. 11 .  Hence, the focus for the analysis and
proper understanding of s. 11 (b) must be the
individual, his or her interests and the limitation or infringement of those
interests.

 

    Historically,
the concept of trial within a reasonable time has been closely associated with
the remedy of habeas corpus and bail and has
thus focused on the liberty interest of the accused, specifically on preventing
unduly lengthy detention prior to trial.  However, under s. 11 (b), the
security of the person is to be safeguarded as jealously as the liberty of the
individual.  In this context, the concept of security of the person is not
restricted to physical integrity but rather encompasses protection against
overlong subjection to the vexations and vicissitudes of a pending criminal
prosecution, including stigmatization of the accused, loss of privacy, stress
and anxiety resulting from a multitude of factors.  Although, to some extent,
these negative consequences are unavoidable, one of the purposes of s. 11 (b) is to
limit the impact of such forms of prejudice to the accused by circumscribing
the time period within which they may occur.

 

    It
can be inferred from that premise that the role of the courts will be to
consider whether the delay is reasonable or not.  Unfortunately, reasonableness
is an elusive concept which cannot be juridically defined with precision and
certainty.  Yet, there is an advantage to be found when dealing with time as
reasonableness can be determined with the help of the precision surrounding the
happening of certain events, such as arraignment, the preliminary inquiry, the
trial and the time elapsed between.

 

    In Mills and Rahey, I
sketched out what I think should be the test for determining whether the delay
was reasonable or not.  If it is obvious that the liberty of the accused is
limited from the day he is charged, as regards the security of the person, we
are dealing largely with the impairment of mental well-being, a matter which
can only be established with considerable difficulty at considerable cost.  The
proper approach, in my view, is to recognize that prejudice underlies the
right.  Since the actual impairment need not be proven by the accused to render
the section operative, an objective standard is the only realistic means
through which the security interest of the accused may be protected under the
section.  In that respect, whether the accused's ability to mount a full and
fair defence is or is not impaired is not relevant to a determination of
whether there has elapsed an unreasonable period of time, as that goes to the
fairness of the trial and is more properly related to the right to a fair trial
than to the right to be tried within a reasonable time.  Indeed, too speedy a
trial might sometimes violate an accused's right to a fair trial, such as when
little or no time to prepare is given.  In my view, our test of reasonableness
involves a balancing of the inherent impairment of the accused's interest as of
the moment he is charged from the very fact of being prosecuted, such
impairment becoming increasingly pronounced with the passage of time, against
three other factors that may justify the delay, or continued impairment of the
accused's interests: (1) waiver of time periods; (2) time requirements inherent
in the nature of the case, and (3) limitations to institutional resources. 
Consequently, we are not concerned with the conduct of the parties; if there is
an explanation for this delay then there should not be a violation of s. 11 (b) giving
rise to the minimal appropriate remedy, a stay of proceedings.

 

    In Mills, I also
elaborated on a secondary but still fundamental issue arising out of a
potential violation of s. 11 (b), whether or not
the time which has elapsed prior to the coming into force of the Charter  may
properly be taken into consideration in assessing the reasonableness of delay,
and if so, whether such delay should receive the same weight as delay
subsequent to the coming into force of the Charter .  As
that case was the first one to have presented this Court with the opportunity
of establishing appropriate guidelines for the application of s. 11 (b), the
full scope of the section and the nature of the obligation it has imposed upon
the government and the courts had remained uncertain for the period prior to
the rendering of that judgment.

 

    I
was of the view that, given this uncertainty and the terminative nature of the
remedy for a violation of the section, namely a stay of proceedings, a
transitional approach is appropriate, and indeed necessary, to enable the
courts and the governments to properly discharge their burden under s. 11 (b).

 

    However,
this is not to say that different criteria ought to apply during the
transitional period, that is, the period prior to the rendering of that
judgment, but rather that the behaviour of the accused and the authorities must
be evaluated in its proper context.  In other words, it would be inaccurate to
give meaning or the same probative value to behaviour which occurred or court
records which were held prior to that judgment against a standard the
parameters of which were unknown to all.  Consequently, facts relevant to two
of the criteria of reasonableness which have been elaborated in that judgment,
waiver of delay and limitations to institutional resources, must be evaluated
during the transitional period keeping in mind court practices on the part of
counsel and of court officials.  Indeed, as regards waiver, while I said (at p.
929):

 

    Waiver
cannot, therefore, be inferred from silence, whether the accused be represented
or not, except in cases where delay is caused by an accused.  It must be
express and informed.

 

I also
added that:

 

    It
should also be noted that the issue of waiver, or consent to delay, will
necessitate modifications to current court practices.  Provisions will have to
be made for properly recording the reasons for adjournments, waiver, or consent
to delay by the accused, noting the period of delay to which consent is given
and ensuring that such consent is informed.

 

I also
went on to say that silence by the accused or defence counsel in the face of
requests for delay by the Crown, does not necessarily, during the transitional
period, carry the same consequences as after this period.  Where there is not
an indication in the record of an objection by the accused or defence counsel,
that silence should generally be construed as acquiescence in the delay.  To do
otherwise would be to retrospectively attach meaning to behaviour and court
records, when those were not intended at the time.  This is not to say that the
law pertaining to the question of waiver was uncertain prior to that case. 
Nevertheless, statements in our courts, at the time of remands or
postponements, were not made and records thereof were not kept with s. 24 
applications based on s. 11 (b) alleged violations in mind.  For similar reasons,
while delay which is due to limited institutional resources is still a factor
to be considered and weighed, it will be open to the courts, during the transitional
period, to excuse any passage of time as long as it is the result of actual
institutional limitations.  I finally added that under no circumstances are
such transitional measures to apply to persons who are charged subsequently to
the rendering of that judgment.

 

    However,
the majority did not rule on the issue relating to the waiver of delay in
circumstances such as those of this case  until this Court's judgment in Rahey. 
Applying the above principles to this case, I am of the view that the transitional
period cannot be said to have ended before May 14, 1987, that is when Rahey was
handed down. From the day he was charged until May 14, 1987, the delays cannot
be given the same consequences as after this period, from May 14 to October 26,
1987.

 

    Before
turning to the instant case, I only want to say once again that there is no
magic moment beyond which a violation will be deemed to have occurred and that
this Court should refrain from legislating one.  In reality, however, when
judges assess the situation in individual cases, they will be measuring the
delays against some norm each judge considers to be prima facie the
tolerable limit for the ordinary, average case.  I hasten to add that a finding
that the delay involved is prima facie excessive is not a
condition precedent to the inquiry into reasonableness of the delay, i.e., to
the weighing and balancing of the criteria elaborated above.  It is simply an
approximate point at which the courts may properly look to the Crown to explain
additional delay.  Such a period, of course, is no more than a reference
point.  It may well be that a balancing of the criteria of reasonableness will
lead to a finding of a violation for lesser periods of delay.  Conversely,
greater periods of delay may well be held to be reasonable depending upon, once
again, an assessment and a weighing of the criteria.  It is the application
under s. 24(1) which triggers the inquiry, not the passage of a certain period
of time.  The amount of time elapsed determines who of the Crown or accused the
judge will call upon to explain the case being unusual.

 

    With
this in mind, we can now apply the criteria to the facts in this case.  The
appellant was charged on August 29, 1982, and it is only on October 26, 1987,
that the third trial resumed.  In between, many events have slowed down the
proceedings and the delay that occurred, if unexplained, is surely prima
facie unreasonable.  This is conceded by the Crown.  A
careful review of the proceedings throughout confirms that most of it is easily
explained by the fact that the appellant did not object to any of the
additional delays and did in fact ask for many of them.  As I mentioned
earlier, silence by the accused or defence counsel in the face of remands and
postponements, cannot, during the transitional period, be given the same
consequences as after this period.  Where there is not an indication in the
record of an objection by the accused or defence counsel, that silence should
generally be construed as acquiescence in the delay.  There is therefore waiver
as regards those periods of time extending to May 14, 1987, which all happened
prior to the rendering of Rahey.  As regards delays requested by the
accused, I do not think that one could dispute that the accused, either when
represented or not, waived them clearly and unequivocally with full knowledge
of the rights and that the courts carried out their duty to ensure to their
satisfaction that the waiver of time by the accused was clear, unequivocal, and
informed as regards the right and the effect waiver would have on the right. 
Concerning the period extending from May 14, 1987 to October 26, 1987, I just
want to recall that on April 21, 1987, the third trial began before Callon J.
and on this occasion, the accused asked the trial judge to re-elect to be tried
by a judge sitting without a jury.  As the question whether the accused had a
right to make such a re-election was to be argued in the Ontario Court of
Appeal in R. v. Turpin in May 1987, and
as Callon J. did not want to risk making a decision that was inconsistent with
the view of the Court of Appeal, the matter was adjourned until June 1, 1987
for assignment court, when trial for murder was set for October 26, 1987.  The
court fixed an objective and realistic time period for the preparation of the
type of case which is at bar, taking into account the charge, the number of
witnesses, the complexity and the history of the case.  It is my opinion that
there is a justification to the delay.

 

    The
appellant has not, in my view, established a violation of his s. 11 (b)
right.  I should add that, had the events taken place after our decision in Rahey, I
would not consider the very long period of time elapsed from the end of the
second trial until the scheduled start of the third trial, almost eighteen
months, as having been acquiesced to as a result of lack of objection, and
would agree with my brother Sopinka in finding a violation of s. 11 (b) of the Charter . 
However, applying the transitional period approach, I am of the opinion that the
appellant's silence during most of that period should be construed as
acquiescence in the delay as there is no indication in the record of an
objection by the accused or defense counsel.  Consequently, I would dismiss
this appeal.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

    The following
are the reasons delivered by

 

    SOPINKA J.
(dissenting) -- This appeal is from the Ontario Court of Appeal (1988), 26
O.A.C. 389, which allowed the appeal from the decision of Smith J. of the High
Court of Ontario.  Pursuant to s. 11 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , Smith J. ordered a stay of
proceedings by reason of the unreasonable delay in resolving a criminal charge
of murder against the appellant.

 

    In
October of 1987, more than five years after the appellant was charged with
murder, a third trial was scheduled to commence.  At that time the appellant
brought a motion for a stay of proceedings based on an alleged violation of
s. 11 (b) of the Charter  and abuse of
process.  The facts and procedural background are obviously central to the
determination of this appeal and must therefore be considered in some detail.

 

Facts

 

    On
August 29, 1982, during the course of a bonfire party, a fight occurred between
the appellant Conway and one Warren Leach.  The appellant was then 21 years of
age.  There had been a history of animosity between the appellant and Leach. 
Leach was stabbed sixteen times and died as a result of these injuries.  Later
that same day, the appellant was arrested on a charge of first degree murder in
connection with Leach's death.

 

    The
appellant was detained in custody until September 13, 1982, at which time he
was granted judicial interim release.  The preliminary hearing was held in part
on January 12 and 13, 1983, and was continued and concluded four months later on
May 9 and 19, 1983 when the original two days scheduled in January proved
insufficient to complete the inquiry.  The appellant was committed to stand
trial on the charge of first degree murder.

 

    On
June 24, 1983, the trial was adjourned on consent until December 5, 1983
to deal with the appellant's application to quash the committal for first
degree murder.  The application was dismissed, and on September 13, 1983 the
trial date of December 6, 1983 was confirmed.  Shortly thereafter, almost 16 months
after the charge, on December 15, 1983, the jury returned a verdict of not
guilty of first degree murder but guilty of the lesser included offence of
second degree murder.  The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment without
eligibility of parole for ten years.  The appellant was represented at this
trial by Mr. Leonard Shore.

 

    The
appellant launched an appeal of his conviction which was heard in December
1984.  The appellant was represented by Mr. Brian Greenspan.  On January 24,
1985, the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal partly on the grounds that
the trial judge incorrectly instructed the jury relating to provocation.   A
new trial was ordered.  The appellant was in custody for over thirteen months
between December 14, 1983 and February 1, 1985.  On the later date he was
released on bail.

 

    The
appellant appeared in Assignment Court on March 4, 1985 and, upon adjournment,
again on June 25, 1985, at which time a date for the second trial was set for
January 7, 1986.  On November 15, 1985, counsel who had represented the
appellant during his first trial, Mr. Shore, brought an application to be
removed from the record.  The appellant was in the process of retaining Mr.
Greenspan to conduct the second trial.  Mr. Shore's  application was refused by
Osborne J. due to a concern that new counsel would be unable to prepare by
January 7, 1986.

 

    However,
Mr. Shore applied again on December 5, 1985, and this time his application to
be removed from the record was granted by Osborne J.  On December 10, 1985,
Osborne J. further directed that the trial was to proceed on January 7, 1986. 
This left the appellant one month to obtain new counsel before the second
trial.  Conway did not succeed in obtaining new counsel and appeared
unrepresented at the scheduled start of his second trial on January 7, 1986. 
The appellant gave Osborne J. at this time a list of 11 criminal lawyers
including Mr. Greenspan who had stated they could not take the case due to the
short time before the trial date.  Although the Crown and the court expressed
some concern at the delay, the matter was adjourned to April 21, 1986 in order
to allow the appellant to retain new counsel.

 

    The
second trial began on April 21, 1986 with Mr. Greenspan acting as counsel for
the appellant.  On May 1, 1986, after two days of deliberations, the jury
failed to reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared.

 

    The
matter again came up in Assignment Court on May 26, 1986. The appellant was
unrepresented but a lawyer from Mr. Shore's office spoke on his behalf.  Mr.
Greenspan had indicated to the accused that it would not be possible for him to
act as counsel again in proceedings held in Ottawa.  There was an adjournment
until June 16, 1986 in order to enable the appellant to attend with counsel to
fix a date for the third trial.  At that time, although Mr. Shore spoke on his
behalf, the appellant still had not retained counsel.  A trial date was
nevertheless set for September 22, 1986.  A change of venue application to move
the proceedings to Toronto brought by Mr. Greenspan was dismissed on August 8,
1986.

 

    After
the second trial the appellant applied for assistance under the Ontario Legal
Aid Plan.  This application had been made prior to the appellant's appearance
on June 16, 1986 to set a date for trial.  However, Conway had not been granted
Legal Aid by the time of the June 16 appearance.  After being refused twice,
the appellant was finally granted Legal Aid on certain financial conditions in
July of 1986.

 

    On
the date set for the third trial, September 22, 1986, the appellant sought an
adjournment as he had not been successful in retaining new counsel.  The
request was granted over the objection of the Crown and the trial was set for
November 10, 1986.  On October 2, 1986, the accused brought an application to
adjourn the trial date as Donald Bayne, the new counsel, was only able to
represent the appellant if an adjournment were granted.  The application was
denied.  A further application was brought on November 4, 1986 and it was also
denied.  From mid-September until the end of October 1986 at least seven
criminal lawyers were approached to represent the appellant at his scheduled
trial of November 10, 1986.  Affidavits from these lawyers were filed
indicating their inability to represent the appellant at this short notice.

 

    On
further application, O'Brien J. ordered that the trial not proceed until
immediately after the disposition of another unrelated murder trial which was
set to commence on November 17, 1986.  On December 4, 1986, the appellant
brought another application to adjourn before Watt J.  This time, the request
made by Mr. Bayne was granted and the date for the trial was set for April 21,
1987.

 

    On
April 21, 1987, the appellant appeared before Callon J. and indicated that he
wished to re-elect to be tried by a judge sitting without a jury.  The question
whether the Criminal Code  gave an accused
this right was scheduled to be argued before the Ontario Court of Appeal in May
of 1987 (subsequently reported as R. v. Turpin (1987), 36 C.C.C.
(3d) 289, appeal dismissed [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1296).  The matter was adjourned by
Callon J. until the June 1, 1987 Assignment Court.  Callon J. felt it best to
await the decision of the Court of Appeal.  Subsequently, at the June 1, 1987
Assignment Court the date of October 26, 1987 was set for the third trial.

 

    At
the onset of the third trial, on October 26, 1987, the appellant appeared
before Smith J. and entered a plea of not guilty on the charge of murder but
guilty on the lesser included offence of manslaughter.  The plea was not
accepted by the Crown because the appellant would not agree to a joint
submission for a sentence of 15 years.  The appellant consequently brought an
application to stay on the basis that holding a third trial in the
circumstances would constitute an abuse of process and, as well, on the basis
that in view of the time elapsed since the beginning of these proceedings,
there had been a violation of his right to be tried within a reasonable time
guaranteed by s. 11 (b) of the Charter .

 

    The
appellant was incarcerated for a period of thirteen and a half months including
the period immediately after his arrest and after the first trial prior to the
Court of Appeal's decision.  While on bail the appellant was subject to several
restrictions including a provision that he not reside at his family home in
Barrhaven.  He was also required to report to the Manotick detachment of the
Ontario Provincial Police on a weekly basis.  As well, the length and number of
proceedings over five years required that the appellant appear in court for two
trials, one appeal and frequently for the purpose of obtaining trial dates and
adjournments.

 

    The
appellant adduced evidence demonstrating that he suffered from stress, anxiety
and stigmatization as a result of the delay.  The uncertainty which he faced
was exacerbated by the length of the delay.  The delay resulted in the
continued disruption of the appellant's family life and social life.  His
education was disrupted and his health suffered.  The defence put forward by
the appellant was self-defence and provocation.  Determination of these issues
will depend on viva voce evidence.  The appellant alleges that
his right to a fair trial has been prejudiced.

 

Judgments
Below

 

High Court

 

    On
November 6, 1987, Smith J. endorsed an order staying the proceedings against
the appellant.  In oral reasons for judgment Smith J. held that the facts and
circumstances surrounding the prosecution of the appellant did not justify a
stay on the grounds of an abuse of process.  Smith J. held that a court's
discretion to issue a stay based on an abuse of process must be sparingly
used.  Abuse of process requires oppressive or vexatious conduct on behalf of
the prosecution or some misconduct which offends the principles of fundamental
justice.  Although Smith J. felt that he could consider whether the Crown's
failure to accept a plea of manslaughter unless the accused agreed to a joint
submission on sentencing comprised an abuse of process, he concluded that the
Crown had acted in a fair and competent manner.

 

    However,
after examining the nature of the proceedings and the more than five-year delay
between the charge and the scheduled date of the third trial, Smith J. held
that the appellant's s. 11 (b) right to be tried within a reasonable time had been
infringed.  Therefore, a stay on the charge of second degree murder was ordered
on the basis that the length of time taken to resolve the matter was due
largely to systemic delay.  Smith J. rejected the assertions of the Crown that
the appellant had in essence waived his right to assert unreasonable delay as a
result of the adjournments made necessary due to the difficulty he experienced
in retaining counsel.  The five-year period was said to be due largely to
systemic delay which was unnecessary.

 

Court of
Appeal

 

    The
Ontario Court of Appeal in a unanimous decision set aside the order staying the
proceedings and directed a new trial to proceed.  The Court of Appeal agreed
with the court below that the conduct of the prosecution did not constitute an
abuse of process.  Neither the failure of the Crown to accept a plea of guilty
to manslaughter nor the refusal to consent to a trial before a judge alone were
held to constitute an abuse of process.

 

    The
Court of Appeal stated that even if the overall time between the charge and the
stay raises a prima facie case of delay,
there was no breach of the appellant's right to a trial within a reasonable
time.  The reasons for the delays were not attributable to the Crown, but were
either neutral or made necessary to provide a fair trial to the accused.  The
Court of Appeal noted that the community has an interest in seeing that a
criminal case is determined on its merits after a fair trial.  In holding that
there was no violation of s. 11 (b) the
Court held that so long as the delays are not unreasonable, those which are
inevitable to the operation of the very system which seeks to provide a fair
judicial determination of criminal charges by way of a trial should not in
themselves be the basis of granting a stay of proceedings.

 

Abuse of
Process

 

    The
appellant argues that requiring a third trial in the circumstances of this case
would comprise an abuse of process.  The appellant also contends that the
Crown's insistence on tying their consent to a plea to manslaughter to a joint submission
as to sentence represented an abuse of process.  I agree with the conclusion
reached in the courts below that the actions of the Crown in prosecuting this
case fall short of conduct justifying a stay of proceedings on the basis of an
abuse of process.

 

The
Right to be Tried Within a Reasonable Time

 

    The
appellant argues that requiring a third trial more than five years after the
date of the charge violates his right to be tried within a reasonable time
pursuant to s. 11 (b) of the Charter .  Section 11 (b)
provides:

 

                                   11.  Any
person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

                            (b)  to be
tried within a reasonable time;

 

With
respect, I cannot agree with the conclusions reached by the majority on this
issue.

 

Application
to Appellate Proceedings

 

    This
case raises squarely the issue whether the rights enshrined in s. 11 (b) of the Charter  apply
to appellate proceedings.  On its face, s. 11 (b) might
be viewed as extending to an individual only the right to have his trial
conducted in a reasonably prompt manner such that there would be no
constitutionally guaranteed right to a decision or sentencing without
unreasonable delay.  Understandably, however, this provision has not been
construed in so narrow a fashion.

 

    This
Court, in R. v. Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
588, was asked to consider the scope of s. 11 (b).  In
that case the Crown closed its case fourteen months after the charges of making
false returns and willful evasion pursuant to s. 239(1) of the Income Tax
Act were laid.  After a defence motion for a directed verdict, the trial
judge took eleven months before dismissing the motion.  The accused argued that
this latter delay must also be considered a breach of s. 11 (b) even
though the trial itself was conducted in a timely fashion.

 

    Lamer
J. (Dickson C.J. concurring) held that the time period is not arbitrarily ended
for the purpose of a s. 11 (b) claim at the end of the trial.  At pages 610-11 of Rahey, supra, Lamer
J. stated:

 

    As I
have already said here and in Mills [R. v. Mills, [1986]
1 S.C.R. 863], s. 11 (b) protects against an overlong subjection to a pending
criminal case and aims to relieve against the stress and anxiety which continue
until the outcome of the case is final.  The delay in the present case occurred
prior to a determination of guilt or innocence and thus, while the case was
pending, the appellant continued to be subjected to stress and anxiety . . . . 
To terminate the protection afforded by s. 11 (b) as of
the moment the trial is commenced without also considering as relevant the
delay that may occur thereafter would be to disregard the purpose of that
provision and would unduly emasculate the protection it was sought to afford.
The stigma of being an accused does not end when the person is brought to trial
but rather when the trial is at an end and the decision is rendered.  The
computation cannot end as of the moment the trial begins, but rather must
continue until the end of the saga, all of which must be within a reasonable
time.

 

    La
Forest J. (McIntyre J. concurring) in Rahey, supra, at pp.
632-33, similarly concluded that the s. 11 (b) right
extends beyond the trial to ensure that the decision itself is rendered
promptly.  I agree that any ambiguity on this point in the English version is
resolved by reference to the French text which suggests that an individual's
right to be ""tried"" promptly encompasses more than the actual trial. 
The French version reads:

 

                                        11. Tout
inculpé a le droit:

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

                                   b) d'être jugé dans
un délai raisonnable;

 

""Jugé""
means ""judged"" or ""sentenced"" and connotes a sense of
adjudication which goes beyond the mere trial itself.  Had the section been
intended to apply to the start of the trial only, then ""mis en
jugement"" would have been used. At the very least, the
rendering of a decision or delivering of a sentence must be part of the
activity which s. 11 (b) addresses. The principles of statutory interpretation
ensure that a person accused of a criminal offence must be able to take
advantage of the more liberal of the two equally authoritative versions, in
this case the French text.

 

    In Rahey, supra, La
Forest J. stated at p. 633:

 

It would
be cold comfort to an accused to be brought promptly to trial if the trial
itself might be indefinitely prolonged by the judge.  The question of delay
must be open to assessment at all stages of a criminal proceeding, from the
laying of the charge to the rendering of judgment at trial.

 

Certainly,
the rights of an accused would be severely limited if s. 11 (b) were
not held to extend beyond the commencement of the trial.  However, in Rahey the
question of whether s. 11 (b) applies to
appellate delay was expressly left open.  That question is directly raised in
this appeal.

 

    The
Supreme Court of the United States in United States v. Loud
Hawk, 474 U.S. 302 (1986), considered the role of appellate
delay in the context of a claim that the defendant's right to a speedy trial as
guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment had been infringed.  After a reindictment, 44
months elapsed before trial, due largely to interlocutory appeals by both the
defendants and the government from pretrial rulings.  Powell J. for the
majority (5-4) recognized that the interests served by appellate review could
sometimes stand in opposition to the interests of a speedy trial.  The delay
caused by the appeal process can be considered as one factor suggesting that a
defendant was deprived of a speedy trial.  However, on the specific facts the
majority held that the delays asserted by the defendants could not weigh
sufficiently in favour of a violation of their Sixth Amendment right.  Rather
than dismissing the possibility that a delay in the appeal process could
comprise an infringement of the right to a speedy trial, the majority merely
held that the reasons for any delay must be considered.  The dissenting opinion
by Marshall J. held that the defendants' right to a speedy trial had been
infringed as a direct result of the delays before the Court of Appeals.

 

    The
European Court of Human Rights, in the Wemhoff case,
judgment of 27th June 1968, Series A No. 7, considered similar provisions. 
Articles 5(3) and 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 213 U.N.T.S. 222,
provide:

 

    5(3)  Everyone arrested or detained in accordance
with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of
this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer
authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial
within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.  Release may be
conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.

 

    6(1) 
In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal
charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a
reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.

 

Although
the Article 5(3) right was said to extend only to the trial of first instance,
the Court held that the Article 6(1) right to a public hearing within a
reasonable time is not limited to a requirement that the initial trial commence
in a prompt fashion.  The right was held to extend to the period after the
trial while awaiting a decision.  As well, the right was extended to delays
involving appellate decisions.  Specifically, the Court stated at p. 26:

 

    The Court is of opinion that the precise aim of this
provision in criminal matters is to ensure that accused persons do not have to
lie under a charge for too long and that the charge is determined.

 

    There
is therefore no doubt that the period to be taken into consideration in
applying this provision lasts at least until acquittal or conviction, even if
this decision is reached on appeal.

 

    This
interpretation of the Convention as applying until determination of the matter
at the highest appellate level is in apparent recognition of the  prejudice to
the appellant, which is not limited to the period prior to an initial trial,
but continues until all potential appeals have been exhausted.  

 

    I am
of the opinion that s. 11 (b) must extend the
procedural right to be tried within a reasonable time to appellate
proceedings.  The word ""tried"" must be interpreted in light of the
intention of the provision.  The purpose of s. 11 (b) is to
minimize the prejudice to an accused as a result of a criminal charge by
ensuring that proceedings are completed within a reasonable time.  There is
little question that most persons charged with an offence suffer some prejudice
such as stress, anxiety or stigmatization.  As well, prejudice is likely to
increase over time and will almost certainly continue until the ultimate
resolution of the matter.  Section 11 (b) of the Charter  has
provided individuals with a measure of protection against unduly long
proceedings.  Given that the mischief towards which s. 11 (b) is
directed (the prejudice to the accused) will persist until all appellate
proceedings have finished, it would be a shallow and illusory right if
s. 11 (b) were interpreted to apply only to the initial trial. 
The aims or objects of s. 11 (b) were more broadly
designed to guarantee an individual the right to a final resolution of a charge
without unreasonable delay.

 

    Our
entire court system has been placed under the scrutiny of the Charter ,
including s. 11 (b).  In the administration of their duties, all courts,
including those at the appellate level, must be cognizant of the need to
dispose of charges against individuals in a reasonably prompt fashion.  The
detriment or prejudice to an accused as a result of delay does not abate until
the rendering of final judgment.  I am therefore of the opinion that any period
prior to the rendering of final judgment comes under the scrutiny of
s. 11 (b) even where appellate courts are involved.  The process
of justice must be reasonably efficient at all levels if s. 11 (b) is to
be meaningful.  Both the government, which is responsible for the
administration of the courts, and the judiciary must ensure that trials and
appeals are conducted and completed within a reasonable time.

 

    The
time elapsed as a result of resort to appeal procedures by either the accused
or the Crown can be considered under s. 11 (b). 
However, these delays are to be assessed in recognition of the inherent time
requirements at the relevant appellate court.  Resort to appellate proceedings
will understandably add to the overall time in resolving the matter.  A
determination of the reasonableness of the actual delay must be sensitive to
the number and nature of proceedings.

 

What is
Unreasonable Delay?

 

    It
is well accepted that the interpretation of Charter  rights
must be considered in light of the underlying purpose of those rights.  (See Hunter v.
Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; R. v. Big M Drug Mart
Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295).  The goal of s. 11 (b) is to
prevent any prejudice to an accused as a result of unreasonable delay in
bringing the individual to trial or reaching a final determination.

 

    This
Court had occasion to consider the overall purpose of s. 11 (b) in
both Mills, supra, and Rahey, supra.  In
those cases, there was general agreement that the goal of s. 11 (b) was to
secure the more extensive rights to liberty and security of the person as
enshrined in s. 7  of the Charter .  I agree that s. 11 (b) is
premised in part upon a desire to ensure that an accused's liberty and security
are not unduly violated as a result of a failure to complete criminal
proceedings within a reasonable time.

 

    The
need to consider an accused's liberty and security interests is common ground
among the members of this Court who participated in the discussion in Rahey and Mills. 
However, slightly different approaches to the consideration of s. 11 (b) were
adopted by members of this Court in Mills, and especially in Rahey.  The
four separate judgments in Rahey, reveal that there was no unanimous
agreement on the following points:  (1) whether there is an irrebuttable
presumption of prejudice to the accused's security interest or if this is
simply an inference that may be drawn by the Court; (2) whether the
infringement of an accused's fair trial interest is also a form of prejudice
that s. 11 (b) is intended to limit; and (3) whether the prejudice is
to be measured from the moment of the charge or only after the delay becomes
unreasonable.  These differences did not, however, in Rahey affect
the result.  I am of the opinion that this appeal can be disposed of without
attempting to reconcile all the differences of opinion expressed in those two
cases.  That would be more appropriate in a case where these issues would
affect the result and all members of the Court are able to participate in the
decision.  Resort to s. 11 (b) is becoming more
frequent and this tendency is likely to continue and indeed increase.  It is
important, therefore, that this Court adopt a practical approach to the problem
that will not unduly complicate the application of s. 11 (b).  I
shall therefore state my views with this in mind and with due deference to the
views expressed by my colleagues.

 

    The
party alleging a violation of s. 11 (b) cannot
by the mere allegation call upon the Crown to justify the period of time that
has elapsed since the charge.  On the contrary, the person charged has the
initial burden of satisfying the court that, prima facie, the
delay is unreasonable.  The United States Supreme Court in Barker v.
Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), per Powell
J., at p. 530, held that only if a delay was presumptively prejudicial would
the court inquire into various factors that need be balanced.  This approach of
looking first for a delay that is prima facie unreasonable has
been followed by Le Dain J. in Rahey, supra, at p.
616, and by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Antoine (1983),
5 C.C.C. (3d) 97 and in R. v. Askov (1987), 37 C.C.C.
(3d) 289.

 

    Section
11 (b) assumes that a reasonable time is required to
""get a case up for trial"".  This is the inherent time requirement in
disposing of a trial or an appeal.  There is the time required to prepare,
conduct a preliminary inquiry (where applicable) and arrange for the attendance
of witnesses.  In addition, there are normal systemic delays:  adjournments for
the reasonable accommodation of the schedules of counsel, the attendance of
witnesses and to make court facilities available.  This list is not intended to
be exhaustive.  We have come to accept as normal a reasonable period of delay
with respect to these matters which reflect the fact that the system is not
perfect and resources are not unlimited.  The distinction between what is
reasonable and what is unreasonable must not be drawn too sharply but it is a
line with which both judges and counsel are very familiar and which is well
within their expertise to draw.

 

    The
person charged must persuade the court that the delay complained of exceeds
what is reasonable.  The degree of persuasion requires an accused to show that
the delay is prima facie unreasonable or
that it is sufficiently beyond the inherent time requirements that an
explanation is called for from the Crown.  It is neither possible nor desirable
to identify precisely the period of time after which a particular trial will be
said to have been delayed so long as to trigger s. 11 (b). 
Rather, courts, and especially trial judges, must assess each case in light of
the particular circumstances with a view to determining if the delay if prima
facie unreasonable.

 

    In
this appeal this burden has been discharged as a result of the five year delay
and the respondent Crown quite properly concedes that the delay is prima
facie unreasonable.

 

    The
Crown may justify the delay on the basis of special features or circumstances
of the case that required more time; for example, that aspects of the case
required more investigation than is generally required for a particular charge,
or that it took longer to arrange for attendance of witnesses due to
circumstances not reasonably within the control of the Crown.  The Crown can
also justify the delay on the basis of conduct of the accused or his counsel,
including waiver of delays which are relied on as being excessive.  The Crown
cannot, however, justify long periods of systemic delay even if such delays are
beyond the control of the prosecution.  Section 11 (b) would
be meaningless if abnormal delays in bringing the accused to trial could be
excused on such grounds as the unavailability of court rooms, judges or
counsel.  Furthermore, the fact that it has been the practice to tolerate long
systemic delays in the past does not immunize them from scrutiny under s. 11 (b).

 

    While
certain delay is inherent in the very process, the Crown must be limited in the
extent to which it can claim that an inordinately long delay is justified due
to exceptional demand on the resources of a particular court.  A crowded trial
calendar is not the accused's fault and it should not be charged against his
constitutional right.  As well, s. 11 (b) calls
upon the judiciary to render decisions without unreasonable delay.  Judges,
too, must shoulder some of the responsibility to ensure that an accused does
not suffer an impairment of her interests as a result of unreasonable delay.

 

    The
accused's right to counsel is as much a part of the system as the role of the
Crown Attorney.  The failure or inability on the part of the accused to obtain
counsel cannot justify unreasonable delay unless such failure or inability is
attributable to the accused.  As in the case of other systemic delays, some
delay must be tolerated under this head, the question always being whether the
particular delay can be justified on the basis of inherent time requirements of
the case.

 

    Frequently,
and this case is no exception, the Crown relies on waiver.  An accused may have
caused or consented to a period of delay such that he or she will be precluded
from including that period of time in the alleged delay.  This Court held in Korponay
v. Attorney General of Canada, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41, at p. 49, that
the validity of any waiver ""is dependent upon it being clear and
unequivocal that the person is waiving the procedural safeguard and is doing so
with full knowledge of the rights the procedure was enacted to protect and of
the effect the waiver will have on those rights in the process"". 
(Emphasis in original.)

 

    In
the context of a waiver of the right to counsel, this Court held in Clarkson
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, that a waiver requires some form
of awareness of the consequences.  Clearly, an individual need be aware of the
effect of a waiver upon his ability to subsequently assert that right.

 

    I
fully agree with the following comments of Lamer J. in Mills, supra, at p.
929:

 

The court, therefore, has a duty to ensure to its
satisfaction that the waiver of time is clear, unequivocal, and informed as
regards the right and the effect waiver will have on the right.

 

    Waiver
cannot, therefore, be inferred from silence, whether the accused be represented
or not, except in cases where delay is caused by an accused.  It must be
express and informed.  Furthermore such waiver does not affect the right but
merely excludes such time as is waived from the calculation of reasonable time.


 

    Failure
by the Crown to displace the prima facie case does not
necessarily end the matter.  Delay in and of itself may not constitute a
violation of the right in s. 11 (b).  The
purpose of s. 11 (b) is not simply to prevent unreasonable delay but to
protect certain interests of the accused including at least his liberty and
security interests.  Section 11 (b) assumes that
delay is prejudicial to those interests.  While the various opinions in Mills,
supra, and Rahey, supra, adopt
similar approaches to the prejudice to an accused's liberty interest, there is
some disagreement whether prejudice to the security interest is an irrebuttable
presumption or simply an inference a court is entitled to make.  (See Rahey, supra, per Lamer
J. at p. 609, per Wilson J. at p. 622, and per
La Forest J. at p. 643.)

 

    If
the presumption is rebuttable, it is one that is extremely difficult to
overcome.  This is not because it is a different type of presumption in law but
because, as a matter of fact, once the accused has established a prima
facie unreasonable delay which has not been justified, it is
difficult to envisage what kind of evidence the Crown might call to negative
prejudice to the accused's security interests.  No doubt this is due to the
fact that unreasonable delay in a criminal prosecution is virtually synonymous
with prejudice to security interests.  As a practical matter, therefore, there
is little difference between the two views on this subject expressed in Rahey.  It
seems preferable not to foreclose the Crown completely from attempting to
demonstrate an absence of any impairment to the accused's security interest
even if it is almost inevitably bound to fail.  Absolutes in excluding types of
evidence should generally be avoided.

 

    On
this view of the matter, the accused is also permitted to adduce evidence of
prejudice to his or her security interests.  It is not necessary in this appeal
to resolve all facets of its relevance.  At least, it would be relevant to
rebut any evidence of the Crown.  In addition, it would likely be relevant on
the issue of justification of periods of delay and perhaps with respect to what
is prima facie delay.

 

    In
the case at bar, the Crown has not displaced the presumption of prejudice to
the accused.  Indeed the evidence on the subject which is canvassed above
confirms that there was actual prejudice to the liberty and security interests
of the appellant.

 

    The
third possible interest that need be considered is the fair trial interest
which considers the accused's ability to mount a full defence to the charges he
faces.  Here again different approaches were followed in Mills and Rahey.  A
majority in Rahey (per Le Dain
J. (Beetz J. concurring), per Wilson J. (Estey J. concurring), and per La
Forest J. (McIntyre J. concurring)) concluded that the prejudice
caused by delay to the accused's fair trial interest and especially the right
to conduct full answer and defence is a relevant consideration under s. 11 (b). 
Lamer J. (Dickson C.J. concurring) held that the accused's ability to mount a
full and fair defence is relevant only to the s. 11 (d) right
to a fair hearing and not to s. 11 (b).  Again this
issue need not be resolved here.  Prejudice to the fair trial interests are not
a sine que non for a finding of prejudice and in any event, if it
were, such prejudice has been established in this case.  I have already pointed
out that the cases for the Crown and the defence are both dependent on viva voce evidence
which is conflicting.  The appellant alleges that this prejudices his
opportunity for a fair trial.  Whether or not this would be the case can seldom
be determined with precision.  Certainly the witnesses will have little
independent recollection of the events and their evidence will be given more by
rote than remembrance.  This reduces the effectiveness of examination and
increases the risk of a miscarriage of justice.

 

Conclusion
and Disposition

 

    In
this case, I am of the opinion that the Crown has failed to sufficiently
justify the delay which it appropriately concedes is prima facie
unreasonable.  As well, the appellant has demonstrated prejudice to both his
liberty and security interests at a minimum.  I now turn to an examination of
the reason for delay and the justification put forth by the Crown.  I divide
the five-year period into four segments:

 

(1)The date of the charge until the end of the first
trial:  August 29, 1982 to December 15, 1983.  Almost 16 months.

 

(2)The end of the first trial until the Court of Appeal
Decision: December 15, 1983 to January 24, 1985.  More than 13 months.

 

(3) The Court of Appeal decision until the second trial:
January 24, 1985 to May 1, 1986.  More than 15 months.

 

(4)The end of the second trial until the scheduled start
of the third trial:  May 1, 1986 to October 26, 1987.  Almost 18 months.

 

With
respect to the first period I am of the opinion that any delay can be justified
on the basis of the inherent time requirements of the case with the possible
exception of the period between January 12, 1983 and May 9, 1983.  The
preliminary hearing commenced on January 12 but was not completed on that date
and was adjourned to May 9 and concluded on May 19, 1983.  No explanation was
offered for this delay of four months.

 

    The
second period is the thirteen months from the end of the first trial until the
decision of the Court of Appeal.  This period alone is not abnormal or
unreasonable.  The decision itself was rendered in a very prompt fashion. 
Almost the entire delay was a result of the wait to be heard by the Court of
Appeal. This delay has been explained adequately.

 

    The
third period is the fifteen-month delay leading up to the second trial.  The
Crown has argued that the accused's actions during this period comprised a
waiver of his right to assert unreasonable delay.  The Crown alleged that the
accused's tardiness in retaining counsel was responsible for any delay.  The
appellant appeared in Assignment Court on March 4, 1985. For reasons that were
not made clear to this Court the matter was adjourned for over three and
one-half months until June 25, 1985.  The Crown failed to satisfactorily
account for this delay.  On June 25 a trial date of January 7, 1986 was
scheduled.  This sixth-month period is part of the overall systemic delay but
in the circumstances would probably be well within the inherent time
requirements.  However, the actual trial did not commence until April 21, 1986.

 

    On
November 15, 1985, the counsel of record (and counsel at the first trial), Mr.
Shore, brought an application to be removed from the record.  The appellant
apparently preferred to be represented by Mr. Greenspan who had conducted his
successful appeal.  The request was denied at that time due to a concern by the
court that new counsel would not be available or would be unable to prepare by
the January trial date.  However, on a further motion on December 5, 1985, Mr.
Shore was removed from the record.  Predictably, on January 7, 1986, the
appellant appeared without counsel and Osborne J. understandably declined to
conduct the trial.  The appellant provided the court with a list of eleven
criminal lawyers who had stated they were unable to take the case.

 

    This
Court must be very sensitive to an accused's right to choose counsel of
choice.  However, that right must be exercised with reasonable diligence  (see R. v. Ross, [1989]
1 S.C.R. 3).  Normally, an attempt to secure the services of eleven different
lawyers would demonstrate that the appellant had made a reasonable effort to
secure representation.  However, in this case, I am of the opinion that the
appellant must answer for the delay caused by his lack of counsel.  I reach
this conclusion because the first application to remove Mr. Shore from the record
came only a month and a half prior to the trial date.  This date had been known
to the appellant since June.  Section 11 (b) must
only protect those who demonstrate reasonable diligence in their selection of
counsel when it affects the timing of the proceedings.  Not all delays or
adjournments sought by an accused will comprise a waiver as the underlying
cause may be due to circumstances beyond the control of the accused.  Here,
however, the appellant must be held accountable for this delay.  The trial was
rescheduled for April 21, 1986.  Because I attribute this delay to the
appellant, this three and one-half month delay is satisfactorily explained by
the Crown.  

 

    The
fourth and longest period extends from the conclusion of the second trial until
the scheduled start of the third, a period of close to eighteen months.  The
Crown again argues that the appellant's actions were responsible for much of
this delay such that he should be held to have waived his s. 11 (b)
rights.  I am of the opinion, however, that most of this period has not been
satisfactorily explained as being either within the inherent time requirements
of the case or attributable to the accused.  The Crown's conduct of the
proceedings must now be scrutinized in light of the fact that through no fault
of the appellant he had been tried twice and was still in jeopardy.

 

    A
month after the end of the second trial, the appellant appeared unrepresented
in Assignment Court.  The matter was adjourned two weeks until June 16 to allow
him to appear with counsel.  Mr. Greenspan, counsel at the second trial, had
informed the appellant that he could not conduct the third trial if it were
again held in Ottawa.  The appellant was also suffering financial difficulties
and had been seeking Legal Aid for some time prior to the June 16 appearance. 
However, no Legal Aid was forthcoming by the time of that appearance at which
the unrepresented appellant was given a trial date of September 22, 1986. 
Legal Aid was only obtained upon appeal in July.  This difficulty in obtaining
Legal Aid was not the fault of the appellant and therefore he cannot be held
responsible for any delay as a result.  This is a different form of systemic
delay which cannot be relied on here by the Crown as justification for any
delay.  I agree with counsel for the appellant that in view of what has
occurred, the Crown had some responsibility to assist the accused in obtaining
Legal Aid or indeed in funding the defense.  The latter is, according to
counsel, not an uncommon occurrence.  While the Crown contends that its current
practice concerning assistance extends only to appellate proceedings, there is
no reason why in special circumstances it should not apply to trial proceedings
which have been protracted due to appeals.

 

    Mr.
Greenspan on behalf of the appellant sought to obtain a change of venue to move
the proceedings to Toronto.  This application was opposed by the Crown and was
dismissed on August 8, 1986, less than two months prior to the trial date. 
This application was a reasonable request by the appellant who would
understandably desire representation by counsel very familiar with the case. 
Opposing this application in light of the appellant's known difficulties in
obtaining counsel directly contributed to the plight in which he found himself
on September 22, 1986.  He had no counsel.  Again, while the Crown has the
right to oppose such motions, its actions here directly contributed to the
mounting delay.

 

    A
new trial was set for November 10, 1986.  Though the attempt to expedite the
proceedings appears admirable in one sense, it also created the dilemma for the
appellant of having to find counsel who was available on short notice.  The
appellant was reasonably diligent in his attempt to find a lawyer.  Affidavits
were filed from seven criminal lawyers who were approached between
mid-September and the end of October.  They were all unable to conduct the
trial on November 10.  Mr. Donald Bayne on behalf of the appellant sought an
adjournment on October 2 so that he could represent the appellant.  This
application was denied as was a further application on November 4, 1986.  After
a several week postponement, the trial was finally moved to April 21, 1987.  I
am of the view that this delay was not the responsibility of the appellant and
that he did not unequivocally waive his right to a prompt trial.  On the
contrary, his actions demonstrated an attempt to respond to the short trial
date which was scheduled.  I agree with counsel for the appellant that the
Crown's insistence on an unrealistically short adjournment in light of the
appellant's known predicament was the principal reason for not being able to
retain counsel and hence caused the delay.  It is an unfortunate illustration
of the saying ""haste makes waste"".

 

    On
April 21, 1987, the appellant sought to be tried by judge alone.  As the
question whether this election was available to an accused was then before the
Ontario Court of Appeal the trial was again postponed, this time until October
26, 1987.  The Crown could have consented to this request pursuant to
s. 430(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34 (now s. 473(1)), but opposed it and argues that this delay is solely the
responsibility of the appellant.  Admittedly, the Crown had little control over
the delay once it refused to allow a hearing before a judge alone.  In view of
the circumstances, however, and recognizing that refusal to consent is the
prerogative of the Crown, I cannot accept the Crown's explanation of this
delay.  The antecedent delay was now chronic.  The time for insisting on
dubious procedural advantages had gone.  This request by the appellant to be
tried by judge alone was especially reasonable given his earlier experiences with
jury trials.  The appellant also demonstrated his sincerity in wanting to
conclude the proceedings by offering to plead guilty to manslaughter.

 

    Accordingly,
I am of the opinion that substantial segments of the five-year period have not
been justified or satisfactorily explained either on the basis of special
circumstances of the case or that they have been waived by the appellant.  As
well, the appellant has demonstrated that the delay resulted in prejudice to
his liberty and security interests.  Furthermore, it is unlikely that a fair
trial is now possible.  Applying the principles in Mills, supra, and Rahey, supra, on any
approach expressed therein, a breach of s. 11 (b) is
made out.  I agree with the majority of this Court in Rahey that
the minimum remedy in the event of a violation of s. 11 (b) is a
stay of proceedings.  In the result, I would have allowed the appeal, set aside
the order of the Court of Appeal and restored the order of Smith J. at trial.

    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

    MCINTYRE J. -- 
This appeal again raises the question of the right to appeal from the refusal
of what has been called a Wilson review (Wilson v. The Queen, [1983]
2 S.C.R. 594).   On January 30, 1985 an authorization was granted for the interception
of the private communications of the appellant, in respect of narcotics
offences.  On March 1, 1985 a different judge granted an application for an
authorization, authorizing the interception of the appellant's private
communications concerning bookmaking offences under the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.    The Crown commenced
proceedings by indictment on October 15, 1985, under ss. 185(1) , 186(1) (d) and
186(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .  The
appellant pleaded not guilty.

 

    The
case came to trial on November 25, 1985.   Counsel for the appellant sought the
right to cross-examine the deponents on affidavits filed to obtain the
authorizations.   The Crown objected.  Counsel for the appellant sought and
obtained an adjournment to enable an application for an order permitting access
to the filed affidavits, pursuant to s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii) of
the Code, and an order setting aside the wiretap authorizations
of the two authorizing judges.   On or about August 12, 1986, edited versions
of the police affidavits were released to defence counsel, but in reasons
delivered the same day His Honour Judge Skipp, of the Vancouver County Court,
dismissed the motion to quash each of the authorizations.  This judgment was
appealed to the Court of Appeal which dismissed the appeal for want of
jurisdiction.  In doing so, Taggart J.A., speaking with the agreement of
Macfarlane and Cheffins JJ.A., said:

 

    The
Crown has referred to us the decision of this court in Meltzer v.
Laison and Her Majesty the Queen.  That judgment was given June 18,
1986.  The Registry number is CA004567.  The effect of the majority judgment of
the court in Meltzer is that the court lacks jurisdiction
to entertain an appeal from a judgment declining to quash authorizations such
as the authorizations granted in this case.  We are bound by that judgment.

 

    In
this court, the appellant stated in his factum that the sole issue in the
appeal was whether the Court of Appeal erred in declining jurisdiction to hear
an appeal on the merits from the authorizing orders.  In support of that
argument he took the position that the appeal was civil in nature and that
jurisdiction to hear it could be found under the provisions of the Court of
Appeal Act, S.B.C. 1982, c. 7, for civil appeals, and that the
absence of a specific provision in the Criminal Code 
enabling the appeal was therefore not decisive.   He argued as well, as did
counsel in the related cases of R. v. Meltzer, [1989]
1 S.C.R. 000, and R. v. Heikel, [1989] 1 S.C.R.
000, that the importance of the interests guaranteed by the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  were such that an appeal on the
merits should be provided.

 

    These
arguments were raised and disposed of in R. v. Meltzer (judgment
given concurrently) and for the reasons given in that case I would reject both
arguments and dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
british columbia

 

    Criminal
law -- Wiretap authorization or renewal -- Application to set aside renewal
(Wilson application) to prevent admission of wiretap evidence -- Whether a
right of appeal exists from a Wilson application -- Whether Wilson v. The Queen
correctly decided -- Whether Charter of Rights guarantees a right of appeal.

 

    Appellant petitioned the British
Columbia Supreme Court to set aside the renewal of an application to intercept
private communications -- Wilson application -- in an attempt to prevent the admission of the wiretap
evidence.  Notwithstanding the allegations made in the petition, there was no
evidence to suggest that the renewal was irregular or improper; no application
was made to have the packet opened.  The petition was dismissed and the Court of
Appeal declined to hear an appeal from that decision for want of jurisdiction. 
Three issues were before the Court: (1) whether a ""Wilson"" application had a civil as well
as a criminal nature which would extend jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal
under s. 6 of the Court of Appeal Act; (2) whether this Court's decision in
Wilson v. The Queen
should be reconsidered; and (3) whether a right of appeal exists from orders
granting authorizations and renewals if Charter  rights could be affected.

 

    Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

    A motion for review of an
authorization rests solely upon the provisions of the
Criminal Code .  The
adoption of a procedure derived from the civil law for a review of an
authorization did not have the effect of severing the motion from the criminal
process and making it civil in nature.

 

    There was no need to reconsider
Wilson v. The Queen. 
That case merely applied established principles of law and any other course
would offend well established rules of judicial review.  It is the Code that gives rise to any confusion and
delay and the Code that does not provide for a right of appeal.

 

    The Charter  does not provide for an appeal where
none is provided for by law.  An interlocutory appeal in criminal cases, such
as the appeal at issue, has no basis in law.

    The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

 

    MCINTYRE J. -- This appeal is against a
judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal which held that the appellant
had no right of appeal from the refusal of what has come to be known as a
Wilson review of an
authorization to intercept private communications:  see
Wilson v. The Queen,
[1983] 2 S.C.R. 594.

 

    By an information sworn on August
25, 1983, the appellant was charged with one Laison with various criminal
offences in connection with a company known as Palliser Resources
Incorporated.   They were committed to stand trial after a preliminary hearing
during which the Crown put in evidence a number of interceptions of private
communications.  Authorization to intercept the private communications of the
appellant Meltzer had been given on June 6, 1980.  It was renewed on July 17,
1980 and a further renewal was granted on September 10, 1980.  Most of the
intercepted private communications were intercepted under the renewal granted
on September 10, 1980.   It is the validity of this renewal which the appellant
attacks in this appeal.

 

    By petition, the appellant sought
to have the Supreme Court of British Columbia set aside the renewal.    The
grounds of the application were set out in this form:

 

(1)THAT
the Renewal was granted upon an ex parte application without full disclosure of
all offences or transactions being investigated and/or intercepted;

 

(2)THAT
the Renewal was granted without full compliance with Section 178.13(3) (b) of the Criminal Code  of Canada
namely, an affidavit by a peace officer deposing:

 

""full particulars, together with
times and dates, when interceptions, if any, were made or attempted under the
authorization, and any information that has been obtained by any interception .
. . .""

 

The petition was entitled ""In the
Matter of Section 178.13(3)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada"" and it
referred specifically to the authorization granted on the 10th day of September
A.D. 1980.   It was heard by Meredith J., of the Supreme Court of British Columbia,
and on July 17, 1985 it was dismissed.   On the hearing, the appellant did not
apply to open the packet concerning the renewal and no request was made to open
it.   In dismissing the petition, Meredith J. said:

 

    There are no grounds to suspect that
the renewal was anything but regular and proper.   Thus it seems to me that the
Order to set aside or discharge the renewal would not be appropriate on either
of the grounds alleged.   There is nothing to suggest that the renewal was
granted without full disclosure of the transactions under investigation or that
it did not comply with the provisions of the section.

 

    An appeal was taken to the Court
of Appeal.   The Crown made a preliminary objection that the Court of Appeal
lacked jurisdiction to hear it.  By judgment dated June 18, 1986, the Court of
Appeal gave effect to the preliminary objection and dismissed the appeal (see
(1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 266).  Three sets of reasons were written in each of
which all arguments of the appellants were rejected.

 

    The appellant has raised three
grounds of appeal in this Court. They are set out below:

 

A.                        The
Court of Appeal erred in holding that a ""Wilson"" application to review an Order
or renewal of an Order authorizing the interception of private communications
was not properly characterized as civil in nature, and therefore, that the
Court did not have jurisdiction to hear an Appeal to the Court of Appeal
pursuant to s. 6 of the Court of Appeal Act, R.S.B.C. 1982 [sic], c. 7 and amendments thereto.

 

 

B. In
the alternative, if the Court of Appeal did not err in holding that the court
did not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from final orders of an authorizing
or renewing judge, then the appellant asks this Honourable Court to reconsider
this Court's decision in Wilson v. The Queen [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, 37 C.R. 3d, 97.

 

C.                        In the
further alternative, authorizing and renewing judges are entrusted with the
function of ensuring that the Constitutional right of citizens to be free from
unreasonable search and seizure is protected;  accordingly, a right of appeal
must exist from orders granting authorizations and renewals.

 

    Dealing with the first ground, it
was argued that the adoption by this Court in Wilson v. The
Queen,
supra, of a procedure
derived from civil practice for the making of an application for a review of an
authorization had the effect of severing the motion from the criminal process
and making it civil in nature.  Its validity as a proceeding would not,
therefore, rest solely upon the provisions of the Criminal Code  and the constitutional authority of
s. 91(27)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 .   Rather, it would be supportable as a civil
proceeding constitutionally based on s. 92(14)  of the
Constitution Act, 1867 .
The admitted fact that no such appeal is authorized in the
Criminal Code  would
not bar the proceeding for the reason that avenues of appeal are provided in
civil matters by provincial legislation.    It was argued that the Court of
Appeal was in error in following its earlier judgment in Re
Turangan and Chui and The Queen (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 249, and the decision of the Alberta Court of
Appeal in R. v. Cass (1985), 71 A.R. 248 (Alta. C.A.)   Both of these cases considered the
matters before them as criminal in nature.   Therefore, the Court of Appeal in
the case at bar should have distinguished and not followed the
Turangan and Cass cases because they were in error in
characterizing as criminal a review of authorizations.   
R. v. Storgoff,
[1945] S.C.R. 526, was also distinguished.   It was argued that the ratio in R.
v. Storgoff, a case
dealing with a habeas corpus application arising directly out of a criminal
proceeding, could not be applicable to a Wilson review which, it was asserted, could
be a proceeding entirely separate from and not necessarily linked to the
criminal proceeding.     The Wilson review would therefore be subject to appeal in accordance with s. 6 of
the Court of Appeal Act, S.B.C. 1982, c. 7.

 

    I would reject this argument.  
The question was dealt with in the Court of Appeal and I am in agreement with
its treatment of the subject. Hutcheon J.A. said, at p. 275:

 

    The decision of Mr. Justice
Meredith was a judicial determination of questions of fact and law arising in
proceedings under Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  (Invasion of Privacy) and in relation
to the charges of indictable offences then pending against Meltzer and
Laison.   Without doubt, the application before him raised questions within the
criminal law.   I agree with this statement of Chief Justice Laycraft in R.
v. Cass, Alberta
Court of Appeal, May 16, 1985 (unreported), in its application to the present
case:   ""In my view it cannot be argued that a wire tap authorization, or
a review of it, or an appeal from such a review, is anything other than a
criminal matter.""

 

    Seaton J.A., with whom Cheffins
J.A. agreed, said, at p. 271:

 

    I think that the application
before Meredith J. was an application in the Part IV.1 proceeding in which the
authorization and renewal were granted.   The application had to be in that
proceeding to escape being collateral.    The subject matter of the application
was an order made under the Criminal Code .   The order was being reconsidered in the light
of new evidence.   The criteria for reconsideration, as for the original
authorization and the renewals, is found in the Criminal Code .   This application cannot be
described as a civil proceeding to which the Court of Appeal
Act would apply.

 

He then referred to the disposition
made of this argument in the Alberta Court of Appeal in R.
v. Cass,
supra, and quoted the
following passage from the words of Laycraft C.J.A. in that case:

 

Indeed,
it is also to be observed that, while the granting of an authorization, because
of its ex parte nature, may be reviewed by the court granting it, no right of appeal
exists under the Criminal Code  against either the grant or refusal of an
authorization.   That point was made by Mr. Justice McIntyre in
Wilson at p. 123
[(1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 97].   It is not surprising that if the grant of an
authorization cannot be appealed, the review of that process is also not the
subject of an appeal.

 

    It is urged that in
Wilson, Mr. Justice
McIntyre held that an appeal from a review of the authorization is a civil
matter and that the civil appeal rules therefore apply.   At p. 123 in
Wilson he did refer
to the body of jurisprudence to be found in the law relating to civil matters
but that was merely to derive assistance in formulating rules for the criminal
matter before him.   In my view it cannot be argued that a wire tap
authorization, or a review of it, or an appeal from such a review, is anything
other than a criminal matter. Indeed, Parliament's authority in the field of
interception of private communications derives from its criminal law
jurisdiction.   An Alberta statute or rule of court relating to civil matters
purporting to govern an appeal from the review of an authorization would be
ultra vires: 
Poje et al. v. A.-G. B.C.
(1953), 105 C.C.C. 311, [1953] 2 D.L.R. 785, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 516; R.
v. Storgoff (1945),
84 C.C.C. 1, [1945] 3 D.L.R. 673, [1945] S.C.R. 526.

 

In the view of Seaton J.A., with which
I agree, R. v. Cass cannot be distinguished.

 

    I have referred to the judgments
in the courts below in some detail because, in my view, they aptly dispose of
this argument.   I would add that this application to review the renewal of the
authorization was simply an interlocutory motion in a criminal proceeding aimed
at the exclusion of evidence in that proceeding.  Section 178.14(1) (a)(ii) of the
Criminal Code 
envisages an opening of the sealed packet.   The Criminal Code  provides no procedural guide for this
purpose and limits the power to open to a judge of a superior court of criminal
jurisdiction or a judge as defined in s. 482  of the Criminal Code .  The fact that a procedural step
deriving from civil practice was employed to meet this problem cannot be said
to have converted the matter into anything approaching a civil appeal.    It
was not contended that the Criminal Code  provided a statutory base for an appeal from the
refusal of the review and, in my view, then this ground of appeal must fail.

 

    The second ground advanced as an
alternative, in the event that the first ground fails, asks this Court to
reconsider its judgment in Wilson v. The Queen.   In that case, this Court by a majority held
that an authorization given by a judge with jurisdiction to do so, that is, a
judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in s.
482  of the Criminal Code , was not subject to collateral attack before a
trial judge and that the authorization must receive full effect according to
its terms, save for errors or defects apparent on its face.   Any application
for the review of the order, and it would appear that a review was contemplated
in view of the provisions of s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii) allowing the opening of the
packet, should be made to the judge who made the order or a judge of the same
court.   It has been said that this has led to a confusion and delay and that
the trial judge should, in his capacity as trial judge, have full power to open
the sealed packet and review the High Court order, regardless of the status of
the trial judge, and make any necessary rulings.    That this procedure would
probably expedite matters and remove some confusion may well be true.   It is
not, however, a procedure provided by Parliament, and subject to arguments
relating to the application of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ** it is not, in my opinion, open to the
courts to disregard the statutory provisions of Part IV.1 of the
Criminal Code . If
there is confusion and delay in this matter it arises from the Criminal
Code  itself and, subject as aforesaid, it will be for
Parliament to change.

 

    As
to the confusion and delay and as to alleged procedural problems, it is my
opinion that these concerns are much exaggerated.   The requirement that an
application to open the sealed packet, a necessary step in any application for
a review, be made to a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a
judge, as defined in s. 482  of the Criminal Code , does
not stem from this court's judgment in Wilson v. The Queen.   It
is clearly provided in s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii)
that the packet shall not be opened except:

 

    178.14 (1)

 

    (a) . . .

 

(ii)
pursuant to an order of a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or
a judge as defined in section 482 ; . . .

 

It is
evident, then, that anyone wishing to have a review of the authorization must,
in any event, go to the higher court for that purpose.    This step may well --
in fact certainly will -- be a source of delay in some proceedings.   It need
not, however, be a source of undue confusion.   All courts in the land have
rules which fix procedures for applications of this nature and it is not a step
involving a strange practice which should confuse the profession.    Once
before the reviewing judge, the matter may be dealt with.     It has been
suggested that the sole function of the judge under s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii) is
to open the package and make available its contents to the trial judge.   I
reject any such suggestion.   It is my view that the power to open the packet
and the power to review and pass upon its contents go together.   Any other
course would offend well established rules of judicial review, forbidding
collateral attacks on orders in judgments, and would deprive the higher courts
of control of the granting and reviewing of authorizations and renewals clearly
conferred upon them by Parliament.

 

    As
to the complaint that no right of appeal exists from the review of such an
authorization, it may be said that this is not because of the judgment in Wilson v.
The Queen but simply because Parliament did not provide such
right of appeal.    If there is confusion and difficulty in this field it is
not because of the Wilson judgment, which merely applies
established principles of law, but because of the provisions of the Criminal
Code .   I would adopt and agree with the words of Seaton
J.A. in the Court of Appeal when he said. at p. 272:

 

    These
provisions deal primarily with protection of privacy, not with evidence.  
Parliament designed them to protect people from unreasonable invasion of
privacy by making particular invasions a criminal offence.   The scheme accepts
that in some cases it will be necessary for the police to breach the privacy of
certain individuals.  To avoid unwarranted interceptions, Parliament has
required that the police first go to a judge and get his authorization.  
Parliament entrusted that function to county and superior court judges without
a provision for an appeal.   I am not persuaded Parliament erred in so doing.

 

I am not
persuaded that there is any basis or need for a reconsideration of this Court's
judgment in Wilson v. The Queen.

 

    The
third ground of appeal was set out in these terms in the appellant's factum:

 

    C.                    In
the further alternative, authorizing and renewing judges are entrusted with the
function of ensuring that the Constitutional right of citizens to be free from
unreasonable search and seizure is protected;  accordingly, a right of appeal
must exist from orders granting authorizations and renewals.

 

The
argument in support of this ground, simply put, is that the rights protected or
guaranteed in the Charter  are of such significance that an
appeal should be available where relief under the Charter  is
denied at first instance.   In short, what is asserted is that the Charter  makes
obligatory a right of appeal from any legal proceeding at first instance.

 

    At
common law there were no appeals.   All appeals have been the creature of
statute.   It has not been argued that the Criminal Code  in any
of its appeal sections (602, 603, 605, 618, 719, 748) provides specifically for
an appeal from a refusal of a Charter  remedy.   Therefore,
if any such specific right exists it must be found in the Charter .   The
question facing the Court then is:  Does the Charter ,
because of the importance of the interests it protects, provide an appeal
against a refusal of a Wilson application for review despite the
fact that neither the Criminal Code  nor any other
legislative enactment so provides?     I assume -- but do not decide --  for
the purposes of dealing with this question, that s. 8  of the Charter  is
engaged by the interception of private communications.

 

    I
would say at the outset that in my view the Charter  does
not provide such an appeal.    In argument, the appellant referred to what I
said in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, at pp. 958-59:

 

    Again,
it must be observed that the Charter  is silent on the question of appeals
and the conclusion must therefore be that the existing appeal structure must be
employed in the resolution of s. 24(1)  claims.   Since the Charter  has
conferred a right to seek a remedy under the provisions of s. 24(1)  and since
claims for remedy will involve claims alleging the infringement of basic rights
and fundamental freedoms, it is essential that an appellate procedure exist.  
There is no provision in the Code which provides a specific right to
appeal against the granting, or the refusal, of a Charter  remedy
under s. 24(1) , but appeals are provided for which involve questions of law and
fact.   The Charter , forming part of the fundamental law
of Canada, is therefore covered and the refusal of a claim for Charter  relief
will be appealable by a person aggrieved as a question of law, as will be the
granting of such relief by the Crown.  The appeal will follow the normal,
established procedure.   When the trial is completed, the appeal may be
taken against the decision or verdict reached and the alleged error in respect
of the claim for Charter  relief will be a
ground of appeal.   [Emphasis added.]

 

 

    I
would, however, add that with the approval of two more of the seven judges
sitting upon the appeal, I went on to say in Mills v. The Queen, at p.
959:

 

    The
question has been raised as to whether there can be something in the nature of
an interlocutory appeal in which a claimant for relief under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  may
appeal immediately upon a refusal of his claim and before the trial is
completed.   It has long been a settled principle that all criminal appeals are
statutory and that there should be no interlocutory appeals in criminal
matters.   This principle has been reinforced in our Criminal Code  (s.
602 , supra) prohibiting procedures on appeal beyond those
authorized in the Code.

 

The
refusal of an application for a remedy or relief based on the Charter  may
well raise a question of law which could be the basis of an appeal under the Criminal
Code  against conviction or acquittal.   Accepting this
principle, however, will not assist the appellants in this case.   They do not
seek to appeal against a conviction under the Criminal Code  appeal
provisions.   They seek to launch an interlocutory appeal concerning the
admissibility of evidence which may be adduced at a future trial.   There is no
statutory basis for such an appeal and the law, as expressed in Mills v.
The Queen, supra, and s. 602  of the Criminal
Code , does not permit interlocutory appeals in criminal
cases.    I am, accordingly, satisfied that the Court of Appeal was correct in
holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain this interlocutory appeal.  
The appellants assert under this head of the argument that ""a right of
appeal must exist from orders granting authorizations and renewals""
(ground of appeal ""C"", supra).   I leave open
the question of whether these words frame a question of law which would be
cognizable as a ground of appeal against conviction upon the completion of the
trial.

 

    I
would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
alberta

 

    Criminal
law -- Wiretap authorization -- Application to set aside authorization (Wilson
application) -- Whether a right of appeal exists from a Wilson application --
Whether Wilson v. The Queen correctly decided -- Whether Charter of Rights
guarantees a right of appeal -- Whether continued interception after targets
arrested infringing right to privacy and Charter rights against
self-incrimination, to retain counsel, and to trial by an independent and impartial
tribunal.

 

    Appellants,
by notice of motion, sought an order setting aside authorizations to wiretap (a Wilson
application) before a new trial took place.  The trial had been ordered by the
Court of Appeal when it set aside the acquittal of the accused.  The decision
dismissing the application was appealed to the Court of Appeal which dismissed
the appeal for want of jurisdiction.  The issues before the Court were: (1)
whether a ""Wilson"" application had a civil nature
which would support an appeal; (2) whether this Court's decision in Wilson v.
The Queen should be reconsidered; (3) whether the Charter 
required that an appeal be available on a denial of a Charter  remedy,
and (4) whether an authorization to wiretap may not be given after the arrest
of the target because it could result in the violation of the accused's right
to privacy and of his Charter  rights against self-incrimination, to
retain counsel, and to trial by an independent and impartial tribunal.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    The
first three issues on appeal should be answered in the negative for the reasons
given in R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 2 S.C.R.
000.  The fourth was one to be dealt with at trial and, for the reasons
expressed in R. v. Meltzer, must fail.

//McIntyre J.//

 

    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

    MCINTYRE J. --
This appeal raises the same questions which were raised in the appeal of R. v.
Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 000, and, in addition, a ground based
on the fact that an authorization to intercept private communications was
granted after the arrest of the intended targets.

 

    The
appellants were arrested as a result of an investigation by the Edmonton
police, carried out in the summer and fall of 1982, and were charged with
conspiracy to traffic in narcotics.   At trial, the Crown sought to tender
wiretap evidence and a voir dire was commenced to determine
admissibility. Before the Crown had concluded its evidence on the voir dire,
counsel for the defence moved to have the wiretap evidence excluded for
violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .    After
argument and a two-day adjournment, the trial judge held the wiretap evidence
to be inadmissible, not by reason of any consideration of the Charter  but by
the application of s. 178.16(2)  of the Criminal Code , which
provides:

 

    178.16 (1) . . .

 

    (2) 
Notwithstanding subsection (1), the judge or provincial court judge presiding
at any proceedings may refuse to admit evidence obtained directly or indirectly
as a result of information acquired by interception of a private communication
that is itself inadmissible as evidence where he is of the opinion that the
admission thereof would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

No
mention of this provision had been made in argument and no reliance had been
placed upon it.   No opportunity had been given to the Crown to conclude its voir dire or to
address the question of the applicability of s. 178.16(2)  before the judge
ruled the evidence inadmissible.   The Crown called no further evidence and the
accused were accordingly acquitted.    The Alberta Court of Appeal allowed the
Crown appeal, set aside the acquittal, and directed a new trial, which at this
date has not taken place.

 

    The
appellants then launched proceedings by notice of motion in the Alberta Court
of Queen's Bench, dated March 22, 1986.    They sought an order setting aside
the authorizations under which the interceptions referred to above had been
made.   Various grounds were alleged and the application clearly sought what
has become known as a Wilson review of the authorization: see Wilson v.
The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594.    The motion was heard by
O'Byrne J. in Chambers.    He heard viva voce evidence and
extensive argument and dismissed the motion.    An appeal was taken to the
Alberta Court of Appeal and, on July 30, 1986, was dismissed on the basis that
the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.  
Laycraft C.J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal, said:

 

    We
have not considered the appeals on their merits because we consider ourselves
bound to follow our decision in R. v. Cass (May 16, 1985
unreported (Alta. C.A.)) that there is no right of appeal from the order of the
learned Chambers Judge.

 

    The
appeal to this Court is by leave granted November 6, 1986.

 

    The
appellants raised three grounds of appeal in this Court.  It was argued that
the Court of Appeal was in error, in holding that there was no right of appeal
from the refusal of the application to review the authorizations, because it
would be supportable as an appeal in a civil matter.   It was argued, as well,
that this Court's decision in Wilson v. The Queen, supra, should
be reconsidered.   The appellants associated themselves also with the general
argument raised in R. v. Meltzer, to the effect
that the Charter  required that an appeal be available
on a denial of a Charter  remedy.  These grounds were raised in
the case of R. v. Meltzer and disposed of.  
For the reasons there given, I would conclude that these arguments are without
merit.

 

    It
was further contended that an authorization may not be given for an
interception after the target has been arrested, because to do so would permit
the violation of the accused's Charter  rights against
self-incrimination: to retain counsel, to trial by an independent and impartial
tribunal, and to privacy.   What the appellants seek in this interlocutory
appeal is an in futuro ruling against the admissibility of
evidence to be tendered at trial.    The issue raised is one to be dealt with
at trial, and again for the reasons expressed in R. v. Meltzer this
ground must fail.

 

    I
would therefore dismiss the appeal.

 

    Appeal
dismissed.

Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, ss. 150(1), 246.1, 613(2),
(3), (8), 623(1).

 

    The
appellant was charged with committing incest by having sexual intercourse with
his daughter contrary to s. 150  of the Criminal Code  and
with sexually assaulting her contrary to s. 246.1 of the Code.  The
appellant was convicted of incest and acquitted of sexual assault because of
the application of the rule against multiple convictions as set in Kienapple
v. The Queen.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the
incest charge, entered a conviction on the sexual assault charge and remitted
the matter of the sexual assault charge back to the trial judge for the
imposition of sentence.  The Crown had not appealed the appellant's acquittal
on the sexual assault charge.  At issue is whether the Court of Appeal had
jurisdiction to substitute a conviction for sexual assault for the acquittal
entered at trial because of Kienapple when the Crown had not appealed the
acquittal for sexual assault.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    The
use of conditional stays of charges in which convictions are barred by the rule
against multiple convictions is preferable to the use of acquittals.  The
stay is conditional on the final disposition of the more serious charge on
which the accused has been convicted.  If the accused's appeal from the
conviction on that charge is dismissed or the accused does not appeal within
the specified times, the conditional stay becomes permanent and is tantamount
to a judgment or verdict of acquittal for the purpose of an appeal or a plea of autrefois
acquit.  If, on the other hand as is the case here, the
accused's appeal from the conviction is successful, the conditional stay
dissolves and the appellate courts, while allowing the appeal, can make an
order remitting to the trial judge the count or counts which were conditionally
stayed because of the Kienapple principle even though no appeal was
taken from the conditionally stayed counts.  A permanent stay should be
recorded on the ""Kienappled"" offence to reflect that reasons of
policy and not the accused's lack of culpability account for the refusal to
enter a conviction.

 

    The
Court of Appeal should first decide whether to allow or dismiss appellant's
appeal of his conviction for incest.  That decision would then determine the
court's jurisdiction to deal with the acquittal of sexual assault.

 

    The
Court of Appeal's power, under s. 613(3), to substitute a verdict that
should have been found only arises when it dismisses an appeal under
s. 613(1)(b)(i).  In this case the appellant's appeal on the incest
charge was not dismissed.  Its jurisdiction is not, however, exhausted in
exercising its power under s. 613(2) to quash the conviction and to direct
an acquittal; the Court is given a broad ancillary power ""to make any
order ... that justice requires"" under s. 613(8).  Section 613(8),
which has been given a broad, liberal interpretation, gives the Court of Appeal
a broad supplementary power to make any order that justice requires when it
exercises its appellate powers under s. 613.

 

    As a
general rule a Court of Appeal cannot disturb an acquittal unless the Crown
appeals from it but an exception to this general proposition exists in the
context of Kienapple.  This exception accommodates the
special relationship between offences which arise out of the same delict and
which are subject to special treatment under the Kienapple
principle.  Here, the general rule should give way to the exception:  the
appellant's acquittal on the sexual assault charge could properly be considered
by the Court of Appeal in the absence of an appeal by the Crown.

 

    The
Court of Appeal, when it allowed the appeal on the incest charge under
s. 613(2), could then have exercised its supplementary powers under
s. 613(8) to dispose of the sexual assault charge.  However, it would have
been more appropriate to remit the matter to the trial judge to register a
conviction on the sexual assault charge and sentence the appellant for that
offence rather than itself entering a conviction on the sexual assault charge
on the basis of the clear finding of the trial judge.  This course preserves
the appellant's right to launch an appeal from the sexual assault conviction.

    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

    WILSON J. --
The issue on this appeal is the jurisdiction of a Court of Appeal, when allowing
an accused's appeal from a conviction on a charge of incest, to deal with an
acquittal of the accused on a charge of sexual assault when that acquittal
resulted from the application of the rule against multiple convictions and the
Crown did not appeal that acquittal.

 

1.  The
Facts

 

    On
June 18, 1983 the appellant and his wife separated after a 3-year marriage
which produced two children, a son Michael aged 5 and a daughter Tracey aged
4.  The appellant also had a step-son John aged 11.  By agreement with his
wife, Corrine Provo, the appellant was allowed access to his children and his
step-son on the weekends while she retained permanent custody.

 

    During
these weekend visits the children stayed at the appellant's residence in
Winnipeg, Manitoba.  When the visits started in June, 1983 the sleeping
arrangements were that the appellant slept alone in a single bed in his bedroom
and the two younger children, Michael and Tracey, slept in a double bed in the
same room.  The older child, John, slept on a couch in the living room.  Some
time before December, 1984 this arrangement was changed and the appellant and
his daughter Tracey slept in the double bed while Michael slept in the single. 
The explanation given for this change was that Michael and Tracey could not
sleep peacefully in the same bed.

 

    On
December 26, 1984 Corrine Provo confronted the appellant with an allegation
that he was sexually molesting his daughter Tracey after Tracey had complained
to her.  The appellant replied that he had an erection while sleeping in the
same bed as Tracey and that Tracey had wakened him up complaining.  The
appellant denied any intentional wrongdoing and offered to see a counsellor
with his wife if necessary.

 

    On
January 4, 1985 Tracey was examined at the Children's Hospital by a
pediatrician who found that the child's vaginal opening was twice the normal
size and that there was a healed laceration in the child's hymen. The police
were contacted and the appellant was arrested at his home the next day.

 

    The
appellant was charged with committing incest by having sexual intercourse with
his daughter contrary to s. 150 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, as amended, and with sexually assaulting her contrary to s.
246.1  of the Criminal Code .  These charges
proceeded by way of indictment and the appellant was tried on September 12 and
13, 1985 in the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba.  The appellant was
convicted of incest and acquitted of sexual assault because of the application
of the rule against multiple convictions.

 

2.  The
Applicable Legislation

 

    Section
150  of the Criminal Code :

 

    150.  (1)  Every one commits incest who,
knowing that another person is by blood relationship his or her parent, child,
brother, sister, grandparent or grandchild, as the case may be, has sexual
intercourse with that person.

 

    (2)  Every one who commits incest is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

 

    (3)  No accused shall be determined by a court to be
guilty of an offence under this section if the accused was under restraint,
duress or fear of the person with whom the accused had the sexual intercourse
at the time the sexual intercourse occurred.

 

    (4) 
In this section, ""brother"" and ""sister"", respectively,
include half-brother and half-sister.

 

    Section
246. 1 of the Criminal Code :

 

    246.1  (1)  Every one who commits a sexual
assault is guilty of

 

(a)  an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment
for ten years; or

 

(b)  an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

    (2) 
Where an accused is charged with an offence under subsection (1) or section
246.2 or 246.3 in respect of a person under the age of fourteen years, it is
not a defence that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the
subject-matter of the charge unless the accused is less than three years older
than the complainant.

 

    Section
613  of the Criminal Code :

 

    613.  (1)  On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal

 

(a)  may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

(i)  the verdict should be set aside on the ground that
it is   unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

 (ii)  the judgment of the trial court should be set
aside on   the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii)  on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

(b)  may dismiss the appeal where

 

(i)  the court is of the opinion that the appellant,
although he was not properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment,
was properly convicted on another count or part of the indictment,

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

    (2)  Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under
paragraph (1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and

 

(a)  direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be
entered, or

 

(b)  order a new trial.

 

    (3)  Where a court of appeal dismisses an appeal
under subparagraph (1)(b)(i), it may substitute the verdict that in its opinion
should have been found and affirm the sentence passed by the trial court or
impose a sentence that is warranted in law.

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

    (8) 
Where a court of appeal exercises any of the powers conferred by subsection
(2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order, in addition, that justice
requires.

 

    Section
623(1)  of the Criminal Code :

 

    623.  (1) 
The Supreme Court of Canada may, on an appeal under this Part, make any order
that the court of appeal might have made and may make any rule or order that is
necessary to give effect to its judgment.

 

3.  The
Courts Below

 

    Manitoba
Court of Queen's Bench

 

    At
trial the pediatrician who examined Tracey testified that the laceration of her
hymen could have been caused by accident or as a result of sexual abuse.  If
the latter were the case Dr. Benoit testified that the injury could have been
caused by penetration by a penis, a finger or an object.  Tracey, aged 5 at the
time of trial, testified as an unsworn witness on direct examination to the
effect that there was penetration by the appellant's penis.  On
cross-examination she said that her testimony was not true, but later agreed on
re-examination that she had told the truth on her direct examination. Michael,
aged 6, testified as an unsworn witness that he observed the appellant
penetrate Tracey with his penis but his testimony, like his sister's and
understandably given their age, was capable of supporting inferences to the
contrary.  The appellant testified that he had not sexually assaulted his
daughter.  The trial judge stated that he was satisfied on the evidence that
there was penile penetration by the appellant.  He concluded:

 

    For
all of these reasons then, I have concluded that I must accept the evidence of
the two children. It follows then that there was certainly a sexual assault
upon Tracey Lynn committed by the accused.  It was submitted that there was no
incest because there wasn't a sufficient degree of penetration shown, but in my
view there was, having regard to the medical evidence, therefore, my conclusion
is that the accused should be convicted on both counts in the indictment.

 

After
the trial judge had made this statement counsel for the appellant submitted
that the appellant could only be convicted on one as opposed to both of the
incest and sexual assault counts because they both arose from the same
incident, i.e, the incident which had led to Corrine Provo's allegations on
December 26, 1984 and the subsequent laying of charges against the appellant.
The trial judge agreed, convicted the appellant of the more serious charge of
incest and acquitted him of the charge of sexual assault.

 

    On
January 14, 1986 the appellant moved to have the trial re-opened.  The trial
judge decided to hear medical evidence in support of the appellant's motion at
a later date.  This evidence was heard on November 4, 1986 when the trial judge
dismissed the motion to re-open the trial and sentenced the appellant to 2
years imprisonment.

 

    Manitoba
Court of Appeal

 

    The
appellant appealed his conviction on the incest charge to the Manitoba Court of
Appeal (O'Sullivan, Philp and Twaddle JJ.A.) on the basis that the Crown had
not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had penetrated his
daughter with his penis. The Crown did not appeal the acquittal of the
appellant on the sexual assault charge.

 

    The
Court of Appeal [(1987), 47 Man. R. (2d) 210] agreed that there was
insufficient proof of sexual intercourse to support the conviction for incest
but found that the case of sexual assault was made out.  The Court of Appeal
was, however, divided as to their powers once the appeal on the incest conviction
was allowed.  Twaddle J.A. held for the majority that a conviction for the
lesser offence of sexual assault could be entered.  He stated at p. 213:

 

    The
entry of an acquittal on the less serious of two charges arising out of the
same delict is, in my view, conditional upon the conviction on the other charge
not being quashed on appeal.  If a court of appeal is of the opinion that the
accused was not properly convicted on the more serious charge, but was properly
convicted (i.e. found guilty) on the less serious charge, the court exercising
its powers under s. 613(1) (b)(i) and s. 613(3)  of the Criminal Code  may
dismiss the appeal, but substitute a conviction on the less serious charge.

 

    Twaddle
J.A. then ordered that the matter be remitted back to the trial judge to impose
a new sentence for sexual assault.  O'Sullivan J.A. held in dissent that the
Court of Appeal had no power to enter a conviction on the sexual assault
charge, that the appellant was entitled to plead autrefois acquit to that
charge, and that the entry of a conviction would be an impermissible collateral
attack on the verdict of the trial judge as a superior court.  He stated at pp.
215-16:

 

    It is true that the transcript indicates that the
verdict of acquittal was entered in error.  But I do not think we can set aside
an acquittal in a superior court simply on the ground it was erroneous unless
there is an appeal to us from the acquittal.  I think the integrity of the
court process requires us to follow what was said by McIntyre J. in the Supreme
Court of Canada in R. v. Wilson (1983), 51 N.R.
321 at 325:

 

""In the Manitoba Court of Appeal, Monnin J.A. said:

 

`The record of a superior court is to be treated as
absolute verity so long as it stands unreversed.'

 

""I
agree with that statement.  It has long been a fundamental rule that a court
order, made by a court having jurisdiction to make it stands and is binding and
conclusive unless it is set aside on appeal or lawfully quashed.  It is also
well-settled in the authorities that such an order may not be attacked
collaterally --  and a collateral attack may be described as an attack made in
proceedings other than those whose specific object is the reversal, variation,
or nullification of the order or judgment.  Where appeals have been exhausted
and other means of direct attack upon a judgment or order, such as proceedings
by prerogative writs or proceedings for judicial review, have been unavailing,
the only recourse open to one who seeks to set aside a court order is an action
for review in the High Court where grounds for such a proceeding exist. 
Without attempting a complete list, such grounds would include fraud or the
discovery of new evidence.""

 

O'Sullivan
J.A. distinguished the case at bar from this Court's decision in Terlecki
v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 483 [hereinafter Terlecki] by
stating that in Terlecki the Court of Appeal only had the
power to enter the conviction on the less serious offence (a conviction which
was barred at trial by the rule against multiple convictions) because the trial
judge had not registered a conviction on the less serious offence and this
Court had construed that to be the equivalent of a stay.  O'Sullivan J.A.
concluded:

 

    But
in the case before us I do not see how it is possible for us to construe a
verdict of acquittal as being the equivalent of a stay.

 

4.  The
Issues

 

    The
main issue presented on this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal erred in law
in holding that it had jurisdiction to set aside the conviction of incest and
substitute a conviction for sexual assault in the absence of an appeal taken by
the Crown against the acquittal for sexual assault, such acquittal having been
entered by reason of the application of the rule against multiple convictions. 
This issue raises, however, a larger issue, namely what approach should a trial
judge take in applying the Kienapple principle against multiple
convictions.

 

    (a)  The
Kienapple Principle

 

    There
appears to be some confusion in the courts as to the proper approach a trial
judge should take in applying the rule against multiple convictions as set out
by this Court in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R.
729 [hereinafter Kienapple].  In this case the trial judge was
faced with the option of registering two possible convictions which could arise
from the same delict.  Following the requirements of the rule, the trial judge
properly entered a conviction for the more serious offence of incest.  Then,
despite his conclusion that the Crown had established that the appellant had
committed all the elements of the offence of sexual assault, he entered an
acquittal on the charge of sexual assault.

 

    The
trial judge's approach to this matter finds support in the decision of this
Court in R. v. Loyer and Blouin, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 631
[hereinafter Loyer and Blouin].  In that case
the Court, for the first time after its decision in Kienapple, dealt
with the proper procedure to be followed in dealing with offences of greater
and lesser severity which could arise from the commission of the same delict. 
Laskin C.J. set out the procedure to be followed by trial judges in such
circumstances at p. 635:

 

    Where a trial before a judge alone or before a judge
and jury proceeds on two or more counts of offences of different degrees of
gravity, and the same delict or matter underlies the offences in two of the
counts, so as to invite application of the rule against multiple convictions,
the trial judge should direct himself or direct the jury that if he or they
find the accused guilty on the more serious charge, there should be an
acquittal on the less serious one; but if he or they should acquit on the more
serious charge, the question of culpability on the less serious charge should
be pursued and a verdict rendered on the merits.

 

    Again,
if at the trial, there is a plea of guilty to the more serious charge, and a
conviction is registered, an acquittal should be entered or directed on the
less serious, alternative charge.  However, if, as was the case here, the
accused pleads guilty to the less serious charge, the plea should be held in
abeyance pending the trial on the more serious offence.  If there is a finding
of guilty on that charge, and a conviction is entered accordingly, the plea
already offered on the less serious charge should be struck out and an
acquittal directed.

 

Both the
trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal applied Loyer and
Blouin in this case.

 

    However,
since the decision in Loyer and Blouin, doubt has been
expressed by this Court as to the wisdom of using the acquittal procedure for
this purpose.  In Hammerling v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R.
905 [hereinafter Hammerling], the Court held that the Manitoba
Court of Appeal had properly allowed the accused's appeal from convictions on
seven counts of theft by reason of the application of the rule against multiple
convictions and that the Crown was entitled in the same case to appeal
acquittals from nine counts of criminal breach of trust and that convictions
could be entered on those charges.  In a concurring opinion, Lamer J.
anticipated the difficulties which could arise from the use of the procedure
set out in Loyer and Blouin and the consequent
requirement for formal appeals from acquittals entered solely by reason of the
rule against multiple convictions.  He stated at pp. 910-11:

 

    But, as regards the future, this Court's decision in Kienapple
v.  The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, should be reconsidered and
modified to the following extent:  whenever a court is of the view that the
principles laid down in Kienapple should be applied, the court should
enter a stay of the proceedings, in the stead of entering the acquittal.

 

    This
way of proceeding has two advantages.  First, it avoids situations such as that
which we are facing in the present case where a Court of Appeal is being
ordered to reconsider an acquittal though no appeal was taken from that
decision, and understandably so.  But, secondly, the more fundamental reason is
that, whilst a person should not be convicted more than once for essentially
the same conduct, such a principle does not of necessity have as a corollary,
when multiple charges are laid and a conviction entered on one of them, his
right to an acquittal on all others.  A stay fully accommodates the policy
consideration underlining this Court's decision in Kienapple whilst
avoiding entering an acquittal notwithstanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt
of conduct that constitutes guilt of a crime.

 

    In
the subsequent case of Terlecki, supra, the
Court unanimously upheld the Alberta Court of Appeal (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 522,
to the effect that, when a court of appeal allows an appeal on one offence, it
can then make an order in relation to other charges that had been conditionally
stayed by reason of Kienapple notwithstanding that there had been
no Crown appeal with respect to the stayed charges.  In Terlecki the
trial judge had found the accused guilty of both impaired driving and driving
with a blood alcohol level over 80mg/100ml but had entered a conviction only on
the ""over 80"" offence because of Kienapple.  The
trial judge declined to enter a conviction on the impaired driving charge.  The
accused's appeal on the ""over 80"" charge was allowed because of a
problem with the breathalyzer certificate. The accused submitted that, once
this was done, the trial judge's refusal to enter a conviction on the impaired
driving charge could not be disturbed absent an appeal by the Crown.  The Court
of Appeal agreed that as a general rule a disposition could not be disturbed
when no appeal was taken but stated at p. 529:

 

But the
situation created by the rule in Kienapple, supra,
affords a fit occasion for an exception to the general rule and s. 613(8)
authorizes this sensible approach.

 

The
Court of Appeal noted Lamer J.'s comment in Hammerling that it
was perfectly understandable for the Crown not to appeal the refusal to convict
on the impaired driving charge when it had no reason to appeal unless the
conviction on the other offence arising from the same delict was overturned. 
In Terlecki the Court of Appeal decided it would be appropriate to
return the matter to the summary convictions appeal court to decide whether to
enter a conviction on the impaired driving count even though there had been no
formal appeal on that matter.  This Court dismissed the accused's appeal, the
Chief Justice stating at pp. 483-84:

 

We find
no error in the Court of Appeal in construing the trial judge's not registering
a conviction on the count of impaired driving under s. 234  of the Criminal Code  as
equivalent to entering a stay on the charge.  We differ from the Court of
Appeal only in that we would return the matter back to Stevenson Prov. Ct. J.
rather than Moshansky J., the Appeal Court Judge, to consider whether to
register a conviction on the s. 234  charge and if so, to impose sentence.

 

    In
my view, this Court implicitly approved in Terlecki the use
of conditional stays of charges in which convictions are barred by the rule
against multiple convictions as outlined by Lamer J. in Hammerling as a
preferable route to the use of acquittals suggested in Loyer and
Blouin.  I emphasize that the stay is conditional on the final
disposition of the charge on which the accused has been convicted.  As the
Court of Appeal explained in Terlecki at p. 529:

 

We say a
conditional stay for the condition should be that the stay is only for the
period until the charge on which the accused has been found guilty is finally
disposed of on appeal or by the expiration of time for appeal.

 

If the
accused's appeal from the conviction arising from the same delict is eventually
dismissed or the accused does not appeal within the specified times, then the
conditional stay becomes a permanent stay and in accordance with this Court's
judgment in R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
128, that stay becomes tantamount to a judgment or verdict of acquittal for the
purpose of an appeal or a plea of autrefois acquit.  If,
on the other hand as is the case here, the accused's appeal from the conviction
is successful, the conditional stay dissolves and the appellate courts, while
allowing the appeal, can make an order remitting to the trial judge the count
or counts which were conditionally stayed by reason of the application of the
rule against multiple convictions notwithstanding that no appeal was taken from
the conditionally stayed counts.  This case makes clear the practical
advantages of the use of conditional stays.  It is, as Lamer J. pointed out in Hammerling and the
Alberta Court of Appeal echoed in Terlecki, quite
understandable that the Crown would not launch a cross-appeal from an acquittal
arising from what, in its view, may very well be a perfectly correct
application of the Kienapple principle.  It is only if and when
the conviction for the other offence arising from the same delict is upset that
such an appeal becomes appropriate and necessary.  The conditional stay
procedure gives the appellate court the flexibility to remit the other offence
to the trial judge should the need arise and avoids the necessity of filing
appeals on some kind of contingency basis.

 

    In
addition to these practical advantages the use of a conditional stay of
proceedings as opposed to an acquittal more accurately reflects the policy
reasons which preclude the registering of a conviction.  The accused who would
be guilty of an offence except for the application of the rule against multiple
convictions is not, in my view, deserving of an acquittal in the true sense
that the state had not met its burden of proving the elements of the offence. 
If, as is the case here, the trial court pursues the preferable and safe course
of making findings on all the counts charged, it will be clear that all the
elements of the offence have been proved against the accused even if the
registering of a conviction is barred for the policy reasons underlying the Kienapple
principle.  The policy considerations here are analogous to those which apply
when proceedings against an accused are stayed because of entrapment.  They are
concerned with the integrity and fairness of the administration of justice
rather than with the culpability of the accused.  In R. v. Mack, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 972, this Court noted that entry of a stay of proceedings
would only be appropriate after the trier of fact determined that the accused
was not entitled to an outright acquittal.  Similarly, once an accused's appeal
from the conviction arising from the same delict has been dismissed or the
accused's time to appeal that conviction has run out, it would be preferable that
a permanent stay be recorded on the ""Kienappled"" offence to reflect
that reasons of policy and not the accused's lack of culpability account for
the refusal to enter a conviction.  The trial judge should determine whether
the accused is entitled to an acquittal before the independent policies of
either the rule against entrapment or the rule against multiple convictions is
applied.

 

    (b)  The
Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal

 

    My
conclusion that the preferable procedure for both practical and policy reasons
is for the trial judge to enter a conditional stay rather than an acquittal
under Kienapple does not settle the question of the Court of Appeal's
jurisdiction in this case.

 

    The
Court of Appeal, in entering the conviction on the sexual assault charge after
it had allowed the appeal from the incest charge, purported to exercise its
power under s. 613(3)  to substitute the verdict that should have been found and
remit the matter to the trial court for sentencing.  The problem with its
approach is that the Court of Appeal's power to substitute the verdict that
should have been found only arises when it dismisses an appeal under s. 613(1) (b)(i). 
In this case the appellant's appeal on the incest charge was not dismissed; it
was allowed because of a doubt as to whether all the elements of that offence
had been made out.  The Court of Appeal supported the exercise of its power
under s. 613(3)  with the following conclusion at p. 214:

 

    In
the result, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction, but substitute a
verdict of guilty of sexual assault.

 

This, in
my respectful view, puts the cart before the horse in the sense that the
substituted verdict of a conviction for sexual assault has determined the
Court's decision as to whether the appeal of the conviction for incest should
be dismissed or allowed.  The proper course was clearly for the Court of Appeal
to decide first whether the appellant's appeal of his conviction for incest
should be allowed or dismissed.  That decision would then determine the court's
jurisdiction to deal with the acquittal of sexual assault.

 

    My
conclusion that the entry of a conviction on the sexual assault charge cannot
be supported as an exercise of the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction under s.
613(3)  of the Criminal Code  does not exhaust
the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in this case.  The Court of Appeal
exercised its jurisdiction under s. 613(1) of the Code to
allow the appeal from the incest conviction on the ground that it could not be
supported by the evidence, quashed the conviction and directed the entry of a
verdict of acquittal under s. 613(2) .  In exercising its power under s. 613(2) 
the Court of Appeal is given a broad ancillary jurisdiction under s. 613(8) of
the Code to make ""any order, in addition, that justice requires"". 
This Court has construed the powers granted to the Court of Appeal under s.
613(8)  in a generous manner consistent with its broad remedial purposes.  For
example in Elliott v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R.
393, the Court held that the section authorized the Court of Appeal, when
ordering a new trial under s. 613(4)(b) of the Code, to
amend a count of the indictment.  The Court rejected the accused's argument
that, because the order for a new trial could not have been made unless the
indictment was amended, the amendment was not ""in addition"" to the
Court of Appeal's exercise of its power to order a new trial.  Justice Ritchie
stated at pp. 431-32:

 

    It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the
order for a new trial could not have been made unless the amendment had been
granted and that the amendment was therefore not an order ""in
addition"" to the exercise of the court's power under subs. (4)(b)(i),
but rather that it was a prerequisite to the granting of a new trial.

 

    In
my view when Parliament authorized the Court of Appeal, in the exercise of its
power, to order a new trial, to ""make any order, in addition, which
justice requires"" it must be taken as having authorized that Court under
those circumstances to make any additional order which the ends of
justice require whether the order for a new trial is dependent upon the
additional order or not.  I do not think that the wide powers conferred on the
Court of appeal by s. 613(8) are to be narrowly construed but rather that they
are designed to ensure that the requirements of the ends of justice are met,
and are to be liberally construed in light of that overriding consideration.

 

I note
that in his dissent in the Court of Appeal O'Sullivan J.A. adopted the
following statement of Goddard L.C.J. in R. v. Seymour (1954),
38 Cr. App. R. 68, at p. 69, as a guide for interpreting the Court of Appeal's
appellate jurisdiction under s. 613  of the Criminal Code :

 

That he
was a guilty man...there is no doubt, but a prisoner is always entitled to the
benefit of a technical point if he can find one.

 

    If
by the invocation of this authority O'Sullivan J.A. meant to suggest that the Criminal
Code  should be given a technical construction in order to
benefit the accused, then I must respectfully disagree.  This Court in R. v. Paré, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 618 [hereinafter Paré] has rejected overly technical or
narrow constructions of criminal law statutes in order to benefit the accused. 
In Paré the Court refused to read the words ""while
committing"" in the then s. 214(5) of the Code (now s.
231(5) ) so as to require that the murder and the underlying offence occur
simultaneously even though such a narrow construction was grammatically
possible and would benefit the accused.  If there is an ambiguity in the
statute, only reasonable alternatives should be adopted regardless of whether a
narrow but unreasonable construction would work to the accused's benefit. 
There is, in my respectful view, no reasonable alternative to a broad reading
of the Court of Appeal's ancillary jurisdiction under s. 613(8)  given its broad
wording and remedial purpose.  The section gives the Court of Appeal a broad
supplementary power to make any order that justice requires when it exercises
its appellate powers under the enumerated subsections of s. 613 .

 

    A
liberal construction of the Court of Appeal's powers under s. 613(8) is also
required in order to give effect to the conditional stay procedure adopted by
the Court in Terlecki.  For example, when an appeal is
allowed under s. 613(2) the Court of Appeal will use its powers under s. 613(8)
to remit to the trial judge the offence which was conditionally stayed by
virtue of Kienapple and which in most cases will not be
the subject of a separate appeal.

 

    It
is, of course, true that as a general rule a Court of Appeal cannot disturb a
verdict of acquittal unless there has been an appeal by the Crown from that
acquittal:  see Rickard v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R.
1022; Guillemette v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 356.  Nevertheless,
it has been expressly recognized by the Alberta Court of Appeal, and certainly
implicitly by this Court in Terlecki, that in the particular context of Kienapple there
should be an exception to the general proposition in order to accommodate the
special relationship between offences which arise out of the same delict and
are subject to special treatment under the rule against multiple convictions. 
I note that this Court made it clear in R. v. Prince, [1986]
2 S.C.R. 480, that, for the Kienapple principle to apply, there must be a
proximate factual and legal nexus between the different offences.  It would be
my view that this is a case in which the general rule requiring an appeal
should give way to the exception and that the appellant's acquittal on the
sexual assault charge could properly be considered by the Court of Appeal in
the absence of an appeal by the Crown.

 

    For
the same reasons concerning the special relationship between the offences, I
would reject the argument that dealing with the acquittal on the sexual assault
charge under s. 613(8) constituted an impermissible collateral attack on that
verdict as prohibited by this Court's decision in Wilson v. The Queen, [1983]
2 S.C.R. 594.  In this case the verdict of acquittal of sexual assault was
prompted solely by the application of Kienapple to the
incest conviction.  Once the incest conviction was challenged, the sexual
assault acquittal was also in doubt.  In the particular context of the rule
against multiple convictions the attack on the sexual assault verdict cannot be
said to be ""collateral"" to the disposition of the incest charge.  The
two counts arose from the same delict and were inextricably tied together by
the Kienapple principle.

 

    Having
allowed the appeal on the incest charge under s. 613(2), the Court of Appeal
could in this case exercise its supplementary powers under s. 613(8) to deal
with the sexual assault charge.  In this case the Court of Appeal decided to
enter a conviction on the sexual assault charge given the clear finding of the
trial judge that all the elements of the sexual assault offence had been
established and the fact that the appeal of the incest conviction was allowed
because of a doubt as to the element of penetration which was not an element of
the sexual assault charge.  In my view, it would have been more appropriate for
the Court of Appeal to have remitted the matter back to the trial judge to
register a conviction on the sexual assault charge and sentence the appellant
for that offence.  This is a preferable route to the Court of Appeal or this
Court itself entering the conviction in that it preserves the appellant's right
to launch an appeal from the sexual assault conviction if he so desires.  Under
section 623(1) of the Criminal Code  this Court may
make any order that the Court of Appeal might have made under its broad powers
under s. 613(8) .   Accordingly, I would remit the matter back to the trial
judge for the entry of a conviction on the sexual assault charge and the
imposition of sentence on that conviction.  The appellant, in my view, suffers
no unfairness in this procedure since the trial judge came to the clear
conclusion that he was guilty of sexual assault and refused to enter a
conviction for that offence only because of the rule against multiple
convictions.   I am also mindful that a new trial should be avoided if possible
given the tender years of the victim and the trauma involved in testifying all
over again.

 

    I
should note by way of addendum that in this case, unlike the case of R. v.
Pringle, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1645 [hereinafter Pringle] only
two charges were laid against the appellant, incest and sexual assault.  This
distinguishes the present case, as far as the appropriate relief is concerned,
from Pringle in which there were four counts against the accused and
it was necessary therefore to remit the matter back to the trial judge, not to
enter convictions on the other counts, but to determine on which of the other
counts to enter convictions.

 

5.  Disposition

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal and remit the matter of the sexual assault charge back

    The
appellant was charged with two counts of sexual assault arising out of separate
incidents in July 1985.  The appellant allegedly fondled the breasts of his
daughter, the complainant, while on an excursion and, the same day, molested
her in his apartment.  Approximately three weeks later, the appellant allegedly
fondled the complainant's vagina through her clothing.  The appellant and his
wife had separated after she discovered him in bed with the complainant on May
30, 1981.  No sexual assault occurred on that date.  They subsequently divorced
and the complainant stayed with her mother but the appellant was allowed ample
access.  At trial, a voir dire was held to determine the
admissibility of alleged previous acts of sexual misconduct by the appellant
against the complainant.  The Crown wished to present the complainant's
allegations of numerous incidents of sexual fondling and intercourse from
December 1978 to May 1981, and further incidents of sexual touching in December
1983 and in the spring of 1985.  The appellant had faced several charges,
including incest, arising from the incidents alleged prior to May 1981, but the
Crown had entered a stay of proceedings in 1982 on all of the charges.  Defence
counsel did not object to the admission of the allegations of the incidents on
May 30, 1981, in December 1983 and in the spring of 1985.  The trial judge
excluded the evidence of the alleged incidents prior to May 30, 1981 due to an
insufficient logical connection between this evidence and the July 1985
incidents.  Even if it was relevant, the probative value of the similar fact
evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect to the appellant.  He added,
however, that the evidence could become relevant as a result of questions asked
in cross‑examination of Crown witnesses.

 

    During
the cross‑examination of the complainant's mother by defence counsel, the
witness made an unsolicited response in which she mentioned the incest charge
against the appellant.  In order to minimize the damage, defence counsel cross‑examined
further on the events surrounding that charge.  Following an adjournment, the
trial judge dismissed defence counsel's motion for a mistrial.  The trial judge
found that the cross‑examination would leave the jury with the erroneous
impression that the incest charge arose out of the events of May 30, 1981 and
was stayed because the complainant's allegation against the appellant was
false.  He then ruled that the allegations of sexual misconduct prior to May
30, 1981 were admissible to correct that erroneous impression.  In his charge,
the trial judge warned the jury on numerous occasions that the appellant was
not on trial for incest, nor was he on trial for events occurring prior to July
1985.  The evidence of the alleged incidents prior to July 1985 was simply
background.  The appellant was subsequently convicted and the Court of Appeal affirmed
the conviction.

 

    Held
(L'Heureux‑Dubé J. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and a new
trial ordered.

 

    Per
McIntyre, Lamer, Wilson and Sopinka JJ.:  The trial judge was correct to
exclude the evidence of the sexual incidents alleged to have occurred between
December 1978 and May 1981.  The evidence from this period showed that the
complainant was the object of the appellant's alleged acts and that his
misconduct was considerably more serious than the misconduct alleged in the
charge.  It was logically connected to the present charge against the appellant
but its probative force was insufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect. 
No evidence other than the complainant's testimony was adduced to prove the
offences in the present charge and the similar fact evidence bore nearly the
entire burden of proving the Crown's case against the appellant on the acts
charged.

 

    The
two incidents of alleged misconduct in December 1983 and in the spring of 1985
were properly admitted as similar fact evidence.  These incidents were similar
to and more proximate in time to those forming the basis of the present
charge.  The probative value of this evidence was not outweighed by its
prejudicial effect.

 

    The
trial judge erred, however, in admitting the evidence of the alleged sexual
misconduct between 1978 and May 1981 following the cross‑examination of
the complainant's mother.  The evidence had not changed its character and
remained evidence of alleged prior sexual misconduct which could only be
admitted if it satisfied the similar fact evidence rule.  While the evidence
had acquired some relevance for correcting the false impression being left in
the minds of the jury, this added relevance did not diminish the prejudicial
effect of that evidence.  Thus, the unfortunate situation created by the cross‑examination
did not alter the balance sufficiently to render the evidence admissible.  If
the trial judge was of the view that an immediate caution to the jury to
disregard the evidence was insufficient to ensure a fair trial, then his course
was to direct a mistrial rather than admit the evidence of similar acts which
had previously been excluded.  Since the trial judge erred in admitting this
evidence, the trial judge's charge need not be considered in relation to that
evidence.

 

    The
trial judge's charge was inadequate in respect of the evidence of alleged
incidents of sexual misconduct in December 1983 and in the spring of 1985. 
While the trial judge warned the jury on numerous occasions that the appellant
was not on trial for the alleged prior misconduct, but only for the alleged
incidents of July 1985, he did not charge the jury in a manner that would
minimize as far as possible the dangers inherent in the admission of similar
fact evidence.  The jury should be instructed that if it accepts the evidence
of the similar acts, that evidence is relevant for the limited purpose for
which it was admitted.  The jury must be specifically warned that it is not to
rely on the evidence as proof that the accused is the sort of person who would
commit the offence charged and on that basis infer that the accused is, in
fact, guilty of the offence charged.  Here, the trial judge gave the jury no
such warning.  The similar fact evidence was treated simply as part of the
whole body of evidence on which the jury was to determine innocence or guilt.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé J. (dissenting):  The application of the similar facts
rule requires a balancing of factors and involves an exercise of discretion on
the part of the trial judge who must assess both the probative value and the
possible prejudicial effect of the evidence in the circumstances of the case
before him.  Here, the trial judge could have validly admitted the evidence
from the outset.  The probative force of the evidence outweighed the
prejudicial effect upon the appellant.  In determining whether a father has
sexually assaulted his daughter, it is particularly relevant to know whether
such behaviour is part of a long‑standing pattern of abuse.

 

    In
any event, the trial judge properly admitted the evidence of the sexual
incidents prior to May 1981 following the defence counsel's attack on the
victim's credibility ‑‑ the Crown's chief witness.  The evidence
was admitted not as evidence of ""similar fact"", but rather for the
purpose of establishing the victim's credibility.  When the victim's
credibility is attacked by defence counsel, the victim should not be denied
recourse to evidence which effectively rebuts the negative aspersions cast upon
her testimony, her character or her motives.

 

    Since
the evidence was not admitted as similar fact evidence, the charge to the jury
did not have to deal directly with the special problems relating to similar
fact.  However, even if it were to be considered as similar fact evidence, the
charge to the jury was not defective.  The trial judge cannot be expected to
completely eradicate any prejudicial effect created by such evidence but he
must, in his charge, carefully direct the jury as to the proper use of the
evidence and the circumstances in which it may be taken into consideration.  In
the case at bar, the trial judge's charge contains numerous and repeated
warnings concerning the proper use of the evidence of prior incidents.

    The
judgment of McIntyre, Lamer, Wilson and Sopinka JJ. was delivered by

 

    SOPINKA J. --
This appeal from a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal comes before
this Court as of right.  The Court of Appeal, McLachlin J.A. (as she then was)
dissenting, upheld the conviction of the appellant.  The appellant had been
tried before a judge and jury and found guilty on two counts of sexual
assault.  The acts of sexual assault were alleged to have been committed by the
appellant against his daughter, G.D.  The issue in this appeal concerns the
admissibility of evidence of alleged previous acts of sexual misconduct by the
appellant against his daughter.

 

Facts

 

    The
two counts of sexual assault against the appellant arose out of separate
incidents in July 1985.  The complainant, G.D., testified that on July 1, the
appellant fondled her breasts while on an excursion to a park and later that
same day, molested her in his apartment.  Approximately three weeks later,
again in his apartment, the appellant is alleged to have fondled her vagina
through her clothing.  The complainant had her 17th birthday shortly before
this incident.  She had been living with her mother, E.D., and two younger
sisters since the appellant left the matrimonial home on May 30, 1981.  On that
date, E.D. discovered the appellant in bed with the complainant.  At trial, it
was common ground that no sexual assault occurred on that date.  The appellant
denied all allegations of sexual misconduct.

 

    Shortly
after the commencement of the trial, a voir dire was
held to determine the admissibility of evidence of alleged previous acts of
sexual misconduct by the appellant against the complainant.  The Crown wished
to present the complainant's allegations of numerous incidents of sexual
fondling and intercourse from December 1978 to May 1981, and further incidents
of sexual touching in December 1983 and spring 1985.  The appellant had faced
several charges, including incest, arising from the incidents alleged prior to
May 1981, however in 1982, the Crown had entered a stay of proceedings on all
of these charges.  The Crown also wished to adduce evidence of a June 1981
medical examination of the complainant.  Counsel for the defence did not object
to the admission of the allegations of incidents in December 1983 and spring
1985, nor to the evidence of the events on May 30, 1981.  Defence counsel did
object, however, to the admission of the evidence of incidents alleged to have
occurred prior to May 1981, and the medical evidence.    

 

    The
trial judge ruled that the evidence of the alleged incidents prior to May 30,
1981 should be excluded.  Low Co. Ct. J. was of the opinion that there was an
insufficient logical connection between this evidence and the July 1985
incidents which gave rise to the charges before him.  Even if the evidence of
the alleged incidents prior to May 30, 1981 were relevant to the present
charges, its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  In
making this ruling, Low Co. Ct. J. warned that the excluded evidence might
become admissible as a result of questions asked in cross-examination of Crown
witnesses, or as a result of defence evidence.  The medical evidence was
excluded as not relevant.

 

    The
trial resumed with E.D. testifying as a witness for the Crown.  In
cross-examination, defence counsel posed numerous probing questions about the
state of family relations both prior to and after May 30, 1981.  When defence
counsel suggested that E.D. attempted to extract money from the appellant's
mother in the summer of 1981, the following exchange took place:

 

WitnessI don't believe so.  I remember getting into an
argument with her about money, but I don't believe I specifically asked her for
money.

 

CounselAnd did you not, in the course of that argument
over money, in the summer of 1981 --

 

WitnessAnd
it must have been later than the summer, because I had to be subpoenaed to go
to Court on charges of incest against [L.E.D.]

 

Following
this unexpected response, defence counsel did not move that the proceedings be
declared a mistrial; instead, counsel cross-examined further on the events
surrounding the incest charge in order to minimize the damage caused.  Before
this Court, counsel for the appellant agreed that this questioning simply
exacerbated an unfortunate situation.

 

    Following
an adjournment, defence counsel did move for a mistrial.  The trial judge
refused this motion since, in his opinion, the situation was created by the
defence.  He found that defence counsel's cross-examination would leave the
jury with the erroneous impression that the incest charge arose out of the
events of May 30, 1981 and was stayed because the complainant's allegation
against her father was false.  Low Co. Ct. J. then ruled that the complainant's
allegations of acts of sexual misconduct by the appellant prior to May 30, 1981
were admissible in order to correct that erroneous impression, and to allow the
complainant ""to tell her entire story"".  He did not, however, change
his ruling as to the medical evidence.

 

    Although
the trial judge told the jury that he would advise them as to what use they
could make of the evidence, the appellant submits that he failed to do so.  In
his charge to the jury, Low Co. Ct. J. reviewed in considerable detail each of
the previous acts of sexual misconduct alleged.  His direction to the jury as
to these allegations consisted of a number of warnings that the appellant was
only charged with the acts alleged to have occurred in July 1985 and that
previous acts alleged were simply ""background"".

 

Court of
Appeal

 

    Speaking
for a majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (1987), 20 B.C.L.R. (2d)
384, Hinkson J.A. was not persuaded that the trial judge proceeded on a
wrong principle or made the wrong decision in failing to declare a mistrial. 
Furthermore, Hinkson J.A. found no error in the trial judge's charge to
the jury.  In his opinion, the warnings about the use of the evidence were
adequate.  The trial judge had admitted the excluded evidence after it was
raised in cross-examination because it had become relevant and necessary to the
unfolding of the narrative.  There was thus no need for the trial judge to
charge the jury that the evidence was admissible to show a guilty sexual
passion by the appellant for the complainant.  In Hinkson J.A.'s view, the
allegations of acts of sexual misconduct prior to May 30, 1981 were relevant
and admissible as similar fact evidence from the outset.

 

    McLachlin
J.A. dissented.  In her view, the trial judge was correct in his initial
decision not to admit the alleged prior misconduct as similar fact evidence. 
The probative value of the evidence was tenuous, while its potential for
prejudice was great.  His subsequent decision to admit the evidence to rebut
the inference which arose on cross-examination violated the rule prohibiting
rebuttal evidence on a collateral point.

 

    In
the event that the evidence was admissible under the similar facts rule, McLachlin J.A.
maintained that the charge to the jury was inadequate.  Telling the jury that
allegations of prior sexual misconduct were ""background"" was
insufficient in view of the special dangers attending similar fact evidence. 
The jury was not instructed as to the limited purpose for which such evidence
could be used, nor that the evidence should be disregarded if it did not meet
that purpose.

 

Issues

 

    The
submissions of the parties pose three questions to be answered by this Court:

(1)was the evidence of alleged prior acts of sexual
misconduct by the appellant against the complainant admissible in these
proceedings;

(2)if the evidence was not admissible, what was the
effect of it being raised in the cross-examination of E.D.; and

(3)if the evidence was admissible, was the charge to the
jury adequate.

 

Admissibility
of Evidence

 

    The
evidence which the Crown wished to have admitted at the voir dire was
evidence of alleged discreditable, even criminal, acts by the appellant against
the complainant prior to July 1985.  As such, it could only be admitted if it
met the criteria of ""similar fact"" evidence.

 

    What
is generally labelled the ""similar facts rule"" is, in fact a rule and
an exception to a rule.  The admission of similar facts is an exception to the
rule excluding evidence which, though relevant, is adduced solely to show that
the accused is the sort of person who would be likely to have committed the
offence (Morris v. The Queen, [1983]
2 S.C.R. 190, at pp. 201-2). This exclusionary rule is itself an exception
to the general principle that all relevant evidence is admissible (R. v.
Robertson, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 918, at p. 941).  In R. v.
Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 368, this Court
recognized the link between the basis for the exclusionary rule and the ""similar
facts"" exception to that rule:

 

As
pointed out by Lamer J. in Morris v. The Queen, [1983]
2 S.C.R. 190, this rule of exclusion evolved as a result of the repeated
exercise of a judicial discretion excluding such evidence because its probative
value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect (p. 201).  In considering
whether an exception should be made, regard must be had for the underlying
rationale of the exclusionary rule: does the prejudicial effect of the evidence
outweigh its probative value?  An exception should be made if the scales tip in
favour of probative value.

 

Cross on
Evidence (6th ed. 1985) contains a concise statement of the
""similar facts rule"" at p. 311 with which I agree:

 

...
evidence of the character or of the misconduct of the accused on other
occasions ... tendered to show his bad disposition, is inadmissible unless it
is so highly probative of the issues in the case as to outweigh the prejudice
it may cause.

 

    The
rule was subjected to a careful analysis by the House of Lords in Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Boardman, [1975] A.C. 421.  Lord Hailsham
explained the rule as follows, at p. 453:

 

It is
perhaps helpful to remind oneself that what is not to be
admitted is a chain of reasoning and not necessarily a state of facts.  If the
inadmissible chain of reasoning is the only purpose
for which the evidence is adduced as a matter of law, the evidence itself is
not admissible.  If there is some other relevant, probative purpose than for
the forbidden type of reasoning, the evidence is admitted, but should be made
subject to a warning from the judge that the jury must eschew the forbidden
reasoning.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

    Following
the decision in Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales, [1894]
A.C. 57 (P.C.), the seminal case on the point, the courts tended to create
categories of cases under which types of similar act evidence ought to be
admitted.  These categories are generally based on the purpose for which the
evidence was adduced, such as ""to prove a system"" or ""to rebut
the defence of innocent association"".  These categories, however, are not
to be taken as exhaustive.  Nor do they provide an ""automatic ticket""
of admissibility.  They are no more than illustrations of the application of
the rule (Sweitzer v. The Queen, [1982]
1 S.C.R. 949, at pp. 952-53, and Boardman, supra).

 

    The
process of reasoning therefore is to determine whether the evidence of similar
acts has probative value in relation to a fact in issue, other than its
tendency to lead to the conclusion that the accused is guilty because of the
disposition to commit certain types of wrongful acts.  If the evidence has such
probative value, the court must then determine whether its probative value is
sufficient to justify its admissibility, notwithstanding the prejudicial
tendency of such evidence.

 

    Before
this Court, the respondent relied on the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Ball, [1911]
A.C. 47, for the proposition that evidence adduced to show a ""guilty
passion"" is admissible as similar facts.  This decision has been followed
for this proposition on numerous occasions in Canada (see, for example, R. v.
Pegelo, [1934] 2 D.L.R. 798 (B.C.C.A.); R. v.
Thompson (1954), 110 C.C.C. 95 (B.C.C.A.); R. v.
Williams (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 453 (Ont. C.A.); and G. v. R., [1977]
C.A. 130).   In light of Boardman and Sweitzer, Ball can no
longer stand for the general proposition that evidence of this kind will
automatically be admitted.  I turn now to consider whether the decision in Ball can
offer any support to the respondent's position.

 

    In Ball, a
brother and sister were charged under the newly enacted Punishment
of Incest Act, 1908 with having had carnal knowledge of each other during
two periods in 1910.  The evidence of the police who had observed the Balls'
house over a two-week period was that the two accused were seen entering and
leaving the house; figures were observed in the front bedroom; and a
conversation between a man and a woman was overhead coming from that bedroom. 
When the police called on the house late one evening, they found the sister in
her nightdress and the brother coming out of the front bedroom fastening his
trousers.  The police observed that the front bedroom had a double bed which
bore signs of having been occupied by two people, and that the only other
bedroom in the house was clearly not in use.  In addition to this
circumstantial evidence, the prosecution was permitted to adduce evidence that
before incest had become unlawful, the two accused had rented and lived in a
house as man and wife, and that the sister had given birth to a child which was
registered as the daughter of the two accused.  The accused denied that any
sexual relations had taken place.

 

    In
upholding the admissibility of the evidence of prior relations between the
accused,  Lord Loreburn L.C. noted that the circumstantial evidence adduced to
establish the opportunity for the offence, was ""very suggestive of
incest"" (p. 71).  The object of the ""similar fact"" evidence was
to establish that the proper inference to be drawn from the accused occupying
the same bedroom and bed was an inference of guilt.  Lord Loreburn L.C.
concluded (at p. 71):

 

...I consider that this evidence was clearly admissible
on the issue that this crime was committed -- not to prove the mens rea, as
Darling J. considered, but to establish the guilty relations between the
parties and the existence of a sexual passion between them as elements in
proving that they had illicit connection in fact on or between the dates
charged.

 

    In Ball, the
""similar fact"" evidence showed the propensity of the accused to
commit incest.  In fact, I think it may be said that in all cases in which
evidence of prior misconduct is adduced, that evidence to some degree goes to a
propensity or disposition of the accused.  That, however, cannot be its sole
characteristic if it is to be admitted under the similar facts rule.

 

    The
probative value of similar fact evidence must also be measured in relation to
the other evidence adduced in the case.  In Ball, there
existed a significant body of circumstantial evidence pointing to the guilt of
the accused.  That this evidence alone was not considered sufficient seems in
part to have been a function of the era; as Lord Alverstone C.J. commented at
p. 66:

 

In the
administration of this Act there is an additional reason which enforces what
you have said, namely in the case of poor people in crowded dwellings.  It is
sometimes impossible for them to avoid sleeping together, and it would be wrong
to assume in some cases that there must have been incestuous intercourse
because persons of different sexes were in the same bed.

 

The
value of the similar fact evidence was that it dispelled any doubt that the
accused were sharing a bed for the purpose of having sexual relations.  It has
been rightly suggested that if the facts in Ball, supra, had
been that there were two bedrooms in use, the evidence of previous acts of
incest would not have been admitted.  (See Hoffmann, ""Similar Facts After Boardman""
(1975), 91 L.Q.R. 193, at p. 202).

 

    Given
the strength of the probative value of the ""similar fact"" evidence in Ball, the
prejudicial effect inherent in evidence of prior misconduct was outweighed. 
The prosecution was not attempting to adduce evidence of past misconduct which
was more serious than that alleged in the charge facing the accused, nor was it
reaching far into the past to find these ""bad acts"".  In all the
circumstances in Ball, the evidence was admissible as
similar fact evidence.

 

    I
turn now to the application of the foregoing to the present appeal.  In the voir dire, the
trial judge excluded the evidence of the incidents of sexual fondling and
sexual intercourse which the complainant alleged occurred from December 1978 to
May 1981.  As in Ball, the evidence from this period showed
that this particular complainant was the object of the appellant's alleged
acts.  It was, therefore, logically connected to the present charge against the
appellant.  The trial judge concluded that its probative force was insufficient
to outweigh its prejudicial effect.  As McLachlin J.A. noted (at p. 399):

 

The
evidence, if accepted, showed that the accused had engaged in repeated and
persistent sexual conduct with the complainant, including sexual intercourse,
when she was a child -- conduct considerably more serious and revolting than
the fondling alleged in the counts charged.

 

No
misconduct as serious as this was alleged to have occurred after May 1981.  No
evidence other than the complainant's testimony was adduced to prove the
offences in the present charge.  Evidence other than that of the complainant is
not essential in every case before similar acts are admissible.  In the present
case, however, the similar fact evidence bore nearly the entire burden of
proving the Crown's case against the appellant on the acts charged.  The trial
judge was thus correct in not admitting this evidence.  Its probative value was
not sufficient to overcome its prejudicial effect.  Low Co. Ct. J. was also
correct in not admitting the medical evidence since it was not relevant to the
offences in the charge.

 

    The
trial judge did admit other ""similar fact"" evidence: the alleged
incidents of sexual touching in December 1983 and spring 1985.  Defence counsel
did not object to the admission of this evidence.  This evidence related to
alleged sexual fondling of the complainant by the appellant similar to that
alleged to have occurred in July 1985; this previous misconduct was not more
serious than that with which the appellant was charged.  As well, these
incidents were more proximate in time to those forming the basis of the present
charge.  The probative value of this evidence was not outweighed by its
prejudicial effect and thus these two incidents of alleged misconduct were
admissible as similar fact evidence.

 

Effect
of Cross-Examination

 

    Following
the cross-examination of E.D., the trial judge admitted the evidence of alleged
sexual misconduct by the appellant against the complainant from December 1978
to May 1981: evidence which he had previously ruled inadmissible as similar
fact evidence due in part to its prejudicial effect.  Low Co. Ct. J. admitted
the evidence to clarify the narrative; in the charge to the jury, he called the
evidence ""background"".  The evidence, however, had not changed its character;
it remained evidence of alleged prior sexual misconduct which could only be
admitted if it satisfied the similar fact evidence rule.  To satisfy this rule,
the cross-examination must be found to have altered the balance to such an
extent that the prejudicial effect of the evidence no longer outweighed its
probative value.  I do not think that the unfortunate situation created by the
cross-examination had this effect.

 

     In Robertson, a case
of sexual assault, the evidence to which the accused objected was that given by
the complainant's roommate to the effect that the accused had also made a
physical approach towards her.  In striking the balance required by the similar
facts rule, Wilson J. found that the roommate's testimony was highly relevant
since ""...[i]t provides the background for the circumstances in which the
assault occurred"" (p. 943).  Wilson J. also considered the other
purposes of the evidence in assessing its probative value, and then balanced
this probative value against the prejudicial effect.  Robertson makes
clear that evidence which clarifies the narrative or provides a background for
understanding events may have probative value as similar fact evidence.  The
use of the term ""background"" was merely a succinct method of
describing the relevance of the evidence in that case.  Similar fact evidence
may very well achieve sufficient relevance if its admission is vital to the
understanding of other evidence in the case.  Whether that evidence is admitted
as similar fact evidence, however, depends on whether its probative value
outweighs its prejudicial effect.  It is in this sense that I understand the
use of the term ""background"" in Robertson.

 

    Following
the cross-examination of E.D. in the case at bar, the evidence of alleged
sexual misconduct from December 1978 to May 1981 had added probative value.  It
had acquired some relevance for correcting the false impression being left in
the minds of the jury.  This added relevance did not, however, diminish the
prejudicial effect of that evidence.  As I have discussed, it is the prejudice
which this evidence could cause to the appellant which is the reason it must be
excluded.  While the nature or significance of evidence may change in the
course of proceedings and the similar facts rule can take into account such
changes, in the case at bar, the balance was not altered sufficiently to render
the evidence admissible.

 

    Alternatively,
if the trial judge was of the view that the answer given by the complainant's
mother and the cross-examination would create a false impression in the minds
of the jury that would distort the proceedings, he ought to have declared a
mistrial rather than admit the similar fact evidence.  The initial answer of
the witness was unresponsive to the question although undoubtedly it was an
innocent and instinctive act.  While the cross-examination by counsel for the
accused compounded the error, and counsel for the accused is by no means
blameless, this does not relieve the trial judge of his duty to exclude
inadmissible evidence.  In R. v. Ambrose (1975),
25 C.C.C. (2d) 90 (N.B.S.C., App. Div.), aff'd [1977] 2 S.C.R. 717, a
Crown witness made an unresponsive statement on cross-examination by defence
counsel who then invited the witness to repeat the statement rather than
objecting immediately to the answer.  I agree with the following statement of
the Appeal Division, at pp. 91-92, with respect to the duty of a trial
judge:

 

    In a
criminal trial there is a duty on the trial Judge to exclude inadmissible
evidence even though adduced by counsel for the accused or not objected to, and
should inadmissible evidence be adduced, the trial Judge should either instruct
the jury immediately to disregard it or, if it is of so prejudicial a nature
that the jury would not have the capability of disregarding it, he should
discharge the jury and order a new trial: see R. v. Farrell (1909),
15 C.C.C. 283, 20 O.L.R. 182 (C.A.); R. v. Doyle (1916),
26 C.C.C. 197, 28 D.L.R. 649, 50 N.S.R. 123 (C.A.).

 

If the
trial judge was of the view that an immediate caution to the jury to disregard
the evidence was insufficient to ensure a fair trial, then his course was to
direct a mistrial rather than admit the evidence of similar acts which had
previously been excluded.

 

Charge
to the Jury

 

    As I
have found that the trial judge, after the cross-examination, erred in
admitting the originally excluded evidence of alleged sexual misconduct by the
appellant against the complainant from December 1978 to May 1981, the jury
charge need not be considered in relation to that evidence.  At the initial voir dire,
however, the trial judge did admit evidence of alleged sexual touching in
December 1983 and spring 1985 and I have found that this evidence was
admissible as similar fact evidence.  I turn therefore, to consider the adequacy
of the charge to the jury.

 

    The
inherent prejudicial effect of similar fact evidence may be felt by a jury in
three main ways (see Cross, op. cit., at pp. 326-28).  The first
is that the jury, if it accepts that the accused committed the prior ""bad
acts"", may therefore assume that the accused is a ""bad person""
who is likely to be guilty of the offence charged.   As McLachlin J.A. noted at
p. 399 in the case at bar, this assumption might raise 

 

...in
the minds of the jury sentiments of revulsion and condemnation which might well
deflect them from the rational, dispassionate analysis upon which the criminal
process should rest.

 

The
second effect on the jury might be a tendency for the jury to punish the
accused for past misconduct by finding that accused guilty of the offence
charged.  The third danger is that the jury might become confused as it
concentrates on resolving whether the accused actually committed the similar
acts.  The jury members' attention is deflected from the main purpose of their
deliberations which is the transaction charged.  Having resolved the first
matter, there is a danger that they will substitute their verdict on that
matter for their verdict on the issue which they are in fact trying.

 

    In
this case, the trial judge warned the jury on a number of occasions that the
appellant was not on trial for the prior misconduct alleged, but only for the
alleged incidents of July 1985.  This warning was, however, accompanied by a
detailed recitation of the prior misconduct alleged against the appellant.  The
warning may still have gone some way to minimize the second prejudicial effect
discussed above, but it did nothing to minimize the first and third dangers
noted.

 

    In a
case in which similar fact evidence is admitted, the trial judge should charge
the jury in a manner that will minimize as far as possible the dangers referred
to above.  The jury should be instructed that if it accepts the evidence of the
similar acts, that evidence is relevant for the limited purpose for which it
was admitted.  The jury must be specifically warned that it is not to rely on
the evidence as proof that the accused is the sort of person who would commit
the offence charged and on that basis infer that the accused is, in fact,
guilty of the offence charged.

 

    In
the instant case, the trial judge gave the jury no such warning.  The similar
fact evidence was treated simply as part of the whole body of evidence on which
the jury was to determine innocence or guilt.  The purpose of the admission of
the evidence was not identified and its use was not limited, although the trial
judge advised the jury at the time the evidence was admitted that he would give
instructions as to the use that could be made of it.  Furthermore, the jury
members were not warned that they were not to engage in the prohibited line of
reasoning to which I have referred.  I conclude, therefore, that the charge to
the jury was not adequate.

 

    Accordingly,
the appeal is allowed and a new trial directed.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé
J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    L'HEUREUX-DUBÉ J.
(dissenting) -- I must respectfully disagree with my colleague Justice
Sopinka's disposition of this appeal.

 

    The
appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his daughter, G.D., on several
occasions in July of 1985.  The assaults which were the subject of the charges
consisted of the fondling of the seventeen-year-old girl's breasts and vagina
by her father.

 

    The
incidents which formed the basis of the charges were not isolated assaults. 
The evidence presented at trial indicated that the appellant had been
repeatedly assaulting his daughter from the time she was eleven or twelve years
old.   The girl's testimony consisted of a chilling recital of sexual assaults
throughout her childhood and adolescence.

    On
May 30, 1981, when G.D. was eleven years old, her mother Mrs. D., caught the
appellant in bed with the child and demanded he leave the home.  G.D.'s parents
were subsequently divorced.  Incest charges were laid, but were dropped when
G.D. refused to discuss the assault with the police.  In her testimony in the
present case, she explained her refusal as being the result of fear, unwillingness
to hurt her father and guilt at being the cause of her parents' separation.

 

    Following
that incident, G.D. lived with her mother.  Her father, however, was allowed
ample access to the children.  The evidence indicates that the incidents of
sexual assault continued throughout the child's adolescence. In 1985, G.D. went
on a trip to Disneyland with her father, brother and uncle.  She expressed her
decision to go in the following way:

 

I wanted
. . . to go to Disneyland and another reason was `cause I thought that maybe my
father might have changed and this trip could be different and my dad could be
my dad and nothing would happen that had happened before.

 

She then
testified that in spite of her hopes, her father repeatedly sexually assaulted
her during the course of the trip.  The assaults which are the subject of this
appeal occurred shortly following this trip.

 

    The
evidence of the alleged assaults occurring prior to May 30, 1981 was initially
excluded by the trial judge on a voir dire.  He determined
that it was similar fact evidence where the prejudice to the accused outweighed
the probative value.  However, the trial judge warned counsel that he would
reconsider the admission of the evidence if the cross-examination of the
witnesses was such that the evidence became directly relevant.  He stated that:

 

    I
want to make it clear that this does not rule out the possibility that the
evidence may become relevant as a result of questions asked in
cross-examination of Crown witnesses, or as a result of defence evidence.

 

In spite
of this warning, counsel for the defence, in cross-examining the mother of the
complainant, engaged in a line of questioning which attempted to damage the
credibility of the complainant.  This was done by suggesting that the charges
were the result of family strife which began with the divorce of the parties, and
that similar charges against the accused had already been laid and dropped. 
The impression created was that there had been no substance to the previous
claims and that the current charges were simply part of a pattern of family
dispute.  The trial judge ruled that the evidence of the prior incestuous
behaviour of the accused had become relevant to the credibility of the victim,
and it was admitted into trial.  The trial judge took care to explain to the
jury that the accused was not on trial for incest, nor was he on trial for
events occurring prior to the laying of charges.

 

    The
majority of the Court of Appeal (1987), 20 B.C.L.R. (2d) 384 held that the
evidence had been relevant from the outset, and that, if anything, the trial
judge had erred in excluding it initially on the voir dire.  They
further found that it was the cross-examination by defence counsel which caused
the material to subsequently be admitted as relevant.  The Court decided that
they could not overturn the exercise of the trial judge's discretion to
continue the trial ""unless the court is clearly satisfied that the judge
proceeded on some wrong principle or his decision was wrong"" (p. 389). 
The majority did not find that the judge had proceeded on a wrong principle,
nor did they find that he had made a decision which was wrong in the
circumstances.

 

1.  Similar
Fact Evidence

 

    The
admissibility of the evidence of past sexual incidents between the accused and
his daughter was dealt with at trial on a voir dire.  The
trial judge decided to exclude evidence relating to events occurring prior to
May 1981.

 

    It
is a well established principle of criminal law that all relevant evidence is
admissible (R. v. Robertson, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
918).  The so-called similar facts rule is an exclusionary rule which forms an
exception to the general principle of admissibility.

 

    In Robertson, Wilson
J. gave the following explanation of the similar facts rule at p. 941:

 

The rule
is an exclusionary rule and an exception to the general and fundamental
principle that all relevant evidence is admissible.  A general statement of the
exclusionary rule is that evidence of the accused's discreditable conduct on
past occasions tended to show his bad disposition is inadmissible unless it is
so probative of an issue or issues in the case as to outweigh the prejudice
caused. . . . [Emphasis added.]

 

    Wilson
J. went on to say that ""In discussing the probative value we must consider
the degree of relevance to the facts in issue and the strength of the inference
that can be drawn"" (p. 943).  Clearly, the application of the similar
facts rule requires a balancing of factors.  It involves an exercise of
discretion on the part of the trial judge who must assess both the probative
value and the possible prejudicial effect of the evidence in the circumstances
of the case before him.

 

    The
recent decision of this Court in R. v. Green, [1988] 1 S.C.R.
228, dealt with similar fact evidence where an accused charged with the sexual
assault of a child had also committed similar acts against other children.  In
that case I concurred with McIntyre J., who wrote (at p. 229):

 

The only
issue argued before us concerned the admission at trial of similar fact
evidence,  which came from children other than the complainant concerning the
respondent's behaviour with them.  This evidence was admissible to show a
system adopted by the respondent, and its probative force was sufficient to
outweigh any prejudicial effect upon the respondent.  In my opinion, no
error was made by the trial judge in its admission and I would allow the appeal
and restore the conviction.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Similarly,
in this case, it is my view that the probative force of the evidence outweighed
the prejudicial effect upon the appellant.  In determining whether a father has
sexually assaulted his seventeen-year-old daughter, it is particularly relevant
to know whether such behaviour is part of a long standing pattern of abuse.

 

    The
majority of the Court of Appeal found that this evidence should have been
admitted directly.  I am inclined to agree. It is my opinion that the trial
judge could have validly admitted the evidence from the outset.

 

2.  Relevance
of the Evidence for Other Purposes

 

    The
evidence which was excluded on voir dire was subsequently
admitted by the trial judge when, in his view, it became directly relevant to
other issues in the case.

 

    Following
his decision on the voir dire, the trial judge warned counsel that:

 

. . .
this does not rule out the possibility that the evidence may become relevant as
a result of questions asked in cross-examination of Crown witnesses, or as a
result of defence evidence.

 

    Given
the line of questioning engaged in by counsel for the defense, it is not in the
least surprising to me that the trial judge subsequently determined that the
evidence became admissible, not as evidence of ""similar fact"", but as
what the trial judge labelled ""background"".  While it must be admitted
that ""background"" is a rather imprecise term, in my view the meaning
of the trial judge was clear.  He was admitting the evidence not to show the
""bad character"" or ""predisposition"" of the accused, nor
even to prove a ""system"" adopted by the accused.  Rather, the
evidence was relevant to establishing the credibility of the victim, and
provided a very important context for the incidents for which the accused was
charged.

 

    In
the present case, defence counsel launched an attack on the credibility of the
complainant.  In particular, he implied that the previous charges were not
pursued because they were bogus.  This approach was an invitation to the jury
to draw the same conclusions about the charges which the accused was then
facing.  He implied that the family break-up was the cause of hostility which
resulted in false charges being laid.  His tactics obscured the fact that the
break-up occurred subsequent to the father being caught in bed with G.D.

 

    When
children are sexually assaulted there are generally no witnesses.  When such
matters become the subject of criminal prosecution it is usually a case of the
victim's word against the accused's.  Under such circumstances, the credibility
of the victim is of crucial importance to the determination of guilt or
innocence.  When, as in this case, the credibility of the victim is attacked by
defence counsel, the victim should not be denied recourse to evidence which
effectively rebuts the negative aspersions cast upon her testimony, her character
or her motives.

 

    It
must be remembered that the sexual abuse of children is a tragedy which
presents the legal system with a difficult situation highly atypical of most
crimes.  The criminal law is right to demand that the accused only be tried for
the crimes with which he is actually charged.  However, in a case such as the
present, it would be unrealistic to completely divorce the specific sexual
assaults with which the accused was charged from the long standing pattern of
abuse which culminated in the charges being laid.

 

    It
cannot be over-emphasized that cases of sexual assault by family members
against children provide the courts with a difficult and unique set of
problems.  The fact that most child sexual assaults occur under circumstances
where the problem is hard to detect and even harder to prosecute places an
obligation upon the judiciary to ensure that the abuses suffered by the victims
are not perpetuated by an inability of the legal system to respond to the
particular nature of the crime.

 

    I
find that, following the line of questioning undertaken by counsel for the
defence, the evidence of prior sexual assaults by the accused on his daughter
became directly relevant to the credibility of the daughter as chief witness in
the case.

 

3.  The
Charge to the Jury

 

    The
appellant claims that the charge to the jury on similar facts was deficient
because the trial judge failed to direct the jury, properly or at all, as to
the similar fact evidence and the purposes to which it could be put.

 

    As I
have already noted, it is my view that the evidence was admitted at a point
where it was relevant for purposes other than those generally associated with
""similar fact"".  The majority of the Court of Appeal was likewise of
this view when Hinkson J.A. wrote, at p. 390:

 

  It
would appear that the trial judge, having rejected the application of the Crown
to adduce the evidence as evidence of similar facts, and subsequently having
decided to admit it as necessary to the unfolding of the narrative, thereafter
treated the evidence as simply evidence that was relevant and admissible to the
issues in the case.

 

    I
agree.

 

    However,
even if it is argued that the evidence of prior sexual contact constituted
similar fact evidence when it was admitted subsequent to the voir dire, I do
not consider the charge to the jury to be defective.

 

    I
have no quarrel with the description by my colleague Sopinka J. of the three
possible prejudicial effects which similar fact evidence can have on the minds
of a jury.  However, any evidence given by Crown witnesses can have a
prejudicial effect on the accused.  The fact that in some cases similar fact
evidence becomes admissible would indicate that the possibility of prejudicial
effect cannot be the uppermost concern.  The prejudice to be suffered by the
accused must be such that it clearly outweighs any probative value of the
evidence.  To illustrate this point, I cite the following passage from R. v.
Stalder, [1981] 2 N.S.W.L.R. 9 (C.C.A.), at p. 20:

 

    It
cannot be gainsaid that the evidence in rebuttal led by the Crown was damning
to the appellant.  Indeed, he thereafter had a significantly diminished
prospect of any verdict being returned other than one of murder.  It is
expecting a great deal to anticipate that the jury, no matter how carefully
instructed and no matter how anxiously they deliberated, could avoid being
markedly prejudiced towards a verdict of murder once the Crown had led evidence
of the circumstances of the 1971 armed robbery conviction and of the two armed
robbery type offences of 1979.  To recognize these matters, however, does not necessarily
import a requirement that, as a matter of discretion, the evidence ought not to
have been admitted.  It is not mere prejudice, no
matter how inevitable or grave that may be, which is the touchstone:  it is undue or
disproportionate prejudice having regard to the probative significance
of the evidence upon an issue falling for determination by the jury.  [Emphasis
in original.]

 

    In
my view, while the jury would most certainly be shocked and undoubtedly
influenced by the evidence of the past sexual conduct of the accused, such
evidence was of very high probative value.

 

    The
trial judge cannot be expected to completely eradicate any prejudicial effect
created by such evidence.  However, it is his duty, in his charge to the jury,
to carefully direct the jury as to the proper use of the evidence, and the
circumstances in which it may be taken into consideration.

 

    In
the present case, the trial judge repeatedly warned the jury not to consider
the evidence of previous sexual incidents when assessing the guilt or innocence
of the accused with respect to the charges he faced.  His address to the jury
contained numerous and repeated warnings concerning the proper use of the
evidence of prior incidents.  He began by reminding the jury of the particular
events with which the accused was charged, and explained that he was not
charged with anything respecting any prior assaults.  He later repeated his
warning that the accused was only charged with two specific counts.  He warned
the jury not to draw any conclusions from the evidence of prior incest
charges.  He emphasized that the material was background evidence only, and
repeated the positions of both counsel with respect to the evidence.  Further
reminders are contained in his address.

 

    The
Court of Appeal found that the charge to the jury contained all of the
requisite warnings (at p. 390):

 

    In
his charge, the trial judge was careful to warn the jury that the accused was
not on trial for any offences other than the two contained in the indictment. 
In particular he stressed to the jury the accused was not charged with any
offences relating to the incidents about which the complainant testified had
occurred between 1978 and May, 1981 nor for any incidents subsequent to May,
1981 and up to the end of June 1985.  In particular he instructed the jury the
accused was not charged with incest.  In this context he instructed the jury
that the evidence of incidents prior to July, 1985 were simply background
matters.

 

    I am
satisfied that the charge to the jury was not in any way deficient in
explaining the proper use of the evidence.

 

4.  Conclusion

 

    It
is my view that the evidence of prior sexual contact between the accused and
his daughter was of such high probative value that the trial judge would have
been correct had he admitted as similar fact evidence on a voir dire. 
However, as the trial progressed, the evidence became relevant to the
credibility of the Crown's chief witness.  As such, it was properly admitted by
the trial judge, not as similar fact evidence, but rather for the purpose of
establishing credibility.

 

    Since
the evidence was not admitted as similar fact evidence, the charge to the jury
did not have to deal directly with the special problems relating to similar
fact.  However, even if it were to be considered as similar fact evidence, the
charge to the jury was not in any way defective.  The prejudicial effect of the
evidence could not be completely removed from the minds of the jurors, but
there is no requirement in law that this result be achieved.  The trial judge
gave numerous and repeated warnings concerning the proper use of the evidence. 
I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that these warnings were
sufficient under the circumstances.

 

    In
the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

                   K was found guilty
of wilful promotion of hatred against an identifiable group contrary to
s. 319(2)  of the Criminal Code .  The majority of the Court of
Appeal allowed his appeal on the ground that the trial judge had erred in law
in his response to questions from the jury and ordered a new trial.  Based on
the dissent, the Crown appealed to this Court as of right under s. 693(1)(a)
of the Code.  K, although his conviction was quashed by the Court of
Appeal, filed an application for leave to appeal.  His application contains
three grounds, one of which raises a constitutional issue.  These grounds were
all raised by K in the Court of Appeal.  The Crown filed a motion to quash K's
application on the basis that this Court lacks the jurisdiction to hear the
appeal on the issues raised.  K filed a motion to amend his leave application
to add another ground.  This additional ground raises a constitutional issue.

 

                   Held:  The Crown's motion to quash K's
application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.  K's application for leave
to appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.: When the
constitutionality of a law is challenged in the context of criminal proceedings,
the determinations of culpability and constitutionality are two distinct
rulings. Under the dual proceedings approach developed in Laba, this
Court has the jurisdiction to hear applications for leave to appeal under
s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act  on any ground questioning the
constitutionality of a Criminal Code  provision.  The limitation imposed
by s. 674 of the Code, and mirrored in s. 40(3)  of the Supreme
Court Act , is not aimed at rulings on constitutionality.  Either party may
seek leave to appeal rulings on constitutionality, regardless of whether the
ruling on culpability is appealed.  When a constitutional issue is put before
this Court through any of the appeals provided for in the Code, there is
no need to seek leave under s. 40 .

 

                   As a general rule,
a respondent is entitled in criminal appeals to this Court under s. 691 or
s. 693 of the Code to raise any argument which supports the order
of the court below.  There is only one restriction:  if the respondent makes a
new argument, the Court may exercise its discretion not to hear it if there is
not a sufficient evidentiary record to support the argument.  This discretion,
however, is not related to the Court's jurisdiction.  Rule 29 of the Rules
of the Supreme Court of Canada does not provide a respondent with an
independent avenue of cross‑appeal.  Finally, leave granted under the Criminal
Code  provisions differs from leave granted under s. 40  of the Supreme
Court Act  in civil matters. As a matter of policy, when restricted leave is
granted in civil cases, the respondent will normally be limited to arguing
those issues set out by the Court in its order granting leave. 

 

                   The Crown's motion
to quash K's application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  K need not seek
leave to argue the two non‑constitutional grounds contained in his
original application for leave since they support the order for a new trial
granted by the Court of Appeal.  Both grounds were raised before that court, so
there is an appropriate evidentiary basis for his arguments here.  With respect
to the constitutional ground, however, K's challenge to the constitutionality
of ss. 319(2) and 319(3) of the Code based on ss. 2 (b), 7 
and 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  does not appear to
be supportive of the order below as success on this ground would likely
preclude a new trial.  Pursuant to the dual proceedings approach, K must thus
seek leave to appeal under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act  to raise
this ground.  With respect to the additional constitutional ground, which
challenges the constitutionality of s. 319(3)(a) based on s. 11 (d)
of the Charter , K need not seek leave since success on this ground would
support the order below. The broadest possible remedy which could result from
this challenge would be to strike out the words ""he establishes"" from
s. 319(3) (a).  K's original application for leave to appeal, reduced to
a single constitutional ground, is denied.

 

                   Per L'Heureux-Dubé J.: Subject to the
following reservation, Lamer C.J.'s reasons were agreed with. It is not
necessary on the facts of these proceedings to determine whether it is
appropriate to draw a distinction between the scope of the arguments that
respondents can raise in criminal and in civil appeals. Accordingly, the
resolution of this issue is left to another day.

I.  Introduction

 

1                 These proceedings arise
subsequent to the Crown filing a notice of appeal to this Court.  Following
that notice, Keegstra filed an application for leave on separate grounds.  The
Crown now moves to quash Keegstra's application for leave to appeal on the ground
that this Court lacks the jurisdiction to hear the appeal on the issues
raised.  Keegstra's motion to amend his leave application was also heard at
this time, as was argument on the merits of the leave application.  I will
address both of these motions, as well as the application for leave in these
reasons.  In addition, the Crown has objected to Keegstra's filing of a
document entitled ""The Hate Crimes Law in Canada"", which I will also
address.  For the sake of clarity, given the procedural complexity of the
issues, I will refer to the parties as the ""Crown"" and
""Keegstra"".

 

2                 The most important issue raised
by these parties is the question of this Court's jurisdiction to hear argument
in criminal appeals.  Two categories of question of law are raised by Keegstra
in his application for leave to appeal: (i) whether certain Criminal Code 
provisions are constitutional; and, (ii) whether the Court of Appeal made an
error in law which does not raise a constitutional question.  I will endeavour
to clarify the principles which govern each of these categories below, and then
apply them to this case.

 

II.  Factual Background

 

3                 In 1982, Keegstra was dismissed
from his position as a high school teacher in Alberta for giving anti-Semitic
lectures.  His appeal of this dismissal was dismissed by the Board of Reference
in 1983: 45 A.R. 348.  In 1984, Keegstra was charged with unlawfully promoting
hatred against an identifiable group under s. 281.2(2) (now s. 319(2) ) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  The Crown proceeded by indictment in
prosecuting this hybrid offence.  Prior to his first trial, Keegstra challenged
the validity of the section under ss. 2 (b) and 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  This application was dismissed: (1984), 87
A.R. 200.  He was tried and convicted by a jury, and sentenced to a $5,000
fine.

 

4                 Keegstra raised the same Charter 
issues on appeal and was successful: (1988), 87 A.R. 177. The Crown appealed to
this Court, which reversed the Court of Appeal on the constitutional questions
by holding that the impugned provisions infringed ss. 2 (b) and 11 (d)
of the Charter  but constituted a reasonable limit, justifiable under s.
1 : [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697.  We remitted the case back to the Court of Appeal for
determinations on other issues. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and
ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge erred in not allowing
Keegstra to challenge potential jurors for cause on account of significant
pretrial publicity: (1991), 114 A.R. 288.

 

5                 The retrial began in March 1992
and lasted four months.  Twenty witnesses were called, of whom 17 were former
students.  Only two of these students had their memories sufficiently refreshed
from their class notes to give independent evidence.  The evidence of the other
students was admitted under the past recollection recorded rule.  Keegstra was
again found guilty and was sentenced to a $3,000 fine.

 

6                 Keegstra appealed to the Court
of Appeal which allowed his appeal on the ground that the trial judge had erred
in law in his response to questions from the jury and ordered a new trial:
(1994), 157 A.R. 1.  Foisy J.A. dissented on the ground that the trial judge's
conduct in response to questions from the jury did not amount to a reversible
error of law.

 

7                 Based on this dissent, the Crown
appeals to this Court as of right under s. 693(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  Keegstra, although his conviction was quashed
by the Court of Appeal,  filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court
on October 31, 1994.  He seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:

 

1.Do
ss. 319(2) and 319(3) of the Criminal Code  infringe ss. 2 (b), 7 
and 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and if so, are
they justified under s. 1  given developments in the law since this case was
last before this Court? 

 

2.Did
the learned trial judge err in his definition of public interest and public
benefit and did the Court of Appeal err in not finding a new trial warranted
for the lack of clarity in this definition?

 

3.Did
the Court of Appeal misapply the principles of R. v. Stinchcombe to the
circumstances of this case?

 

All of these grounds were raised by
Keegstra in the Alberta Court of Appeal. 

 

8                 The Crown responded to
Keegstra's application for leave by filing a motion to quash the application on
November 23, 1994.  Keegstra filed a reply to this motion on January 11, 1995,
as well as a motion to amend his application for leave to appeal by adding:

 

4.Does
s. 319(3)(a) of the Criminal Code  infringe s. 11 (d) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

9                 These two motions, as well as
the application for leave, were heard by this Court on February 6, 1995, and
judgment was reserved.

IV. The Motion to Quash Keegstra's
Application for Leave to Appeal

 

10               This motion raises the question of
this Court's jurisdiction to hear arguments from a respondent in an appeal in
respect of an indictable offence.  In other words, what grounds is a respondent
permitted to argue in this Court.  Appeals in respect of indictable offences
are provided for under ss. 674 , 691  and 693  of the Criminal Code . 
Keegstra's application for leave contains two categories of grounds for leave
to appeal: (i) whether certain Criminal Code  provisions are
constitutional; and, (ii) whether the Court of Appeal made errors of law which
do not raise constitutional questions.  First, I will discuss the rights of
respondents to raise constitutional issues in criminal appeals in respect of
indictable offences.  The capacity to raise these arguments is procedurally the
same, regardless of which party is appealing or which provision of the Code
governs other aspects of the appeal.  Next, I will consider errors of law which
do not involve constitutional concerns.

 

A. Grounds of Appeal Raising
Constitutional Issues 

 

11               To begin, I will outline the
jurisdiction of this Court to hear appeals of declarations made pursuant to s.
52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  In R. v. Laba, [1994] 3
S.C.R. 965, I elaborated a ""dual proceedings, s. 40 "" approach to the
jurisdiction of this Court in respect of proceedings involving indictable
offences.  This approach provides that criminal proceedings which raise
constitutional issues have two aspects.  As a consequence, a party to such a
proceeding can, in some instances, apply for leave to appeal a ruling on
constitutionality to this Court under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 , when there is no appeal route provided by the Criminal
Code .  In Laba I stated (at pp. 977-78):

 

My
analysis will be grounded in the following premise: when the constitutionality
of a law is challenged in the context of criminal proceedings, there are
effectively two proceedings -- the proceedings directed at a determination of
culpability and the proceedings directed at a determination of
constitutionality.

 

In Laba the proceedings dealing
with constitutionality were separated from the proceedings in regard to culpability. 
This procedural aspect, however, is not the determinative feature of the dual
proceedings approach.  Even when the determinations of culpability and
constitutionality arise in the same proceeding, the two rulings are separate
and distinct.  As I stated in Laba (at pp. 981-82):

 

...
an appeal against a ruling on the constitutionality of a law is not an appeal
from a judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or
affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence.

 

12               The significance of this
bifurcation is that appeals of the constitutionality of a law are not governed
solely by the Criminal Code  provisions regarding appeals, even when the
appeal is from a judgment which also contains a ruling ""acquitting or
convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an
indictable offence"".  An appeal of a ruling against the constitutionality
of a Criminal Code  provision is not proscribed by the Criminal Code . 
In particular, the limitation imposed by s. 674 , and mirrored in s. 40(3)  of
the Supreme Court Act , does not apply. 

 

13               Since these two limiting
provisions are not applicable to appeals of rulings on the constitutionality of
Criminal Code  provisions, these rulings are subject to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme
Court Act :

 

                   40. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an
appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any final or other judgment of the
Federal Court of Appeal or of the highest court of final resort in a province,
or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought
to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court has been refused by any other court, where, with respect to the
particular case sought to be appealed, the Supreme Court is of the opinion that
any question involved therein is, by reason of its public importance or the
importance of any issue of law or any issue of mixed law and fact involved in
that question, one that ought to be decided by the Supreme Court or is, for any
other reason, of such a nature or significance as to warrant decision by it,
and leave to appeal from that judgment is accordingly granted by the Supreme
Court.

 

14               Accordingly, where the highest
court of final resort of a province has made a ruling on the constitutionality
of a Criminal Code  provision, either party may seek leave to appeal that
ruling to this Court, regardless of whether a finding of culpability accompanied
the ruling and, if there was an accompanying finding of culpability, regardless
of whether that finding is appealable as of right or on granting of leave.  Of
course, the party choosing to seek leave to appeal a ruling of
constitutionality will be the party whose interests are not served by the
ruling on constitutionality below.  Nonetheless, this dual proceedings approach
insures that leave can always be sought to appeal rulings on constitutionality
whether or not the party seeking leave ""won"" or ""lost"" in
the ruling on culpability in the court below.

 

15               In the majority of cases, to be
sure, an accused who has been acquitted will not be interested in appealing,
regardless of the ruling on the constitutionality of the provision he or she
was charged under.  Therefore, the accused will rarely take advantage of the
opportunity to seek leave to appeal under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act . 
(An accused who is convicted has various appeal routes under the Criminal
Code  which I examine below.)  However, in the rare instance where the
interest of an accused in a Criminal Code  provision extends beyond the
question of his or her own culpability, the dual proceedings approach ensures
that leave may be sought and this Court, in deciding whether to grant leave or
not, will weigh whether the acquitted accused's interest justifies hearing the
constitutional arguments.

 

16               The Crown is more likely to avail
itself of the access to s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act  highlighted by
the dual proceedings approach.  In any criminal proceeding where the
constitutionality of a provision is ruled upon, two possible outcomes are
adverse to the interests of the Crown: an acquittal and a ruling of
unconstitutionality.  The dual proceedings approach ensures an appeal route in
each of these circumstances.

 

17               I set out the policy concerns
animating this approach in Laba, supra.  The examples I set out there at
pp. 982-84 are equally relevant, if not more so, in this case:

 

                   To
find otherwise would be to accept an absurd consequence.  Consider the
following example.  In a trial on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while
impaired, a Superior Court judge in Ontario declares s. 256  of the Criminal
Code  (warrants to obtain blood samples) unconstitutional and inoperative
and rules that the evidence obtained as a result of a warrant under this
section is inadmissible.  Despite this declaration, the accused is convicted on
the remaining evidence.  The accused chooses not to appeal this conviction. 
The Crown cannot appeal against the conviction through the Criminal Code 
(because no such appeal is provided for by Parts XXI and XXVI of the Code). 
Unless the analysis I propose is accepted, s. 256  will remain inoperative in
Ontario unless and until one of the following four scenarios transpires. 
First, a case involving s. 256  of the Criminal Code  comes before another
Superior Court judge in Ontario, this second judge disagrees with the first
judge and declares the section constitutional, the accused is convicted, the
accused appeals the conviction to the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal
affirms the conviction.  Second, a case involving s. 256  comes before another
Superior Court judge in Ontario, this second judge agrees with the first judge
on the constitutionality issue and acquits the accused, the Crown appeals the
acquittal to the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal declares the section
constitutional.  Third, a case involving s. 256  comes before a Superior Court
judge of another province or territory, this judge declares the section
unconstitutional, the accused is acquitted, the Crown appeals the acquittal to
the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal affirms the acquittal, and the Crown
successfully appeals against the Court of Appeal decision at the Supreme Court
of Canada.  Fourth, a case involving s. 256  comes before a Superior Court judge
in another province or territory, this second judge disagrees with the first
judge and declares the section constitutional, the accused is convicted, the
accused appeals the conviction to the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal
affirms the conviction, and the accused successfully appeals against the Court
of Appeal decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.  If ever a finding of
unconstitutionality coincides with a conviction, no appeal against the finding
of unconstitutionality will be available if the accused chooses not to appeal.

 

                   To
me, such a consequence is absurd.  First, the constitutionality of a law is left
dependent upon the resolution of an issue completely unrelated to
constitutionality, i.e., the guilt or innocence of the accused and upon his or
her decision to appeal a conviction.  Second, a law can be struck down by a
Provincial or Superior Court judge and then left to hang there inoperative
until some time in the future when another case on point happens to come before
another judge and happens to result in a verdict that provides for an avenue of
appeal through the Criminal Code .  Just as an accused is entitled to his
or her day in court, so too is the legislature.  The legislature does not
properly get this day in court if its ability to get to court on the issue of
the constitutionality of a law is dependent upon the contingency of a
particular finding of guilt or innocence coinciding with a Criminal Code 
avenue of appeal.

 

18               Although the reasoning in Laba
was particularly directed to providing adequate appeal routes for the Crown,
there is no policy reason why an accused who has been acquitted should not have
access to the same appeal routes.  The same absurdity results from making a
ruling on constitutionality unappealable because the Crown chooses not to
appeal it under the Criminal Code  provisions, as would have resulted in Laba
by making a ruling on constitutionality unappealable because the accused chose
not to take advantage of existing Criminal Code  appeal routes.  Rulings
on the constitutionality of Criminal Code  provisions are subject to the
dual proceedings approach whether the party who seeks the s. 40  route of
appeal is the Crown or the accused, and whether the ruling sought to be
appealed is one of constitutionality or unconstitutionality.  We must recall
that s. 40  does not provide a right of appeal, but rather a right to seek leave
to appeal.

 

19               R. v. Finta, [1994] 1
S.C.R. 701, illustrates the dual proceedings approach.  In that case, the Crown
had a statutory right of appeal on four grounds based on a dissent in the Court
of Appeal.  The Crown sought leave to appeal to add an additional three grounds
of appeal.  The respondent sought leave to appeal two rulings on
constitutionality where the Court of Appeal had been unanimous and which were
not put in issue by the Crown.  Leave was granted to both parties, and the
Court considered nine grounds of appeal. 

 

20               In summary, under the dual
proceedings approach, this Court has the jurisdiction to hear applications for
leave to appeal under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act  on any ground
questioning the constitutionality of a Criminal Code  provision.  As
rulings on constitutionality are distinct from rulings on culpability, either
party may seek leave to appeal rulings on constitutionality, regardless of whether
they are the appellant or respondent in proceedings regarding culpability, and
regardless of whether the ruling on culpability is appealed.  

 

B. Grounds of Appeal Which Do Not
Raise Constitutional Issues

 

21               Under the Criminal Code , an
appeal to this Court in respect of an indictable offence may take five possible
forms:  (i) an accused may appeal as of right based on a dissent in the court
of appeal; (ii) an accused may appeal as of right because the court of appeal
overturned his or her acquittal, or the acquittal of a co-accused; (iii) an
accused may appeal after obtaining leave to appeal; (iv) the Crown may appeal
as of right on the basis of a dissent in the court of appeal; and (v) the Crown
may appeal after obtaining leave to appeal.  While the accused has an appeal as
of right (reversal of an acquittal) which the Crown does not (reversal of a
conviction), the Crown and the accused have identical rights as respondents
in each of these forms of appeal.  Consequently, the categories of appeal which
need to be examined are: (i) appeals as of right based on a dissent in the
court of appeal; (ii) appeals as of right based on the setting aside of an
acquittal; and, (iii) appeals where leave is granted.  As a general rule, a respondent
is entitled to raise any argument which supports the order of the court below. 
For clarity, the non-constitutional arguments which may be raised by the
respondent in each form of appeal are set out below.

 

                   1.    Appeals as
of Right Based on a Dissent in the Court of Appeal

 

22               This appeal as of right arises in
three situations.  In the first instance, the accused was acquitted at trial
and his or her acquittal was upheld, with a dissent in the court of appeal
which gives the Crown a narrow appeal as of right.  In the second case, the
accused was convicted and the court of appeal overturned the conviction with a
dissent, providing for a narrow appeal as of right for the Crown.  Finally,
when the accused was convicted and the court of appeal upheld the conviction
with a dissent, the accused will have a narrow appeal as of right.

 

23               Sections 691(1)(a) and
693(1)(a) provide a narrow right of appeal on the basis of court of
appeal dissents.  These provisions limit the arguments which may be raised by
appellants in this Court.  They do not, however, limit arguments which can be
made by respondents.  The respondent can raise any argument which supports the
order of the court below.  This includes presenting grounds on which the
respondent was successful in the court below, re-arguing grounds which were
unsuccessful or not dealt with below, and even making new arguments in this
Court.  If a respondent makes a new argument which lacks an appropriate evidentiary
basis below, this Court may exercise its discretion not to hear the argument. 
This decision, however, is not related to the Court's jurisdiction.  When a
respondent in an appeal as of right raises an issue the appellant has not
addressed, the appellant may seek leave to file a reply factum.

 

24               If an appellant who has an appeal
as of right based on a dissent wishes to raise other issues, he or she may seek
leave under ss. 691(1)(b) or 693(1) (b).  In Finta, supra,
this procedure was followed by the appellant Crown who wished to address issues
on which the Court of Appeal had been unanimous.  Once leave has been sought,
the Court may grant leave on narrow grounds or grant a general leave to
appeal.  The arguments which may be advanced are then governed by the same
procedures as any case where leave is granted, set out below.

 

                   2.    Appeals as
of Right Based on the Setting Aside of an Acquittal

 

25               Section 691(2) provides these
appeals as of right to an accused on any point of law if the court of appeal
set aside his or her acquittal, or the acquittal of a co-accused.  Accordingly,
these appeals are similar to appeals where leave is granted at large.  The
appellant may argue any point of law, including points of law raised by
intervening decisions (R. v. Wigman, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 246).  The
respondent Crown in these appeals may argue any point of law which supports the
order of the court below.  

 

26               In Perka v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 232, the appellants came before this Court under this
provision.  The Crown sought to present argument in respect of a point of law
which the appellants had not raised.  In ruling on the jurisdictional issue,
Dickson J. (as he then was), writing for the majority, said (at p. 240):

 

                   In
both civil and criminal matters it is open to a respondent to advance any
argument to sustain the judgment below, and he is not limited to appellants'
points of law.  A party cannot, however, raise an entirely new argument which
has not been raised below and in relation to which it might have been necessary
to adduce evidence at trial.... Therefore, if we regard the Crown's submission
as an argument to sustain the judgment below, this Court undoubtedly has jurisdiction
to hear and decide this issue.

 

This clarifies that the only
restriction on arguments by the respondent which support the order below will
be whether there is a sufficient evidentiary record to support the argument. 
As noted above, this limitation is discretionary.  The Court may choose to hear
arguments on which there is no record below, although it normally will not. 
The question of an evidentiary record below does not affect this Court's
jurisdiction.  

 

27               Our decision in R. v. Barnes,
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 449, further clarifies the position of respondents in these
appeals as of right.  In Barnes the trial judge had entered a judicial
stay for entrapment and the court of appeal had allowed the Crown's appeal and
ordered a new trial.  The Crown requested that, upon finding there was no
entrapment, this Court enter convictions against the accused.  Writing for the
majority of this Court, I stated (at p. 466):

 

The
Crown is not given by statute the ability to appeal to this Court a decision
which allowed its appeal from an acquittal or judicial stay of
proceedings, but which gave the Crown less than what had been
requested.  As a result, there is no statutory provision which would allow the
Crown to appeal from the Court of Appeal's judgment.  Absent a statutory right
of appeal, there is no right of appeal. [Emphasis in original.]

 

This makes it clear that, while the
respondent Crown in all of these appeals would undoubtedly prefer a conviction
over a new trial, the Crown is not permitted to cross-appeal or otherwise argue
in this Court for a conviction to be entered.  

 

                   3.    Appeals
Where Leave Is Granted

 

28               Where leave is sought under s.
691(1)(b) or s. 693(1) (b), the Court may choose to grant leave on
restricted grounds or at large.  Restricting the leave granted to specific
issues constrains the arguments which may be raised by appellants.  The
arguments which may be raised by respondents are not affected by an order
granting leave on narrow grounds.  As is the case in the two forms of appeal as
of right, the respondent here may make any argument which supports the order of
the court below.  A respondent who has won in the court below and been granted
a new trial may not seek leave under these provisions to seek either a
conviction (in the case of the Crown) or an acquittal (in the case of an
accused).  (See Meddoui v. The Queen, [1991] 3 S.C.R. ix.)

 

29               Leave granted under the Criminal
Code  provisions differs from leave granted under s. 40  of the Supreme
Court Act  in civil matters.  While appeal routes in civil cases are not at
issue in this motion, it is useful to clarify that the decision in Idziak v.
Canada (Minister of Justice), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 631, is not relevant to
criminal appeals.  In Idziak, leave was granted on one ground only and
both parties were restricted in their argument to addressing that ground.  In
civil matters, leave to appeal may be sought with respect to any finding
adverse to the party in question.  The number of such findings in a civil case
is nearly always much greater than in a criminal case.  Accordingly, as a
matter of policy, when restricted leave is granted in civil cases, the
respondent will normally be limited to arguing those issues set out by the
Court in its order granting leave. A respondent who wishes to avoid this
restriction should seek relief therefrom in the response to the application for
leave to appeal or by application to the Court prior to the hearing.  Such an
application would succeed if, in the opinion of the Court, limited grounds of
appeal would operate adversely to the respondent.

 

30               Three final points will conclude
the clarification of which arguments may be raised by respondents in criminal
appeals.    

 

31               First, in some cases, two issues
which may have been discussed separately at the court of appeal will be so
inextricably linked as to form two aspects of the same question of law.  In
this case, an appellant who has a narrow right of appeal based on a dissent, or
who has been granted leave to appeal on restricted grounds, will be able to
address all aspects of the question, even if the court of appeal treated the
different aspects separately.  One example of this intertwining is the question
of whether a particular error of law is so serious that it justifies setting
aside the trial verdict.  The provisions for taking account of the severity of
errors (s. 686(1) (b)(iii) in the case of convictions, and the threshold
set out in Vézeau v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277, in the case of
acquittals) will always be intertwined with any error of law considered by this
Court.

 

32               Second, the principles which are
to govern permissible arguments in appeals relating to included offences are
contained in the general rules.  When an accused is convicted of an included
offence, he or she has been acquitted of the offence originally charged.  The
accused can appeal the conviction and the Crown can appeal the acquittal. 
Appeals to this Court are then governed by the appropriate Criminal Code 
provisions.  This is set out in my reasons, for the Court, in Guillemette v.
The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 356.  In Guillemette the accused was
charged with second degree murder and convicted of manslaughter.  He appealed
his conviction but the Crown did not appeal his acquittal.  The Court of Appeal
erroneously ordered a new trial on the second degree murder charge.  As the
acquittal had not been appealed, this order was beyond the Court of Appeal's
jurisdiction.  Guillemette's appeal to this Court was as of right on the basis
that the Court of Appeal had set aside his original acquittal on the second
degree murder charge.  I stated (at pp. 363-64):

 

                   The
accused cannot challenge the verdict of manslaughter in this Court.  The Court
of Appeal did not affirm the conviction and, were it not for the error by the
Court of Appeal in setting aside his acquittal for murder by ordering a new
trial on that charge, the accused would not have been able to appeal to this
Court under s. 618 [now s. 691 ].  On an appeal as of right under s. 618(2)(a)
of the Code, the accused can only challenge the setting aside of his
acquittal for murder and ask that the new trial be held on a charge of
manslaughter.  This Court therefore cannot rule on the other arguments put
forward by the accused in support of an acquittal.  

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   Though
it made no appeal to the Court of Appeal, the Crown could have appealed in this
Court, against the order for a new trial made by the Quebec Court of Appeal....
In addition to the limitations imposed on us by the nature of the accused's
appeal, the jurisdiction of this Court is also limited by the Crown's decision
not to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the acquittal for murder by the
jury, and further by its decision not to appeal against the order for a new
trial made by the Court of Appeal.

 

There are no special or additional
rules which apply in the case of included offences.  What is required, rather,
is a careful consideration of which party has the right to appeal the implicit
and explicit rulings of the trial court.

 

33               The final clarification concerns
the interaction between the dual proceedings approach to constitutional issues
and the avenues of appeal provided in the Criminal Code .  When a
constitutional issue is put before this Court through any of the appeals
provided for in the Criminal Code , there is no need to seek leave under
s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act .  The dual proceedings approach exists in
order to ensure that rulings regarding constitutionality will not be made
""unappealable"" by the Criminal Code  provisions, not to remove
all constitutional questions from the Criminal Code  routes of appeal.

 

34               Counsel in this motion raised the
question of whether Rule 29 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada,
SOR/83-74, provides an independent avenue of cross-appeal to respondents. 
While Rule 29 prescribes the procedural aspects of cross-appeals, it does not
provide an avenue for cross-appeals which have no statutory foundation.

 

C. Application to this Motion

 

35               The Crown moves that the Court
quash Keegstra's application for leave to appeal on the basis that it is beyond
the Court's jurisdiction.  The Crown is appealing to this Court as of right on
the basis of a dissent in the Court of Appeal.  Keegstra seeks leave to appeal
on three points, one of which raises a constitutional issue.

 

36               I would dismiss the Crown's
motion.  Keegstra does not need leave to argue the two non-constitutional
points contained in his original application for leave to appeal as these
support the order for a new trial granted by the Court of Appeal.  As well, he
advanced both of these arguments on appeal, so there is an appropriate
evidentiary basis for his arguments here.  His challenge to the
constitutionality of ss. 319(2)  and 319(3) based on ss. 2 (b), 7  and 15 
of the Charter , on the other hand, does not appear to be supportive of
the order below.  Keegstra seeks to argue that the combined effect of ss.
319(2)  and 319(3)  is to create an offence which infringes freedom of
expression, is unconstitutionally vague and does not provide equal protection
of the law to all groups in Canadian society. Success on this ground would
likely preclude a new trial.  With respect to this ground of appeal, therefore,
Keegstra must seek leave to appeal under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act ,
pursuant to the dual proceedings approach.     

 

V.  The Motion to Amend the
Application for Leave to Appeal

 

37               Keegstra moves to add an
additional ground to his application for leave to appeal.  This additional
ground challenges s. 319(3)(a) as contrary to s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
because it creates a reverse onus on the issue of truth, thus allegedly
infringing an accused's right to be presumed innocent. I need not address this
motion because the broadest possible remedy which could result from this
challenge would be to strike out the words ""he establishes"" from s.
319(3) (a).  Success with respect to this challenge would support the
order for a new trial and therefore Keegstra does not need leave to make this
argument.

 

VI. The Application for Leave to
Appeal

 

38               As Keegstra need not seek leave to
argue in support of the order of the Court of Appeal, this Court must consider
whether to grant leave to appeal on the following ground:

 

1.Do
ss. 319(2) and 319(3) of the Criminal Code  infringe ss. 2 (b), 7 
and 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and if so, are
they  justified under s. 1  given developments in the law since this case was
last before this Court? 

 

                       

39               I would deny leave to appeal on
this ground.

 

 

VII. Request to Remove the Volume
""The Hate Crimes Law in Canada"" from the

      Record

 

40               As part of its motion to quash the
application for leave to appeal, the Crown requests that the Court remove from
its record the volume entitled ""The Hate Crimes Law in Canada"" by
Barbara Kulaszka, which Keegstra filed as volume 2 of ""Applicant's
Authorities"".  This volume reviews the application of a group of
provisions it labels collectively as Canada's ""hate crimes"" laws,
including s. 319(2)  of the Criminal Code , and certain provisions of the Customs
Tariff, R.S.C., 1985, c. 41 (3rd Supp.), the Canada Post Corporation Act ,
S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 54, and the Immigration Act, 1976, S.C.
1976-77, c. 52.  The thesis of the study is that these provisions are applied
inconsistently and unfairly by Canadian law enforcement officials.  

 

41               As this volume did not form part
of the record below, and Keegstra has not sought leave to file it here, I would
grant the Crown's motion and remove this volume from the Court's record for the
application for leave to appeal.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

42               L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- I agree with the Chief Justice's disposition of these proceedings
and substantially agree with his reasons in support of this disposition. 
Specifically, I agree that a respondent in a criminal appeal is free to raise
any argument which supports the order below (subject to the discretion of this
Court to decline to hear any argument for which there is not a sufficient
evidentiary foundation). 

 

43               My only reservation with the Chief
Justice's reasons concerns the distinction he draws between civil and criminal
appeals.  Specifically, after concluding that respondents in criminal appeals
are free to raise any argument which supports the order below, he states (at p.
400):

 

...
as a matter of policy, when restricted leave is granted in civil cases, the
respondent will normally be limited to arguing those issues set out by the
Court in its order granting leave.

 

I am not sure I see the underlying
legal rationale for this distinction between the scope of the arguments that
respondents can raise in criminal and civil appeals.  Accordingly, I cannot
agree with the Chief Justice's obiter comments on this issue.  Instead,
as this issue is not squarely raised by the facts of these proceedings, I would
leave its resolution to another day.  Subject to this reservation, however, I
would dispose of these proceedings as does the Chief Justice.

Trial -- Evidence -- Use to which evidence to be put  --  Propriety
of certain questions on cross‑examination and related comments in address
to jury ‑‑ Adequacy of charge to jury. 

 

                   The Crown appealed
from a Court of Appeal judgment which overturned respondent's conviction for
second degree murder and ordered a new trial.  One issue touched upon the use
of evidence of the respondent's attack on a third party and of the theft of a
bicycle.  Another issue arose as to the propriety of certain questions put by
the Crown in cross-examination and related comments in the address to the jury.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   For
the reasons of Labrosse J.A., dissenting at the Court of Appeal, this appeal
should be allowed.  In respect of both matters in issue in this appeal, the
trial judge's charge was thorough and adequately explained the limited use to
which the evidence in question could be put.

judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 259, 92 C.C.C.

                   Gary T. Trotter, for the appellant.

 

                   Anil K. Kapoor, for the respondent.

 

                   The following is
the judgment delivered by

 

1                 The
Court -- The respondent, Steven Joseph Tanner, was convicted at trial of
the second degree murder of Dan Watters.  This verdict was subsequently
overturned by a majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal (Labrosse J.A.
dissenting) and a new trial was ordered:  (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 259.  It is from
this decision that the Crown appeals to this Court as of right.

 

2                 In our view, the Crown's appeal
should be allowed for the dissenting reasons of Labrosse J.A. at the Court of
Appeal but we would add the following.  With respect to evidence of the attack
on McCurdy and the theft of a bicycle, this evidence was admitted for the
limited purpose of tending to show the respondent's state of mind at the time
that he killed Watters.  It was not admitted nor used as evidence of flight
tending to show consciousness of guilt.  The question put in cross-examination
and followed up in the address to the jury by Crown counsel, while improper,
must be assessed in light of the trial judge's charge to the jury.  In respect
of both matters in issue in this appeal, the trial judge's charge was thorough,
and adequately explained the limited use to which the evidence could be put. 
There was no objection to the charge in either respect.  In view of the
foregoing, no error of law occurred and we agree with Labrosse J.A. that the
respondent's appeal to the Court of Appeal ought to have been dismissed.

 

3                 Accordingly, this appeal is
allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is set aside and the conviction of
the respondent is restored.

The appellant, who had been charged with one murder
and was suspected in a second, was subjected to an intensive and often manipulative
interrogation by the police.  He was systematically questioned notwithstanding
his stating repeatedly that he would not speak unless he could consult with his
lawyer.  The police interrogators also constantly denigrated the integrity of
defence counsel.

 

The police offered the appellant a ""deal"": 
he would be charged with second degree murder if he provided the police with
the location of the gun and other ancillary information related to that
murder.  When the appellant refused to accept the ""deal"" without
consulting his lawyer, the officers continued to badger him about the
reliability of his lawyer and informed him this ""one‑time""
chance would be kept open only for the weekend ‑‑ the period when
appellant's counsel was unavailable.  The appellant eventually agreed, despite
his being advised by another lawyer not to talk to the police, and fulfilled
his part of the deal by giving police a full confession, bringing them to the
murder site, and telling them where the murder weapon had been thrown.  The
appellant recounted the events of the day and the information he had given to
the police to his girlfriend.








A misunderstanding arose as to the deal.  The
appellant understood that he would be allowed to plead not guilty to a charge
of second degree murder whereas the Crown insisted that he would have to plead
guilty to that charge.  The trial judge found as a fact that the police
officers had made an honest mistake.

 

The appellant was charged with first degree murder. 
At trial, the Crown sought to introduce all of the evidence obtained while the
appellant had been under the misunderstanding that he was participating in a
valid agreement.  The trial judge found that appellant's right to counsel
(s. 10 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms )
had been breached and held that appellant's confession, his disclosure of the
location of the weapon and his directions and gestures to the police were
inadmissible.  He admitted the fact of finding the gun, the actual gun,
testimony of a witness, testimony identifying the gun and the testimony of his
girlfriend regarding the statements appellant made to her.  The appellant was
convicted of the first degree murder and the Court of Appeal affirmed that
decision.  At issue here is whether or not appellant was denied his right to
counsel guaranteed by s. 10 (b) of the Charter , and if so,
what was the just and appropriate remedy under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé J. dissenting in part):  The appeal
should be allowed.

 








Per La Forest, Sopinka,
Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The ""deal"" fundamentally changed
the prosecution to involve a different offence and so brought the accused's
right to counsel under s. 10 (b) of the Charter  into play. 
This right was denied in several ways.  First, the police refused to hold off
and continued to question him despite his repeated statements that he would say
nothing without consulting his lawyer.  Second, s. 10(b)
specifically prohibits the police from belittling an accused's lawyer with the
express goal or effect of undermining the accused's relationship with defence
counsel.  Third, the police acted improperly when they pressured the accused to
accept the ""deal"" without first giving him the chance to consult his
lawyer.  Their duties were not discharged, given the seriousness of the offence
and the context of general trickery, when they allowed the accused to consult a
random lawyer.

 

Section 10(b) mandates the Crown or police,
whenever offering a plea bargain, to tender that offer either to the accused's
counsel or to the accused while in the presence of his or her counsel, unless
the accused has expressly waived the right to counsel.  It is a constitutional
infringement to place such an offer directly to an accused, especially when the
police coercively leave it open only for the short period of time during which
they know defence counsel to be unavailable.  Mere expediency or efficiency or
the facilitating of the investigatory process was not enough to create an
urgency sufficient to permit a s. 10(b) breach.  To the extent that
the plea bargain is an integral element of the Canadian criminal process, the
Crown and its officers engaged in the plea bargaining process must act
honourably and forthrightly.

 

These proceedings should not be stayed; stays should
only be limited to the ""clearest of cases"".

 








Evidence obtained in a manner that infringes an
accused's Charter  rights, should be excluded under s. 24(2)  if,
having regard to all of the circumstances, its admission would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.  Under the test in R. v. Collins,
three categories of factors are to be considered:  (1) those affecting the
fairness of the trial; (2) those relating to the seriousness of the
violation; and, (3) those relating to the effect on the reputation of the
administration of justice of excluding the evidence.  The impact of the
evidence on the fairness of the trial was determined to be the most important
consideration in triggering the Charter 's exclusionary effect.

 

Self‑incriminatory evidence obtained as a result
of a Charter  breach will generally go to the fairness of the trial and
should generally be excluded.  Trial unfairness strikes at the heart of the
reputation of the administration of justice.  That the evidence is classified
as either real or conscriptive should not be of itself determinative.

 

Consideration of what evidence should be excluded
should begin with that evidence most proximate to the Charter  breach and
then work towards evidence arising more remotely from it.  More remote evidence
might not be admitted if its admission would have the same effect as admitting
the proximate evidence.  Here, the contested evidence most proximate to the
breach was the finding of the gun because the gun would not have been found but
for the unconstitutional behaviour of the police.  Appellant's statement
voluntarily made to his girlfriend about directing the police to the location
of the gun too was derivative evidence flowing from his confused state of mind
stemming from the s. 10 (b) violations and the critical decisions
made in the absence of counsel.  It was not mere windfall evidence for the
Crown.  Nothing would have been said had appellant not been improperly
conscripted by the police to provide evidence against himself.

 








Evidence lying in close proximity with the Charter 
breach is excluded because it detracts from the integrity of the trial and
thereby infringes both the principles of fairness and of reliability.  Here,
the Crown sought to introduce the statement at trial precisely because doing so
allowed it to do indirectly what the trial judge had ruled it could not do
directly:  introduce evidence that the appellant knew where the gun was
hidden.  Excluding the gun while including the statements effectively
eviscerates the Charter of most of its protective value to the accused
in this case.

 

Where the impugned evidence flows from a violation of
the s. 10(b) right to counsel, the Crown must demonstrate on a
balance of probabilities that, regarding the unfairness of the trial component
of the test under s. 24(2) , the accused would not have consulted counsel
even if properly advised.  The Crown did not meet this burden here.

 

Given the serious nature of the Charter  breach,
the admission of the impugned evidence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.  The violation was wilful and flagrant and there was no
element of urgency.  The effect of excluding the evidence on the reputation of
the administration of justice will be incidental and far outweighed by the
negative consequences that would follow were this unconstitutional evidence to
be included.  The fact that the impugned evidence played only a minor role in
the trial was irrelevant to a s. 24(2)  analysis.  The effect of evidence
at the trial may be relevant in a consideration of the effects of excluding the
evidence on the reputation of the administration of justice but no framework
has been established to consider the effect of including the evidence.  Such a
framework should not be created here.

 








Section 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 
(the curative provision) should not be applied here because the admission of
unconstitutionally obtained evidence at trial amounted to a ""substantial
wrong"".  There was a reasonable possibility that the impugned evidence
could have weighed significantly in the conviction.

 

Per Sopinka, Cory,
Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The reasons and conclusion of Iacobucci J. were
agreed with.  These reasons address L'Heureux-Dubé J.'s point that this Court
has departed from R. v. Collins in favour of a rule of automatic exclusion.

 

Differing opinions exist among both commentators and
the public as to the appropriate approach to the exclusion of evidence under s.
24(2)  of the Charter .  With respect to the suggestion that this Court is
out of step with public opinion, individual rights are not to be submitted to
an adjudication by the majority.  Furthermore, there is no accurate assessment
of public opinion.  The test with respect to what could bring the
administration of justice into disrepute is grounded in longer term community
values rather than the public passion of the moment.  These  values are to be
assessed in terms of the views of the hypothetical, reasonable, well-informed
and dispassionate person in the community.

 








This Court's s. 24(2)  jurisprudence, subsequent to Collins,
has generally evolved with due respect for stare decisis but also with
due regard for the fact that as an early comprehensive statement of principles,
it did not purport to be exhaustive or immutable.   The key words in that
judgment, ""conscripted against himself through a confession or other
evidence emanating from him"", necessitated further definition in
subsequent cases.  Whether it was ever so intended, it soon became apparent
that real evidence and evidence emanating from the accused were not mutually
exclusive categories.  It is unfair for the Crown to make out its case in whole
or in part by the use of evidence that it obtained in breach of the rights of
the accused and involving his or her participation.  The participation of the
accused in providing incriminating evidence involving a breach of Charter 
rights is the ingredient that tends to render the trial unfair as he or she is
not under any obligation to assist the Crown to secure a conviction.  Serious
breaches of the Charter  which do not involve the participation of the
accused may result in the exclusion of the evidence under the second branch of
the Collins test.

 

The application of the Reliability and the Fairness
Principles as suggested L'Heureux-Dubé J. does not constitute a return to Collins. 
Nowhere in Collins is the fairness of the trial equated with the
reliability of the evidence.  The description used in Collins as to the
kind of evidence that could render a trial unfair was ""a confession or
other evidence emanating from him"".  Even the admissibility of a
""confession"" is not determined solely on the basis of reliability. 
Prior to the Charter  and at common law, reliability ceased to be the
exclusive basis for excluding confessions.  The fairness of the trial was also
a factor in the exclusion of involuntary confessions.  The reliability
principle would, therefore, impose a more restrictive exclusionary rule than
that which existed at common law.  Its preoccupation with the probative value
of the evidence would also appear to be a close relative of the rule in R.
v. Wray.  This case was widely criticized, has not been followed by this
Court and was not the basis for the exclusionary power adopted by the Charter 
in s. 24(2) .

 








The first branch of the Collins test cannot be
accurately characterized as an automatic rule of exclusion with respect to all
self-incriminating evidence.  While a finding that admission of illegally
obtained evidence would render the trial unfair will result in exclusion, the
court must first conclude that ""in all the circumstances"" the
admission of the evidence would render the trial unfair.

 

The discoverability or ""but for"" test can be
traced to Collins.  While the Court has not decided the extent to which
discoverability is relevant in all aspects of the Collins test, it has
been applied to admit as well  as to exclude evidence.  The distinction made in
Collins between real evidence and evidence emanating from the accused
was based, at least in part, on the rationale that real evidence (or things)
can be discovered without the participation of the accused.  They pre-existed
the state action which is called into question, and were there to be discovered
by investigative means not involving the accused.  Where this distinction is
blurred, discoverability has been used to place the evidence in one or other of
these two categories.  If the evidence was discoverable without the
participation of the accused, then it has the attributes of real evidence. 
Conversely, evidence that clearly emanates from the accused such as statements
has not been subjected to the discoverability analysis.

 

The distinction between real and conscriptive evidence
is thus not determinative and greater emphasis has been placed on the
discoverability or ""but for"" test.  The law relating to s. 24(2) 
should be developed on this basis rather than the new approach advocated by
L'Heureux-Dubé J.  This approach to date is more consistent with Collins,
and therefore with stare decisis.  

 








Per Gonthier J.: 
The reasons of L'Heureux‑Dubé J., read together with the comments of
Sopinka J., contribute to a proper understanding of the principles governing
the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  Evidence
of the accused's statement to his girlfriend, evidence of the gun and of its
location, all of which were made possible by this statement, were to be
excluded for its admission would tend to bring the administration of justice
into disrepute in the eyes of a reasonable person, dispassionate and fully
apprised of the circumstances.  The statement was intimately connected to that
deal which was obtained through the highly egregious conduct of the police
officers in pressing the accused to confess and in systematically undermining
the role of defence counsel.  This conduct was a Charter  violation of
the most serious kind, bringing into play both the Reliability and the Fairness
Principles referred to by L'Heureux‑Dubé J., although other evidence
served to allay concern as to reliability.  The curative provisions of s.
686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should not be applied.

 

Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
(dissenting in part):  The police conduct constituted a serious violation of
the s. 10 (b) Charter  right to counsel.  The Crown or police,
when offering a plea bargain, must tender the offer to either the accused's
counsel or the accused while in the presence of his or her counsel, unless the
accused has expressly waived the right to counsel.

 








Certain of the evidence derived from the Charter 
breach need not be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  Section
24(2)  is not to be apprised according to the views of the reasonable lawyer,
but simply according to the reasonable person, dispassionate and fully informed
of the circumstances.  Under s. 24(2), a court's duty to preserve the integrity
and repute of the judicial system in the eyes of the Canadian community must
prevail if in conflict with its more general duty under the Charter  to
vindicate the rights guaranteed therein.  There is some evidence to suggest
that a material gap has developed between the views of the community and those
of the Court with respect to the exclusion of unconstitutionally obtained
evidence.  In particular, this is attributable to the broad interpretation that
this Court has given to the term ""trial fairness"" in the first branch
of the Collins test, and the virtually absolute exclusionary
consequences that follow from a finding of ""trial unfairness"".  This
approach to ""trial fairness"" is inconsistent with the first
principles laid down by this Court in Collins and with the courts'
obligation under s. 24(2)  to adjudicate upon the exclusion of the impugned
evidence ""having regard to all the circumstances"".  The nature of the
evidence (real or self-incriminatory, or discoverable or undiscoverable) should
not be determinative of ""trial fairness"", and therefore of almost
automatic exclusion.  ""Trial fairness"" should not be so broadly
defined as to allow the ""trial fairness"" tail to wag the s. 24(2) 
dog.

 








At the time that s. 24(2) was enacted, the common law
in Canada was in the process of recognizing two different bases for the
exclusion of evidence.  The first was reliability.  The second was the
integrity of the justice system.  This constituted the legal context in which
s. 24(2) was enacted, and against which the approach to s. 24(2) in Collins
was elaborated.  Two fundamental principles are identified as flowing from the
common law and the Charter , and as underlying the Court's approach to s.
24(2) .  The first, the Reliability Principle, is engaged whenever anything done
by the authorities casts some doubt as to the accused's having been induced to
make a possibly unreliable statement.  In such circumstances, there may be a
concern that the trier of fact could be misled, or an innocent person
convicted, as a result of the authorities' activities.  These circumstances
potentially affect the fairness of the actual adjudicative process, and
therefore relate to the first set of factors to be considered under Collins. 
The admission of evidence whose reliability may be suspect as a result of state
activity would almost inevitably bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.  The second principle is the Fairness Principle.  This principle is
engaged whenever the state uses methods to advance its case against an accused
in a manner that undermines values that are fundamental to a free and
democratic society.  Judicial condonation of acts that violate this principle
undermine the integrity of the justice system, and could bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.  Thus, where the objection to the
admission of unconstitutionally obtained evidence is not so much that it could
mislead a trier of fact but pertains rather to the manner in which the
evidence was obtained, this objection relates to the Fairness Principle.  All
considerations relating to the Fairness Principle are better considered within
the rubric of the second branch of the Collins test: the impact of the
seriousness of the rights violation on the reputation of the justice system. 
Analysis under this branch of Collins must be undertaken ""having
regard to all of the circumstances"".  Whether or not the evidence could
have been discovered ""but for"" the rights violation is a serious,
albeit not determinative, consideration within this set of factors. 
Finally, under the third branch of the Collins test, courts must ensure
that there is a sense of proportionality between the competing interests and
effects at issue in the s. 24(2)  determination.  

 

In this case, the ""proximate connection""
between the s. 10 (b) violation and the accused's voluntary
statement to his girlfriend is sufficient to bring that statement within the
purview of a s. 24(2) examination.  The mere fact that the statement is
proximately connected to the rights violation or may not have been made but for
the violation does not, however, inevitably lead to the conclusion that it must
be excluded since its admission would render the trial unfair.  Although the
accused was incarcerated at the time, the statement was freely and voluntarily
made with no element of state compulsion to taint it with the possibility of
unreliability, and therefore with the possibility of unfairness to the trial.  

 








Turning to the impact of the seriousness of the rights
violation on the reputation of the justice system, it is noted that the direct
and intended fruits of the officers' unconstitutional conduct were properly
excluded by the trial judge.  The voluntary statement to a third party was,
however, an evidentiary windfall, and its admission is therefore less likely to
bring the administration of justice into disrepute over the long term.  Admittedly,
if this statement would not otherwise have been made by the accused, then it
could affect the integrity of the judicial system to admit such a statement at
trial.  This consideration is not, of itself, determinative of the question of
exclusion.  In this case, having regard to the seriousness of the offence and
the fact that it was incidental to the officer's unconstitutional conduct, the
exclusion of this reliable evidence would bring the administration of justice
into greater disrepute than its inclusion.

 








The impugned statement tends to connect the accused
more closely with the crime, and could give rise to an inference of
consciousness of guilt.  That its admission may create a danger that the trier
of fact will be misled does not relate to ""trial fairness"" in any way
that is relevant to s. 24(2).  Trial fairness will only be connected to
the rights violation, and therefore subject to special scrutiny under the first
branch of the Collins analysis,  when there is some possibility that the
evidence is unreliable or otherwise likely to lead to the conviction of an
innocent person, and when this unreliability is somehow attributable to the
state's unconstitutional conduct. Such was not the case here.  Under the
circumstances, there was no reasonable possibility of unreliability in the
statement.  If there is nonetheless a possibility that the statement is
prejudicial in the evidentiary sense, in that it could mislead a trier of fact
by causing it to follow an inappropriate chain of logic, then that problem must
be addressed within the context of the traditional balancing test which
inquires into whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its
prejudicial effect. 

 

Since the voluntary statement to the third party was
admissible under s. 24(2)  of the Charter , the admission of the gun
and the fact of finding the gun would not bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.

 

Section 24(2)  of the Charter  and the curative
provision of the Criminal Code , s. 686(1) (b)(iii), are not co‑extensive. 
First, s. 686(1)(b)(iii) only requires that the appellate court
consider the particular circumstances before it, whereas s. 24(2)  involves
long‑term considerations in any determination made as to admissibility. 
Second, the French version of s. 24(2) , on which the Collins
framework is based, requires that evidence be excluded ""if its admission
could bring the administration of justice into disrepute"".  A conclusion
that the administration of justice could be brought into disrepute by the admission
of certain evidence does not necessarily mean that its admission led to a
""substantial wrong"" or ""miscarriage of justice"".  Third,
the two provisions further different objectives and so have different focuses. 
The primary purpose of s. 24(2) , which focuses on whether the inclusion or
exclusion of evidence obtained in violation of the Charter  would bring
the administration of justice into further disrepute, is protection of the
integrity of the judicial system.  By contrast, the primary purpose of
s. 686(1) (b)(iii), which focuses on the outcome of the particular
proceedings, is to enable appellate courts to feel unhindered in clarifying
errors of law committed by the trial judge.  It reflects a careful balancing of
collective interests in the effective and efficient conclusion of litigation
against the right of the individual accused to a full and fair trial.

 








Given the strength of the Crown's case, the curative
provisions of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) could be properly invoked
notwithstanding a finding that evidence should have been excluded under
s. 24(2) .  Moreover, the trial judge warned the jury as to the limited
probative value of both the gun and the impugned statement.  There is no
reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different had the
impugned evidence been excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

A stay of proceedings was not appropriate because the
conduct of the authorities, while contemptible, did not amount to one of the
""clearest of cases"" of abuse of process.  The Crown, however, did act
with male fides by charging the accused with first degree murder
notwithstanding the fact that the Crown was aware that the police had misled
the accused and that he had fulfilled his half of the bargain in full reliance
of the deal offered by the police.  This conduct violates basic principles of
decency and fair play.  The principle of fundamental fairness under s. 7 
of the Charter  was therefore breached.  It would be appropriate and just
under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  to require the Crown to uphold its
half of the ""deal""; a conviction for the lesser included offence of
second degree murder should be substituted for the present conviction of first
degree murder.

The judgment of La Forest, Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci
and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

1                 Iacobucci J. -- This appeal, which
comes to the Court as of right under s. 691  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , raises two sets of issues: (1) the content of an
accused's right to counsel during the plea bargaining process; and (2) the
appropriate remedy for an infringement of s. 10 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and more specifically, the reach of
s. 24(2)  to exclude from the trial process evidence obtained in a manner
violative of the right to counsel.

 

A.  Background

 

2                 Terrence
Burlingham, the appellant, is accused of the murder of Denean Worms, which was
committed in October 1984 in Cranbrook, British Columbia.  He has also been
convicted of the murder of Brenda Hughes, which was committed in December 1984
also in Cranbrook.  It was because of the very similar manner in which the two
women were murdered and sexually assaulted that the police charged appellant
with the Worms murder at the point when it was decided to charge him with the
Hughes murder.  Both Worms and Hughes were found naked, with semen in their
vaginas, and each was shot twice in the head at close range with a .410
shotgun, though with different types of pellets.  Appellant's appeal to
the British Columbia Court of Appeal on the conviction for the Hughes murder
was dismissed.  This appeal relates only to the appellant's conviction for the
murder of Worms.

 








3                 From
January 1, to January 4, 1985, the police subjected appellant to an intensive
and often manipulative interrogation.  They systematically questioned him in
spite of the fact that he repeatedly stated that he would not speak unless he
could consult with his lawyer.  The police urged the accused to tell them what
he knew about the crime, suggesting that any delay would hurt his parents
since, just as they would be getting over the shock of the Hughes murder, they
would be doubly hurt by a second murder charge.  One of the officers commented
(quoted from the judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (1993), 85
C.C.C. (3d) 343, at pp. 356 and 359):

 

...I don't think that you're being very fair to them
[appellant's parents], um they, y'know they love you very much and, and from
what I, I see, you're a, a loving caring sort of person and, and uh, y'know you
have to weigh the, the advice that you're getting, but I can see that, that by
delaying you're just hurting them....

 

But basically what you're saying is you're going to
put your parents through this, for a long, uh, a lot longer.  From what I've
seen I thought you had a lot more love for them than that, Terry.

 

To which the appellant replied (at p. 359):  ""From
what I just seen, you're just trying to use my parents against me.""

 

4                 The
police also constantly denigrated the integrity of defence counsel; the
interrogation record attests to repeated disparaging comments made about
defence counsel's loyalty, commitment, availability, as well as the amount of
his legal fees.  The interrogation officers suggested they were more
trustworthy than the appellant's lawyer.  The following excerpts from the
interrogation record, cited at pp. 351-53, are illustrative:

 

[Appellant]: Well, that's what I
told you and I told him I pretty well got to talk to somebody about it, he [his
counsel] said to talk to me about it.

 

[Officer #1]:           Talk to
him? This is your friend who wants $15,000 out of you, and you're going to talk
to him?








[Appellant]: —- talk to him —-.

 

[Officer #1]:           Well,
it's, it's, it's obviously your choice, but I'll, I tell you it, it kind of
hurts if uh...

 

[Appellant]:            No, I, I'm not gonna, okay.

 

[Officer #1]:           It hurts
if, if, that's what you think of us.  That's all you think of us, after all—.

 

[Appellant]: That's
not what I thought. -- uh, I don't know whether I should follow his advice or
maybe I shouldn't, like I mean I don't know—.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[Officer #1]:           You gotta
realize, just the fact of what you've --, you're coming a long ways.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[Officer #1]:           Cause
you're, you're admitting it basically.

 

[Appellant]: Well...

 

[Officer #1]:           You're
telling us that, that, that you, you were there, and just the fact that you're
doing that, that makes me feel a lot better about what you're—.

 

                                                                   . . .








[Appellant]: I'm trying to word
this as good as I can, um, like I say, and I'm not saying that I ain't, uh I
won't talk to you guys.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[Appellant]: ... I'd like to
consult with him [counsel] first.

 

[Officer #1]:           Okay,
that, that's -- uh --.  He, he didn't even, -- didn't tell you if he's going to
even represent you?

 

[Appellant]: No.

 

[Officer #1]:           Hah! How
much money does he want?

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[Appellant]: Well when I talk to
my lawyer, um, I'm gonna pretty well lay it on the line with him, and find out
what or -- need to answer it, uh, -- answer -- won't bother -- to say anything
at that time, but uh --

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[Officer #1]:           Why, why
do we, why do you want to wait, I don't understand that and I, just for my own
feelings, I'd like to know.

 

                                                                   . . .

 








[Officer #1]:           Why you
can trust him [counsel] more than you can trust us?

 

[Appellant]: All I'm saying is
that, I won't say nothing at this time until I talk to him.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

 

[Officer
#1]:           Think about it -- cause like I say, I, I tell you, I'm a
pessimist, cause I've seen lawyers before --. 

 

5                 And
the comments continued as follows (at p. 354):

 

[Officer #1]:           Well has
he talked anything other than money with you?

 

[Appellant]: No.

 

[Officer #1]:           Just
money?

 

[Appellant]: Uhh, what do you
mean, anything...

 

[Officer #1]:           Like
hasn't he talked about any, getting any sort of help or anything?

 

[Appellant]: No.

 








[Officer #1]:           Hmh! All
he's really been worried about is money, money, money, eh?

 

6                 On
January 4, 1985 the police offered the appellant a ""deal"".  They
claimed they had instructions from their ""boss"" and Crown counsel to
make such a deal.  The appellant was told by the police that he would only be
charged with the second degree murder of Worms in exchange for his providing to
the police the location of the gun and other ancillary information related to
the murder.  When the appellant refused to accept the ""deal"" without
consulting his lawyer, the officers continued to express doubts regarding the
helpfulness of the appellant's counsel, emphasizing that he was taking the
weekend off.  They then kept the deal open only for the weekend, the period of
time during which the appellant's counsel was unavailable, underscoring all the
while that the deal was but a ""one-time chance"".  The trial record,
as cited by the Court of Appeal at pp. 358-59, reveals the following
exchanges between the appellant and the law enforcement agents once the
""deal"" was proposed:

 

[Appellant]: Why don't you tell
my lawyer that [about the deal]?

 

[Officer #1]:           What?
That, that we would do this [deal]?

 

[Appellant]: Yeah.

 

[Officer #1]:           He only
talked to us for two minutes and left, he wanted to have the weekend off, he's
not even prepared to talk to us till Monday.

 








[Officer
#2]:           We're talking to you, Terry, because I think you're the one that
should be --.

 

[Officer #1]:           You're
the one that's sitting here, and your parents are sitting at home!

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[Officer #1]:           The
difference is that your family are, are sitting there for another week or two
weeks, while your lawyer is going back and forth, having his weekends off and,
and uh, whatever, and they're, they're just waiting for the knock on the door. 
That's the difference.  I agree with you, as far as the sentence is concerned,
there's no difference.  None whatsoever, because you'll do the time on the most
serious, which we've already got. . . .

 

[Appellant]: How do you know it's
more serious?

 

[Officer #1]:           Well, because
it's a First Degree [murder] charge.  We're offering you the Second Degree
one.  That's, that's like uh... I, I can't believe you're hedging on it.  Jees,
cause that's, that would be. . . .

 

7                 On
the night of January 4, 1985, the appellant eventually acquiesced to the deal
despite having telephoned another lawyer who had advised him not to talk to the
police.  The appellant fulfilled his half of the bargain: by midnight the
police had a full confession, had been brought to the murder site, and had the
possibility of locating the murder weapon.  On the morning of January 5, 1985,
appellant told his girlfriend Judy Hall that he had brought the police to the
location where the gun had been left months earlier under what had since become
the frozen Kootenay River.  He also told her he knew (at p. 365)
""...something about the death of Ms. Worms"".








8                 Later
that day, however, the appellant was told the deal never existed in the manner
in which he understood it.  Apparently Crown counsel had only authorized the
officers to say that a plea of guilty to second degree murder would be
accepted, not that the appellant would be charged with second degree murder,
the difference being the accused would have the option to plead not guilty to
second degree murder.  The trial judge, Toy J. (as he then was), found as a
fact that the police officers had made an honest mistake.  When informed about
the aborted deal, the appellant's reaction was as follows:

 

[Officer #1]:           Maybe I
should bring you up first uh...just up on what's transpired today with Crown
counsel and everything.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[Officer #1]:           I don't
know if you're going to be very happy with the Crown, but what they've been
saying is that uh...they said that Glenn had no right to make any deals with
you and their [sic] taking the you know it's probably no surprise to you
but their [sic] taking the...the uh...line that we decide on what
charges are laid.

 

[Appellant]: Ya, that's not very
fair to me, though is it?

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[Appellant]: I mean uh...promises
were made to me and there [sic] not being kept.

 

                                                                   . . .

 








[Appellant]: So what you're
telling is that it's another murder one charge?

 

[Officer
#1]:           I'm telling ya is that what I'm telling you is that the Crown
will not let us make deals and their [sic] ...their [sic] the
ones that uh...will decide on those sort of things so that the problem is
...that their [sic] not bound to go by and uh..

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[Officer #1]:           ...Like I
say it's a piss off for everybody concerned....

 

9                 The
appellant was charged on January 8, 1985, with the first degree murder of
Worms, and the Crown subsequently sought to introduce all of the evidence
obtained while the appellant was under the misunderstanding that he was
participating in a valid agreement.  Of particular significance is the fact
that the police never consulted with the appellant's counsel regarding the
""deal"" nor did they give the appellant the opportunity to speak to
his counsel.

 

10               At
trial, a breach of s. 10 (b) of the Charter  was found.  The
trial judge held that, as a result of this violation, the appellant's
confession, his disclosure of the location of the weapon, as well as his
directions and gestures to the police were inadmissible.  However, Toy J.
admitted the fact of finding the gun, the actual gun, as well as Hall's
testimony regarding the statements made to her by the appellant.  The appellant
was convicted of the first degree murder of Denean Worms.  He appealed.  The
Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the trial judge, but there was a
strong dissent by McEachern C.J, who found that admitting any or all of the
derivative evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.








B.  Analysis

 

11               Although
the appellant has advanced some seven grounds for appeal, it is only proper for
this Court to consider those which gave rise to the dissenting opinion among
the members of the British Columbia Court of Appeal since the appellant never
submitted an application for leave with respect to the other issues.  The
issues giving rise to dissent in the court below all relate to the
admissibility of the derivative evidence, more specifically: (1) the testimony
from Hall that the appellant told her he showed the police where the gun could
be found; (2) evidence that police divers had found the gun in the river; (3)
testimony from   Everett Biddlecome (a witness) and the lawful owner of the gun
(James Lewis) identifying the murder weapon at trial; and (4) the gun itself. 
The admissibility of these pieces of evidence is contingent upon the resolution
of the legal questions at issue in this appeal: namely (1) was the accused
denied his right to counsel under s. 10 (b) of the Charter ;
and (2) if so, what consequences flow from that violation?

 

(i) Was there a denial of the accused's right to
counsel?

 

12               Section
10 (b) of the Charter  guarantees an accused the right, upon arrest
and detention, to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed
of that right.  This Court has consistently given a broad interpretation to s.
10 (b).  In the case at bar, there were several ways in which the
appellant's right to counsel was denied.

 

 








13               First,
the police continually questioned him despite his repeated statements that he
would say nothing absent consultation with his lawyer.  Section 10 (b)
requires, barring urgent circumstances, that the police refrain from attempting
to elicit incriminatory evidence once a detainee has asserted his or her right
to counsel: R. v. Prosper, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 236; R. v. Matheson,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 328; R. v. Brydges, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 190.

 

14               Second,
s. 10(b) specifically prohibits the police, as they did in this
case, from belittling an accused's lawyer with the express goal or effect of
undermining the accused's confidence in and relationship with defence counsel. 
It makes no sense for s. 10 (b) of the Charter  to provide for
the right to retain and instruct counsel if law enforcement authorities are
able to undermine either an accused's confidence in his or her lawyer or the
solicitor-client relationship. 

 

15               Third,
the improper conduct by the police regarding the plea bargain also amounted to
an infringement of s. 10 (b).  On this issue, I would affirm the
conclusion of Toy J. at trial and McEachern C.J. on appeal that s. 10 (b)
was violated when the officers pressured the appellant into accepting the
""deal"" without first having the opportunity to consult with his
lawyer.

 








16               An
argument could be made that, at the moment the plea bargain was offered, no
s. 10 (b) violation arose since the accused had an opportunity to call
a lawyer, albeit not his particular lawyer, whom the police knew to be
unavailable for the one night the offer was left open.  However, I am not
persuaded by such an argument.  Allowing the appellant to call a random lawyer
is, given the seriousness of the situation he faced and the circumstances of
this case, insufficient for the officers to discharge their responsibilities
under s. 10 (b).  This is especially so when the call to this
unknown lawyer is placed within the context of the general trickery and
subterfuge used by the police in arranging matters so that the appellant
himself had to decide on the plea in the absence of his own counsel.  Although
it is clear that s. 10 (b) does not guarantee an accused the right
to the counsel of his or her choice at all times, in a situation such as the
appellant's I believe that either the offer should have been made at a point in
time when the accused's lawyer (who was entirely familiar with the facts of his
case) was available or the police should have kept it open to a point in time
when the accused's counsel would reasonably be considered to be available.

 

17               In
this conclusion I agree with the following passage from McEachern C.J.'s
dissent in the court below at pp. 367-68:

 

The s. 10  Charter  rights of detained persons who
have elected to exercise their constitutional rights to retain and instruct
counsel would be seriously compromised if police officers having complete
control over such persons, should seek...directly or indirectly, to disregard
or act contrary to the advice they have received.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

Even more
serious, in my view, was the police insistence that the accused make a decision
that very evening when the police knew the lawyer for the accused was not
available.  This is worse than the ""unfair trick"" described in R.
v. Hebert . . . , [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, [at p. 158].... There was no
urgency, and the police could well have waited over the weekend when the matter
could have been discussed with counsel for the accused.  Their failure to do so
constituted a clear denial of the accused's s. 10 (b) Charter  right
to retain and instruct counsel.

 








18               When,
at first, the appellant refused to accept the deal without consulting with a
lawyer, the officers resumed their attempts to discourage the appellant from
meeting with his lawyer by observing that the appellant's lawyer was taking the
weekend off, by stressing that any delays in accepting the deal would prove
painful for the appellant's family, and by underscoring that the deal was being
offered for that night only.  The end result of this badgering was that the
accused did not understand the full content of his right to counsel.  When it
is evident that there is such a misunderstanding, the police cannot rely on a
mechanical recitation of the right to counsel in order to discharge their
responsibilities under s. 10 (b): R. v. Evans, [1991] 1
S.C.R. 869, at p. 891.  They must take positive steps to facilitate that
understanding.  In the case at bar, not only did the police fail to take
affirmative steps to clear up the appellant's confusion, but they also in fact
created this confusion in the first place.

 

19               The
following excerpt from the decision of Toy J. indicates the extent to which the
appellant did not understand the meaning of the right to counsel:

 

In his
testimony the accused was asked why, in light of the two lawyers' advice not to
speak to the police, he had done so and he replied, ""I was under the
impression that if I cooperated with the police I'd face a lesser charge and I didn't need a lawyer."" In my
judgment this impression is totally justifiable when one reads the transcript
of the denigrating way the police officers referred to the accused's then
lawyer. [Emphasis in original.]

 

It is thus apparent from the transcripts that the accused would not
have made the deal with police if it were not for the concerted effort by the
police to convince the accused not to consult with his counsel.

 








20               I
underscore that, in Evans, supra, at pp. 886-87 and 893,
McLachlin J. held that the police have the duty to advise a suspect of the
right to counsel where there is a fundamental and discrete change in the
purpose of an investigation which involves a different and unrelated offence or
a significantly more serious offence than that contemplated at the time of the
original instruction of the right to counsel.  Such a situation arose in the
case at bar.  The deal offered by the police involved a different offence and
was of such material importance to the appellant that it constituted a
fundamental change in the course of his prosecution.  For the reasons discussed
earlier, a genuine effort should have been made to contact the accused's own
lawyer.

 

21               Furthermore,
I conclude that s. 10 (b) mandates the Crown or police, whenever
offering a plea bargain, to tender that offer either to accused's counsel or to
the accused while in the presence of his or her counsel, unless the accused has
expressly waived the right to counsel.  It is consequently a constitutional
infringement to place such an offer directly to an accused, especially (as in
the present appeal) when the police coercively leave it open only for the short
period of time during which they know defence counsel to be unavailable.  In
the case at bar, the police should have negotiated the ""deal"" with
the appellant's counsel or, at a minimum, with the appellant while accompanied
by his lawyer.

 

22               I
emphasize that, in the case at bar, there was no urgency to the matter.  Mere
expediency or efficiency is not sufficient to create enough ""urgency""
to permit a s. 10 (b) breach: Prosper, supra.  Neither the 
precipitous issuing of the plea bargain by the police nor their conscious
undermining of the accused's relationship with his counsel can be justified on the
basis that such conduct allegedly facilitated the investigatory process.

 








23               In
closing, given the appellant's success on the other questions he raises, I need
not deal with his submission that the breach by the Crown of the plea bargain
deal also triggered constitutional violations.  However, I should mention that,
to the extent that the plea bargain is an integral element of the Canadian
criminal process, the Crown and its officers engaged in the plea bargaining
process must act honourably and forthrightly.

 

(ii) What is the just and appropriate remedy?

 

24               Having
found a serious Charter  violation, I now turn to the question of the
appropriate remedy.  I see no reason to interfere with the lower courts'
conclusion that it is inappropriate to stay these proceedings.  Stays should
only be limited to  the ""clearest of cases"" and, despite the
exhortations of appellant's counsel to the contrary, this is not such a case: R.
v. Power, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601.  After all, a judicial stay is ""the
most drastic of remedies"": R. v. L. (W.K.), [1989] B.C.J. No. 1700
(C.A.) (QL), aff'd [1991] 1 S.C.R. 1091.  Therefore, given the
inappropriateness of staying these proceedings on account of the s. 10 (b)
violation, the fundamental question that must be addressed is whether
s. 24(2)  of the Charter  can operate to exclude any or all of the
derivative evidence that had been admitted at trial.

 








25               Section
24(2) provides that when evidence is obtained in a manner that infringes an
accused's Charter  rights, this evidence shall be excluded from the trial
process if it is established that, having regard to all of the circumstances,
the admission of such evidence would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.  The approach to be employed in interpreting the content of
""bringing the administration of justice into disrepute"" was outlined
by the Court in R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265.  It is commonly
recognized that the Collins decision established a test to gauge whether
the impugned evidence ought to be admitted or excluded.  The purpose of this
test is to oblige law enforcement authorities to respect the exigencies of the Charter 
and to preclude improperly obtained evidence from being admitted to the trial
process when it impinges upon the fairness of the trial.

 

26               I
note that, at the time of trial, the Collins decision had not yet been
rendered.  The trial judge had consequently governed himself by the
determinative authority in British Columbia at the time, R. v. Gladstone
(1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 151 (B.C.C.A.), which adopted a narrower
interpretation of s. 24(2)  than that currently applicable.  As early as R.
v. Jacoy, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 548, at p. 558, this Court decided that Gladstone
had been overtaken by more recent Supreme Court jurisprudence, most notably Collins. 
Owing to the application of the ""in the system rule"" (R. v. Wigman,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 246) the appellant is entitled to the benefit of the Collins
test in terms of the disposition of his appeal.

 

27               When
the Collins test is applied to the facts at bar, I find, as did
McEachern C.J. in dissent below, that all of the derivative evidence ought to
be excluded.

 








28               In Collins, supra,
at pp. 283-85, Lamer J. (as he then was) set forth a number of criteria to be
examined in determining whether the admission of evidence obtained in violation
of a Charter  right would tend to bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.  In a subsequent decision, Jacoy, supra, Lamer J.
then explicitly grouped these factors into three categories: (1) those
affecting the fairness of the trial; (2) those relating to the seriousness of
the violation; and (3) those relating to the effect on the reputation of the
administration of justice of excluding the evidence.  It appears that, when the
s. 24(2)  analysis was first developed by this Court in Collins, the
impact of the evidence on the fairness of the trial was determined to be the most
important consideration under s. 24(2)  in terms of triggering the
exclusionary effect of the Charter  remedy. In Collins, supra,
at p. 284, Lamer J. held:

 

If the admission of the
evidence in some way affects the fairness of the trial, then the admission of
the evidence would tend to bring the administration of justice into
disrepute and, subject to a consideration of the other factors, the evidence
generally should be excluded.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

29               In
Collins, supra, at pp. 284-85, Lamer J. also noted that
self-incriminatory evidence obtained as a result of a Charter  breach
(i.e., evidence where the accused is conscripted against him- or herself
through a confession or other evidence emanating from him or her) will
generally go to the fairness of the trial and should generally be excluded.  It
was expressly held that such evidence will generally arise in the context of an
infringement of the right to counsel.  For more recent cases on this point, see
R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595; R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2
S.C.R.  151; R. v. Elshaw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 24.  Trial unfairness strikes
at the heart of the reputation of the administration of justice: Hebert,
supra, at pp. 207-8; see also J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A. W.
Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada (1992), at p. 407,
""[o]nce impugned evidence has been found to come within the trial fairness
rationale, exclusion is virtually certain to follow"".

 








30               On
the other hand, Lamer J. noted that the admission of real evidence obtained in
a manner that violates the Charter  will rarely operate unfairly for that
reason alone.  This conclusion militates against the exclusion of the gun in
the case at bar.  However, I find that, in jurisprudence subsequent to Collins,
this Court has consistently shied away from the differential treatment of real
evidence.  For example, in R. v. Ross, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 16,
Lamer J. emphasized that the admissibility of evidence under s. 24(2) 
depended ultimately not on its nature as real or testimonial, but on whether or
not it would only have been found with the compelled assistance of the accused:

 

... the use of any evidence that could not have
been obtained but for the participation of the accused in the construction of
the evidence for the purposes of the trial would tend to render the trial
process unfair. [Emphasis added.]

 

These comments are apposite to the case at bar.  Further, I draw
attention to the conclusions of La Forest J. in R. v. Colarusso, [1994]
1 S.C.R. 20, at p. 74, where it was noted that the mere fact that impugned
evidence is classified as either real or conscriptive should not in and of
itself be determinative.

 








31               The
exclusion of real evidence was specifically dealt with in the  decision of this
Court in R. v. Mellenthin, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 615.  The Mellenthin
case involved the exclusion of drugs found in a car at a random roadside
breathalyser checkstop.  Cory J. reiterated the distinction between
""independently existing evidence that could have been found without
compelled testimony"" and ""independently existing evidence that would
have been found without compelled testimony"" (emphasis in original)
established by La Forest J. in Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada
(Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices
Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, at p. 555.  The admission of evidence
that simply ""could have otherwise been found"" will have a higher
chance of affecting the fairness of the trial.  In Mellenthin, the
admission into evidence of the drugs -- despite their status as real evidence
-- would have certainly affected the trial's fairness because they would not
have been found without the improper conduct.  The drugs were consequently
deemed inadmissible.

 

32               I
conclude my review of the pertinent jurisprudence with the recent decision of R.
v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451.  In that case it was recognized that,
despite the fact that theoretically the onus rests on the accused to show that
the impugned evidence would not have been found but for the unconstitutional
conduct, in practice the burden will often fall on the Crown as it possesses
superior knowledge.  It was held at p. 553 that the ""but-for"" test
will be met by the Crown when it satisfies the court on a balance of
probabilities that the law enforcement authorities would have discovered the
impugned derivative evidence regardless of the information arising from the
unconstitutional conduct.

 

33               I
now turn to the application of this jurisprudence to the case at bar.  At the
outset, I note that my colleague, Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, concludes that it is
the Hall testimony that constitutes the crux of this appeal.  My colleague
first decides to determine the admissibility of Hall's testimony and, deeming
it to be in fact admissible, then goes on to hold that the admission of the gun
and the fact of finding the gun would not bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.  With respect, I find this approach to be inverted.  It is the
gun and the fact of finding it that stand at the heart of this appeal.  This is
the key derivative evidence.  To this end, the application of s. 24(2) 
should first concern itself with the gun and its finding, then Biddlecome's and
Lewis' identification of it at trial, and thereafter the Hall testimony.

 








34               I
suggest that it is appropriate to commence the consideration of what evidence
should or should not be excluded from the trial process with the evidence
obtained most proximate to the Charter  breach and then work towards
evidence arising more remotely therefrom.  Since the trial judge deemed
appellant's confession to be inadmissible, the contested evidence most
proximate to the breach is the finding of the gun.  As shall become evident,
this gun would never have been found were it not for the unconstitutional
conduct by the police officers.  In any event, in terms of formulating this
analysis, it must be kept in mind that there may be times (as in this case)
where more remote evidence might not be admitted if its admission would have
the same effect as admitting the most proximate evidence.

 

35               As mentioned earlier, I
find that  the derivative real evidence, the gun, would not have been
found but for the information improperly obtained through the s. 10 (b)
breach.  The question is not even whether such evidence would, on a balance of
probabilities, have otherwise been located.  The gun was at the bottom of the
frozen Kootenay River and the only person who knew of its location was the
appellant.  In this regard, this case can be sharply distinguished from R.
v. Black, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 138.  In Black, after the occurrence of a
s. 10 (b) violation, an accused helped the police identify a
particular knife as the murder weapon.  Wilson J. admitted this piece of real
evidence, noting at p. 164 that she had ""little doubt that the police
would have conducted a search of the appellant's apartment with or without her
assistance and that such a search would have uncovered the knife"". 
Consequently, the position that the trial judge's discretion should, in the
preponderance of cases, be exercised in favour of exclusion with respect to
derivative evidence which would not have been obtained but for a witness's
testimony is, in fact, consonant with Black.

 








36               On
a policy level, if the appellant's gestures and directions arising from the
s. 10 (b) violation are inadmissible yet real evidence obtained
pursuant to these directions is admissible, this Court might create an
incentive for law enforcement agents to disregard accused's Charter 
rights since, even in the case of an infringement of Charter  rights, the
end result might be the admission of evidence that, ordinarily, the state would
not be able to locate.

 

37               I
also share McEachern C.J.'s view that the appellant's statement to Hall that he
had directed the police to the location of the gun can be classified as
derivative evidence.  It is true, as Cumming J.A. points out in his concurring
majority opinion below, that the appellant made this statement voluntarily and
that Hall was not a person in authority.  However, even though the statement
may not have been ""caused"" directly by the breach, it was certainly
made as a result of that breach.  The statements to Hall flowed from the
appellant's understandably confused state of mind stemming from the s. 10 (b)
violations and the critical decisions he had made in the absence of counsel. 
The appellant was still under the erroneous impression that the
""deal"" was on.  The statement was made the morning after the
appellant had been unconstitutionally conscripted to provide evidence against himself. 
He had never been properly informed of his right to counsel and it cannot be
said with any degree of conviction that he would have made the same statement
to Hall had he been duly advised of his constitutional rights.  In fact,
he would have had nothing to say to Hall had he not been improperly conscripted
to provide evidence against himself by the police in the first place.  For this
reason, the rights violation had much more than, as characterized by
L'Heureux-Dubé J., simply an incidental effect on the making of the impugned
statement.

 








38               I
note that my colleague describes these statements as a ""windfall"" to
the Crown.  Such a description, in my view, overlooks the fact that the content
of the appellant's conversation with Hall is inextricably connected to the
conduct of the police, found to violate s. 10 (b).  These
self-incriminatory statements amount to evidence that could not have been
obtained but for the unconstitutional manner in which the accused was tricked
into participating in the construction of the evidence for the purposes of his
trial.  Given that no satisfactory indication has been given that, on a balance
of probabilities, this evidence would have been found regardless of the unconstitutionally
obtained information, it is to be excluded under s. 24(2) : R. v. Ross,
supra; R. v. S. (R.J.), supra.

 

39               The
rationale behind the exclusion of evidence lying in close proximity with the Charter 
breach stems from the fact that, in the case at bar, such evidence, if tendered
at trial, detracts from the integrity of the trial and thereby infringes both
the fairness principle and reliability principle evoked by L'Heureux-Dubé J. in
her reasons in the instant appeal.  There is an overlap between these two
principles in so far as unconstitutionally obtained information may well
constitute unreliable evidence, especially when the particular constitutional
right that has been breached is the right to counsel.  In any event, even if
the improperly obtained evidence were reliable, considerations of reliability
are no longer determinative given that the Charter  has made the rights
of the individual and the fairness and integrity of the judicial system
paramount: Hebert, supra, at p. 178.

 

40               It
is now necessary to focus more directly on the issues of proximity and
remoteness.  In this regard, the decision of this Court in R. v. Strachan,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, at pp. 1005- 6, is helpful to this analysis.








41               Strachan
concerned the admissibility of evidence (marijuana) obtained as a result of a
valid search during which the accused's right to counsel was violated.  Dickson
C.J. made it clear that a strict causal analysis is not necessary in a
s. 24(2)  analysis and that the presence of a temporal connection is not
determinative.  He stated at pp. 1005- 6:

 

In my view, all of the pitfalls of
causation may be avoided by adopting an approach that focuses on the entire
chain of events during which the Charter  violation occurred and the
evidence was obtained....  A temporal link between the infringement of the Charter 
and the discovery of the evidence figures prominently in this assessment,
particularly where the Charter  violation and the discovery of the
evidence occur in the course of a single transaction.... [However] [t]here can
be no hard and fast rule for determining when evidence obtained following the
infringement of a Charter  right becomes too remote.

 

42               Seen
in light of Dickson C.J.'s comments in Strachan, it appears that the
problem with Cumming J.A.'s reasoning with respect to the statement to Hall is
that he fails to recognize the important connection between the content of the
statement and the s. 10 (b) violation.  The fact is that the Crown sought
to introduce the statement at trial precisely because it allowed it to do
indirectly what the trial judge had ruled the Crown could not do directly:
introduce evidence that the appellant knew where the gun was hidden.  In this
regard, the inclusion of the statement to Hall would directly affect the
fairness of the trial, which is a key consideration in affecting the repute of
the justice system, despite the fact that the statement was but remotely
connected to the unconstitutional conduct.  In effect, excluding the gun while
including the statements effectively eviscerates the Charter of most of
its protective value to the accused in this case; including both would totally
eliminate any such value.  At this point, it is important to recall the
observation by Lamer C.J. in R. v. Bartle, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 173, in which
the opinion was expressed at pp. 208-9 that:








Generally speaking, so long as it is not too remotely
connected with the violation, all the evidence obtained as part of the
""chain of events"" involving the Charter  breach will fall
within the scope of s. 24(2) . . . .

 

See also R. v. Grant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223, per Sopinka
J.

 

43               Returning
to the question of the self-incriminatory nature of the evidence and its effect
on the fairness of the trial, I agree entirely with McEachern C.J.'s reasons
when he states at p. 377:

 

In my view, however, this was
highly damaging evidence because even if the circumstances of finding the gun,
and the gun itself were admissible, the statement to Ms. Hall was the only
evidence that fixed the accused with knowledge that the gun was in the river. 
This fact tended to connect the accused more closely with the crime and could
give rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt on the part of the
accused.  If, as I believe, the finding of the gun and the gun itself was
inadmissible, this statement was the only evidence that proved the gun was even
in a river, and that would make an inference of consciousness of guilt even
stronger....

 

In this connection, it is
significant that the accused did not know that his s. 10 (b) Charter 
rights had been violated at the time he made the first statement to Ms. Hall,
or that the Crown would be reneging on its agreement with him.  More important
is the fact that the statement was so closely related both in time and content
to the breach.

 

44               Furthermore,
I note that in two recent decisions this Court has concluded that, in cases of
including evidence flowing from a s. 10 (b) violation, the onus lies
upon the Crown to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that, regarding the
unfairness of the trial component of the test under s. 24(2) , the accused
would not have consulted counsel even if properly advised: Bartle, supra;
R. v. Pozniak, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 310.  The Crown has clearly not met this
burden, or even the less onerous requirements stipulated in earlier
jurisprudence.

 








45               Moreover,
the serious nature of the Charter  breach in this case also supports the
conclusion that the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute
by the admission of the evidence.  In Collins, supra, at p. 285,
Lamer J. quoted from Le Dain J. in R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613,
at p. 652:

 

The relative seriousness of the
constitutional violation has been assessed in the light of whether it was
committed in good faith, or was inadvertent or of a merely technical nature, or
whether it was deliberate, wilful or flagrant.

 

46               In
this case, it is clear that the violation was wilful and flagrant.  It is also
clear, as discussed earlier, that there was no element of urgency.  Indeed, as
McEachern C.J. notes, the police actually created an artificial situation of
urgency in order to trick the accused into accepting the deal without first
consulting a lawyer.

 

47               As
to the third branch of the Collins test, I am satisfied that the effect
of excluding the evidence on the reputation of the administration of justice
will be incidental and far outweighed by the negative consequences that would
follow were this unconstitutional evidence to be included.  I realize that the
appellant stands accused of a serious offence.  However, as shall become
evident in my disposition of this matter, the end result of allowing this
appeal is not the issuance of a stay, but the ordering of a new trial in which
the accused will have to meet the lawful evidence adduced against him.  All
that is required is the holding of the constitutionally mandated fair trial
that should have occurred in the first place, and would have occurred were it
not for the misconduct of the law enforcement agents.

 








48               I also find the submission
that the impugned evidence ought to be included since there is likely
sufficient properly admissible evidence to convict the appellant to be
unpersuasive.  While it is undeniable that the Crown had a very strong case
even without the impugned evidence, this Court has made it clear that the
admission of self-incriminatory derivative evidence will generally affect the
fairness of the trial and thereby bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.  In any event, I find the respondent's argument that the admission
of the gun or the other derivative evidence did not play a central role in the
trial to be irrelevant to s. 24(2) .  Although the effect of evidence at
the trial may be relevant in a consideration of the third set of factors under Collins
-- namely the effects of excluding the evidence on the reputation of the
administration of justice, no framework has been established by the
jurisprudence to consider the effect of including the evidence.  Nor
should such a framework be presently created.

 

49               In
the case at bar, the nature of the Crown's argument in this regard is that,
since the impugned evidence is not extremely probative or decisive given the
plethora of other clearly admissible evidence inculpating the appellant, this
somehow diminishes the fact that it was obtained pursuant to an egregious
constitutional violation.  Taken one step further, this argument leads to the
anomalous result that the Crown, while arguing strenuously that the impugned
evidence should not be excluded, supports this claim by contending that the
evidence was, after all, not really that important in the context of the
appellant's trial.

 








50               In
response, I underscore that we should never lose sight of the fact that even a
person accused of the most heinous crimes, and no matter the likelihood that he
or she actually committed those crimes, is entitled to the full protection of
the Charter .  Short-cutting or short-circuiting those rights affects not
only the accused, but also the entire reputation of the criminal justice
system.  It must be emphasized that the goals of preserving the integrity of
the criminal justice system as well as promoting the decency of investigatory
techniques are of fundamental importance in applying s. 24(2) .

 

51               These
goals operate independently of the type of crime for which the individual
stands accused.  I note that my colleague, L'Heureux-Dubé J., suggests that the
fact that the crime for which appellant is charged (first degree murder) is the
most serious in Canada militates in favour of including the unconstitutionally
obtained evidence.  This contradicts the pronouncement of this Court in Collins
in which Lamer J. held at p. 286:

 

I hasten to add, however, that if the admission of the
evidence would result in an unfair trial, the seriousness of the offence could
not render that evidence admissible.

 








52               Given
the seriousness of the Charter  violations, I agree with McEachern C.J.
that this is not a case where the curative effect of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  is appropriate since the admission of the
unconstitutionally obtained evidence at trial amounted, in my mind, to a
""substantial wrong"" toward both the accused as well as the
administration of justice: Elshaw, supra. After all, the
improperly obtained evidence formed a critical component of the Crown's case
and it cannot be said that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict
would have been different were this evidence to have been properly excluded at
trial: R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599.  This is not a case that fits
into the small exception mentioned in Elshaw, supra, at
p. 46, where the curative provision could apply notwithstanding that
evidence should have been excluded under s. 24(2) .  Unlike in R. v.
Hodge (1993), 133 N.B.R. (2d) 240, where the curative provision was applied
because the evidence excluded under s. 24(2)  could not have factored very
significantly in the conviction of the accused, I find that there was a
reasonable possibility that the impugned evidence in this case (a murder weapon
and evidence that the accused took the police to find that weapon) could have
weighed significantly in his conviction.  The trial judge's instruction to the
jury reproduced by L'Heureux-Dubé J. does not alter my view in this regard.

 

53               On
a broader note, I am reluctant to open the door to the possibility that it
shall become commonplace for an accused to prove a Charter  breach
sufficient to impugn the repute of the administration of justice and then have
s.  686(1) (b)(iii) deny that person the opportunity to have a fair
trial in which he or she shall face evidence obtained in a constitutional
manner.  Consideration should be given to limiting the Elshaw exception
only to cases in which it can be shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the
impugned evidence excluded under s. 24(2)  in light of a Charter 
violation did not contribute at all to the original verdict.  Focus is thus
made on whether the unconstitutionally conscripted evidence in any way
influenced the verdict.  See David M. Tanovich, ""Can the Improper
Admission of Evidence Under the Charter  Ever be Cured?"" (1994), 32
C.R. (4th) 82.

 








54               I
also note, in closing, that in John v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 476,
this Court held that appellate courts should not retry cases to assess the
worth of residual evidence after improperly adduced evidence has been
extracted, given that appeal courts do not have the advantage of seeing the
witnesses and were never intended to replace the triers of fact.  It was noted
in John that in cases were such situations arise, s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
should not be invoked, but rather a new trial ought to be ordered.  I find
that, although the facts of John are different from those in the case at
bar, the conclusions of law proposed by Estey and Lamer JJ. in that case are
apposite to the present analysis.

 

55               Consequently,
a new trial should be ordered in which the impugned evidence will not be
admitted, namely: (1) the Hall testimony regarding the appellant's recounting
of the events of the night of January 4, 1985; (2) evidence that police divers
had found the gun in the river; (3) the Biddlecome and Lewis testimony identifying
the murder weapon at trial; and (4) the gun itself.  I add that, as was found
at trial, the appellant's confession as well as his gestures and directions to
the police with regard to the location of the gun are equally inadmissible. 
The Crown, if it chooses, can properly introduce the rest of the evidence it
has adduced against the accused, including, as noted by McEachern C.J., the
evidence of Biddlecome and Lewis that the accused had possession of a sawed off
.410 shotgun shortly before the disappearance of Ms. Worms as well as
Hall's testimony that the accused had told her he was actually present when
Biddlecome had beaten and killed Ms. Worms.

 

56               
Since preparing the above, I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of
Sopinka J. regarding the manner in which the Court has been applying s. 24(2) 
of the Charter  since the Collins decision.  I concur with his
reasons.

 

C.  Conclusion

 

57               I
would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, and, in lieu thereof, would order a new trial to be held consistent
with these reasons.

 








//L'Heureux-Dubé J.//

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

58               L'Heureux-Dubé J. (dissenting in part)
-- I have read the reasons of my colleague Justice Iacobucci and I agree with
him that the accused's rights under s. 10 (b) of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms  were clearly violated in the case at bar. I must
respectfully disagree, however, with his proposed remedy under s. 24(2)  of the Charter . 
In particular, I do not believe that the administration of justice would be
brought into disrepute by the admission of the voluntary statements by the
accused to his girlfriend or, under these unusual circumstances, by the
admission of the murder weapon.  At the outset, it is necessary to elaborate
somewhat on the circumstances under which these two impugned pieces of evidence
became available to the police, as well as the circumstances under which they
were admitted at trial.

 

I. Facts and Judgments

 








59               In
October 16, 1984, 20-year-old Denean Worms was found dead in a gravel pit in
Cranbrook, B.C.  She was naked, and had been shot twice in the head at contact
range by a .410 shotgun.  Semen was found in her vagina.  On December 30, 1984,
also in Cranbrook, 16-year-old Brenda Hughes was found dead in her family
house, murdered in a virtually identical manner.  Terrence Burlingham was
arrested on January 1, 1985 in connection with the murder of Brenda Hughes.  He
confessed that same day to the killing of Hughes and took the police to his
parents' home where a sawed-off shotgun and some pellet shells were found.  On
the basis of the factual similarities between the murders of Worms and Hughes,
the officers were convinced that the appellant was also responsible for the
earlier death of Worms.  Accordingly, they continued their interrogation of the
appellant.

 

60               Following
a lengthy and manipulative interrogation of the accused, during which the he
repeatedly denied any involvement in the Worms murder, the police consulted on
Friday, January 4 with Crown counsel, who authorized them to offer a
""deal"" to the accused.  The Crown authorized the officers to say that
the Crown would accept a guilty plea to a second degree murder charge in
relation to the Worms murder if the appellant cooperated by providing them with
information about the Worms murder, including the location of the weapon used. 
The officers, however, misled the appellant by indicating to him that if he
cooperated, he would be charged with second degree murder.  The accused
continued to resist and to insist that he wished to speak to his lawyer.  The
officers repeatedly denigrated his lawyer and persevered in trying to convince
him to accept the ""deal"", emphasizing that the deal was only open for
the weekend.  Finally, the accused called another lawyer, and asked that lawyer
if he would act for him at trial.  The lawyer assented and advised him not to
say anything to the police.  Immediately thereafter, however, the appellant
took the two investigating officers to a bridge on the Kootenay River and
pointed out where he had thrown the .410 shotgun that had been used to kill
Worms.  Later, he made several inculpatory statements and then drove with them
to the gravel pit and pointed out the spot where he had shot his victim, as
well as the location where he had hidden her body.

 








61               A
day later, a .410 sawed-off shotgun was recovered from the river at the place
which the appellant had indicated to police.  That same day, the appellant
volunteered to his girlfriend, Judy Hall, that he had shown police the location
of the gun.  In addition, in a visit approximately two months later, in the
early spring of 1985, he told Hall that he had been present during the killing,
but that it was his friend, Biddlecome, who had beaten and killed Worms.  This
story, however, was at least partly false because there was no physical
evidence that Worms had been beaten.

 

62               At
trial for the murder of Worms, notwithstanding that the appellant had delivered
on his side of the ""deal"", the Crown nonetheless proceeded with a
first degree murder charge.  Although the trial judge did not find the
authorities' failure to keep their side of the ""deal"" to amount to an
abuse of process, he concluded that the police conduct constituted a serious
violation of s. 10 (b) of the Charter .  I agree with my
colleague's affirmation of this finding, as well as with his conclusion that s.
10 (b) mandates that the Crown or police, when offering a plea bargain,
must tender that offer either to the accused's counsel or to the accused while
in the presence of his or her counsel, unless the accused has expressly waived
the right to counsel.

 








63               As
a result of finding the s. 10 (b) violation, the trial judge excluded all
of the accused's inculpatory statements to police, as well as the evidence that
the accused had pointed the police to the murder weapon and to the site of the
murder.  Had this been the end of the story, then it follows that the Crown
would not have been able to introduce into evidence the actual gun, or the
evidence of Lewis' and Biddlecome's identifying that gun, unless the Crown were
able to point to a sufficient nexus between the accused and the gun that would
have made the gun relevant to the trial.  Without such a nexus, the gun would
just be a gun found in a river, and would not be probative of any material
issue at trial.  Unfortunately for the appellant, however, the story does not
end here.  Instead, the day after cooperating with the police, he volunteered
to his girlfriend, Judy Hall, that he had indicated the location of the gun to
the police.  In a voir dire, the trial judge found this statement to be
admissible at trial, and consequently found the fact of the finding of the gun,
as well as the gun itself, to be admissible into evidence on the basis of that
statement.

 

64               The
appellant appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal on numerous grounds,
including the correctness of the trial judge's ruling as to abuse of process,
the admission into evidence of the accused's voluntary statement on January 5
to Hall, as well as the admission into evidence of the finding of the gun and
the gun itself.  Southin and Cumming JJ.A. dismissed the appellant's appeal. 
McEachern C.J.,  in dissent, would have excluded all of the derivative evidence
flowing from the s. 10 (b) violation on the basis that its admission
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

II.  Analysis

 

65               My
colleague would favour excluding this evidence under s. 24(2)  on the basis that
""but for"" the s. 10 (b) violation, the police clearly would not
have found the murder weapon.  He further concludes that the statement to Hall,
though voluntary and not to a person in authority, and though not necessarily
""caused"" directly by the Charter  breach, must nonetheless also
be excluded under s. 24(2)  because it was proximately connected to the Charter 
breach.  With respect, I disagree.  In order to explain the basis for my
disagreement, however, it is necessary to re-examine the language, spirit and
purpose of s. 24(2)  of the Charter , as well as the approach to that
section as originally set out in R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, and
elaborated upon in subsequent jurisprudence.

 

1. Section 24(2) of the Charter








66               Section
24  of the Charter  reads:

24.(1)
Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter , have been
infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain
such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.

 

 

(2) Where, in proceedings under
subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that
infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter , the
evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the
circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.

 

Many, if not most, judicial guidelines to the purpose and
interpretation of s. 24(2)  of the Charter , and in particular the meaning
of the phrase ""bring the administration of justice into disrepute"",
originate in this Court's decision in Collins.  It is to that decision
that I therefore turn in order to revisit the first principles that underlie
this section of our Charter , and to question whether the course that
this Court has since steered in subsequent jurisprudence remains true to the
language, spirit and purpose of s. 24(2) .

 

(i)  The First Principles of Section 24(2)  Set Down
in R. v. Collins

 








67               In
Collins, a police officer approached a suspect in a pub and seized her
in a ""throat hold"" used to prevent individuals from swallowing
drugs.  At the same time, he directed her to let go of an object in her hand
which turned out to be a balloon carrying heroin.  Although the trial judge
found that the officer did not have the requisite reasonable and probable
grounds for the search, the evidence was nonetheless admitted under s. 24(2) 
and the accused was convicted.  This Court found the trial judge's
determination on the reasonableness of the search to be defective because the
evidential basis for the officer's suspicion was not admitted as a result of a
spurious objection by defence counsel.  Lamer J. (as he then was), for the
majority, then went on to examine whether the evidence should have been
excluded under s. 24(2) .

 

68               Lamer
J. began his analysis of s. 24(2)  by expressing general agreement, at p. 275,
with the following principles governing the interpretation of s. 24(2) , as
summarized by Seaton J.A. in the British Columbia Court of Appeal:

 

-                  It is not open
to the courts in Canada to exclude evidence to discipline the police, but only
to avoid having the administration of justice brought into disrepute.

 

-                  It is the
admission, not the obtaining, that is the focus of the attention under our s.
24(2) , though the manner of obtaining the evidence is obviously one of the
circumstances.

 

-                  Evidence
improperly obtained is prima facie admissible.  The onus is on the
person who wishes the evidence excluded to establish the further ingredient:
that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.

 

-                  Section 24(2) 
does not confer a discretion on the judge but a duty to admit or exclude as a
result of his finding.

 

In what most would agree is the quintessential pronouncement on s.
24(2) , Lamer J. then gave form and substance to several of these principles, at
pp. 280-81:

 








Misconduct by the police in the investigatory process
often has some effect on the repute of the administration of justice, but s.
24(2)  is not a remedy for police misconduct, requiring the exclusion of the
evidence if, because of this misconduct, the administration of justice was
brought into disrepute.  Section 24(2)  could well have been drafted in that
way, but it was not.  Rather, the drafters of the Charter decided to
focus on the admission of the evidence in the proceedings, and the purpose of
s. 24(2)  is to prevent having the administration of justice brought into further
disrepute [emphasis in original] by the admission of the evidence in the
proceedings.  This further disrepute will result from the admission of
evidence that would deprive the accused of a fair hearing, or from judicial condonation
of unacceptable conduct by the investigatory and prosecutorial agencies. 
It will also be necessary to consider any disrepute that may result from the
exclusion of the evidence.  It would be inconsistent with the purpose of s.
24(2)  to exclude evidence if its exclusion would bring the administration of
justice into greater disrepute than would its admission.  Finally, it must
be emphasized that even though the inquiry under s. 24(2)  will necessarily
focus on the specific prosecution, it is the long-term consequences of regular
admission or exclusion of this type of evidence on the repute of the
administration of justice which must be considered. . . . 
[Emphasis added.]

 

This passage expanded upon what was meant by the phrase ""bring
the administration of justice into disrepute"".  More importantly, these
remarks laid the rationale upon which Lamer J. discussed the three categories
of factors that are relevant to determinations under s. 24(2)  of the Charter . 
His concerns over the use of evidence that would deprive the accused of a fair
hearing manifested themselves in the first category: ""factors touching
upon the fairness of the trial"".  His concerns over the judicial
condonation of unacceptable conduct found expression through the second category:
""factors touching upon the seriousness of the violation"".  Finally,
his concerns over remaining true to the underlying purpose of s. 24(2)  of the Charter 
found form in the third category: ""factors governing the effect of
excluding the evidence"".

 

69               Lamer
J. then noted that the fairness of trials is both a constitutionally protected
right and a major source of repute of the judicial system.  He therefore
concluded that where the admission of the evidence would result in an unfair
trial, then the admission of the evidence would tend to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.  In my view, this conclusion, as well
as the three categories of factors outlined in Collins, is completely
consistent with s. 24(2) 's purpose of maintaining the integrity of the judicial
system.

 








70               Another
significant aspect of the approach set out in Collins, was the fact that
the threshold for exclusion under s. 24(2)  was intentionally set lower than the
pre-Charter  ""community shock test"" set out in Rothman v.
The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640.  Although Lamer J. justified this lower
threshold in part on the fact that violations of the Constitution should be
subject to greater scrutiny than ""dirty tricks"" under the common law,
he expounded in some detail upon a second rationale which bears recalling. 
Namely, he observed that while both the English text of s. 24(2)  and the
language used by this Court in Rothman use the words ""would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute"", the French version of
s. 24(2)  provides that evidence shall be excluded that ""could bring
the administration of justice into disrepute"".  He then chose the French
text as the version that was more suited to protecting the right of the accused
to a fair trial.  Consequently, the origins of the Collins test, as well
as the availability of a remedy in s. 24(2) , is actually tied to the French
text rather than to the English text.  Evidence shall be excluded under s.
24(2)  whenever its admission could bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.  I will return to this matter later, for it is significant when
considering the interaction between s. 24(2)  of the Charter  and the
curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 

71               Most
significant of all, however, Lamer J. drew upon (at p. 282) Professor
Yves-Marie Morissette's influential article ""The Exclusion of Evidence
under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms : What to Do and What
Not to Do"" (1984), 29 McGill L.J. 521, to characterize the
determination that lies at the heart of s. 24(2) : 

 

""Would the admission of the evidence bring the
administration of justice into disrepute in the eyes of the reasonable man,
dispassionate and fully apprised of the circumstances of the case?""  The
reasonable person is usually the average person in the community, but only when
that community's current mood is reasonable.








It is manifestly clear that s. 24(2)  was not to be apprised
according to the views of the reasonable lawyer, but simply according to
the reasonable person, so long as he was ""dispassionate and fully
informed of the circumstances"".  This standard sets the ideal towards which
all applications of s. 24(2)  must strive. 

 








72               The
remedial role of s. 24(2)  is very different from the rights and freedoms set
down elsewhere in the Charter .  The Charter  imposes upon Canadian
courts the duty to preserve and protect the rights of the individual as
guaranteed in the Charter .  These rights find their most unequivocal
vindication through s. 24(1)  of the Charter  and s. 52(1)  of the Constitution
Act, 1982 .  Notably, however, our Constitution addresses the exclusion of
evidence with particularity, and entrenches in s. 24(2)  a quintessentially
Canadian compromise.  Section 24(2)  confers directly upon courts the
responsibility to preserve and protect the integrity and repute of the judicial
system.  The vindication of rights, though important, is ultimately only one
factor to be considered in a more complex constitutional equation.  Though
there will be many occasions when the courts' duties under s. 24(2)  complement
the courts' responsibility to give the fullest possible effect to the
individual rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Charter , there may
be other occasions when these two duties conflict.  On those occasions, s.
24(2)  makes it clear that the courts' primary concern must lie in maintaining
the integrity and legitimacy of the judicial system in the eyes of the Canadian
community, assuming that community to be reasonable, dispassionate, and fully
apprised of the circumstances.  Section 24(2)  serves to ensure that, in the
application and enforcement of our laws, our constitutional values neither run
too far ahead nor lag too far behind our basic values as a society.  One of its
purposes is therefore to ensure that the institution charged with upholding
those fundamental values does not lose legitimacy in the eyes of those whose
values it is entrusted to protect.

 

73               Given
the role of s. 24(2)  of the Charter , it is just as important that we
remain faithful to the spirit and purpose of this remedial provision as it is
to remain consistent with the purpose of the individual rights and freedoms
guaranteed within the Charter .  Although the balance can sometimes be a
difficult one, it is not one which the court can avoid.  Academic commentary
such as that of Professor David M. Paciocco, in ""The Judicial Repeal of s.
24(2)  and the Development of the Canadian Exclusionary Rule"" (1990), 32 Crim.
L.Q. 326, at pp. 341-43, suggests that this Court's evolving jurisprudence
on s. 24(2)  has failed to effect this balance, and has therefore been
unfaithful to its constitutional mandate under that section:

 

As a matter of construction, s.
24(2)  decidedly focuses on the ... imperative of judicial integrity, the
maintenance of popular trust in the judicial branch of government.  The phrase states that the concern is with whether the admission
of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
Disrepute has to do with reputation and reputation has to do with what others
think of you, not with what standards you would like to emulate.  If one was to
boil all of this down into simple terms and to appreciate it in its historical
context, one would be driven to conclude that the framers of the Charter  were
attempting to fashion a cautious exclusionary rule where evidence would be
refused only in relatively extreme cases; after all, there were no signs at
the time that s. 24(2)  was drafted that the administration of justice was
suffering disrepute as a result of a long-standing position that the method of
obtainment was irrelevant to the admissibility of probative evidence.

 

Despite this, the Supreme Court
of Canada has fashioned what has proved, in at least a wide spectrum of cases,
to be an extremely aggressive exclusionary remedy.  It set the stage for doing
so by leaving the partially implicit but unmistakable message that s. 24(2) 
should be understood as though it was intended to preserve judicial integrity,
regardless of the impact of exclusion on the reputation of the judicial branch.

 

                                                                    ...

 








In essence, all of this means that judges in
applying s. 24(2)  of the Charter  have a luxury that is not available elsewhere;
they themselves get to define what conduct of theirs will bring them into
disrepute.  In so holding the court has done more than a little violence to the
concept of disrepute. [Êmphasis by underlining
added.]

 

74               I
note, as well, the findings of carefully conducted surveys which suggest that,
although the Canadian public shares this Court's views as to what factors are
important in the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2) , there is a material gap
between public opinion and this Court regarding how those factors would be applied:
see A. W. Bryant, M. Gold, H. M. Stevenson and D. Northrup, ""Public
Attitudes Toward the Exclusion of Evidence: Section 24(2)  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms "" (1990), 69 Can. Bar Rev. 1, and
""Public Support for the Exclusion of Unconstitutionally Obtained
Evidence"" (1990), 1 S.C.L.R. (2d) 555.  On one hand, I am in basic
agreement with the concern expressed in Collins, at p. 282, that
""[t]he Charter  is designed to protect the accused from the
majority, so the enforcement of the Charter  must not be left to that
majority"".  I am also sensitive to the fact that public opinion surveys,
no matter how carefully culled, are rarely without their weaknesses.  On the
other hand, however, given that the express purpose of s. 24(2)  is to maintain
the repute of the justice system, I believe that we also cannot dismiss them
completely out of hand.  A periodic ""reality check"" is both healthy
and necessary in order to ensure that the discretion to exclude evidence under
s. 24(2)  is exercised in conformity with long-term community values.

 








75               Let
me start by first acknowledging that the road upon which this Court originally
embarked was the right one.  In particular, returning to the first principles
outlined in Collins, I believe that the ""reasonable person,
dispassionate and fully apprised of the circumstances"" would most
generally agree that the administration of justice tends to be brought into
disrepute when the fairness of the hearing may be undermined by the admission
of unconstitutionally obtained evidence.  This hypothetical person would also
agree that, in certain cases, the conduct of the police or of the Crown may be
so unacceptable that admission of evidence obtained in such a manner would tend
to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Finally, this person
would agree that, notwithstanding these two considerations, there may still be
exceptional situations in which the exclusion of the impugned evidence would
bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute than its inclusion. 
As such, I believe that the ""reasonable person"" would approve of the
three criteria set out by this Court in Collins.  In my respectful
opinion, however, the hypothetical ""reasonable person"" would then
point to the fork in the road which has ultimately led this Court to misapply
s. 24(2)  -- our approach to ""factors governing the fairness of the trial"".

 

(ii)   The Fairness of the
""Trial""

 

76               It
is interesting to note, at the outset, that when Lamer J. originally set out in
Collins, at p. 281, the considerations that should animate the
interpretation of s. 24(2)  of the Charter , he spoke of the fairness of
the hearing.  At page 284, however, he directed his remarks not to the
fairness of the hearing, but to the fairness of the trial:

 

The trial is a key part of the administration of
justice, and the fairness of Canadian trials is a major source of the repute of
the system and is now a right guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter . 
If the admission of the evidence in some way affects the fairness of the trial,
then the admission of the evidence would tend to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute and, subject to consideration of the
other factors, the evidence generally should be excluded. [Emphasis in
original.]

 








He then went on to distinguish between the admission of evidence that
was real and that which was self-incriminatory.  In his opinion, where an
accused is conscripted against him- or herself to provide a confession or other
evidence emanating from the accused, then such evidence would by definition
generally affect ""the very fairness of the trial"", since it did not
exist prior to the violation and since it strikes at one of the fundamental
tenets of a fair trial, the right against self-incrimination.  At that time, Le
Dain J. wrote concurring reasons in Collins, sounding a cautionary note
regarding the role of ""trial fairness"" in the s. 24(2)  analysis.  In
my respectful view, the passage of time has borne out his concerns.  The
grouping of too many factors under the rubric of ""trial fairness"",
the encroachment of which we are told must almost inevitably lead to exclusion
of the evidence, has led this Court to depart from the first principles and
underlying purposes animating s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

77               This
deviation has become more evident over time.  We now know that any evidence
that could not have been obtained ""but for"" the participation of the
accused is classified as self-incriminatory in nature, and is therefore decreed
to affect the fairness of the trial, and thereby most likely to require
exclusion due to an application of the first branch of the Collins
test:  R. v. Ross, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 16.  This has come to be
known in many circles as the discoverability doctrine.  Thus, in a very
significant number of cases, the multi-facetted Collins framework has
been subsumed within its first branch.

 








78               I
believe this subtle yet significant expansion of the first branch of the Collins
test to have come about as a result of an equally subtle shift in terminology. 
This Court went from speaking of the repute of the justice system being
affected in terms of possible unfairness of the hearing (Collins,
at p. 281), to being affected in terms of unfairness of the trial (Collins,
at p. 284), to being affected in terms of unfairness of the trial process.
See, e.g., R. v. Ross; Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of
Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 425, per La Forest J.; R. v. Mellenthin, [1992] 3 S.C.R.
615; R. v. Prosper, [1994] 3 S.C.R 236, per Lamer C.J.  I believe
Iacobucci J.'s approach in the present case to take the definition of
""trial unfairness"" even one step further than ever before, moreover,
by concluding as a matter of law that the ""fairness of the trial"" is
adversely affected as a result of a ""proximate connection"" between
the impugned evidence (i.e., the accused's voluntary statements to his
girlfriend) and the s. 10 (b) Charter  violation.  Each time the
terminology has changed, it has expanded the scope of the first branch of the Collins
analysis, and thereby increased the likelihood that virtually absolute
exclusionary consequences will follow from a s. 24(2)  analysis. 

 

79               The
paradigmatic shift that has resulted in the adoption of the ""but for""
approach to s. 24(2)  has most dramatic implications.  Its magnitude is perhaps
most fully appreciated by returning once again to the proverbial grandfather of
s. 24(2)  jurisprudence.  In Collins, the majority of the Court
elaborated its three-part framework in the context of an unconstitutional
search of a bar patron, which resulted in the finding of a balloon of heroin
clenched in her hand.  In determining whether the heroin obtained in the
illegal search should be excluded under s. 24(2) , its application of the first
set of factors, concerning the fairness of the trial, is most informative (at
p. 288):

 

The evidence obtained as a result
of the search was real evidence and, while prejudicial to the accused as
evidence tendered by the Crown usually is, there is nothing to suggest that
its use at the trial would render the trial unfair. [Emphasis added.]

 








The heroin was excluded on the basis of the second branch of the Collins
test, since the violation was both flagrant and serious, and since it was
unacceptable conduct for police to take flying tackles at people, seizing them
by the throat, if they did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe
that these people were dangerous or handlers of drugs.  For the Court to signal
its condonation of the officer's acts by nonetheless admitting the evidence
could bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute than if the
evidence were to be excluded and the accused were subsequently acquitted. 
Given that the officer had not had the opportunity to explain the basis for his
search, however, a new trial was ordered, at which time the reasonable and
probable grounds for the search could be properly ascertained.

 

80               By
contrast, only five years later, in Mellenthin, this Court excluded
under s. 24(2)  drugs found by an officer pursuant to a search of a car at a
random roadside sobriety check.  Cory J. found the drugs to have been discovered
as a result of an unconstitutional search and concluded that ""but
for"" this Charter  violation, the drugs would never have been
found.  In other words, although the drugs were real, they were
self-incriminatory in the sense that they would not have been discovered but
for the rights violation.  He therefore excluded the evidence as a result of
his analysis under the first branch of Collins.  His analysis under the
first branch of the Collins test mentioned the following factors (at p.
629) as relating to the fairness of the trial:

 

The unreasonable search carried
out in this case is the very kind which the Court wished to make clear is
unacceptable.  A check stop does not and cannot constitute a general search
warrant for searching every vehicle, driver and passenger that is pulled over. 
Unless there are reasonable and probable grounds for conducting the search, or
drugs, alcohol or weapons are in plain view in the interior of the vehicle, the
evidence flowing from such a search should not be admitted.

 








It would surely affect the
fairness of the trial should check stops be accepted as a basis for warrantless
searches and the evidence derived from them was to be automatically admitted. 
To admit evidence obtained in an unreasonable and unjustified search carried
out while a motorist was detained in a check stop would adversely and unfairly
affect the trial process and most surely bring the administration of justice
into disrepute. [Emphasis added.]

 

In view of the foregoing conclusion, Cory J. thought it unnecessary
to consider the other branches of the Collins test, but nonetheless went
on to conclude that the evidence should also be excluded on the basis of the
second branch of the Collins test because the violation was a serious
one involving unacceptable conduct which should not be condoned by the justice
system.  He did not give any consideration to the third branch of the Collins
test.

 

81               It
becomes evident how far this Court has deviated from its original approach to
s. 24(2)  when we transplant the ""but for"" standard employed in Mellenthin
back to Collins.  If, in Collins, Lamer J. had approached the
problem in the manner suggested by Cory J. in Mellenthin, he should have
concluded that ""but for"" the Charter  violation, the officer
would not have seized the heroin balloon from the suspect in the bar.  There
was no evidence to suggest that the officer could have seized the drugs in any
other way.  Yet how is it that Lamer J. concluded for the majority in Collins
that this evidence, though prejudicial in the ordinary sense, did not
render the trial unfair, and therefore did not tend to the almost
automatic exclusion of the evidence?  Why have our notions of what constitutes
a ""fair trial"", and thereby inevitably leads to exclusion, changed so
profoundly in the space of the five years between Collins and Mellenthin?

 

82               With
great respect, I suggest that we have lost sight of the original concerns that
motivated the Court to remark that the admission of evidence affecting the
fairness of the hearing would generally tend to bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.








83               In
my view, the essence of those original concerns is reflected in the concurring
reasons of Lamer J. in Rothman in which he provided an important
jurisprudential stepping stone between the traditional common law
""voluntariness"" rule and s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  In the
context of his discussion of the confessions rule and the power of courts to
exclude certain types of evidence, he recognized that reliability was an
important consideration as to whether or not evidence should be excluded, but
then went on to say that the discretion of a trial judge to exclude evidence
must extend beyond that criteria.  He therefore favoured a two-step analysis. 
The first stage was reliability.  Where anything done by the authorities casts
some doubt as to the accused's having been induced to make a possible
unreliable statement, then that statement would be excluded.  The second
component was a general discretion on the part of the judge to exclude reliable
and probative evidence where it was obtained in circumstances that threatened
the integrity of the judicial system.

 

84               Section
24(2)  of the Charter  was not enacted in a vacuum.  As numerous
commentators have noted, it reflected a compromise between a Canadian common
law rule which focused almost exclusively on reliability and an American
exclusionary rule which focused largely on police misconduct.  It was intended
as a cautious expansion of the Canadian common law.  Many of its values are
reflected in Lamer J.'s reasoning in Rothman v. The Queen.  I will
outline below why I believe that the two-part framework outlined in Rothman
v. The Queen forms the underpinnings of the approach to s. 24(2)  taken by
this Court in R. v. Collins.  In my view, at the heart of R. v.
Collins, building as it did on Rothman v. The Queen, is the
recognition of two fundamental concerns, the encroachment of either of which
could bring the administration of justice into disrepute within the meaning of
s. 24(2) .

 








85               The
first basic concern groups together all of the common law and Charter 
protections of the accused that ultimately relate to liberty and
truth-seeking.  For the sake of simplicity, I shall call it the
""Reliability Principle"".  In essence, this principle dictates that
our justice system must be constantly and intensely vigilant to ensure that
innocent persons not be convicted.  Where the individual's liberty is at stake,
then these protections take on added significance and additional dimensions. 
In accordance with this principle, the trial must not amount to an attempt by
the Crown to ""win"" its case against the accused:  see, e.g.,  R.
v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.  Rather, the trial is undertaken as a
truth-seeking activity, and its conduct is animated by the overarching need for
the accurate determination of innocence or guilt.  As such, the trial itself
must be conducted so as to maximize the accuracy of the outcome and minimize
the possibility of wrongful conviction.  Evidence that may be unreliable or
that has the potential to mislead a trier of fact is at the heart of this
concern, and will generally be excluded.  Accordingly, under the Reliability
Principle, the use at trial of evidence, obtained in a manner that violated the
Charter , that may mislead the trier of fact could render that trial unfair,
and could bring the administration of justice into disrepute in the eyes of the
reasonable person, dispassionate and fully apprised of the circumstances.  In
other words, where the unfairness flowing from the Charter  violation may
touch in any way upon the actual adjudicative process, then this kind of
evidence must almost inevitably be excluded.

 








 86              The
second basic concern relates to life, security of the person and, within that
same rubric, fundamental human dignity.  For the sake of convenience, I shall
refer to this principle as the ""Fairness Principle"".  This principle
groups together all of the common law and Charter  protections that
breathe life into the notion that the individual should be free from
unwarranted interference with the state.  In essence, it recognizes the vital
importance in ensuring that the state treat each individual in accordance with
basic principles of decency and fair play.  Failure to treat the individual in
such a manner is offensive both to our common law and to our Charter . 
Unlike the first concern, however, this concern does not relate to notions of
reliability and potential for prejudice, or to the possible conviction of
innocent persons.  Rather, it acknowledges that the use of certain methods to
build a case against an individual denigrates the values and mores which we
consider fundamental to a free and democratic Canadian society.  It recognizes
that these methods undermine our social fabric.  It recognizes that these costs
are endured over the long-term, that they are ultimately borne by all within
society, and that they considerably outweigh any benefit to society gained by
conviction of an individual accused.  For this reason, judicial condonation of
acts that violate this principle will also tend to bring the administration of
justice into disrepute in the eyes of a reasonable person, dispassionate and
fully apprised of the circumstances.

 

87               These
two fundamental concerns reflect, in my view, the ""principles underlying
the principles"".  They have found expression in such varied forms as the
presumption of innocence, the right to silence, the principle against
self-incrimination, the doctrine of abuse of process, and a whole host of other
protections under the common law and Charter . (See R. v. S. (R.J.),
[1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, per L'Heureux-Dubé J.)  Those protections, and many
others, have developed over the ages within our common law and most recently
within our Charter  as methods of giving substance and meaning to these
two most fundamental of principles.  In my view, it is most consistent with the
goals of s. 24(2) , as well as with the courts' duty to guard jealously the
reputation of our system of justice, to build an analytical framework that
encourages consideration of those two most fundamental of principles.   








88               In
my opinion, evidence is capable of affecting ""trial fairness"",
as that term is employed in the first branch of R. v. Collins, where its
admission could give rise to concerns analogous to, or falling within, the
rubric of the Reliability Principle, outlined above.  Where, by contrast, the
complaint about the impugned evidence is, for instance, that it would not have
been obtained ""but for"" the rights violation, then this complaint
relates more fundamentally to the Fairness Principle.  The objection to the
admission of the evidence is not that it has the potential to mislead a trier
of fact or convict an innocent person, but rather that the manner in
which the authorities obtained the evidence was fundamentally unfair, and
erodes values that are fundamental to our society.  I therefore believe that
the fact that the evidence could not have been obtained ""but for"" the
rights violation is more accurately viewed as a relevant consideration to the
second branch of the Collins framework: the impact of the seriousness of
the rights violation on the reputation of the justice system.  I shall return
to this matter shortly.

 

89               To
summarize, given that this Court uses ""trial fairness"" within s.
24(2)  as a proxy for circumstances in which the administration of justice is
almost inevitably brought into disrepute, and where any other mitigating
considerations or circumstances are virtually irrelevant, I believe that it is
most consistent with the purpose and spirit of s. 24(2)  to define that category
of factors narrowly.  In my respectful view, it runs counter to the inherently
discretionary nature of a s. 24(2)  determination, which is to be made
""having regard to all of the circumstances"", to formulate rigid rules
or presumptions for the exclusion or admission of different kinds of evidence. 
Thus, to the extent that this Court decides to set down such a rule in regard
to ""trial fairness"", I believe that it should take care not to define
that concept so broadly as to allow the ""trial fairness"" tail to wag
the s. 24(2)  dog.

 








90               Classifying
evidence as ""self-incriminatory"" or ""real"", or
""discoverable"" or ""not discoverable"" is not, nor should it
be, an end in itself. For this reason, I have considerable sympathy for the
following observations of Professor David M. Paciocco in ""The Judicial
Repeal of s. 24(2)  and the Development of the Canadian Exclusionary Rule"",
supra, at pp. 353-54:

 

The whole historical
development of s. 24(2) drives home the point that it was intended to be a
compromise between what is typically but inaccurately characterized as the
automatic exclusionary rule in the United States, and the traditional common
law Canadian position whereby evidence is admissible if relevant and material,
regardless of how it was obtained.  Out of distaste
and distrust for the American regime the first public draft of the Charter  had
provided expressly that no exclusionary remedy could be developed to enforce
the Charter .  Strong submissions against this position were made by various
public-interest groups who favoured an exclusionary rule.  Ultimately, s. 24(2)
was adopted as a compromise position.  It promised to be a provision which
answered the most common objection to having an exclusionary enforcement
mechanism, that requiring the exclusion of unconstitutionally obtained evidence
may provide disproportionate relief to accused persons; serious offenders may
be acquitted because of constitutional violations which are not nearly as
shocking or outrageous as the crime shown by the evidence to have been
committed.

 

The rejection of the polar
extremes has been drafted into the provision.  The section requires courts to
determine whether admission of the evidence in question could cause the
relevant kind of disrepute, ""having regard to all of the
circumstances"".  The spirit of the provision, if not that very language,
calls into question the legitimacy of developing even quasi-automatic
principles for exclusion.  Despite this, the court has produced just such a
principle, and its implications are enormous. [Emphasis
added.]

          

91               Kerans
J.A. in his thoughtful discussion of s. 24(2) in R. v. Meddoui (1990),
61 C.C.C. (3d) 345 (Alta. C.A.), at p. 367, raised comparable concerns:

 








Perhaps mistakenly, I have dealt
with the issue of discoverability as one that arises under the
""fairness"" rule in Collins, supra.  If one labels the trial as
unfair, one leaves little scope for review of factors that might argue against
exclusion, like a minimal breach, urgency, and the like.  One might be
forced to say something silly like this:  the trial was unfair, but the
administration of justice was not placed in disrepute.  I do not object to a
categorization of the advantage, in an abstract sense, as ""unfair"" so
long as one keeps in mind that s. 24  refuses to accept that it is always
unfair.  The reference to the reputation of the administration of justice in s.
24 , as all agree, can have no sense other than that, in the concrete, any unfairness
to the accused might in some cases be overborn by other factors.  A balancing
must occur. [Emphasis added.]

 

I reached a similar conclusion in R. v. Dersch, [1993] 3
S.C.R. 768, at p. 784.  Unfairness in the manner certain evidence was obtained,
or in the fact that certain evidence was obtained, does not necessarily render
the trial unfair.  We must therefore be circumspect in defining what type of
evidence, or what circumstances, will inevitably lead to exclusion under
s. 24(2)  of the Charter . 

 

92               There
is an important lesson to be learned from the difficulties encountered south of
our border.  I cannot help but reflect upon the irony of the fact that in Collins,
at p. 275, the majority of this Court ""unconditionally endorsed""
Seaton J.A.'s review in Collins (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 141 (B.C.C.A.), at
pp. 151-54, of the unfortunate U.S. experience with a rigid exclusionary rule. 
In that review, Seaton J.A. noted that American courts, in order to lessen the
impact of their exclusionary rule, have found more and more searches to be
lawful, and more and more evidence-giving situations to be outside the scope of
the rule.  Professor Paciocco, in ""The Judicial Repeal of s. 24(2)  and the
Development of the Canadian Exclusionary Rule"", supra, at pp.
360-61, has noted what is perhaps the beginning of a similar trend in Canada,
in cases such as R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, and R. v. Wiggins,
[1990] 1 S.C.R. 62.

 

(iii)  Returning to the Collins
Framework and to First Principles

 








93               As
I have said earlier, I am convinced that the reasonable person, dispassionate
and fully apprised of the circumstances, would approve of the basic framework
set out in Collins.  Rather than set out any rigid legal
""test"", however, I prefer to revitalize the approach taken in Collins,
and to provide a non-exhaustive list of factors which should be considered in
the course of a s. 24(2)  determination, as well as a basic analytical framework
according to which those considerations may be structured.  I start, as well,
with the basic premise, approved in Collins, at p. 275, that evidence
obtained in an unconstitutional manner is prima facie admissible until
the accused demonstrates that its admission could bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.

 

94               As
I have already mentioned, the first set of factors relates to the exclusion of
evidence which may offend the Reliability Principle.  Where anything done by
the authorities casts some doubt as to the accused's having been induced to
make a possibly unreliable statement, then the evidence obtained under such
circumstances touches upon the Reliability Principle.  This set of factors
relates to any circumstances under which a person may be convicted of an
offence of which he or she is innocent.  As such, they relate to the fairness
of the trial and its corollary, the right to make full answer and
defence.  The admission of unconstitutionally obtained evidence which may
render the trial unfair in this manner could bring the administration of
justice into disrepute in the eyes of a reasonable person, dispassionate and
fully apprised of the circumstances.  

 








95               Such
evidence should almost inevitably be excluded, although consideration should
still be had of the other two branches of the Collins test.  Where a
risk of unfairness in the actual trial is identified, considerations relating
to the second branch of the Collins framework, the seriousness of the
violation, will generally only aggravate, rather than palliate, the potential
for disrepute to the justice system flowing from the admission of the impugned
evidence.  Moreover, where the admission of the evidence could give rise to
concerns relating to the fairness of the trial, then I would agree in
principle with the observation in Collins, at p. 286, that the disrepute
arising from the admission of the impugned evidence will be greater if the
offence is more serious.

 

96               The
second category of factors in our s. 24(2)  framework relates to the impact of
the seriousness of the rights violation on the reputation of the justice
system.  The concerns grouped within this general rubric include all those
potentially infringing the Fairness Principle.

 

97               Within
this rubric, considerable regard should be had to the potential long-term
effect on the reputation of the justice system of judicial condonation of the
kind of behaviour engaged in by the authorities.  In Collins, for
instance, it was noted at p. 288 that

 

we cannot accept that police officers take flying
tackles at people and seize them by the throat when they do not have reasonable
and probable grounds to believe that those people are either dangerous or
handlers of drugs.

 








Similarly, in Mellenthin, albeit as part of his discussion of
""trial fairness"" under the first branch of the Collins test,
Cory J. took great exception to the possibility that police could, without
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that they would find anything,
simply search a vehicle which they had stopped for the altogether different
purpose of a routine sobriety check.  If both Collins and Mellenthin
recognize that over the long-term this kind of activity by state actors affects
the rights of all Canadians, then it constitutes a fundamental and important
infringement of the right of ordinary citizens to be free from unwarranted
interference by the state.  For the justice system to condone such intrusive
activity by nonetheless admitting the fruits of such searches into evidence
could therefore, absent other circumstances, bring the administration of
justice into disrepute in the eyes of the reasonable person, dispassionate and
fully apprised.

 

98               Other
factors that have been identified as relevant to the question of the
seriousness of the violation relate more closely to the particular
circumstances surrounding the impugned violation.  Did the violation occur in
circumstances of urgency or necessity?  Was the conduct that led to the
violation of the Charter  wilful or flagrant, or was the violation
inadvertent or committed in good faith?  In this respect, since the accused is
not generally in a position to demonstrate the officer's mala fides, it
is reasonable that an accused need only point to conduct which plausibly
indicates bad faith before the onus shifts as a practical matter to the Crown
to demonstrate the good faith of the officers involved.  

 








99               Another
important consideration, as I have already noted, is whether the impugned
evidence would likely have been obtained in any event, or whether the evidence
could not have been obtained but for the violation.  Where the impugned
evidence could not have been obtained ""but for"" the rights violation,
then this undoubtedly visits an unfairness upon the accused.  With great
respect, however, I would not go so far as my colleagues as to say that such
evidence must therefore almost inevitably be excluded.  In my view,
discoverability is an important, albeit not determinative, factor in
considering how the seriousness of the rights violation will affect the
reputation of the justice system, as measured by the long-term values of the
community.  We must always bear in mind that the language of s. 24(2)  clearly
requires that the court's inquiry be conducted ""having regard to all the
circumstances"".

 

100             The
third branch of the Collins test need only be broached if the judge has
concluded that evidence should tend to be excluded on the basis of analysis
conducted within the framework of one or both of the first two branches.  This
branch, we must recall, is a safeguard which verifies that s. 24(2)  is not
being applied in such a way as to frustrate its own underlying purposes.  One
factor that may be relevant to an analysis conducted under this branch may be
the extent to which the evidence is essential to substantiate the charge.  As noted
in Collins, at p. 288, the exclusion of otherwise reliable evidence
necessary to support a conviction for a serious crime may, itself, tend to
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  

 

101             It
should be noted that rigid tests of inclusion should be opposed just as
vigorously as rigid tests of exclusion.  What must ultimately be sought within
a s. 24(2)  analysis is a sense of proportionality between competing interests
and effects.  In Collins, at p. 286, for instance, such proportionality
found form through the following observation:

 

In my view, the administration of justice would be
brought into disrepute by the exclusion of evidence essential to substantiate
the charge, and thus the acquittal of the accused, because of a trivial breach
of the Charter .

 

Implicit in the third branch of the Collins test, in my view,
is an inquiry into whether the value to society of admitting the evidence
outweighs the prejudice to societal and individual interests that could follow
from the admission of the evidence.

 








102             Assessing
proportionality may have opposite effects depending upon whether the admission
of the evidence touches upon the Reliability Principle or the ""Fairness
Principle"".  If the evidence relates to the Fairness Principle, then the
higher the value to society in obtaining the conviction, the more serious must
be the rights violation before the admission of the evidence could be said to
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  On the other hand, if the
evidence relates to the Reliability Principle, then the relationship may be
quite the opposite.  The more serious the offence, then the greater the need
for the courts to be vigilant in ensuring that the innocent are not convicted. 
As such, the more serious the offence, the higher the likelihood that the
inclusion of the evidence impugning trial fairness could bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. 

 

103             Finally,
although I do not wish to resurrect the pre-Charter  ""community
shock test"" elaborated in Rothman, I think that it may offer a
helpful standard in an opposite sense.  Namely, having regard to all of the
circumstances, would the long-term values of the community, assuming it to be
reasonable, dispassionate and fully informed, be shocked by the exclusion
of this evidence?  This factor is essentially a reality check.  It is one last
safeguard to ensure that courts do not lose sight of the forest for the trees,
or abstract the law from reality.  Courts must not frustrate the very purposes
of s. 24(2)  that they are duty-bound under the Constitution to uphold.

 








104             We
must always bear in mind, as Collins has clearly enunciated, that the
purpose of s. 24(2)  is not to discipline the authorities.  Nor, for that
matter, is the primary purpose of s. 24(2)  even to seek to discourage certain
types of behaviour by state actors, although this will certainly be one of its
effects.  Simply put, the purpose of s. 24(2)  is to prevent the administration
of justice from being brought into further disrepute by the admission of
evidence obtained in a manner that violates the Charter .  Although I
decline to comment further on this matter, I would simply note that there may
be other means, either statutory or common law, by which to further more
directly the purpose of discouraging or sanctioning unconstitutional conduct by
state actors. (See, e.g., § 1983 of the United States Code, which
recognizes a tort for breach of an individual's civil rights.)

 

105             I
have set out above what I believe to be the first principles and purposes
underlying s. 24(2)  of the Charter , which I believe found much of their
genesis in The Queen, and which were given form by this Court in Collins. 
I believe that this Court's jurisprudence regarding s. 24(2)  has perhaps
inadvertently departed from the purpose of s. 24(2)  of the Charter , and
from the foundations laid down in those cases.  By including too many factors
within the rubric of ""trial fairness"", we have transformed s. 24(2) 
from a supple analytical framework within which could be balanced a
multiplicity of factors into a fairly rigid test of exclusion that, with each
passing day, bears increasing resemblance to the American model that the
framers of our Charter  so consciously eschewed.

 

Summary

 








106             To
summarize briefly, giving effect to s. 24(2)  requires courts to adopt a
somewhat different focus than what is necessary to give effect to the
substantive rights and freedoms guaranteed within the Charter .  Whereas
recognition of these substantive rights and freedoms must be done with primary
regard to ensuring that every individual obtains the fullest protection
possible under these rights, s. 24(2)  mandates that courts adjudicate upon the
admissibility of evidence with primary regard to preventing the administration
of justice from being brought into disrepute.  Whereas rights and freedoms must
therefore be given expression through the eyes of one trained in the law, s.
24(2) , which deals with the reputation of the justice system, must be
approached from the point of view of the reasonable person, dispassionate and
fully apprised of the circumstances.   With great respect, I believe that this
Court's recent jurisprudence governing s. 24(2)  does not take this differing
focus sufficiently into account.

 

107             Since
writing these reasons, I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of
Justice Sopinka.  I take great exception to his implication that I am in any
way advocating an approach to exclusion of evidence that is reminiscent of this
Court's judgment in R. v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272.  In
fact, the approach I suggest, which looks both to reliability and to the
integrity of the judicial system, finds its genesis in Lamer J.'s influential
remarks in Rothman, its inspiration in the wording and historical
context of s. 24(2)  of the Charter , and its application in this Court's
approach in Collins.  Although it bespeaks the obvious, I must emphasize
that a court's inquiry into exclusion does not end when it finds that unconstitutionally
obtained evidence is inherently reliable (and therefore not subject to
virtually automatic exclusion).  Analysis then passes on to a consideration of
the damage to the integrity of the system that could be occasioned by the
admission of the impugned evidence.  This must be approached from the point of
the long-term effects on the community of the admission of evidence obtained
under similar circumstances.  The likelihood of exclusion under this framework
therefore goes far beyond anything that ever existed at common law,
particularly since evidence will be excluded whenever its admission could
bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 

 








108             The
thrust of my criticism of this Court's recent jurisprudence on s. 24(2)  is that
we may be digging ourselves into a hole.  If we are to create a test of
absolute exclusion to further the purposes of s. 24(2) , then I believe that we
must not define that test so broadly as to risk frustrating the text of s.
24(2) , which calls upon courts to evaluate ""all of the circumstances""
in preserving the reputation of the justice system.  I therefore prefer to
formulate any absolute exclusionary rules more narrowly than most of my
colleagues.  

 

109             In
my view, it is most consistent both with our common law approach to exclusion
and with the purposes of s. 24(2)  of the Charter  to confine an absolute
exclusionary rule to circumstances in which the unconstitutional conduct of
state authorities is responsible for evidence which may possibly be
unreliable.  I do not feel that the nature of the evidence (real vs.
self-incriminatory, or discoverable vs. undiscoverable) should be
determinative of absolute exclusion.  For my part, I believe that a viable
distinction can and must be drawn between evidence whose admission potentially
touches upon the adjudicative fairness of the hearing and evidence which is
obtained in a manner which does violence to the integrity of the judicial
system.  Whereas the former must almost inevitably be excluded, the latter must
be evaluated ""having regard to all of the circumstances"".

 

110             My
colleague Sopinka J. notes that Lamer J. did not specifically mention
reliability in his discussion of trial fairness.  I agree.  For this, one must
go back to Rothman, the grandfather of Collins.  I do not believe
that our concept of what constitutes a minimal standard of ""trial
fairness"" has changed so dramatically since the Charter .  The
justice system was not suffering from widespread disrepute as a result of
""unfair trials"" when s. 24(2)  came onto the scene.  








111             Finally,
Sopinka J. concludes by opining that the majority's approach to s. 24(2)  is
more consistent with Collins than the framework I propose.  In answer, I
repeat the following rhetorical question that I have already asked about Collins:
given that the heroin balloon could not have been recovered ""but for""
the unreasonable search by the officer, why did this Court nonetheless conclude
that, although the admission of the evidence would operate unfortunately for
the accused, the ""fairness of the trial"" was in no way implicated?  I
find further support, moreover, in my rejection of using discoverability as a
proxy for trial fairness in the following excerpt from J. Sopinka, S. N.
Lederman and A. W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada (1992), at p.
407:

 

[The] disposition [in R. v.
Black, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 138] leaves open the question whether real evidence
obtained as a consequence of a s. 10 (b) violation, but which would not
have been discovered but for the violation, can be characterized as falling
within the trial fairness rationale for exclusion.... In light of the strong indications
in Collins and Ross, it is difficult to see how real evidence, no
matter how obtained, could be said to affect the fairness of the trial.  The
better view seems to be that the admission of real evidence (i.e., tangible
evidence not created by the accused as a consequence of a Charter 
violation) must stand or fall on the basis of the seriousness of the Charter 
violation by which it was obtained.  [Emphasis added.]

 

I rest my case.

     

(iv)  Application of Section 24(2)  to the Impugned
Evidence

 








112             At
the outset, it is important to recall that no appeal is taken by the Crown from
the trial judge's decision to exclude, on the basis of a serious s. 10 (b)
violation, the compelled confessions as well as the fact that the appellant led
police to the location of the murder weapon and to the site of the murder.  I
will not comment further on the exclusion of those two pieces of evidence under
s. 24(2)  except to say that I agree that, under the circumstances, their
admission could bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute than
their exclusion.  As I have already noted, had this been the only evidence
indicating a nexus between the accused and the gun found in the river, then the
exclusion of this evidence would in all likelihood have also precluded the
Crown from pointing to any basis for admitting into evidence the gun itself, or
the fact of its finding.  Simply put, the Crown would not have been able to
show that the gun found in the river was at all relevant to the proceedings. 
The effect of excluding the other evidence would therefore be to exclude
the gun itself, as well as the fact of its finding.

 

113             I
turn to the accused's statement to Hall.  My colleague Iacobucci J. would focus
his s. 24(2)  analysis primarily on the gun and the fact of its finding.  I
respectfully disagree.  The gun and the fact of its finding are meaningless
and, in fact, inadmissible without evidence that connects them somehow to the
accused.  The accused's voluntary statement to Hall is the only basis for their
admission.  By contrast, even if the gun had not been found or introduced at
trial, the statement was, by itself, extremely incriminating, since it
constituted a voluntary admission to a third party which indicated involvement
in the crime.  Thus, I have no doubt that the proper focus of our analysis must
be on the statement made to Hall.

 

114             My
colleague would exclude this statement on the basis that it is proximately
connected to the s. 10 (b) violation and that its admission would
therefore tend to render the trial unfair.  He relies for this proposition on
this Court's judgment in R. v. Strachan, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980.  With
respect, I do not believe that Strachan supports such an approach.

 








115             Strachan
stands for the proposition that the accused need not show a strict causal link
between the s. 10 (b) violation and the statement to Hall.  The accused
can bring the statement to Hall within the ambit of a s. 24(2)  examination so
long as he can demonstrate that the statement was not too remote from the
rights violation.  (By way of aside, I note that there was never any challenge
raised as to the admissibility of a statement made by the accused to Hall some
two months later, alleging that he had been present at the killing but that it
had been committed by Biddlecome.)  I must respectfully disagree, however, with
my colleague's conclusion that principles of remoteness should also predispose
this Court's determination on whether the fairness of the trial is
adversely affected.  Whereas I take Strachan to govern the applicability
of s. 24(2) , my colleague takes Strachan one step further, and extends
its logic of ""proximate connection"" to the application of the
first branch of the s. 24(2)  Collins test.  With respect, given the
almost automatic exclusionary consequences of a finding of ""trial process
unfairness"", I fear that this approach will dig this Court even more
deeply into the legal hole that I believe it has already dug itself.

 

116             In
my opinion, the ""proximate connection"" between the s. 10 (b)
violation and the accused's voluntary statement to Hall is sufficient to bring
that statement within the purview of a s. 24(2)  examination: R. v. Strachan. 
I note, however, that although the accused was incarcerated at the time, the
statement to Hall was freely and voluntarily made.  No element of state
compulsion could have operated upon his mind at that time so as to taint that
statement with the possibility of unreliability, and therefore with the
possibility of unfairness to the trial.  Thus, although the evidence is highly
incriminating to the accused, and therefore prejudicial in the sense that it
increases materially the likelihood of his conviction, I do not see how it
touches in any way upon the Reliability Principle, and therefore upon trial
fairness.








117             I
next turn to the second branch of the Collins framework, to ascertain
whether the method by which this statement was obtained raises sufficient
concerns under the Fairness Principle that its admission into evidence could
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  

 

118             In
my view, accepting this statement into evidence would not send a signal to the
community condoning this kind of conduct by state actors.  We must recall that
both the confession and the totality of the self-incriminating evidence
emanating from the accused while acting under state compulsion were
excluded by the trial judge.  In this case, however, the state obtained an
unanticipated windfall as a result of the accused's voluntary remarks to his
girlfriend.  This windfall cannot realistically be said to have been part of
the officers' scheme at the time the ""deal"" was hatched.  In this
sense, the present case is different in important respects from instances in
which the state actively seeks to elicit incriminatory statements from the
accused through the use of undercover agents (R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 151) or through individuals effectively acting as agents of the state (R.
v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595).  In both of those types of situations,
the court is faced with evidence arising as a direct result of an
unconstitutional scheme on the part of the authorities, and obtained in the
manner reasonably anticipated by the police.  The judicial sanction of such
unconstitutional activity by admitting evidence thus obtained can have
significant repercussions in the long-term on citizens' dignity and right
generally to be free from unwarranted interference from the state.  Admission
of evidence under such circumstances could bring the administration of justice
into disrepute in the eyes of the reasonable person, dispassionate and fully
apprised of the circumstances. 

 








119             By
contrast, in the present case, the direct and intended fruits of the state's
unconstitutional conduct were properly excluded by the trial judge.  All that
remained was a voluntary statement-- an evidentiary windfall.  It would be
largely speculative to guess at whether the accused would not have made such a
statement, or any other incriminating statement, to Hall if the circumstances
had been different.  I note, for instance, that he made another highly
incriminating statement to Hall some two months later. I am willing to accept,
however, that this statement may not have been available had the rights
violation not occurred.  In fact, I agree with my colleague Iacobucci J.'s
observation at para. 42 of his reasons that

 

[t]he fact is that the Crown sought to introduce the
statement at trial precisely because it allowed it to do indirectly what the
trial judge had ruled the Crown could not do directly: introduce evidence that
the appellant knew where the gun was hidden.

 

In my view, however, the long-term interests in the administration
of justice and in the integrity of the Fairness Principle would not be
disserved by admitting this evidence, notwithstanding the insalubrious police
conduct that may have, as its incidental effect, prompted the statement
to Hall.  

 








120             I
am, as I have said, mindful of the unfairness that flows from admitting a
statement that may not have been made were it not for the Charter 
violation.  Indeed, it is true that the accused made the statement to his
girlfriend while he was still under the impression that the ""deal""
was on.  As I have said, however, it is important not to consider this factor
in isolation, but to examine it ""having regard to all the circumstances"". 
The mere presence of some unfairness in the manner in which the evidence was
obtained, and the fact that the admission of the statement operates
unfortunately for the accused, do not compel irrevocably the conclusion that
evidence obtained in such a manner be automatically excluded.  In the present
case, even assuming that this factor militated sufficiently toward finding that
the administration of justice could be brought into disrepute by the admission
of the voluntary statement, I would nonetheless conclude that the exclusion of
this reliable evidence would bring the administration of justice into greater
disrepute, given the seriousness of the offence as well as the fact that the
making of the statement was essentially incidental to the police
officers' unconstitutional conduct.

 

121             Lastly,
I wish to note that I am also mindful of the concern raised by McEachern C.J.
that this statement tends to connect the accused more closely with the crime,
and could give rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt.  It is important
to realize, however, that trial fairness will only be connected to the rights
violation, and therefore subject to special scrutiny under the first branch of
the Collins analysis, when there is some possibility that the evidence
is unreliable or otherwise likely to lead to the conviction of an innocent
person, and when this unreliability is somehow attributable to the state's
unconstitutional conduct.  Such was not the case here.  Under the
circumstances, there was no reasonable possibility of unreliability in the
statement.  I note, as well, that if a statement or other communicative
behaviour is prejudicial in the evidentiary sense, in that it could mislead a
trier of fact by causing it to follow an inappropriate chain of logic, then
that problem must be addressed within the context of the traditional balancing
test outlined by this Court in R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R.
577, by inquiring into whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs
its prejudicial effect.  

     








122             To
recapitulate, although the admission of the evidence most definitely operates
unfortunately for the appellant, a reasonable person, dispassionate and fully
apprised of all of the circumstances in this case would conclude that the
exclusion of this evidence would bring the administration of justice into
greater disrepute than its inclusion.  The most important consideration leading
me to this conclusion is that admission of this statement would not imply any
condonation of the police officers' actions, even though those actions were,
themselves, clearly contrary to the long-term interests of the integrity of the
justice system.  Any other damage to the integrity of the judicial system, such
as the unfairness flowing from the fact that the windfall statement might not
otherwise have been made, is outweighed by the impact upon the administration
of justice of excluding such evidence, given that it is incidental to the
opprobrious police conduct, inherently reliable, and significantly probative of
the most serious crime in Canada.  

 

123             Because
of my conclusion that the statement to Hall is admissible under s. 24(2)  of the
Charter , I am also satisfied that the admission of the gun and the fact
of finding the gun would not bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

 

2.                The
Interaction of Section 24(2) of the Charter and Section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the
Code

 

124             Given
my conclusion that the evidence which is the subject of this appeal was
properly admitted at trial, it is not strictly necessary for me to address the
interaction between s. 24(2)  of the Charter  and s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .  Nonetheless, assuming that my colleague is
correct in concluding that the impugned evidence should be excluded, I shall
address this issue as well.

 

(i)    Principles Governing the Interaction of
Section 24(2)  and Section 686(1) (b)(iii)








 

125             Section
686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  reads as follows:

 

686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a
verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not criminally
responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal

 

                                                ...

 

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

 

                                         ...

 

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion
that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be
decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred. . . .

 

The most recent elucidation of the proper approach to s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
is outlined by Major J., speaking for the Court on this issue, in R. v.
Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599.  After outlining various approaches to s.
686(1) (b)(iii) that had been utilized by this Court in the past, he
consolidated those approaches within the following test, at p. 617:

 

...the task of an appellate court is to determine
whether there is any reasonable possibility that the verdict would have
been different had the error at issue not been made. [Emphasis added.]

 

The most recent statement by this Court on the interaction between
s. 24(2)  of the Charter  and s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code,
however, predates Major J.'s articulation of the proper approach to be taken to
s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

 








126             In
R. v. Elshaw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 24, the accused was observed with
young boys under suspicious circumstances, and attempted to flee when police
accosted him.  He was locked in the police van for a short period of time after
which he made several inculpatory statements to the police.  Iacobucci J. found
that the accused had been denied his rights under s. 10 (b), that the
statements should be excluded under s. 24(2)  and that the curative provisions
in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) could not prevent the ordering of a re-trial.  He
made the following observation on the interplay between s. 24(2)  of the Charter 
and s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code (at p. 46):

 

If the evidence in question should have been excluded
under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  because its admission would put the
administration of justice into disrepute, then generally its admission was such
as to amount to a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, thereby putting
matters beyond the reach of s. 686(1) (b)(iii), which is available to
cure errors of law where no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
results.  Consequently, s. 686(1)(b)(iii) is not available in this
case.  This is not to say that there may not be other circumstances where
the curative provision could apply notwithstanding that evidence should have
been excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter . [Emphasis added.]

 

We must recall that the inculpatory statements given to the police
by the accused in Elshaw were quite central to the Crown's case, and no
doubt played an important role in his conviction.  In essence, therefore, given
the majority's finding of a s. 10 (b) violation and given the majority's
conclusion that the impugned inculpatory statements should be excluded under s.
24(2) , there was, indeed, a ""reasonable possibility that the verdict would
have been different"" had this important evidence not been available to the
Crown.

 








127             I
note, however, that in Elshaw, Iacobucci J. did not have the benefit of
Major J.'s approach to s. 686(1)(b)(iii) for the Court in Bevan. 
As such, I believe that it is now clear that the ""other
circumstances"" to which Iacobucci J. alluded in Elshaw include
situations where, even if the appellate court concludes that certain evidence
should have been excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter , the court is
satisfied that no reasonable possibility existed that the verdict would have
been different.  

 

128             I
would like to preface my remarks on the application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
to the instant case with three additional observations about the interplay
between s. 24(2)  of the Charter  and s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code. 
First, it is now established that although an examination under s. 24(2)  must
look to the particular context of the rights violation, the determination as to
whether or not evidence should be excluded necessarily also involves long-term
considerations, such as the impact on the reputation of the justice system of
the regular inclusion or exclusion of this type of evidence: Collins, at
p. 281.  Section 686(1) (b)(iii), by contrast, only requires
consideration by the appellate court of the particular circumstances before
it.  The differing breadth of the examination under s. 24(2)  and under s.
686(1) (b)(iii) is therefore one indication that the two sections are
clearly not coextensive.

 

129             Second,
as I observed at the outset of my reasons, it is important to recall that the
French version of s. 24(2) , which is the text upon which the Collins
framework is based, requires that evidence be excluded ""if its admission could
bring the administration of justice into disrepute"".  A conclusion that
the administration of justice could be brought into disrepute by the
admission of certain evidence does not necessarily mean that its admission has,
by definition, led to a ""substantial wrong"" or ""miscarriage of
justice"" in the particular case under review.   

 








130             Third,
s. 24(2) of the Charter  and s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code
clearly focus on different things, in furtherance of different objectives. 
Section 24(2)  focuses on whether the inclusion or exclusion of evidence obtained
in violation of the Charter  would bring the administration of justice
into further disrepute.  Its primary purpose, therefore, is protection of the
integrity of the judicial system.  By contrast, as is clear from Major J.'s
test in R. v. Bevan, s. 686(1)(b)(iii) focuses on the outcome of
the particular proceedings.  Its primary purpose is to enable appellate courts
to feel unhindered to clarify errors of law committed by the trial judge.  If a
new trial were required every time an appellate court identified an error of
law in the proceedings below, even if that error were immaterial to the outcome
of the proceedings, then appellate courts might be reluctant to identify such
errors of law in the first place.  Instead, s. 686(1)(b)(iii) reflects a
careful balancing of collective interests in the effective and efficient
conclusion of litigation against the right of the individual accused to a full
and fair trial.  Whenever these two interests collide, s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
resolves the conflict in favour of the accused.  Where there is no conflict,
however, then s. 686(1) (b)(iii) provides a means by which to advance
collective interests while not at the expense of the accused.  

       

(ii)   Application of Section 686(1)(b)(iii)
to the Facts

 








131             In
R. v. Hodge (1993), 133 N.B.R. (2d) 240, the New Brunswick Court of
Appeal found that evidence should have been excluded under s. 24(2), yet
declined to order a retrial on the basis that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice had occurred.  The impugned evidence was a hair sample
which had been seized from the accused while he was detained, and which was
matched with hair found on the motorcycle with which he was alleged to have
made his getaway from the scene of a robbery.  The court found a clear s. 8
violation and ruled that the seized hair should have been excluded under s.
24(2), but declined to order a new trial on the basis that the hair sample had
limited probative value since the hair on the motorcycle could have been
deposited at any time prior to the incident, and could not have factored very
significantly in the conviction of the accused. 

 

132             My
colleague declines to apply s. 686(1)(b)(iii) in the present case on the
basis that the admission of the evidence amounted to a ""substantial
wrong"".  Moreover, he relies upon John v. The Queen, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 476, for the proposition that appellate courts should not retry cases to
assess the worth of residual evidence after improperly adduced evidence has
been extracted.  In John, this Court found that the prosecution
improperly split its case so as to sandwich the defence, forcing the accused to
testify a second time and face a second round of cross-examination on issues
that related directly to credibility.  The Court stated at p. 480 that,
""[i]t is of course impossible to reconstruct this trial by jury so as to
determine what the verdict would have been had this evidence not been
presented"".  That case is very clearly distinguishable from the case at
bar.  

 








133             In
the present case, although the murder weapon and the statement to Hall were
significant pieces of evidence, the remainder of the case was so overwhelming
as to make this an appropriate case in which to invoke the curative provisions
of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) notwithstanding a finding that evidence should have
been excluded under s. 24(2).  Even without the impugned statement from Hall
and the evidence of the actual gun, the Crown's case against the accused was
unimpeachable.  Evidence properly admitted at trial included the following:
testimony from the appellant's father that he had found a pair of jeans and a
vest with a floral pattern (the same clothing that other witnesses testified
Worms had been wearing the night of her murder) in the back of the family
pick-up truck the morning after the killing; testimony from the appellant's
girlfriend, Hall, that she had found a vest of that description in his pick-up
the next day, and that he had snatched it away from her; testimony that the
accused was at the same nightclub as Worms on the night of the murder;
testimony by a friend of the appellant (Biddlecome) that the appellant stole a
.410 shotgun a few weeks before the murder of Worms; testimony from Biddlecome
that the appellant had showed him the same shotgun with the barrel sawed off
days before the killing; three .410 shotgun shells found in the appellant's
vehicle; and testimony from Hall that the appellant had voluntarily told her,
during the spring of 1985, that he had been present at the killing but that he
had stood by while Biddlecome beat the victim and killed her.   This
statement definitively placed the appellant at the scene of the crime, and
therefore left it to the jury to decide whether the murderer was the appellant
or Biddlecome.  In this respect, the accused did not testify, Biddlecome
denied any involvement on the stand, and there was no evidence of beating found
on the body.  Finally, striking similar fact evidence was admitted into
evidence concerning the almost identical killing of Hughes (to which the
appellant confessed and had already been convicted) three months after the
killing of Worms.

 

134             Moreover,
I note the trial judge's warning to the jury as to the limited probative value
of both the gun and the appellant's statement to Hall that he had directed
police to its location:

 

Now, I'm invading your function,
but I do so deliberately, to caution you that that statement, if you accept it
as truthful and accurate, that he took the police to where the gun was in the
river, is not evidence that he, Burlingham, threw the gun in the river
necessarily.  It only goes so far as to show that he knows that somebody, and
possibly including himself, but somebody put the gun in the river at that
location. 

 








Given the appellant's assertions to Hall that he had seen Biddlecome
kill the victim, it was open for the jury to conclude that the appellant had
simply seen Biddlecome dispose of the weapon.  In my view, the judge's sharp
cautionary remarks to the jury on the use of the evidence is surely a factor in
deciding whether ""there [was] a reasonable possibility that the verdict
would have been different"", since this warning could have mitigated at
least some of the prejudice that might flow to the accused as a result of an
impermissible inference of consciousness of guilt.  The gun, moreover, proved
absolutely nothing about whether it was the appellant who committed the murder,
since it could equally well have been Biddlecome, according to the appellant's
tale to Hall.  Although the appellant did not testify, defence counsel
impressed upon the jury members in his closing address that they had heard the
appellant's story through the mouth of Hall.

 

135             Having
regard to all the circumstances, including the sharp warning issued by the
trial judge, the reliance by defence counsel on the story of the murder told
through the mouth of Hall, and the overwhelming case against the accused
presented by the Crown at trial, I am satisfied that the absence or presence of
either or both items of the impugned evidence would not have factored
materially in the ultimate outcome.  I am satisfied that there is no reasonable
possibility that the verdict would have been different had the impugned evidence
been excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

3.  The Unfair Crown Conduct

 








136             In
closing, I would like to turn very briefly to the Crown's conduct in
repudiating the ""deal"" reached between the police officers and the
appellant.  I agree with my colleague's conclusion that the conduct of the
authorities, though certainly contemptible, did not amount to one of the
""clearest of cases"" of abuse of process, requiring a stay of
proceedings.  I am also mindful of the fact that the trial judge found the
police to have made an honest mistake and not to have acted with mala fides
in breaking their bargain.  Their misunderstanding of the Crown's offer may
very well have been genuine.  However, I firmly believe that the Crown acted in
bad faith by charging the accused with first degree murder notwithstanding the
fact that the Crown was aware that the police had misled the appellant who, in
full reliance on the ""deal"" proffered by the police, had fulfilled his
half of the bargain.  Under the circumstances, and given that the Crown did not
object to the police officers' presenting the ""deal"" on the Crown's
behalf, it seems highly unfair and unjust to allow the Crown to act in total
disregard for its agents undertakings, and to impose the consequences for such
disregard upon the appellant.  For this reason, I would find a violation of the
principle of fundamental fairness under s. 7  of the Charter , as
discussed in my reasons in R. v. S.(R.J.).  Under the circumstances, while
I do not believe that this case is one of the ""clearest of cases""
calling for a stay of proceedings, I am of the opinion that it would be
appropriate and just under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  to require the Crown
to uphold its half of the ""deal"", and for this Court to substitute a
conviction for the lesser included offence of second degree murder for the
present conviction of first degree murder.

 

III.               Disposition

 

137             I
would dismiss the appeal but would substitute a conviction of second degree
murder for the conviction of first degree murder imposed at trial, and return
the case to the trial judge for proper sentencing in this respect.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 








The reasons of Sopinka, Cory Iacobucci and Major JJ.
were delivered by

 

Sopinka J. -- I agree with the reasons and conclusion of Justice Iacobucci but
wish to address the point made by my colleague, Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, that
the Court has departed from the approach adopted in R. v. Collins,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, in favour of a rule of automatic exclusion.

 

138             The
criticism made by my colleague closely parallels the opinion of Professor
Paciocco who advocates a more literal and restrictive interpretation of s.
24(2)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  See David M.
Paciocco, ""The Judicial Repeal of s. 24(2)  and the Development of the
Canadian Exclusionary Rule"" (1990), 32 Crim. L.Q. 326.  Not
surprisingly, commentators no less than the public differ as to the appropriate
approach to the exclusion of evidence associated with a violation of a Charter 
right.  See, for example, Yves-Marie Morissette, ""The Exclusion of
Evidence under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms :  What to Do and
What Not to Do"" (1984), 29 McGill L.J. 521; R. J. Deslisle,
""Collins: An Unjustified Distinction"" (1987), 56 C.R. (3d) 216; Tim
Quigley and Eric Colvin, ""Developments in Criminal Law and Procedure: The
1988-89 Term"" (1990), 1 S.C.L.R. (2d) 187; Steven M. Penney, ""Unreal
Distinctions:  The Exclusion of Unfairly Obtained Evidence Under s. 24(2)
of the Charter "" (1994), 32 Alta. L. Rev. 782, at p. 800. 
While Professor Paciocco favours an approach that would be less exclusionary
and, in his opinion, more in tune with the views of the average Canadian,
Steven Penney, in his comprehensive article at p. 810, argues that by
focusing on trial fairness, as opposed to the criminal justice system as a
whole, we ""render individual Canadians more susceptible to invasions of
their constitutional rights"". 

 








139             Both
Professor Paciocco and my colleague are of the view that the approach we have
taken is out of step with the public mood.  Quite apart from the admonitions of
Lamer J. (as he then was) in Collins, at pp. 281-82, that
individual rights are not to be submitted to an adjudication by the majority,
there is no accurate assessment of public opinion.  Adjusting the approach to Charter 
rights based on public opinion surveys is fraught with difficulties.  This can
be illustrated by reference to the empirical study to which my colleague refers
by A. W. Bryant, M. Gold, H. M. Stevenson and D. Northrup, ""Public
Attitudes Toward the Exclusion of Evidence:  Section 24(2)  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms "" (1990), 69 Can. Bar Rev. 1.  It purported
to show ""a significant gap between public and judicial opinion"" (p.
45) regarding the application of the Collins factors.  After publication
of that study, a further study by the same authors, ""Public Support for
the Exclusion of Unconstitutionally Obtained Evidence"" (1990), 1 S.C.L.R.
(2d) 555, concluded at p. 557 that ""taking into account some of the
ambiguity in the case law, the gap between public and judicial opinion may not
be that substantial over a broad range of cases"".  

 

140             The
study concluded with the following warning, at p. 587:

 

Whatever one's views on the merits
or rationale of the exclusionary rule, our study illustrates the multi-faceted
and complex nature of the public's judgments about admissibility.  Levels of
support for the exclusion of evidence varied considerably depending upon a
number of factors, some of which were case-specific while others were
attitudinal and demographic.  In this respect, any argument for or against
how judges apply section 24(2)  that relies upon a supposedly monolithic
""public opinion"" clearly must be rejected.  [Emphasis added.]

 








141             Had
the Court reacted to the first study and altered its approach, the validity of
cases decided under the altered approach would have been called into question
by the subsequent study.  It is for this reason that the test with respect to
what could bring the administration of justice into disrepute was stated in Collins
to be grounded in longer term community values rather than the public passion
of the moment.  These long-term community values are to be assessed in terms of
the views of the hypothetical, reasonable, well-informed and dispassionate
person in the community.  

 

R. v. Collins

 

142             The
jurisprudence of this Court with respect to s. 24(2) , subsequent to Collins,
has generally evolved with due respect for stare decisis but also with
due regard for the fact that as an early comprehensive statement of principles,
it did not purport to be exhaustive or immutable.  The key statement of
principles in Collins is contained in the following passage at pp.
284-85:

 

Real evidence that was obtained in a manner that
violated the Charter  will rarely operate unfairly for that reason
alone.  The real evidence existed irrespective of the violation of the Charter 
and its use does not render the trial unfair.  However, the situation is very
different with respect to cases where, after a violation of the Charter ,
the accused is conscripted against himself through a confession or other
evidence emanating from him.  The use of such evidence would render the trial
unfair, for it did not exist prior to the violation and it strikes at one of
the fundamental tenets of a fair trial, the right against self-incrimination. 
Such evidence will generally arise in the context of an infringement of the
right to counsel.  Our decisions in Therens [[1985] 1 S.C.R. 613] and Clarkson
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, are illustrative of this.  The use of
self-incriminating evidence obtained following a denial of the right to counsel
will generally go to the very fairness of the trial and should generally be excluded. 


 

It is apparent that the words ""conscripted against himself
through a confession or other evidence emanating from him"" necessitated
further definition in subsequent cases.

 








143             Whether
it was ever so intended, it soon became apparent that real evidence and
evidence emanating from the accused were not mutually exclusive categories of
evidence, and in R. v. Ross, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3, Lamer J. explained at p.
16 that:

 

... the use of any evidence that could not have been
obtained but for the participation of the accused in the construction of the
evidence for the purposes of the trial would tend to render the trial process
unfair.  

 

The rationale for this view is that it is unfair for the Crown to
make out its case in whole or in part by the use of evidence that it obtained
in breach of the rights of the accused and involving his or her participation. 
La Forest J. addressed this point in Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v.
Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices
Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, stating at p. 553:

 

A breach of the Charter  that forces the
eventual accused to create evidence necessarily has the effect of providing the
Crown with evidence it would not otherwise have had.  It follows that the
strength of its case against the accused is necessarily enhanced as a result of
the breach....  In contrast, where the effect of a breach of the Charter 
is merely to locate or identify already existing evidence, the case of the
ultimate strength of the Crown's case is not necessarily strengthened in this
way.  The fact that the evidence already existed means that it could have
been discovered anyway.  Where this is the case, the accused is not forced to
confront any evidence at trial that he would not have been forced to confront
if his Charter  rights had been respected.  [Emphasis added.]

 

144             The
participation of the accused in providing incriminating evidence involving a
breach of Charter  rights is the ingredient that tends to render the
trial unfair as he or she is not under any obligation to assist the Crown to
secure a conviction.  See R. v. Genest, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 59, at p. 83. 
Serious breaches of the Charter  which do not involve the participation
of the accused may result in the exclusion of the evidence under the second
branch of the Collins test.








145             My
colleague accepts the Collins test and that its application would
satisfy the hypothetical reasonable person.  Specifically, she does not
criticize the principle that the admission of evidence that would render the
trial unfair would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  A fair
trial is the sine qua non of our justice system and it is hard to
conceive of a situation in which it could be said that an unfair trial
resulting in a conviction did not depreciate the repute of our system of
justice.  My colleague's criticism is with respect to the kind of evidence that
can result in an unfair trial.  In her view, only the admission of evidence
that is not reliable by reason of some connection with state action amounting
to a Charter  breach can render the trial unfair (the ""reliability
principle"").  Other state conduct which runs afoul of common law and Charter 
protections is grouped under the ""fairness principle"".  The fairness
principle ""recognizes the vital importance in ensuring that the state
treat each individual in accordance with basic principles of decency and fair
play"" but violation of the fairness principle cannot render the trial
unfair.  A violation of the fairness principle may in certain circumstances
result in the exclusion of evidence provided that the breach of the Charter 
protection is so serious that its admission would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.

 








146             I
have great difficulty in appreciating how the application of these two
principles as suggested by my colleague constitutes a return to Collins. 
Nowhere in Collins is the fairness of the trial equated with the
reliability of the evidence.  The description used in Collins as to the
kind of evidence that could render a trial unfair was ""a confession or
other evidence emanating from him"" (p. 284).  Leaving aside the words
""or other evidence emanating from him"", even the admissibility of a
""confession"" is not determined solely on the basis of reliability. 
Prior to the Charter  and at common law, reliability ceased to be the
exclusive basis for excluding confessions.  See Rothman v. The Queen,
[1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, especially at p.
207, R. v. Whittle, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 914, at p. 932, and R. v. Sang,
[1980] A.C. 402.  It could hardly be suggested that exclusion of involuntary
confessions did not relate to the fairness of the trial.  The reliability
principle would, therefore, impose a more restrictive exclusionary rule than
that which existed at common law.  Its preoccupation with the probative value
of the evidence would also appear to be a close relative of the rule in R.
v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272.  At page 293, Martland J. stated:

 

... the exercise of a discretion by the trial judge
arises only if the admission of the evidence would operate unfairly.  The
allowance of admissible evidence relevant to the issue before the court and of
substantial probative value may operate unfortunately for the accused, but not
unfairly.  It is only the allowance of evidence gravely prejudicial to the
accused, the admissibility of which is tenuous, and whose probative force in
relation to the main issue before the court is trifling, which can be said to
operate unfairly.

 

Wray was widely criticized, has not been
followed by this Court and was not the basis for the exclusionary power adopted
by the Charter  in s. 24(2) .  See Anne McLellan and Bruce Elman,
""The Enforcement of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms :  An
Analysis of Section 24 "" (1983), 21 Alta. L. Rev. 205, at p. 230;
Penney, supra, at p. 794; R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, per
L'Heureux-Dubé J., at pp. 583-84.

 

147             It
is not accurate to characterize the first branch of the Collins test as
an automatic rule of exclusion with respect to all self-incriminating evidence. 
While a finding that admission of illegally obtained evidence would render the
trial unfair will result in exclusion, the Court must first conclude that
""in all the circumstances"" the admission of the evidence would render
the trial unfair.

 








148             R.
v. Tremblay, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 435, and R. v. Mohl, [1989] 1 S.C.R.
1389, illustrate the kinds of circumstances that can be taken into account to
secure admission of the evidence even in the case of a breach of the right to
counsel under s. 10 (b) of the Charter .

 

Discoverability

 

149             The
discoverability or ""but for"" test which my colleague criticizes can
also be traced to Collins.  At page 285, Lamer J. stated that, in
relation to the factors relating to the fairness of the trial, ""[i]t may
also be relevant, in certain circumstances, that the evidence would have been
obtained in any event without the violation of the Charter "".  In R.
v. Ross, supra, in relation to evidence that could be classed as
real evidence, he observed that the fairness of the trial would be affected by
""the use of any evidence that could not have been obtained but for
the participation of the accused"" [emphasis added].  In R. v. Dersch,
[1993] 3 S.C.R. 768, at p. 781, my colleague L'Heureux-Dubé J. states:

 

Pursuant to Collins, supra,
the admission of evidence that would have been unlikely to have been
discovered, had the Charter  violation not occurred, severely affects the
fairness of the trial.  On the other hand, if the evidence had been
discoverable regardless of the Charter  violation, the fairness of the
trial will not be influenced.  

 

150             While
the Court has not decided the extent to which discoverability is relevant in
all aspects of the Collins test, it has been applied to admit evidence (R.
v. Black, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 138) as well as to exclude evidence (R. v.
Mellenthin, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 615).

 








151             The
distinction that was made in Collins between real evidence and evidence
emanating from the accused was based, at least in part, on the rationale that
real evidence (or things) can be discovered without the participation of the
accused.  They pre-existed the state action which is called into question, and
were there to be discovered by investigative means not involving the accused. 
In a situation such as R. v. Ross in which this distinction is blurred,
discoverability has been used to place the evidence in one or other of these
two categories.  If the evidence was discoverable without the participation of
the accused, then it has the attributes of real evidence.  Conversely, evidence
that clearly emanates from the accused such as statements has not been
subjected to the discoverability analysis.  While it can be argued that when an
accused has been denied the right to counsel under s. 10 (b), an inquiry
could be made as to whether the accused would have acted differently had his Charter 
rights been observed, the Court has generally refused to enter into such an
inquiry.  See R. v. Strachan, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, at p. 1002; R.
v. Elshaw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 24, at pp. 43-44; R. v. Bartle, [1994] 3
S.C.R. 173, at pp. 217-18.  Unless the right to counsel is waived by the
accused, such a breach generally results in the exclusion of the evidence.

 

152             Various
proposals have been made as to the future direction that this Court should take
with respect to s. 24(2) .  Some would favour an approach that is less
exclusionary and others more exclusionary.  It has been suggested that the
distinction between real and other evidence be eliminated as well as any
distinction between the nature of the Charter  right that has been
infringed.  See Deslisle, supra.  It has been proposed that the
distinction based on participation of the accused be eliminated, and that
discoverability be the main touchstone of admissibility (R. v. Meddoui
(1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 345, at p. 364).  See Quigley and Colvin, supra.

 








153             While
we have not rushed in to adopt every current theory on the application of s.
24(2) , these are serious proposals that have been and should be taken into
account in the incremental evolution of the jurisprudence in this area. 
Accordingly, as my colleague Iacobucci J. points out, the distinction
between real and conscriptive evidence is not treated as determinative and
greater emphasis has been placed on the discoverability or ""but for""
test.  See Mellenthin, supra.  In my opinion, we should proceed
to develop the law relating to s. 24(2)  on this basis rather than adopt the new
approach advocated by my colleague L'Heureux-Dubé J.  In my view, our
approach to date is more consistent with Collins and therefore with stare
decisis.  Moreover, I believe it strikes the appropriate balance between a
restrictive versus a liberal exclusionary rule, and therefore is more faithful
to the values that the Charter  protects.

 

//Gonthier J.//

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 








155             Gonthier J. -- I have had the benefit
of the reasons of Justices L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka and Iacobucci.  I consider
that those of L'Heureux-Dubé J., read together with the comments of
Sopinka J., contribute to a proper understanding of the principles governing
the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .  I am in agreement with Iacobucci J. that the
accused's statement to Ms. Hall is to be excluded as well as the gun and its
location, the discovery of which could be made possible by this statement.  The
making of this statement which recounted the carrying out by the accused of his
part of the deal made with the police officers was intimately connected to that
deal which was obtained through the highly egregious conduct of the police
officers in pressing the accused to confess and systematically undermining the
role of defence counsel.  This conduct was a Charter  violation of the
most serious kind, bringing into play both the Reliability and the Fairness
Principles referred to by L'Heureux-Dubé J. though other evidence served
to allay concern as to reliability.  The charge of first degree murder is, it
is true, one of the most serious known to the criminal law.  In the
circumstances, however, it is my view that the admission of this evidence would
tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute in the eyes of a
reasonable person, dispassionate and fully apprised of the circumstances.  The
evidence should therefore be excluded.  The accused must be tried for his crime
but without having to face evidence which is the product of egregious police
misconduct.

 

156             At
the same time, in agreement with the reasons of Iacobucci J., I am not
prepared to apply the curative provision of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  The extreme egregious
conduct of the police in this case casts a pall on the perception of fairness
of the whole trial process and constituted a substantial wrong for which the
proper remedy is a new trial.  While miscarriage of justice in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
may focus on avoiding conviction of the innocent, substantial wrong (which, I
note, does not appear in s. 686(1) (a)(iii)) may be more
encompassing.

 

157             I
therefore concur in the disposition of this appeal by Iacobucci J.

                   J and the other
appellants are all either charged or suspects in connection with an explosion
and fire that damaged a property.  A provincial court judge issued subpoenas
requiring them to testify at the preliminary inquiries of the other accused
appellants who are separately charged.  The accused appellants applied to a
superior court judge for an order quashing the subpoenas on the ground that
their right to silence under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  would be infringed.  The appellants who were not charged also
applied to quash the subpoenas.  The superior court judge dismissed the
application and the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants' appeal for lack
of jurisdiction.  Sometime later, the appellants were subpoenaed to testify at
J's trial.  Their application to have the subpoenas quashed was again
dismissed.  This appeal raises two issues:  (1) whether the Court has
jurisdiction to hear this appeal; and (2) whether persons separately
charged with an offence, and persons suspected of an offence, are compellable
as witnesses at the preliminary inquiries and criminal trials of other persons
charged with the same offence.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

(1)   Jurisdiction

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.: In seeking to
challenge the subpoenas issued by the Provincial Court, the appellants must
follow the procedure for third parties laid out in Dagenais and apply to
a superior court judge for the issuance of a writ of certiorari.  While,
technically, the appellants did not follow the correct procedure since they did
not have the benefit of this Court's reasons in Dagenais, it is
sufficient that they applied for s. 24(1)  Charter  relief, which by
its nature would be included in the expanded remedial scope of certiorari
described in Dagenais.  The Court of Appeal therefore did have
jurisdiction to hear the appeal, pursuant to s. 784(1)  of the Criminal
Code .  The jurisdiction of this Court follows naturally from the decision
of the Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act .

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.:  For
the concurring reasons given in R. v. Primeau, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 60, the
appellants could appeal the superior court judge's decision to the Court of
Appeal and could appeal, with leave, the Court of Appeal's decision to this
Court.

 

(2)  Compellability

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The liberty
interest under s. 7  of the Charter  is engaged when a deprivation is
imminent, and the applicants sought relief at the appropriate time when they
first applied to a superior court judge for an order quashing the subpoenas.
The appellants, however, could not claim a right to silence on the basis that
they were entitled to claim this right by virtue of their status as
""accused persons"", ""suspected persons"", or ""unindicted
co‑conspirators"".  This focus on status occludes the focus required
by the Charter , which is a focus on the purpose or character of the
proceedings.  There is no meaningful difference between subpoenas issued in
respect of preliminary inquiries and those issued in respect of criminal
trials.  Since there is no evidence to suggest that the subpoenas issued in
this case can be regarded as a form of pre‑trial interrogation in respect
of any of the appellants or are otherwise objectionable, all of the persons
subpoenaed to testify were properly compellable.  At subsequent proceedings
against any of them, each would be entitled to the protections against self‑incrimination
described in R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, as refined in British
Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 3.

 

                   Section 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act  does not infringe s. 7  of the Charter .

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.:  For
the concurring reasons given in R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R.
451, the appellants are compellable witnesses at the preliminary inquiries and
criminal trials of the other accused appellants. If compelled to testify, they
are entitled to the protection of s. 13  of the Charter  and of
s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , which does not infringe the Charter . 
The appellants could also invoke the residual protection of s. 7  of the Charter 
should the circumstances be of the kind outlined in the concurring reasons in S. (R.J.). 
However, since there is no evidence to suggest that the subpoenas issued in
this case can be regarded as a form of pre‑trial interrogation in respect
of any of the appellants or are otherwise objectionable, none of the appellants
could successfully invoke the residual protection of s. 7  to quash their
subpoenas at this stage, the subpoena stage.

//Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ.//

 

                   The
judgment of Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin,
Iacobucci and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

I.                        Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ.
-- The important question in this appeal is very similar to the main question
raised in R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, heard together with this
appeal, namely, are persons separately charged with an offence, and persons
suspected of an offence, compellable as witnesses at the preliminary inquiries
and criminal trials of other persons charged with the same offence?

 

I.  Facts

 

II.                The facts of the present appeal
are complex.  The appellants are all either charged or suspects in connection
with an explosion and fire that damaged property located at the Buchanan
Logging Site, near Haig Lake, Alberta.  For the purposes of identification
within this appeal, we shall refer to the appellants charged with an offence as
the ""primary appellants"";  those who are only suspects shall be
referred to as ""secondary appellants"".

 

III.               The primary appellants are:  Paul
Ominayak, Reinie Jobin, Victor Scotty, Dwight Gladue, Norman Laboucan, Brian
Laboucan, Sullivan Laboucan, John Sawan, Walter Whitehead, Hector Whitehead,
George Whitehead, John Letendre and Steve Noskey.  All thirteen are charged
with several criminal offences, namely: arson, mischief, possession of
explosives, and wearing a mask in the commission of an indictable offence.

 

IV.              The secondary appellants, who are
not now charged but who are said to be implicated in the offence and who are in
receipt of subpoenas to testify, are:  Rodney Sinclair, Adolphus Wapoose, Gary
Wapoose, Joe Laboucan, Mark Laboucan and Dennis Noskey. 

 

V.                The Crown has conceded that there
is but one actus reus alleged.  However, each of the primary appellants
is the subject of a separate information, with the exception of Walter
Whitehead, Hector Whitehead, George Whitehead, John Letendre and Steve Noskey,
who are jointly charged.  The Crown sought and obtained from the Alberta
Provincial Court, subpoenas requiring Norman Laboucan, Brian Laboucan, Victor
Scotty, Sullivan Laboucan, Joe Laboucan, Gary Wapoose, Adolphus Wapoose, Mark
Laboucan and Rodney Sinclair to testify at the preliminary inquiry of Reinie
Jobin.  Reinie Jobin was subpoenaed to testify at John Sawan's preliminary
inquiry.

 

VI.              The appellants applied for relief
to Berger J. of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta.  Although the exact
nature of the application is unclear, the original notice of motion requested, inter
alia:

 

1.To
quash subpoenas as annexed hereto in Schedule ""A"" setting out the
witnesses subpoenaed and the respective Preliminary Inquiries for which they
are to be compelled and such other subpoenas as have been served upon and of
the Applicants by the time of the hearing of this application;

 

2.In
the nature of prohibition preventing the presiding Judge at the said
Preliminary Inquiries of:  a) Reinie Jobin and b) John Sawan from compelling
the evidence of the Applicants at those Preliminary Inquiries and in the
Preliminary Inquiries against c) Paul Ominayak and d) Victor Scotty or in
Preliminary Inquiries of e) Brian Laboucan; f) Sullivan Laboucan; g) Norman
Laboucan; h) Dwight Gladue; and i) Walter Whitehead, Hector Whitehead, George
Whitehead, John Letendre, and Steve Noskey;

 

3.An
interim Order of prohibition until such time as this application can be heard
and determined;

 

VII.             In addition to seeking to quash the
subpoenas, the appellants obtained permission to challenge the validity of s. 5 
of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 .  The primary
appellants allege that being compelled to testify would violate their right to
silence contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.  Berger J. dismissed
the application without ruling on the validity of s. 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act : (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 281, 123 A.R. 220.

 

VIII.            The appellants appealed the decision
to the Court of Appeal for Alberta.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal
for lack of jurisdiction:  (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 445, 131 A.R. 179, 25 W.A.C.
179, 10 C.R.R. (2d) 313.

 

IX.              In the interim between the decision
of Berger J. and that of the Court of Appeal, all of the primary appellants
waived their rights to a preliminary inquiry in the hope that an appeal route
would be located before any person would be compelled to give evidence. 
However, following the dismissal of the appellants' appeal to the Court of
Appeal, subpoenas were issued in the trial of Reinie Jobin.  

                          

X.                Jobin's trial was to begin in
October 1992.  All the primary and secondary appellants, save Jobin, were once
again subpoenaed to testify.  They applied a second time to the Court of
Queen's Bench for Alberta in order to have the subpoenas quashed.  McFadyen J.
(as she then was) dismissed the application on the same grounds as Berger J.
did.

 

XI.              Jobin's trial finally began on
January 4, 1993.  At the outset of Jobin's trial, defence counsel announced
that a police statement made by Jobin could be admitted without a voir dire. 
On this basis, the Crown agreed not to call any of the subpoenaed witnesses. 
Jobin's counsel later asserted the need for a voir dire.  On March 8,
1993, a mistrial was declared because Crown counsel had referred to Jobin's
police statement in the opening address to the jury.

 

XII.             On February 4, 1993, leave to appeal
was granted at large by this Court, [1993] 1 S.C.R. vii.  The motion book for
leave covered three bases for seeking leave.  First, leave was sought from the
decision of the Court of Appeal.  Second, and in the alternative, it was sought
directly from the decision of Berger J.  Third, and in the alternative,
leave was sought directly from the decision of McFadyen J.

 

II.  Relevant Constitutional and
Statutory Provisions

 

XIII.            The provisions relevant to this
appeal are the same as those relevant to the judgments in S. (R.J.) and R.
v. Primeau, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 60, heard together with this appeal, and are
reproduced in those reasons for judgments.

 

III.  Judgments

 

Court of Queen's Bench
of Alberta (1991), 66
C.C.C. (3d) 281

 

XIV.            Berger J. noted that, in the
application before him, it was assumed that the issuance of subpoenas triggered
a breach of s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  He
indicated, however, that it ""would be dangerous ... to now predict what
evidence will be elicited from each applicant"".  Citing Re Praisoody
(1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 606 (Gen. Div.), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 404 (sub nom. R. v.
Devasagayam), Berger J. stated:  ""While I agree that within s. 7  a
balancing of interests must occur to determine whether there is a violation of
fundamental justice, I prefer the view that there can be no breach until the
proposed witness has testified"" (p. 286).

 

XV.             In focusing on the moment of
compelled testimony, as opposed to the moment at which compelled testimony or
derivative evidence is tendered at subsequent proceedings, Berger J.
acknowledged the potential contrast between his approach and that of La Forest J.
in Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and
Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, in
that La Forest J. suggested that ""there can really be no breach of the Charter 
until unfair evidence is admitted"" (p. 559).  But Berger J. stated (at pp.
286-87):

 

                   In
my view, the testimony of an applicant which may not be admitted at his
subsequent trial may, none the less, confer an unfair advantage upon the Crown
and trigger a Charter  breach.  It is always, at the very least, an advantage
for the Crown to know in advance what the testimony of an accused would be if
he should subsequently elect to testify at his own trial.  It matters not
whether that testimony is inculpatory or exculpatory; it matters not whether
that testimony is damning or innocuous.  It is still an advantage for the Crown
to know ....The relevant inquiry will then be whether, in all of the
circumstances, the advantage thereby gained operates so as to violate the
principles of fundamental justice and to deny the accused a fair trial. 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

Berger J. concluded that a Charter 
breach could be triggered only at the moment of compelled testimony, and not at
the moment when a subpoena is issued.  He indicated that further contextual
elements, unknown at the time of the application, would then fall to be
considered.

 

XVI.            Berger J. discussed these issues in
relation to those applicants who appeared before him already accused of the
alleged offence, and thus refused to quash the subpoenas issued against them. 
He refused, for the same reasons, to quash the subpoenas issued against those
applicants who were not then charged with the alleged offence.

 

XVII.          Finally, Berger J. refused to assess
the constitutionality of s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act .  He noted that
the applicants had failed to challenge ss. 698 , 699 , or 700  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , pursuant to which the subpoenas were issued. 
Also, he noted that no evidence had been called to demonstrate that questions
posed might tend to incriminate the subpoenaed witnesses.  He concluded,
""[o]nce again, the context has yet to be revealed"" (p. 288).

 

XVIII.         Berger J. dismissed the application.

 

Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta (McFadyen J.)

 

XIX.            The relevant portion of McFadyen J.'s
oral reasons state, in full:

 

                   I
dismiss the application for the reasons outlined by Justice Berger in his
judgment in this matter and I adopt his reasons in that regard.

 

Alberta Court of Appeal (per curiam) (1992), 75 C.C.C.
(3d) 445

 

XX.             The Court of Appeal examined cases
cited by the appellants, but noted that ""the appellants' application for
an order quashing the subpoenas in this case was made under s. 24(1)  [of the Charter ]""
(p. 447).  The court then followed R. v. Paquette (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d)
353 (Alta. C.A.), where Stevenson J.A. found that, although provincial superior
courts are courts of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of s. 24(1)  of the
Charter , an appeal will lie to a court of appeal only if the Criminal
Code  so provides (where proceedings are criminal in nature) or where the
proceeding is a prerogative one.

 

XXI.            The Court of Appeal held that, in
respect of Berger J.'s refusal to quash the subpoenas, the proceeding was
clearly criminal in nature, since the subpoenas were issued under the authority
of the Criminal Code .  In so far as the Criminal Code  provides no
right of appeal, and in so far as no prerogative relief was sought, the court
held that the appellants had no right of appeal.

 

XXII.          In respect of Berger J.'s refusal to
consider the constitutionality of s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act ,
the Court of Appeal concluded (at p. 448):

 

                   Again
the appellants do not have the right to appeal from this decision.  This
proceeding in so far as it relates to this issue is clearly criminal in
nature.  The concern of the appellants is that as a result of s. 5 , witnesses
may incriminate themselves.  The appellants did not seek any relief other than
a declaration that s. 5  was inconsistent with s. 7  of the Charter , and
therefore of no force or effect under s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 . 
There is nothing in the Criminal Code  or in the Charter  which gives them
the right to appeal from a refusal to grant a declaration.

 

XXIII.         The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal
for want of jurisdiction.  

 

IV.  Issues

 

XXIV.         There are two issues in this appeal:

 

1.Upon
what basis does this Court have jurisdiction to hear the appeal?

 

2.Are
persons separately charged with an offence, and persons suspected of an
offence, compellable as witnesses at the preliminary inquiries and criminal
trials of other persons charged with the same offence, or would compellability
in this context violate s. 7  of the Charter ?

 

XXV.          On March 30, 1993, the following
constitutional questions were stated:

 

1.[Does]
s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 , infringe[] s. 7 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is affirmative, is the limitation one which is
reasonable, prescribed by law, and demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1  of
the Charter ?

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  Upon what basis does this Court
have jurisdiction to hear the appeal?

 

XXVI.         The jurisdictional issue raised in this
case is substantially similar to that addressed by the Court in Dagenais v.
Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835.  On its specific facts,
this appeal quite closely resembles the situation in Primeau, the
reasons of which have been released concurrently with this appeal. 

 

XXVII.        In Dagenais, Lamer C.J., writing
for the majority, elaborated the appropriate channels to follow in order to
challenge the validity of a publication ban.  The procedures vary depending on
the status of the person challenging the order, that is, whether a party or
third party is involved.  For parties, the accused and the Crown, they must
apply for relief to the trial judge, or to the level of court having
jurisdiction to hear the trial, if known, or otherwise to a superior court
judge.  An appeal of such a decision must await the end of the trial. 

 

XXVIII.      For third parties to a criminal proceeding,
the type of recourse to seek is dictated by the court issuing the order.  A
provincial court order should be challenged by an application to a superior
court for the extraordinary remedy of certiorari.    This decision can
then be appealed pursuant to s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .  A superior
court order can be challenged by seeking leave to appeal directly to this Court
pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 .

 

XXIX.         The order at issue in this appeal is the
issuance of subpoenas to the appellants by the Alberta Provincial Court.  The
Court of Appeal for Alberta rejected the appeal launched by the appellants
pursuant to s. 813  of the Criminal Code , because of a lack of
jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  The Court cited the absence of a statutory
right of appeal in the Criminal Code  as fatal to the appellants'
application.  It is significant that the Court of Appeal considered that the
appellants had in essence made an application for relief based solely on s.
24(1)  of the Charter .  It based this finding on the fact that the
appellants had effectively abandoned their application for prohibition, by not
pleading it before Berger J., and that Berger J. had based his decision solely
on s. 24(1)  of the Charter . 

 

XXX.          In the light of its finding that the
present application was made solely pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter ,
the Court of Appeal held that no right of appeal lay from the decision of
Berger J.  Neither the Criminal Code , nor the Charter  (as
interpreted in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863) provide for such
a right.  As such, the Court of Appeal decided it lacked jurisdiction to hear
the appeal.  

 

XXXI.         In the case at bar, as in Primeau,
all the appellants, excluding Jobin for the moment, are third parties.  Each
appellant, excluding Jobin, is seeking to challenge a subpoena issued by the
Alberta Provincial Court requiring him to testify at either the preliminary
inquiry or the trial of a person accused of the same indictable offence as that
with which he is either charged or suspected.

 

XXXII.        Given that the order in question emanates
from a provincial court, the proper procedure to follow, as laid out in Dagenais,
is to apply to a superior court judge for the issuance of a writ of certiorari. 
As noted in Dagenais, an immediate appeal becomes possible from an order
refusing to grant certiorari through the operation of s. 784(1)  of the Criminal
Code .

 

XXXIII.      As in Primeau, we are faced with a
situation where the appellants have not technically complied with the
procedures set out in Dagenais.  In our view, however, the
jurisdictional question can be resolved in much the same way and for the same
reasons as it was solved in Primeau.  Given that neither the appellants,
nor the Court of Appeal had the benefit of this Court's reasons in Dagenais,
we find that it is sufficient that the appellants applied for s. 24(1)  Charter 
relief, which by its nature would be included in the expanded remedial scope of
certiorari described in Dagenais.  The Court of Appeal therefore
did have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, pursuant to s. 784(1)  of the Criminal
Code .  The jurisdiction of this Court follows naturally from the decision
of the Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act 
and there is no need to examine the alternative jurisdictional grounds on which
leave to appeal was granted.

 

XXXIV.      The application for leave to appeal also
sought to appeal from the judgment of McFadyen J. who dismissed the application
of the appellants, other than Jobin, for the reasons of Berger J.  It is not
necessary to decide whether an appeal lies from that judgment to this Court
since the principles that apply to determine the substantive issue raised by
the decision of Berger J. are also determinative in respect of the judgment of
McFadyen J.

 

B.Are persons separately charged with an
offence, and persons suspected of an offence, compellable as witnesses at the
preliminary inquiries and criminal trials of other persons charged with the
same offence, or would compellability in this context violate s. 7 of the
Charter?

 

XXXV.       In refusing to quash the subpoenas
confronting him, Berger J. suggested that the liberty interest under s. 7 is
not engaged until the moment that testimony occurs, on the theory that it is
relevant to consider context at that time.  For the reasons we expressed in S.
(R.J.), supra, the liberty interest is engaged when a deprivation is
imminent, and the applicants before Berger J. applied for relief at the
appropriate time.

 

XXXVI.      The relief they sought, however, was not
properly available to them.  The appellants claimed a right to silence on the
basis that they were entitled to claim this right by virtue of a status,
namely, ""accused person"", ""suspected person"", or
""unindicted co-conspirator"".  This focus on status occludes the focus
required by the Charter , which is a focus on the purpose or character of
the proceedings.  Thus, the fact that some of the appellants were not accused
of anything at the time of their application is not of primary importance.  It
also follows from the reasons in S. (R.J.), as elaborated on in British
Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 3, released
concurrently, and Primeau, supra, that there is no meaningful
difference between subpoenas issued in respect of preliminary inquiries and
those issued in respect of Jobin's criminal trial.  Finally, there is no
evidence to suggest that the subpoenas issued in this case can be regarded as a
form of pre-trial interrogation in respect of any of the appellants or are
otherwise objectionable, such that a different analysis might have obtained for
the reasons expressed in S. (R.J.) and further elaborated on in Branch.

 

VI.  Disposition

 

XXXVII.     All of the persons subpoenaed to testify
were properly compellable.  At subsequent proceedings against any of them, each
would be entitled to the protections against self-incrimination described in S.
(R.J.) as refined in Branch.

 

XXXVIII.    We would answer the constitutional questions
stated on March 30, 1993, in the following way:

 

1.[Does]
s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 , infringe[] s. 7 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer: 
No.

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is affirmative, is the limitation one which is
reasonable, prescribed by law, and demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1  of
the Charter ?

 

Answer: 
It is not necessary to answer this question.

 

XXXIX.      We would dismiss the appeal.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- This case raises
the same issues as are raised in the companion case of R. v. Primeau,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 60.  As well, this case raises the additional issue of the
constitutional validity of s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-5 .  I have read the joint reasons of my colleagues Sopinka and
Iacobucci JJ. and agree that this appeal should be dismissed.  I reach this
conclusion, however, by a different route.

 

I.                 I say at the outset, as my
colleagues point out and as my concurring reasons in R. v. S. (R.J.),
[1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, make clear, that the ""primary"" and
""secondary"" appellants, to use my colleagues' terminology, are
compellable witnesses at each other's preliminary inquiries and criminal
trials.  However, if compelled to testify, they are entitled to the protection
of s. 13  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and
s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , which, like my colleagues, I find
does not infringe the Charter .  In addition, should the circumstances be
of the kind I outlined in my concurring reasons in S. (R.J.), the
appellants could invoke the residual protection of s. 7  of the Charter . 
I agree, though, with my colleagues that ""there is no evidence to suggest
that the subpoenas issued in this case can be regarded as a form of pre-trial
interrogation in respect of any of the appellants or are otherwise
objectionable"" (p. 93).  Accordingly, I find that at this stage, the
subpoena stage, none of the appellants could successfully invoke the residual
protection of s. 7  outlined in my reasons in S. (R.J.) to quash
their subpoenas.  As I emphasized in S. (R.J.), it will be rare indeed
that the residual protection of s. 7  could be successfully invoked at the
subpoena stage.  In this respect, I agree with Berger J., who dealt with the
appellants' first application to quash subpoenas, when he stated:  ""[i]t
would be dangerous. . . to now predict what evidence will be elicited from each
applicant"" and ""I prefer the view that there can be no breach until
the proposed witness has testified"" ((1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 281, at
p. 286).

 

II.                As for the issue of jurisdiction,
I refer to my reasons in the companion case of Primeau, released
concurrently with this decision.  For the reasons outlined in Primeau, I
conclude that the appellants could appeal the decision of Berger J. to the
Court of Appeal and could appeal, with leave, the decision of the Court of
Appeal to this Court.  As regards a direct appeal from the decision of McFadyen
J., who dealt with the appellants' second application to quash subpoenas, I
agree with my colleagues that ""[i]t is not necessary to decide whether an
appeal lies from that judgment to this Court since the principles that apply to
determine the substantive issue raised by the decision of Berger J. are also
determinative in respect of the judgment of McFadyen J."" (p. 92).

 

III.               For the reasons outlined above, I
would dismiss the appeal.

                   P and C were
charged with first degree murder and, on a separate information, L was charged
with the same offence.  P was later subpoenaed by a provincial court judge to
testify at L's preliminary inquiry.  P's counsel filed a motion seeking relief
under s. 24(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and
by means of prohibition.  The Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench granted the
motion and quashed the subpoena, holding that to compel P to testify would
violate his rights under s. 7  of the Charter .  The Court of Appeal
allowed the Crown's appeal.  This appeal raises two issues: (1) whether
this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal; and (2) whether an
accused separately charged with an offence is compellable as a witness at the
preliminary inquiry of another accused charged with the same offence.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

(1)  Jurisdiction

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.: Since P is a
third party to L's criminal proceedings, to challenge the subpoena order issued
by the Provincial Court, P must follow the procedures for third parties
outlined recently in Dagenais and apply to a superior court judge for
the issuance of a writ of certiorari.  While, technically, P has not
followed the correct procedure since he did not have the benefit of this
Court's reasons in Dagenais, the remedy sought by P is substantially
similar to the type that could be sought through a certiorari after Dagenais
and the proceedings in the present case should, for the purposes of determining
jurisdiction, be treated as tantamount to a Dagenais certiorari
application.  This Court therefore has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.: While
the procedure followed by P in challenging the subpoena was not the one
suggested by the majority in Dagenais, it nonetheless was, on the facts
of this case, open to him. A superior court judge is a court of competent
jurisdiction to hear an application for Charter  relief and, in the
present circumstances, P could apply for a writ of prohibition.  Although,
applicants challenging subpoenas issued by provincial court judges in the
criminal context should, from now on, follow the procedural route set out in Dagenais,
P should not be faulted for having followed a somewhat different route, given
that he first applied to quash his subpoena prior to the release of this
Court's decision in Dagenais.  Furthermore, since P's s. 24(1) 
application to quash the subpoena is identical in substance to an application
to quash the subpoena through the writ of certiorari (as expanded in Dagenais),
form must yield to substance and the appeal rights set out in Dagenais
from an application for certiorari must be available.  While there is no
general right of appeal from a s. 24(1)  application, in the case at hand, P's
application to quash the subpoena was tantamount to an application for certiorari
and as such was subject to the appellate procedures set out in Dagenais. 
Moreover, if a court order issued in the criminal context would be, according
to Dagenais, open to challenge by an affected third party, it must also
be open to challenge, through the same procedures, by parties to the criminal
proceeding who are also effected by it.  Accordingly, the Crown could appeal
the Court of Queen's Bench's decision to the Court of Appeal, and P could, with
leave, appeal the Court of Appeal's decision to this Court.

 

(2)  Compellability

 

                    Per
Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin,
Iacobucci and Major JJ.: The focus required by the Charter  is not
on P's status as an accused but on the purpose for which the state wishes to
compel his testimony.  Even if separately charged as an accused person, a
witness appearing in another person's criminal trial will ordinarily be
compellable in that trial unless it is established that the predominant purpose
in compelling the testimony is incrimination of the witness.  A similar test
must be applied in respect of the preliminary inquiry.  P was thus properly
compellable at L's preliminary inquiry since there is no evidence to suggest
that the predominant purpose of the inquiry is a form of pre‑trial
interrogation in respect of P or is otherwise objectionable.  At subsequent
proceedings against him, P would be entitled to the protections against self‑incrimination
described in R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, and British
Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 3. 

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.: For the
concurring reasons given in R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, P
is compellable at L's preliminary inquiry.  P has not demonstrated that he is
within any of the conditions described in those reasons which would allow him
to challenge the subpoena.  P will enjoy all the Charter  protections
outlined in these concurring reasons as well as those of s. 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act .

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci
and Major JJ. was delivered by 

 

I.                 Sopinka
and Iacobucci JJ. -- The important question in this appeal is very
similar to that which was raised in R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R.
451, heard together with this appeal, namely, are persons separately charged
with an offence compellable as witnesses at the preliminary inquiries of other
persons charged with the same offence?

 

I.  Facts

 

II.                The appellant, Dorne James
Primeau, was jointly charged along with Rory Michael Cornish with the first
degree murder of Calvin Aubichon.  On a separate information, Jerry Allan
Lefort was charged with the same murder.

 

III.               A preliminary inquiry against
Primeau and Cornish was scheduled at the Saskatchewan Provincial Court for June
1993.  Lefort's preliminary inquiry, however, began in March 1993.  Primeau was
subpoenaed to testify at Lefort's inquiry (an order of production was obtained,
Primeau being on remand).  As a result, Primeau filed a motion seeking:  (1)
relief under s. 24(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to
prevent him from being compelled as a witness at the preliminary inquiry of
Lefort; and, (2) a writ of prohibition to prevent the Provincial Court judge
from compelling his presence at the inquiry, and to prevent him from being
compelled to testify at that inquiry.

 

IV.              The Saskatchewan Court of Queen's
Bench granted Primeau's motion:  (1993), 108 Sask. R. 193.  The Crown's appeal
to the Court of Appeal was allowed:  (1993), 113 Sask. R. 4, 52 W.A.C. 4, 85
C.C.C. (3d) 188, 17 C.R.R. (2d) 356.  This Court granted leave to appeal from
the Court of Appeal's decision:  [1993] 4 S.C.R. vii.

 

II.  Relevant
Constitutional and Statutory Provisions

 

V.                With one exception, the
constitutional and statutory provisions relevant to this appeal are the same as
those relevant to the judgment in S. (R.J.), supra, and they are
reproduced in those reasons for judgment.  The exception is the following:

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

                   784. (1) An appeal lies to the court of
appeal from a decision granting or refusing the relief sought in proceedings by
way of mandamus, certiorari or prohibition.

 

III.  Judgments

 

Saskatchewan Court of
Queen's Bench (1993),
108 Sask. R. 193

 

VI.              Geatros J. first noted the
alternative remedies sought in Primeau's motion, namely, relief under s. 24(1) 
of the Charter , and relief by way of a writ of prohibition.  Geatros J.
then followed Re Praisoody (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 606 (Gen. Div.), 61
C.C.C. (3d) 404 (sub nom. R. v. Devasagayam), and stated that the rights
protected by s. 7  of the Charter  go beyond the rights protected in ss.
11 (c) and 13 .  He quoted a passage from E. Ratushny, ""The Role of
the Accused in the Criminal Process"", in G.-A. Beaudoin and E. Ratushny,
eds., The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (2nd ed. 1989), 451,
at pp. 483-84, in which it is suggested that ""many of the protections
provided by the criminal process may be subverted by calling the suspect or
accused as a witness at some other proceeding prior to his criminal
trial"".  He indicated that Primeau did not seek relief prematurely, and
concluded (at p. 198):

 

                   By
compelling Primeau to testify at the preliminary inquiry of Lefort, his right
to silence has been effectively denied.  It is not an answer for the Crown to
say that Primeau's testimony at the preliminary inquiry could not be used
against him at his trial.  He is entitled to say nothing until his trial, and
then only if he chooses to testify.  If Primeau were required to testify at
this time the Crown would acquire an advantage indirectly that it could not
obtain directly.

 

Geatros J. granted Primeau's motion
and ordered, ""under s. 24(1)  of the Charter , that [Primeau could
not] be compelled to testify"" at the preliminary inquiry of Lefort.

 

Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan (1993),
85 C.C.C. (3d) 188

 

VII.             Gerwing J.A., for the court,
discussed the appeal before her almost exclusively with regard to other
reported decisions.  In this regard, she indicated that two decisions cited to
her were in direct conflict, Praisoody, supra, and Perreault
v. Thivierge (1992), 17 C.R.R. (2d) 361 (Que. C.A.).  She quoted from the
latter case, in which the following was stated:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Up to the present time, except for
the isolated decision referred to by the appellant rendered by the Ontario
Court (General Division) in [Re Praisoody (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 606, at
p. 618], I know of no other precedent which has held that the fact of
being charged or of having already been committed for trial prevents the
subpoena of an individual as a witness at the preliminary inquiry of another on
the ground that he might thereby be required to disclose his defence at an
earlier time than he would otherwise have had to.

 

Further, Gerwing J.A. indicated that
the decision in Praisoody was considered by the Ontario Court of Appeal
in R. v. S. (R.J.) (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 397, and she noted that: 
""[w]hile the court [in S. (R.J.)] did refer to and distinguish [Praisoody],
supra, on the basis that it dealt with a preliminary inquiry, it did not
do so, in our view, in a way which suggested its correctness"" (p. 191).

 

VIII.            Gerwing J.A. expressed a preference
for the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Perreault and for the
Ontario Court of Appeal decision in S. (R.J.).  She allowed the Crown's
appeal and set aside the order of Geatros J.

 

IV.  Issues

 

IX.              There are two issues in this
appeal:

 

1.Does
this Court have jurisdiction to entertain an appeal?

 

2.Are
persons separately charged with an offence compellable as witnesses at the
preliminary inquiries of other persons charged with the same offence, or would
compellability in this context violate s. 7  of the Charter ?

 

No constitutional questions were
stated in this appeal, although the judgments below implicitly rest upon
conclusions which affect the constitutionality of  statutory subpoena powers as
well as s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 .  However,
since the necessary constitutional questions were stated as part of the appeal
in S. (R.J.) and R. v. Jobin, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 78, heard together
with this appeal, this deficiency can be ignored.

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  Issue 1:  Does this Court have
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal?

 

X.                The appellant sought at the
outset to challenge a subpoena, issued from the Provincial Court, to testify at
the preliminary inquiry of a co-accused.  He argued that the subpoena violated
his Charter  right to protection against self-incrimination.  The
jurisdictional point in the present appeal is similar to that addressed by this
Court in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835. 
Lamer C.J., writing for the majority, phrased the issue as follows (at p. 856):

 

...
what court(s) have jurisdiction to hear a third party challenge to a
publication ban order sought by the Crown and/or defendant(s) in a criminal
proceeding, and made by a provincial or superior court judge under his or her
common law or legislated discretionary authority?

 

Although the specific order challenged
in the case at bar is a subpoena and not a publication ban, this case can
nonetheless be evaluated in the light of the procedural scheme laid down in Dagenais,
which outlines the channels to follow when seeking redress of a court order
that potentially violates the Charter .

 

XI.              In Dagenais, the Court
traces two separate paths to follow for challenges to orders made in a criminal
proceeding: one for the parties to the proceeding, another for third
parties.  Both the accused and the Crown must apply for relief to the trial
judge, or to the level of court having jurisdiction to hear the trial, if
known, or otherwise to a superior court judge.  An appeal of such a decision
must await the end of the trial.  

 

XII.             The procedure for third parties
differs for two reasons.   First, a third party, being outside the actual
proceedings, cannot apply to the trial judge for relief.  Second, an order
deciding an issue with respect to a third party is a final order.  Such a
characterization is important in order to comply with the general rule barring
interlocutory appeals in criminal matters.

 

XIII.            As a result of these two differences,
the procedural route to follow for a third party is determined by the level of
court issuing the order.  A provincial court order is to be challenged through
an application to a superior court judge for the extraordinary remedy of certiorari. 
However, given that this remedy is limited to the quashing of an order, the
Court decided that it was necessary, for specific circumstances, to enlarge the
remedial scope of certiorari (at p. 866):

 

... 
it is open to this Court to enlarge the remedial powers of certiorari
and I do so now for limited circumstances.  Given that the common law
rule authorizing publication bans must be consistent with Charter 
principles, I am of the view that the remedies available where a judge errs in
applying this rule should be consistent with the remedial powers under the Charter . 
Therefore, the remedial powers of certiorari should be expanded to include
the remedies that are available through s. 24(1)  of the Charter . 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

By the reasoning of the Court, the
advantages of this route lie in its use of established procedures and its
consistency with recent decisions of the Court.  Moreover, an immediate appeal
becomes possible from an order granting or refusing to grant certiorari
through the operation of s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .  A further
appeal to this Court is possible where leave to appeal is obtained pursuant to
s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 .

 

XIV.            A different route is required for the
challenging of an order made by a superior court judge, as certiorari
does not lie against the decision of such a judge.  As a result, the Court in Dagenais
held that such orders should be challenged by seeking leave to appeal directly
to this Court pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act .  

 

XV.             The appellant has been subpoenaed to
testify at the preliminary inquiry of a co-accused.  Despite this fact, the
subpoena has not occurred in the context of his own trial, and as such we
cannot consider him as a party to the criminal proceedings which generated the
order he wishes to challenge.  He is a third party to the trial of Lefort, and
consequently, he must follow the procedures for third parties as outlined in Dagenais.

 

XVI.            As the order in question has been
issued by the Provincial Court, the appellant must challenge it by seeking the
extraordinary remedy of certiorari from a superior court judge. 
Technically, of course, the appellant has not followed the correct procedure as
he sought relief in the form of a s. 24(1)  Charter  remedy and by means
of prohibition.  However, neither the appellant nor the superior court judge
had the benefit of the reasons of this Court in Dagenais to guide them. 
If one examines the nature of the application made by the appellant, there is
considerable resemblance between prohibition and the s. 24(1)  remedy sought,
and the expanded notion of certiorari developed in Dagenais.  In
that respect, both approaches involve applications for prerogative writs. 
Since the remedy sought by the appellant is substantially similar to the type
that could be sought through certiorari after Dagenais, we are of
the view that the proceedings in the present case should, for the purposes of
determining jurisdiction, be treated as tantamount to a Dagenais certiorari
application.  Indeed, we should presume that the appellant would have framed
his application in the proper manner had this Court's decision in Dagenais
been available to him at the time.

 

XVII.          Because we are willing to consider that
the appellant has in effect complied with the requirements set out in Dagenais,
we find that this Court has jurisdiction.

 

B.Issue
2:  Are persons separately charged with an offence compellable as witnesses at
the preliminary inquiries of other persons charged with the same offence, or
would compellability in this context violate s. 7 of the Charter?

 

XVIII.         Geatros J. adopted the reasoning of Praisoody,
supra, in quashing the subpoena issued against Primeau.  The approach
adopted by Geatros J. is not in accordance with our decision in British
Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 3, released
concurrently, and the Court of Appeal was right to allow the appeal.

 

XIX.            The argument of the appellant focuses
attention upon his status as an accused person, and excludes analysis of the
purpose for which the state wishes to compel his testimony.  As expressed by
Iacobucci J. in his reasons in S. (R.J.), supra, this focus is
inappropriate.  Those reasons, which were elaborated on in Branch,
indicate that, even if separately charged as an accused person, a witness
appearing in another person's criminal trial will ordinarily be compellable in
that criminal trial unless it is established that the predominant purpose in
compelling the testimony is incrimination of the witness.  If that be the case,
then a similar test must be applied in respect of the preliminary inquiry,
since the criminal trial might never be reached if the Crown is unable to call
proposed trial evidence at that inquiry.  Finally, there is no evidence to
suggest that the predominant purpose of the preliminary inquiry is a form of
proposed pre-trial interrogation in respect of Primeau or is otherwise
objectionable, such that a different analysis might have obtained on the basis
of the reasons expressed in S. (R.J.) and Branch.

 

VI.  Disposition

 

XX.             Primeau was properly compellable at
the preliminary inquiry against Lefort.  At subsequent proceedings against him,
Primeau would be entitled to the protections against self-incrimination
described in S. (R.J.) and Branch.  We would therefore dismiss
the appeal.

 

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

XXI.            L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- This case raises the issue of whether it is consistent with
s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to compel a
person charged separately with an offence, here the appellant, to testify at a
criminal proceeding of another person charged with an offence arising from the
same set of circumstances.  In addition to this substantive issue, this case
also raises a jurisdictional issue concerning whether and how a witness can
challenge a subpoena or other order issued by a justice of the peace or a
provincial court judge compelling him to testify at a criminal proceeding.  In
particular, it is necessary to determine whether this Court has jurisdiction to
entertain this appeal.

 

XXII.          I have read the joint reasons of my
colleagues Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ. on these two questions.  While I agree
with their conclusion that this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal and
that the appellant is compellable at the preliminary inquiry of Jerry Allan
Lefort, I do not entirely agree with their reasons to this effect.

 

I.  Facts and
Proceedings

 

XXIII.         The appellant and Rory Michael Cornish
are jointly charged with the first degree murder of Calvin Aubichon.  On a
separate information, Lefort is also charged with the first degree murder of
Aubichon.  The appellant was subpoenaed by a provincial court judge to testify at
the preliminary inquiry of Lefort (an order of production was obtained since
Primeau was on remand).  In response, the appellant applied to the Court of
Queen's Bench, pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter , for an order not to
be compelled to testify at the preliminary inquiry in question.  The appellant
also applied for a writ of prohibition to prevent the Provincial Court judge
from compelling his presence at the preliminary inquiry and from requiring him
to testify.   On March 30, 1993, Geatros J. of the Saskatchewan Court of
Queen's Bench granted the appellant's motion on the basis that the appellant's
rights under s. 7  of the Charter  would be violated if he were compelled
to testify at the preliminary inquiry: (1993), 108 Sask. R. 193 .  On June 7,
1993, the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan allowed the respondent's appeal:
(1993), 113 Sask. R. 4 , 52  W.A.C. 4, 85 C.C.C. (3d) 188, 17 C.R.R. (2d) 356. 
It is from this decision that the appellant appeals to this Court.

XXIV.         The jurisdictional issue raised by this
case concerns whether and how a witness can challenge a subpoena or other order
compelling him to testify at a criminal proceeding.  This issue is a component
of the larger question of whether and how third parties can challenge
interlocutory court orders arising out of criminal proceedings.   This larger
question was recently addressed by this Court in Dagenais v. Canadian
Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835. 

 

XXV.          In Dagenais, this Court
considered the procedural avenues through which a third party could challenge a
publication ban issued in the criminal context.  The majority held that where
such a publication ban is issued by a superior court judge, a third party can
challenge it by appealing (with leave) directly to this Court.  On the other
hand, where such a publication ban is issued by a provincial court judge, a
third party can challenge it by applying to a superior court judge for a writ
of certiorari.  The decision of the superior court judge is then subject
to appeal to the Court of Appeal, and from there, with leave, to this Court.

 

XXVI.         Technically, Dagenais dealt only
with third party challenges to publication bans.  However, like my colleagues
Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ., I believe that the procedures outlined by the
majority in Dagenais are, as an inevitable consequence, also applicable
with respect to third party challenges to other court orders, such as subpoenas,
issued in the criminal context.  In saying this, I do not want to be
misunderstood as expressing support for the majority's position in Dagenais. 
I continue to disagree with many aspects of the majority's decision for the
reasons outlined in my dissenting reasons.  Nonetheless, despite my concerns, I
feel bound to follow the decision of the majority.

 

XXVII.        Applying the decision of the majority to
the case at hand, I find that the appellant should have challenged the impugned
subpoena through the prerogative writ of certiorari, as expanded in Dagenais. 
This was not, however, the procedure followed by the appellant.  Instead, the
appellant sought prohibition and a remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter . 
Moreover, the decision of Geatros J. quashing the subpoena was grounded not
in prohibition, but in s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

 

XXVIII.      While the procedure followed by the
appellant in challenging the impugned subpoena was not the one suggested in Dagenais,
it nonetheless was, on the facts of this case, open to him. This Court, in R.
v. Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588, determined that a superior court judge is a
court of competent jurisdiction to hear an application for Charter 
relief such as the one made by the appellant.  As well, in the circumstances of
this case, the appellant could apply for a writ of prohibition.  Although
applicants challenging subpoenas issued by provincial court judges in the
criminal context should, from now on, follow the procedural route set out in Dagenais,
the appellant in this case should not be faulted for having followed a somewhat
different procedural route, given that he first applied to quash his subpoena
prior to the release of this Court's decision in Dagenais.  This said,
the question which remains is whether the decision of Geatros J., based as it
was on s. 24(1)  of the Charter , was subject to appeal.

 

XXIX.         On this question, I note that while the
appellant's s. 24(1)  application to quash the impugned subpoena differed in
form from the procedure outlined in Dagenais, it did not differ in
substance.  The effect of the appellant's s. 24(1)  application was identical to
the effect of an application to quash a subpoena by way of certiorari
(as expanded in Dagenais).  Accordingly, I find that the appellant's
application was tantamount to such an application for certiorari. 
Following the reasoning of this Court in R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
128, I conclude that the appellate procedure set out in Dagenais with
respect to an application for certiorari is also available in the case
at hand.

 

XXX.          The above conclusion should not,
however, be interpreted as granting a right of appeal from s. 24(1)  applications
generally.  It was clearly held in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
863, that no right of appeal lies from a decision with respect to an
application for a remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  save where
conferred by statute, or, I would add, where established at common law.  In the
case at hand, however, since the s. 24(1)  application to quash the subpoena
made by the appellant, a third party to the criminal proceedings, is identical
in substance to an application to quash the subpoena through the writ of certiorari
(as expanded in Dagenais), form must yield to substance and the appeal
rights set out in Dagenais from an application for certiorari
must be available.  Such a substance over form approach to appellate
jurisdiction is consistent with this Court's decision in Jewitt, supra,
and with my reasons in R. v. Laba, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 965.  To paraphrase
the words of Chief Justice Warren of the United States Supreme Court (""The
Law and the Future"", in Fortune (November 1955), 106, at
p. 224), the spirit and not the form of the law keeps justice alive.  

 

XXXI.         Examining the ""spirit"" or the
""substance"" of the appellant's initial application to the
Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench, I conclude that it was tantamount to an
application for certiorari and that as such was subject to the appellate
procedure set out in Dagenais.  Accordingly, the respondent could appeal
the decision of Geatros J. to the Court of Appeal.  Furthermore, the appellant
could, with leave, appeal the Court of Appeal's decision to this Court.

 

XXXII.        The above resolves the jurisdictional
question raised by this case.  However, before moving on to the substantive
question concerning the compellability of the appellant, I wish to emphasize
that, in my view, if a court order issued in the criminal context would be,
according to Dagenais, open to challenge by an affected third party, it
must also be open to challenge, through the same procedures, by parties to the
criminal proceeding who are also affected by it.  It is for this reason that I
conclude that, in this case, the Crown, a party to the underlying criminal
proceedings, benefits from the same appellate rights as Primeau, a third party,
with respect to the challenge of the impugned subpoena.  In light of this, I
wish to stress that the procedural route used by the Crown in R. v. S.
(R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, to appeal a successful application by a third
party to quash a subpoena should be avoided.  In S. (R.J.), a third
party successfully applied to the trial judge to quash his subpoena.  As a
result of the quashing of the subpoena, the Crown was forced to request that
the charges against the accused be dismissed on the basis of insufficient
evidence.  The Crown then appealed this dismissal on the grounds that the judge
erred in quashing the subpoena.  While such a procedure was the only option
prior to Dagenais, this is no longer the case.

 

B.  Compellability 

 

XXXIII.      The substantive issue raised by this case
concerns whether it is consistent with s. 7  of the Charter  to compel a
person charged separately with an offence, here the appellant, to testify at a
criminal proceeding of another person charged with an offence arising from the
same set of circumstances.

 

XXXIV.      In answering this question, I refer to my
concurring reasons in S. (R.J.) which dealt with a similar issue. 
Applying the considerations I outlined in S. (R.J.), I find that the
appellant is compellable in the case at hand as he has not demonstrated that he
is within any of the conditions outlined in S. (R.J.) which would allow
him to challenge the impugned subpoena.  This said, I note that the appellant,
if compelled, will enjoy all of the Charter  protections outlined in my
concurring reasons in S. (R.J.), as well as those of s. 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 .

 

III.  Disposition

 

XXXV.       For the reasons outlined above, I would
dismiss the appeal.

                     On a clear summer
day, the accused drove his boat at considerable speed toward a known swimming
area.  As he approached, a group of swimmers waved their arms and shouted to
alert the accused of the dangerous situation.  The bow of the boat was up at such
an angle that the accused could not see in front of the boat and there was no
lookout.  The boat ploughed through the group of swimmers, striking and fatally
injuring one of them.  The accused was charged with operating a vessel in a
manner dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(4)  of the Criminal
Code .  The trial judge considered all the evidence and the circumstances
and convicted the accused.  The conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal.

 

                   Held (Lamer C.J. and Sopinka,
McLachlin and Major JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci JJ.:  The trial judge adequately described the actus
reus of the offence as conduct which, viewed objectively, constituted a
significant departure from the standard of a reasonably prudent person.  There
is no real difference between the phrase ""significant departure"" and
the phrase ""marked departure"" used by this Court in Hundal
when referring to the actus reus.  The mens rea test adopted by
the trial judge, however, required the Crown to prove advertent negligence. 
This subjective test places a stricter onus on the Crown than the modified
objective test put forward by this Court in Hundal.  The trial judge's
statement at the end of his reasons that ""the accused operated the boat
. . . in a manner a prudent person would not"" does not detract
from this conclusion.  When, as in this case, a trial judge sets out the legal
principle and test that he intends to apply it should be assumed, in the
absence of a very clear indication to the contrary, that he in fact followed
that very course.  Although the trial judge committed an error in law in
applying a more stringent test for the mens rea, it is appropriate to
apply s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  since no
miscarriage of justice was occasioned by this error.  Further there was strong,
cogent and convincing evidence upon which the trial judge could base his
conclusion that there was a significant or marked departure from the standard
of care of a reasonable person.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka,
McLachlin and Major JJ. (dissenting):  While, throughout his reasons, the
trial judge set out a stricter test than that laid down by this Court in Hundal,
there is uncertainty as to what test the trial judge in effect applied.  He
seems to have concluded, however, that the accused was guilty because he
operated his boat ""in a manner a prudent person would not"".  This is
a much easier test for the Crown to meet than the test set out in Hundal.

view that, in the light of the last paragraph of the trial judge's reasons, set
out in Justice Cory's reasons, they are left uncertain as to what test the
trial judge did in effect apply.  While he did set out a stricter test
throughout his reasons, he seems to us to have concluded that the accused is
guilty because he operated his boat ""in a manner a prudent person would
not"".  This obviously is a much easier test for the Crown to meet than
that which was set down in the majority reasons of the Court in R. v. Hundal,

//Cory J.//

 

                   The judgment of La
Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. was delivered by

 

4                 Cory
J. -- On a bright and sunny Saturday afternoon, the appellant drove his
boat through a group of seven wildly waving, shouting young swimmers.  The boat
struck and fatally injured one of the young men.  This appeal arises from the
conviction of the appellant on a charge of dangerous operation of a vessel,
under s. 249(4)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
at the time of the accident.

 

Factual Background

 

5                 There was ample evidence of a
cogent, and convincing nature presented to the trial judge upon which he could
base his conviction of the appellant.

 

6                 The accident took place on
Saturday afternoon, the 17th of August, 1991.  It was a warm, clear summer
day.  The trial judge found that ""the rocks"" at Cribbons Point was
then, as it had been for many years, a location which had a magnetic attraction
for swimmers, divers and sunbathers.  As might be expected, there were many
people swimming and sunbathing at ""the rocks"" when the accident
occurred.  At that time, some 300 feet out from ""the rocks"", a
group of seven boys was swimming back towards the shore.  The appellant knew
that ""the rocks"" was frequented by swimmers.  Indeed, in the past he
had been swimming there himself.  On this tragic afternoon, he was cruising in
his boat with members of his family.  As he approached the swimming boys, the boat
appeared to be bouncing or skipping in the small chop.  Estimates of the speed
varied with some witnesses testifying that it was fast.  The seven boys waved
their arms and shouted, as did those on the shore, to alert the appellant to
the dangerous situation, all to no avail.  The boat ploughed through the group
of swimmers and the propeller struck the victim.

 

7                 At the time of the accident, the
bow of the boat was up at such an angle that the appellant could not see in
front of the boat.  It was possible to have some visibility ahead by leaning
over the side and looking forward.  The trial judge specifically found that
this was not done.

 

8                 In an area where the appellant
knew that there could be swimmers, he drove blindly ahead impervious to what
was in front of him.  No doubt it is important, from an historical point of
view, to look back and to see where one has been.  It is also pleasant to see
what is on either side of a vehicle or a boat.  Yet, in the operation of any
vehicle, whether it be aircraft, automobile or boat, it would seem to be
essential that a lookout be kept ahead in the direction in which the vehicle is
moving.  It really is vitally important for the driver of a vehicle or vessel
to see where that vehicle or vessel is going.  It cannot be said that this was
only a momentary lapse of attention resulting from an inadequate lookout.  In
this case, there was not just an inadequate lookout but no lookout at all. 
Although it is not essential to the result, I cannot help observing that this
evidence could well be found to demonstrate a degree of negligence that
constitutes a marked departure from the standard of a reasonable person.

 

9                 The trial judge convicted the
appellant and that conviction was upheld in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal: 
(1993), 126 N.S.R. (2d) 275, 352 A.P.R. 275.

 

Issue

 

10               There is but one question to be
resolved on this appeal.  Did the trial judge apply a test which was stricter
than that laid down by this Court in R. v. Hundal, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867? 
If he did, then it would be appropriate to apply the provisions of
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  since, although he
committed an error in law, no miscarriage of justice was occasioned by it.

 

11               The decision in Hundal was
an attempt to clarify the law with regard to the dangerous operation of
vehicles.  The test set out in that case should be followed in the future.  It
was described in this way (at pp. 885 and 888):

 

                   Thus,
it is clear that the basis of liability for dangerous driving is negligence. 
The question to be asked is not what the accused subjectively intended but
rather whether, viewed objectively, the accused exercised the appropriate
standard of care.  It is not overly difficult to determine when a driver has
fallen markedly below the acceptable standard of care.  There can be no doubt
that the concept of negligence is well understood and readily recognized by
most Canadians.  Negligent driving can be thought of as a continuum that
progresses, or regresses, from momentary lack of attention giving rise to civil
responsibility through careless driving under a provincial Highway Traffic Act
to dangerous driving under the Criminal Code .

 

                                                                   . . .

 

                   In
summary, the mens rea for the offence of dangerous driving should be
assessed objectively but in the context of all the events surrounding the
incident.  That approach will satisfy the dictates both of common sense and
fairness.  As a general rule, personal factors need not be taken into account. 
This flows from the licensing requirement for driving which assures that all
who drive have a reasonable standard of physical health and capability, mental
health and a knowledge of the reasonable standard required of all licensed
drivers.

 

                   In
light of the licensing requirement and the nature of driving offences, a
modified objective test satisfies the constitutional minimum fault requirement
for s. 233 (now s. 249) of the Criminal Code  and is eminently
well‑suited to that offence.

 

                   If
follows then that a trier of fact may convict if satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that, viewed objectively, the accused was, in the words of the section,
driving in a manner that was ""dangerous to the public, having regard to
all the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of such place
and the amount of traffic that at the time is or might reasonably be expected
to be on such place"".  In making the assessment, the trier of fact should
be satisfied that the conduct amounted to a marked departure from the standard
of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused's situation.

 

Unfortunately, these reasons were not
released until after the trial judge had rendered his decision.  However, he
carefully considered the reasons of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in
this same case, reported at (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 214.  He quoted at length
from the minority reasons of Lambert J.A. and stated that he adopted them with
approval as to the general law in the area.  His lengthy quotation from those
reasons included the following from pp. 225‑26:

 

                   So
I consider that the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Tutton, Waite
and Anderson should be regarded as leaving the mental element of
dangerous driving where it was before those cases.  The Crown must prove
""advertent"" or ""subjective"" negligence or carelessness.

 

                                                                   VI

 

                   I
have concluded that at the present time the only proper course to be followed
by trial courts and courts of appeal in Canada is to apply the
""subjective"" standard of ""advertent"" negligence.

 

                   The
actus reus continues to be determined by an objective standard. 
Dangerous driving is driving which involves, objectively determined (that is,
in the estimation of reasonably prudent people), the creation of a significant
risk of danger to others by a significant departure from the standard that a
reasonably prudent person, with similar basic physical and mental capacities as
the accused, but not necessarily with the same propensities, would have adopted
in the circumstances facing the accused.  (I am setting out the actus reus
because of the close inter-relationship between the actus reus and the mens
rea.  The nature of the actus reus was not in issue in this appeal.)

 

                   How
then is the ""advertent"" or ""subjective"" element of the
offence to be determined?  It should be approached on the basis of the
application of the concepts that underlie mens rea generally, namely a
knowledge of the relevant facts, or wilful blindness to them, coupled with an
intention to commit the prohibited act or with recklessness as to whether the
prohibited act is committed:  see R. v. Sault Ste. Marie (City) (1978),
40 C.C.C. (2d) 353 at p. 362, 85 D.L.R. (3d) 161, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299. 
And, as I have said, the prohibited act is the creation of a significant risk
of danger to others by a significant departure from the standard of a
reasonably prudent person.

 

                   The
key to the mental element is either that a significant risk of danger is
appreciated and the risk is intentionally or recklessly undertaken or,
alternatively, that a significant risk of danger is not appreciated but it is
undertaken, either because of wilful blindness to the circumstances that create
the risk, or by recklessness as to the appreciation of those circumstances, or
by recklessness as to the reason why those circumstances make the risk of
danger a significant one that a reasonably prudent person would not take.

 

The trial judge concluded his reasons
with this paragraph:

 

                   I
have considered all the evidence and find that the accused operated the boat at
a speed, with no visibility ahead, no proper lookout, in an area which he knew
or ought to have known was a recreational swimming area, in a manner a prudent
person would not.  And by doing so caused the death of William Francis
Corsten.  The advertent negligence can be inferred from the conduct and driving
of the accused.

 

12               The trial judge adopted the
reasons of Lambert J.A. as a statement of the general law on the subject.  The
last paragraph of his reasons must be read in light of his earlier statement as
to the law he would apply which is set out in the lengthy quotation.  The test
set out by Lambert J.A. would require the Crown to prove ""advertent"",
that is to say, ""subjective"", negligence.  This places a much heavier
onus upon the Crown than the modified objective test put forward by the
majority reasons of this Court in Hundal, supra.  This very point
was recognized in the reasons of McLachlin J., concurring in the result. 
Clearly, a subjective test places a far stricter onus upon the Crown than an
objective test.

 

13               Lambert J.A. referred to the actus
reus of the offence as conduct which, viewed objectively, constituted a
significant departure from the standard of a reasonably prudent person.  In my
view, there is no real difference between the phrase ""significant
departure"" and the term ""marked departure"" used by the majority
in this Court when referring to the actus reus.  This is borne out by
the dictionary definitions of the terms.  The Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary (3rd ed. 1990) includes these pertinent definitions of the words
""mark"", ""marked"" and ""significant"":

 

Mark I. To put a mark upon.
. . . [4] b. To separate from something else as
by a line or distinctive mark. . . . 6.  In immaterial sense: 
a. To make perceptible by some indication.  b. To manifest (one's
approval, displeasure, etc.) by some act, or by reward or punishment.

 

Marked . . . 3.  Easy to
distinguish or recognize.

 

Significant 1.  Full of meaning or
import.  b. Important, notable.

 

14               It is of course preferable to make
use of the words employed by this Court in Hundal to describe the test. 
However, if a truly synonymous term is used it should not be considered a
ground for complaint.  It follows then that the trial judge did indeed apply a
stricter test than that set out in the reasons of this Court in Hundal.

 

15               Nor in my view, does the last
paragraph of his reasons detract from this conclusion.  It must be remembered
that this is not a charge to a jury but the reasons of a judge sitting alone. 
They should not be scrutinized with the same intensity as a jury charge, where
the appellate courts must make certain that the words set out in the
instructions to the jury are not only correct but, as well, not likely to
mislead the jury.  Here, the trial judge set out the general law and the test by
which he would be guided.  The fact that he did not specifically repeat it in
his last paragraph cannot be taken as detracting from his stated intention.  If
a trial judge sets out the legal principle and test that he intends to apply,
it should be assumed, in the absence of a very clear indication to the
contrary, that he in fact followed that very course.  To come to any other
conclusion would I think be unfair to trial judges.

 

16               I am satisfied that the trial
judge applied a stricter test for finding guilt on a charge of dangerous
driving or operation of a vessel than that set out by this Court in Hundal,
supra.  Further, there was strong, cogent and convincing evidence upon
which he could base his conclusion that there was indeed a significant or
marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonable person.  As a
result, it is appropriate to apply the provisions of s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code and conclude that despite the error in law no substantial
wrong or miscarriage was occasioned by it.  The appeal should therefore be
dismissed.

                   The appellant and C
went out drinking at a bar one night where they met and befriended the
deceased, who was impaired.  The three men left the bar together, all appearing
to witnesses to be drunk, and the deceased was robbed and beaten with a 2 x 4
piece of lumber.  The appellant and C were charged with second degree murder. 
The appellant made no statement to the police.  He testified at trial, 13
months after the murder, that he had never struck the deceased and denied that
he had aided or abetted in the assault.  C's counsel cross‑examined the
appellant on the appellant's failure to make any statements to the police.  C
did not testify at trial.  His version of the events was set out in a
videotaped statement to the police on his arrest.  Effectively, each accused
cast the blame primarily on the other, and each relied on the defence of
intoxication as negativing the intent for murder.  The appellant and C were
both convicted of second degree murder.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority
decision, upheld the convictions.  This appeal is to determine (1) whether the
cross‑examination of the appellant on his failure to give a statement to
the police and the trial judge's failure to instruct the jury to disregard that
cross‑examination violated his pre‑trial right to silence protected
by s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ; and (2) whether
the trial judge erred in instructing the jury as to the use it could make of
the evidence that the appellant had not given a statement to the police, in
light of his constitutionally guaranteed right to remain silent.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed and a
new trial ordered.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  It is a corollary of
the right to choose to remain silent during the pre‑trial investigation
that, if exercised, this fact is not to be used against the accused at a
subsequent trial on a charge arising out of the investigation and no inference
is to be drawn against an accused because he or she exercised the right.  The
right to pre‑trial silence, however, like other Charter  rights, is
not absolute.  Application of Charter  values must take into account
other interests and in particular other Charter  values which may
conflict with their unrestricted and literal enforcement.  This approach to Charter 
values is especially apt in this case in that the conflicting rights are
protected under the same section of the Charter .

 

                   Co‑accused
persons clearly have the right to cross‑examine each other in making full
answer and defence.  Restrictions that apply to the Crown may not apply to
restrict this right of the co‑accused.  The right to make full answer and
defence is not, however, absolute.  When the right is asserted by accused
persons in a joint trial, regard must be had for the effect of the public
interest in joint trials with respect to charges arising out of a common
enterprise.  Although the trial judge has a discretion to order separate
trials, that discretion must be exercised on the basis of principles of law
which include the instruction that severance is not to be ordered unless it is
established that a joint trial will work an injustice to the accused.  The mere
fact that a co‑accused is waging a ""cut‑throat"" defence
is not in itself sufficient.

 

                   To resolve the
competing interests at issue, a balance between the rights of the two co‑accused
must be struck taking into account the interest of the state in joint trials. 
An accused who testifies against a co‑accused cannot rely on the right to
silence to deprive the co‑accused of the right to challenge that
testimony by a full attack on the former's credibility including reference to
his pre‑trial silence.  The co‑accused may thus dispel the evidence
which implicates him emanating from his co‑accused.  He cannot, however,
go further and ask the trier of fact to consider the evidence of his co‑accused's
silence as positive evidence of guilt on which the Crown can rely to convict. 
The limited use to which the evidence can be put must of course be explained to
the jury with some care.  The jury should be told:  (1) that the co‑accused
who has testified against the accused had the right to pre‑trial silence
and not to have the exercise of that right used as evidence as to innocence or
guilt; (2) that the accused implicated by the evidence of the co‑accused
has the right to make full answer and defence including the right to attack the
credibility of the co‑accused; (3) that the accused implicated by the
evidence of the co‑accused had the right, therefore, to attack the
credibility of the co‑accused by reference to the latter's failure to
disclose the evidence to the investigating authorities; (4) that this evidence
is not to be used as positive evidence on the issue of innocence or guilt to
draw an inference of consciousness of guilt or otherwise;  (5) that the
evidence could be used as one factor in determining whether the evidence of the
co‑accused is to be believed.  The failure to make a statement prior to
trial may reflect on the credibility of the accused or it may be due to other
factors such as the effect of a caution or the advice of counsel.  If the jury
concluded that such failure was due to a factor that did not reflect on the
credibility of the accused, then it must not be given any weight.

 

                   In this case there
was nothing in the manner or form of the cross‑examination that amounted
to an improper use of this evidence.  The charge and re‑charge, however,
contain serious misdirections.  The jury were clearly invited to consider the
evidence of pre‑trial silence on the issue of innocence or guilt and as
consciousness of guilt.  The references to the right to remain silent did not
mitigate this misdirection and the re‑charge was not substantially
different.  The Crown has not satisfied its obligation under s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code to show that if a proper direction had been given the
verdict would necessarily have been the same.

 

                   Per McLachlin J.:  Evidence that a
co‑accused failed to give his version to the authorities should be
excluded.  The right to silence must mean that a suspect has the right to
refuse to talk to the police and not be penalized for it.  Further, since the
accused has been informed by the police of the right not to speak, his exercise
of it cannot logically found an inference as to his credibility when he later
testifies.  The same considerations govern the contention of the other accused
in a joint trial, that he should be allowed to cross‑examine on the
failure of his co‑accused to disclose his version to the police.  Since
no valid inference can be drawn from exercise of the right to silence, the
evidence sought to be adduced should be excluded for lack of relevancy. 
Because the evidence lacks probative value, it cannot be suggested that its
exclusion denies the co‑accused the right to full answer and defence. 
Alternatively, even if slight probative value could be found, the evidence
should be excluded on the ground that it has insufficient probative value to
overcome the prejudicial effect on the trial process that arises from the
danger that the jury will infer not just lack of credibility but guilt.  Since
the law of evidence precludes the admission of prior consistent statements to
bolster the credibility of an accused, admission of evidence of a co‑accused's
silence leads to a further difficulty.  If pre‑trial silence can lead to
a negative inference as to credibility, the accused is placed in the anomalous
situation of being obliged to make a prior consistent statement in order to
avoid cross‑examination on his silence, but being unable to tender that
evidence in support of his own credibility.

I.  Facts

 

2                 The appellant, Crawford, and his
co-accused, Creighton, were charged with second degree murder of Behnke.  One
night in early November 1988, Crawford and Creighton, who are distant cousins,
went out drinking at a Belleville bar where they met and befriended the
deceased, who was impaired.  The three men left the bar together, all appearing
to witnesses to be drunk, and the deceased was robbed and beaten with a 2 x 4
piece of lumber.  The autopsy of the victim revealed that the immediate cause
of death was a ""massive area of bruising"" within the victim's brain,
consistent with the application of ""massive blunt force"" to the top
of his head, but the pathologist did not rule out interplay between head
injuries and serious injuries to other parts of his body.  The cause of death
thus was stated to be multiple trauma to the head and body.

 

3                 The Crown's theory was that
Crawford and Creighton pretended to befriend the impaired deceased, invited him
to a party with the intention of robbing him, and after robbing him, either
Crawford or Creighton or both beat the deceased viciously with a 2 x 4 causing
his death.

 

4                 Crawford made no statement to
the police.  He testified at trial, 13 months after the murder, that he had
never struck the deceased and denied that he had aided or abetted in the
assault.  Crawford testified that, on leaving the bar with Creighton and the
deceased, the deceased had grabbed the waitress's leg and apologized and
Creighton had told the waitress that he would ""take care of it"".  On
the way to the party, Creighton hit the deceased without warning and the two
exchanged about four punches before Crawford could intervene.  He tried to grab
the deceased but lost his balance and he and the deceased fell to the ground
with the deceased on top.  They began to scuffle when Creighton hit the
deceased on the back with a 2 x 4.  Crawford became scared, shoved the deceased
off him, and ran away.  When Creighton caught up to him, Creighton said ""I
think I killed him"".

 

5                 Creighton's counsel
cross-examined Crawford on Crawford's failure to make any statements to the
police:

 

 

 

Q.Mr.
Crawford, if my memory is correct the incident that brings us here today
happened one year and 20 days ago; is that right?

 

A.I
think so, yes.  I'm not too sure, I didn't check.

 

Q.Well,
it's the 22nd day of November today, 1989?

 

A.Yes.

 

Q.Do
you agree with that?

 

A.Yes.

 

Q.So
this incident happened one year and 20 days ago?

 

A.Yes.

 

Q.You
have had one year and 20 days to think about what you were going to tell us
about this?

 

A.Just
the truth.

 

Q.You've
had one year and 20 days to think about it.

 

A.Just
the truth.

 

Q.Have
you ever told the police anything about it?

 

A.No.

 

Q.Have
you ever told anybody in authority anything about it?

 

A.Just
my lawyer.

 

Q.You
have been well represented by counsel?

 

A.Yes.

 

Q.You
were aware through your counsel what all the evidence was in this case?

 

A.Well,
yes.

 

6                 Creighton did not testify at
trial.  His version of the events was set out in a videotaped statement to the
police on his arrest.  Creighton said that he, Crawford, and the victim had
left the pub on the way to a party.  Crawford and the victim were arguing as
they walked.  When a fight broke out between Crawford and the deceased,
Creighton intervened and tried to break it up.  When that failed, since the
deceased was on top of Crawford, he hit the deceased across the back about four
times with a 2 x 4 piece of lumber (about 3 feet long).  Crawford continued to
beat the victim with his fists, despite Creighton grabbing Crawford and telling
him to stop since the victim was already hurt.  Unable to break up the fight,
he climbed over a fence and left the scene.  At the point that he left,
Creighton told the police that the deceased was still alive.  Crawford soon
came running behind him saying that they had to ""get . . . out of here I
think I killed him"".

 

7                 Effectively, each accused cast
the blame primarily, if not entirely, upon the other, and each relied upon the
defence of intoxication as negativing the intent for murder.  At trial,
Creighton's counsel made much of the fact that Crawford had declined to give a
statement to the police on his arrest, contrasting unfavourably with
Creighton's full statement to the police at the earliest opportunity.  
Conversely, Crawford's counsel, when addressing the jury, stated that ""an
innocent man sitting in Creighton's seat would have gotten into that witness
box and sworn that he was not guilty"".  Crawford's counsel also dealt with
Creighton's counsel's cross-examination of Crawford in his closing address to
the jury.

 

8                 On November 28, 1989, the
appellant and co-accused were both convicted of second degree murder by White
J. of the Ontario Supreme Court sitting with a jury.  They appealed their
convictions to the Ontario Court of Appeal.  Crawford claimed that:

(1)the
trial judge erred in allowing counsel for the co-accused to cross-examine him
on his failure to give a statement to the police, thus infringing his right to
remain silent; and

 

(2)the
trial judge had erred in not instructing the jury to disregard that
cross-examination on his pre-trial silence.  

 

On April 6, 1993, the Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeals:  (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 130, 62 O.A.C. 91, 80 C.C.C. (3d)
421, 20 C.R. (4th) 331, 14 C.R.R. (2d) 93.  Weiler J.A. dissented, holding that
the trial judge erred in instructing the jury as to the use that it could make
of the evidence that Crawford had not given a statement to police, in light of
his constitutionally guaranteed right to remain silent, and would have allowed
the appeal and ordered a new trial.

 

9                 Crawford appealed as of right to
this Court on whether the trial judge erred in instructing the jury as to the use
of the evidence that Crawford had not given a statement to the police.  Leave
to appeal was granted on whether the Court of Appeal erred in holding that Crawford's
rights were not infringed either by:

(1)the
cross-examination of Crawford by Creighton's counsel on his failure to give a
statement to the police before trial; or

 

(2)the
failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury to disregard this cross-examination.

 

Creighton has not appealed.

III.  Judgments Below



A.  Charge to the Jury

 

10               In his charge to the jury, the
trial judge reminded the jury of the cross-examination of Crawford by
Creighton's counsel:

 

                   So
his [Crawford's] basic defence is that he left before -- that while blows were
struck by Creighton he had no foreknowledge of that, he did not make any plan
with Creighton to assault or rob Mr. Behnke, his presence in that yard was
entirely innocent, he was going to a party, suggested by Creighton.  And his
explanation of why he fled the scene, I've already indicated to you what that
was, but his explanation as to why he didn't go to the police and give them
what he knew about this, and this was brought out when Mr. Kemp [counsel for
Creighton] was cross-examining him.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The trial judge's charge on the
circumstantial evidence against Crawford included reference to his failure to
give an explanation to the police:

 

                   Does
the circumstantial evidence against Crawford, together with the admissions he
made in his evidence, satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt that he was an
accomplice of Creighton in a joint enterprise to rob Behnke?  Consider all the
circumstances.

 

                   The
chief circumstance might be the blood on his pants and the blood on his jacket;
his admission that he was in a fight, and that was to Miss Delorme; his flight
from the scene; his failure to come forward if he is innocent; his
hiding his pants, and he admitted that, in the garbage.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The trial judge's charge to the jury
on the use they could make of Crawford's silence upon arrest was as follows:

 

But
Mr. Kemp, as you remember, started this cross-examination:

 

""Today
is the 22nd of November.  This incident took place one year and 20 days ago. 
You have had a year and 20 days to think about it.  Did you ever tell the
police about it?""  

 

                   ""No.""

 

And,
of course, the first time Crawford gave his version of what happened that night
was in the witness box as far as the public notice is concerned.

 

                   And,
yes, there is a Charter of Rights  and, yes, you have the right to remain
silent.  Those are all constitution rights.  But also it's an axiom of
reasonable conduct that if you're entirely innocent of something serious that
you witnessed you are not afraid to talk about it, Charter  or no Charter ,
that's just a simple common sense proposition, and that was the point that Mr.
Kemp made in his cross-examination.

 

                   Certainly
you don't have to make a statement to the police but, on the other hand, you
can take into account that if the story -- Mr. Crawford's evidence is a version
of the facts that is reasonable, you can certainly accept his evidence, but you
have a right to ask yourself, if I am to believe this evidence, why has Mr.
Crawford waited until now to tell anybody about it, anybody in authority?  And,
while you certainly respect his Charter  rights to remain silent, as jurors of
fact you are entitled to take into account that fact, that he didn't tell
anybody until this trial.

 

11               When Crawford's counsel objected
to this charge, in his re-charge to the jury, the trial judge reinstructed the
jury as follows (in part):

 

                   And,
of course, I told you time and time again, in a criminal case there is no
obligation upon the accused to make any explanation at any time, there is never
an obligation to make an explanation.  The onus is on the Crown to prove beyond
a reasonable doubt the ingredients of the offence, the mental state and the
fact.  However, that is what I meant in discussing the statement of Creighton
on that subject.

 

                   When
I commented upon the testimony of Crawford I indicated, as by referring to Mr.
Kemp's cross-examination of him, that this trial was the first occasion on
which Crawford gave his side of what had happened, and I may have mentioned
that it is a proposition of common sense to the effect that if he is innocent,
why hasn't he said anything about it up until now.

 

                   It
would be wrong for you to infer that at any time there was any obligation
whatsoever on Mr. Crawford to tell the police or anybody else what had
happened.  Insofar as you may have construed my remarks as indicating that he
had an obligation, please disregard those remarks.  There is no obligation on
any person accused of a crime to make any statement.  That is enshrined in the
Charter .  So bear that in mind, that he was within his rights not to have made
any statement, and he was within his rights to remain silent until the trial to
give his explanation.

 

                   Now,
you should not, therefore, draw any adverse inference from Crawford's failure
to have given a statement to the police or to have given his evidence
hitherto.  He had a perfect right to remain silent.

 

                   Notwithstanding
that right to remain silent, it is not unreasonable for you, as jurors of fact
in analyzing the credibility of Crawford, to put to yourself the question such
as would be reasonable, and the question might very well be, If Crawford
expects me, a juror, to believe that he left after there were a certain number
of blows, in which he was unaware that any severe damage had been done to the
deceased, and if a short while later, on the street, the other person told him
words to the effect he had -- I forget what the words were but, according to
Crawford he told -- Creighton told him that he had killed a man, or words to
that effect, I say it is a proposition of sense, and that in that situation one
does -- one can expect a person whose conduct -- a person who is innocent to
act in accordance with the way an innocent person would act.  You're the jurors
and I'll leave that to you.

 

B.  Ontario Court of Appeal
(1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 130

 

                   Majority

 

12               After reviewing the
cross-examination of Crawford by Creighton's counsel and the jury charge,
Finlayson J.A. (Tarnopolsky J.A. concurring) noted that there was not much
difference between what the trial judge said in his initial charge to the jury
and what he said in his re-charge.  Nonetheless, there was nothing
substantially wrong with what the trial judge said in either of his
instructions (at p. 137):

 

What
has happened in this case resulted from the inevitable tension between the
constitutionally protected rights of two accused who adopted antagonistic
defences.  There is clearly a conflict between the constitutionally protected
right of Crawford to remain silent and the constitutionally protected right of
Creighton to full answer and defence.  Both protections are contained in s. 7 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (the ""Charter ""). 
In addition . . . s. 4(6)  of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-5 , prohibits Crown counsel and the trial judge from commenting on the
failure of an accused to testify.  It does not so limit counsel for a
co-accused.

 

Where an attack on a co-accused is
relevant to his defence, an accused cannot be limited.  The remedy is to ask
for a trial severance.  If it can be shown that the prejudicial effect is great
then the trial judge has discretion to sever the trial of the two accused.  In
this case, there was no request for severance.  Furthermore, severance likely
would not have been granted merely because of cut-throat defences, since the
public has an interest in bringing criminals to justice and severance might
have resulted in two unwarranted acquittals.

 

13               Finlayson J.A. then considered the
principles relating to the right to remain silent, and restrictions on counsel
in commenting on the failure of a co-accused to testify.  Neither the Crown nor
the trial judge may comment on an accused's exercise of his right to remain
silent, a principle codified in s. 4(6)  of the Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 .  The situation is different, however, when there are two
or more accused, and one sets up, as part of his attack on the credibility of
his co-accused, the failure of his co-accused to testify or to give a statement
to the police at the earliest opportunity.  In R. v. Naglik (1991), 65
C.C.C. (3d) 272, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that neither s. 11 (c)
of the Charter  nor s. 4(6)  of the Canada Evidence Act 
prevented co-accused counsel from commenting on an accused's failure to
testify.  In that case, Morden A.C.J.O. noted that, unlike the bulk of American
case law, in Canada, it is open to a jury to draw an adverse inference from the
failure of an accused to testify.  Thus (Finlayson J.A. , at p. 139):

 

In
exercising his constitutional right to full answer and defence, he is entitled
to put his best foot forward, and the court is not entitled to inhibit that
defence simply because it involves a tactic prohibited to the Crown.

 

After a review of English and American
case law, Finlayson J.A. then concluded (at pp. 143-44) that:

 

                   In
my opinion, then, it was open to counsel for Crawford to comment upon the
failure of Creighton to testify on his own behalf....

 

                   The
case under appeal is probably the classic confrontation between the conflicting
rights of accused persons to a fair trial.  The fact of the conflict causes me
no unease, and I am not persuaded that either appellant received anything other
than a fair trial or that the result of the trial was unsatisfactory.

 

                   Dissent

 

14               Weiler J.A. agreed that
Creighton's counsel was entitled to comment on the fact that Crawford did not
make any response to the charges against him until trial.  This is part of the
co-accused's right to make full answer and defence.

 

15               Nonetheless, when the trial
judge's charge to the jury concerning Crawford is considered as a whole, it
infringes his right to remain silent up until trial.  In the charge to the
jury, the trial judge should have balanced:

 

(a)the
co-accused's right to make full answer and defence, in attacking the
credibility of Crawford's evidence, with

(b)instructions
as to Crawford's right to remain silent.

 

A balanced charge would have been as
follows (at p. 145):

 

(a)Crawford
had a constitutionally guaranteed right to remain silent and had an absolute
right to exercise that right.

 

(b)The
jury could not draw an inference of consciousness of guilt as a result of
Crawford's choice to exercise that right.

 

(c)Creighton
had the right to make full answer and defence and was entitled to attack the
credibility of Crawford's evidence.

 

(d)When
assessing the credibility of Crawford's evidence the jury could
consider, as one factor, that Crawford did not make a statement prior to trial,
but they could not consider the exercise of his right to remain silent for any
other purpose.  Specifically, they could not use the fact that Crawford
exercised his right to remain silent as positive evidence of his guilt. 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

Instead, the trial judge clearly gave
instruction on (a), gave contradictory and confusing instructions on (b), and
gave no instructions on (c) and (d).  One excerpt of the charge implicitly
refers to Crawford's exercise of his right to remain silent as one of the
circumstances from which the jury could infer guilt combined with other
circumstantial evidence.  

 

16               While in his re-charge, the trial
judge attempted to correct the impression that Crawford had an obligation to
make a statement, the trial judge nevertheless again referred to it as a
failure on Crawford's part.  This instruction was confusing and contradictory,
but left the clear implication that an innocent person would come forward
quickly and proclaim his innocence (at p. 148):

 

                   At
no time did the trial judge correct his earlier instructions and tell the jury
that they were not entitled to consider the fact that the accused had exercised
his constitutional right to remain silent as a positive piece of circumstantial
evidence in deciding whether the Crown had proven Crawford's guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt, nor did he tell them of the limited use to which this
evidence could be put, that is, only as a factor in assessing Crawford's
credibility ....

 

                   It
is trite law that the failure of counsel to object to the recharge, while a
factor to consider, does not, alone, excuse error in law on the part of the
trial judge.  The charge, when read as a whole, was so imbalanced that I am
unable to conclude with a reasonable degree of certainty that the jury's
verdict would necessarily have been the same in relation to Crawford, and
therefore that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

 

Weiler J.A. refused to apply the
proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 .

 

IV.  Issues

 

1.Cross-Examination
by Co-Accused:  Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in holding that
cross-examination of the appellant Crawford on his failure to give a statement
to the police by counsel for the co-accused Creighton and the failure of the
trial judge to instruct the jury to disregard that cross-examination on the
appellant's pre-trial silence did not violate his pre-trial right to silence
protected by s. 7  of the Charter ?

 

2.Adequacy
of Jury Charge:  Did the trial judge err in instructing the jury as to the use
it could make of the evidence that the appellant Crawford had not given a
statement to the police, in light of his constitutionally guaranteed right to
remain silent?

 

V.  Analysis

 

17               As the appellant points out, no
Canadian court or court in a common law jurisdiction has addressed squarely the
issue of the right of one co-accused to comment on or cross-examine another
accused on the latter's pre-trial silence.  The analysis must therefore proceed
on the basis of principle and policy.  Involved are the competing assertions of
two accused that their respective rights, both of which are protected under
s. 7  of the Charter , be respected.  One accused asserts his right
to silence and that its exercise not be used against him to his prejudice,
while the other contends that he has the right to make full use of the
pre-trial silence of his co-accused in order to make full answer and defence. 
As well, the prosecution asserts that it is in the interest of effective law
enforcement to have a joint trial in respect of charges arising out of a common
enterprise and, in particular, in circumstances in which the co-accused are
engaging in mutual recriminations.

 

18               Three plausible solutions for
resolution of the competing interests have been put forward in this case:

 

                   1.    The accused's
pre-trial silence trumps the co-accused's right to make use of it in
furtherance of his defence.  This is the appellant's position.

 

                   2.    The
co-accused's right to make full answer and defence trumps the accused's right
to pre-trial silence.  This is essentially the approach of the majority of the
Court of Appeal. 

 

                   3.    A balance
between the rights of the two co-accused must be struck taking into account the
interest of the state in joint trials.  This is the position of the Crown and
of Weiler J.A. in dissent in the Court of Appeal.

 

19               A fourth solution would be to
sever the trial whenever the conflict occurs, but no one in this appeal
advocates such a solution and it would run counter to a uniform stream of
authority in this country in favour of joint trials.  No application for
severance was made at trial and the issue was not raised or commented on in the
Court of Appeal.

 

20               I turn to consider each of the
competing rights and interests in order to determine which of the solutions is
appropriate.  I conclude that the third option is the solution that best
accords with the interests involved and respects the principles of fundamental
justice as well as society's interest in effective law enforcement.

 

The Right to Pre-trial Silence 

 

21               The right to silence embraces a
number of distinct rights which are included in s. 7  of the Charter 
as principles of fundamental justice.  Two aspects of the right to silence are
pertinent to the discussion of the issues in this appeal, that is, the right to
pre-trial silence and silence at trial.  The latter is specifically protected
in s. 11 (c) of the Charter .  See Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v.
Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices
Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425; R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151;
R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595; R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1
S.C.R. 451; and others.

 

22               It is a corollary of the right to
choose to remain silent during the pre-trial investigation that, if exercised,
this fact is not to be used against the accused at a subsequent trial on a
charge arising out of the investigation and no inference is to be drawn against
an accused because he or she exercised the right.  See R. v. Chambers,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293.  The same general rationale would apply to trial silence
but the matter has been complicated by the specific statutory provision in
s. 4(6)  of the Canada Evidence Act  which forbids the trial judge
and Crown counsel from commenting on the failure of the accused to testify. 
This encompasses both comment prejudicial to the accused, as well as a
direction that the jury must not draw an unfavourable conclusion from the
accused's failure to testify.  As a result, as a practical matter in a jury
trial, as Martland J. writing for the majority in Vézeau v. The Queen,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 277, at p. 288, stated, ""it is open to a jury to draw an
inference from the failure of the accused to testify, and, particularly, in a
case in which it is sought to establish an alibi"".  

 

23               The above principles were
developed in relation to the use that may be made of the accused's silence by
the Crown and comment on such silence by the trial judge, and not its use by a
co-accused.  The main issue in this appeal is whether these principles must be
applied in their full vigour when it is a co-accused who seeks to make use of
the silence of his co-accused. 

 

24               With respect to silence at trial
it has been held by several Courts of Appeal in Canada that a co-accused can
comment on the failure of his co-accused to testify.  See R. v. Naglik, supra,
reversed on another point, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122, and R. v. Cuff (1989),
49 C.C.C. (3d) 65 (Nfld. C.A.).  See also R. v. Wickham (1971), 55 Cr.
App. R. 199 (C.A.).  In Naglik, this Court found it unnecessary to deal
with the point as a new trial was directed and, in the circumstances, the issue
would not arise at the new trial.  As pointed out by the Chief Justice, in
order to decide the point it may be necessary to consider whether the right to
comment and the restriction imposed by s. 4(6)  can stand together in so far as
the subsection precludes a limiting instruction.  L'Heureux-Dubé J., dissenting
on other grounds, opined that such a comment is permitted.

 

25               It has been submitted that to the
extent that the above line of authority establishes that the right to silence
at trial must give way to the rights of a co-accused and therefore it is not an
absolute right, a clear distinction exists between the right of silence at
trial and pre-trial silence.  Prior to or on arrest, the accused is in a much
more vulnerable position against the coercive power of the state.  The
environment in the police station is different from that of the courtroom where
procedural rules protect the accused.  In the police station, the accused may
not be represented and he may be overwhelmed by the whole experience.  The
police possess considerably greater power than the accused and there are no
disclosure obligations.  The police can disclose some or misleading information
or no information at all.  Evidential use of silence forces the suspect to
cooperate with his interrogators without a reciprocal exchange of information
and without placing proper limits on the power of the police to demand
cooperation.  In contrast, in the courtroom, the accused is represented, he
knows the case that he has to meet (due to disclosure) and there are rules
regarding admissibility of evidence.  See McNicol in Law of Privilege
(1992), at p. 286.

 

26               I accept that the distinctions
referred to are apt, but nonetheless I am not prepared to accept that,
therefore, the right to pre-trial silence is absolute.  In Hebert, supra,
at p. 179, McLachlin J. stated:  

 

[Section
7 ] guarantees the individual's life, liberty and security of person.  But it
recognizes that these rights are not absolute.  In certain circumstances, the
state may properly deprive a person of these interests.  But it must do so in
conformity with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

This principle applies, a fortiori,
when there is a conflict between two rights, both protected by the Charter . 
In Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, at
p. 877, the Chief Justice in his majority reasons pointed out that
""[a] hierarchial approach to rights, which places some over others, must
be avoided"".  In this regard it is significant that, even in the absence
of a competing Charter  right, the right to pre-trial silence is not
absolute.  Accordingly, failure to make a timely disclosure of an alibi defence
can be used by the Crown to attack the credibility of this defence.  See Chambers,
supra, per Cory J., at p. 1319.

 

The Right to Full Answer and Defence

 

27               There is no doubt about the right
of co-accused persons to cross-examine each other in making full answer and
defence.  See R. v. McLaughlin (1974), 2 O.R. (2d) 514 (C.A.), and R.
v. Ma, Ho and Lai (1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 537 (B.C.C.A.).  Moreover,
restrictions that apply to the Crown may not apply to restrict this right of
the co-accused.  As pointedly observed by D. W. Elliott, ""Cut
Throat Tactics:  The Freedom of an Accused to Prejudice a Co-Accused"",
[1991] Crim. L. Rev. 5, at p. 17, ""[t]he notion of the Crown having
one hand tied behind its back is familiar and accepted, but not the notion of a
person standing trial being in that position"".  See also R. v. Jackson
(1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (affirmed on other grounds, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 573), at
p. 434, per Doherty J.A.  Accordingly, a co-accused may adduce evidence
of or cross-examine on the disposition or propensity of a co-accused to commit
the offence even though the co-accused has not put his character in issue, and
may cross-examine a co-accused on a statement the voluntariness of which has
not been established.  See R. v. Kendall and McKay (1987), 35 C.C.C.
(3d) 105 (Ont. C.A.); Lowery v. The Queen, [1974] A.C. 85 (P.C.); R.
v. Pelletier (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 533; R. v. Jackson, supra. 
Exclusionary rules based on a policy of fairness to the accused would preclude
the Crown resorting to this kind of evidence.

 

28               The right to make full answer and
defence is protected under s. 7  of the Charter .  As stated in R.
v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at p. 336:  

 

This
common law right has acquired new vigour by virtue of its inclusion in s. 7  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  as one of the principles of
fundamental justice. . . .  The right to make full answer and defence is one of
the pillars of criminal justice on which we heavily depend to ensure that the
innocent are not convicted.

 

This right extends to prevent
incursions on its exercise not only by the Crown but by the co-accused.  As
observed by Goodman J.A. in Kendall, supra, at p. 127:

 

Having
been obliged to participate in a joint trial, Kendall was nevertheless entitled
to make full answer and defence in accordance with the principles of
fundamental justice:  see Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , s. 7 ,
and the Criminal Code  of Canada, s. 577(3).  The law is clear that if
Kendall had been tried alone he would have been entitled to call Dakin's
evidence to show that it was probable that McKay had committed the crime.  His
right to call that evidence cannot be denied simply because he was obliged to
participate in a joint trial.  

 

The right to full answer and defence,
as is the case with other Charter  rights, is not absolute.  It must be
applied and be subject to other rules that govern the conduct of a criminal
trial.  As I stated in Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2
S.C.R. 1505, at p. 1515:

 

                   The
right to full answer and defence does not imply that an accused can have, under
the rubric of the Charter , an overhaul of the whole law of evidence such
that a statement inadmissible under, for instance, the hearsay exclusion, would
be admissible if it tended to prove his or her innocence.  

 

When the right is asserted by accused
persons in a joint trial, regard must be had for the effect of the public
interest in joint trials with respect to charges arising out of a common
enterprise.  Can this interest in joint trials prevail against the assertion of
one accused to make full answer and defence while at the same time protecting
another accused against the blows to his or her right to pre-trial silence that
the exercise of the right to make full answer and defence entails?  In order to
resolve this question it is necessary to examine the principles relating to
joint trials and severance.

 

Joint Trials and Severance

 

29               In Kendall, supra,
Goodman J.A., after concluding that the exclusion of evidence as to disposition
of the co-accused violated the appellant's right to make full answer and
defence, went on to deal with the question of severance.  At page 127, after
the passage quoted above, he stated:

 

                   It
is no doubt true that the evidence of Dakin would have been highly prejudicial
to McKay. . . .  It may be that if the evidence had been admitted that McKay
could have complained that it was highly prejudicial to him and could not have
been introduced against him by the prosecution if he had been tried alone.  He
may then have applied for a separate trial on the ground that the admission of
such evidence on the joint trial might cause a miscarriage of justice in so far
as he was concerned.

 

30               There exist, however, strong
policy reasons for accused persons charged with offences arising out of the
same event or series of events to be tried jointly.  The policy reasons apply
with equal or greater force when each accused blames the other or others, a
situation which is graphically labelled a ""cut-throat defence"". 
Separate trials in these situations create a risk of inconsistent verdicts. 
The policy against separate trials is summarized by Elliott, supra, at
p. 17, as follows:  

 

                   There
is a dilemma here which could only be avoided by separate trials.  But separate
trials will not be countenanced because, quite apart from the extra cost and
delay involved, it is undeniable that the full truth about an incident is much more
likely to emerge if every alleged participant gives his account on one
occasion.  If each alleged participant is tried separately, there are obvious
and severe difficulties in arranging for this to happen without granting one of
them immunity.  In view of this, in all but exceptional cases, joint trial will
be resorted to, despite the double bind inevitably involved.  

 

31               Although the trial judge has a
discretion to order separate trials, that discretion must be exercised on the
basis of principles of law which include the instruction that severance is not
to be ordered unless it is established that a joint trial will work an
injustice to the accused.  The mere fact that a co-accused is waging a
""cut-throat"" defence is not in itself sufficient.  In Pelletier,
supra, a co-accused was permitted to cross-examine another accused on a
statement to the police that had not been proved to be voluntary.  On appeal of
his conviction he contended that if he had been tried separately the cross-examination
would not have been permitted.  On this basis he claimed that the trials should
have been severed. In dismissing this ground, Hinkson J.A., on behalf of the
court, stated, at p. 539:  

                   On
this point it is necessary to keep in mind that the trial judge has a
discretion as to whether or not he will grant a severance.  The general rule of
severance is that persons engaged in a common enterprise should be jointly
tried unless it can be demonstrated that a joint trial would work an injustice
to a particular accused:  R. v. Black and six others, [1970] 4 C.C.C.
251 at pp. 267-8, 10 C.R.N.S. 17 at pp. 35-6, 72 W.W.R. 407.  In this case, the
trial judge was not persuaded that it was appropriate to grant a severance.  I
do not conclude that he erred in the exercise of his discretion.  

 

32               As I pointed out above, neither
party to this appeal contended that the solution to the problem is to order
separate trials whenever the full exercise of the right to make full answer and
defence by one accused appears to collide with the protections ordinarily
accorded to an accused when facing the Crown alone.  This position is
consistent with both principle and policy as outlined above.  The general rule,
therefore, is that the respective rights of the co-accused must be resolved on
the basis that the trial will be a joint trial.  This does not mean, however,
that the trial judge has been stripped of his discretion to sever.  That
discretion remains and can be exercised if it appears that the attempt to
reconcile the respective rights of the co-accused results in an injustice to
one of the accused.

 

Resolving Competing Charter Rights

 

33               The proper approach to the problem
created by a conflict in the protected rights of individuals was outlined by
the Chief Justice in Dagenais, supra.  After stressing that Charter 
rights are of equal value, he continued as follows, at p. 877: 

 

When
the protected rights of two individuals come into conflict, as can occur in the
case of publication bans, Charter  principles require a balance to be
achieved that fully respects the importance of both sets of rights.  

 

34               I have gone to some length to
stress that Charter  rights are not absolute in the sense that they
cannot be applied to their full extent regardless of the context.  Application
of Charter  values must take into account other interests and in
particular other Charter  values which may conflict with their
unrestricted and literal enforcement.  This approach to Charter  values
is especially apt in this case in that the conflicting rights are protected
under the same section of the Charter .

 

35               Applying the foregoing to the
question posed at the commencement of this analysis, the appropriate choice of
the three solutions is readily apparent.  The first option would allow the
right to silence to trump the right to full answer and defence.  This would
apply one right fully in complete disregard of another equal right.  Similarly, 
the second option would allow the right to full answer and defence to trump the
right to silence.  This again is counter to the approach which was approved in Dagenais,
supra, in that it applies one right in absolute terms to the detriment
of another equal right.  The third solution which strikes a balance between the
two is the correct approach.  It remains to determine how the two rights can be
reconciled in order to give the fullest respect possible to the Charter 
values which underpin these rights.

 

36               An accused who testifies against a
co-accused must accept that his credibility can be fully attacked by the
latter.  In R. v. Kuldip, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 618, at pp. 635-36, the Chief
Justice stated:

 

                   An
accused has the right to remain silent during his or her trial.  However, if an
accused chooses to take the stand, that accused is implicitly vouching for his
or her credibility.  Such an accused, like any other witness, has therefore
opened the door to having the trustworthiness of his/her evidence challenged.  

 

The accused who has incriminated a
co-accused by his testimony cannot therefore rely on the right to silence to
deprive the accused who is implicated by his testimony of the right to
challenge that testimony by a full attack on the credibility of the former
including reference to his pre-trial silence.  This enables the co-accused to
dispel the evidence which implicates him emanating from his co-accused.  He
cannot, however, go further and ask the trier of fact to consider the evidence
of his co-accused's silence as positive evidence of guilt on which the Crown
can rely to convict.  This is not essential to enable him to defend himself
against the imputations of his co-accused and would constitute an unwarranted
intrusion on the right to silence of his co-accused.

 

37               The limited use to which the
evidence can be put must of course be explained to the jury with some care. 
The distinction between the use of evidence limited to credibility and evidence
that can be used to infer guilt is well understood by lawyers but may not be
easily understood by a jury.  It has been criticized as being artificial.  See R.
v. Gilbert (1977), 66 Cr. App. R. 237 (C.A.).  While I recognize that the
distinction is a subtle one, it is nonetheless a distinction that is firmly
rooted in our law and is one that can be adequately explained to a jury.  The
distinction was recently re-affirmed by this Court in Kuldip, supra. 
At p. 635, the Chief Justice stated:  

 

                   This
seems an appropriate time at which to mention that I share Martin J.A.'s
concern that it is sometimes difficult to draw a clear line between
cross-examination on the accused's prior testimony for the purpose of
incriminating him and such cross-examination for the purpose of impeaching his
credibility.  A trial judge will have to be very clear in his or her
instructions to the jury when setting out the uses to which previous testimony
can be put and the uses to which such testimony must not be put.  While such a
distinction may be somewhat troublesome to the jury, it is my view that with
the benefit of clear instructions from the trial judge the jury will not be
unduly burdened with this distinction.  These instructions should, in many
ways, be reminiscent of those which are routinely given with respect to the use
to which an accused's criminal record may be put.  A trial necessarily involves
evidentiary questions which are sometimes complex in nature.  While simplicity
in these manners is generally preferable to complexity, the policy reasons
underlying the need for a jury to have before it all the relevant information
related to the charge (discussed by this Court in R. v. Corbett, [1988]
1 S.C.R. 670) clearly outweigh the benefits of simplicity in these circumstances.


 

It is also a distinction that is made
with respect to the alibi defence in respect of which the accused's failure to
make timely disclosure may be used to attack credibility.  See Chambers,
supra.

 

38               A proper balance with respect to
the competing rights in issue can be achieved if the trial judge when sitting
alone carefully applies the distinction to which I refer above.  The evidence
of pre-trial silence is not to be used as positive evidence to infer the guilt
of the accused either as tending to show consciousness of guilt or otherwise. 
In a trial before a jury the trial judge must explain the respective rights
involved, how they are to approach the use of the evidence of silence and its
limited purpose.  In her dissenting reasons, Weiler J.A. has suggested four
points that the charge should contain.  The Crown in its argument and factum
suggests a fifth.  With the benefit of these suggestions and the submissions of
counsel, I propose the following as a guideline that trial judges should follow
in these circumstances.  The jury should be told:

 

                   1.  that the
co-accused who has testified against the accused had the right to pre-trial
silence and not to have the exercise of that right used as evidence as to
innocence or guilt;

                   2.  that the
accused implicated by the evidence of the co-accused has the right to make full
answer and defence including the right to attack the credibility of the
co-accused;

                   3.  that the
accused implicated by the evidence of the co-accused had the right, therefore,
to attack the credibility of the co-accused by reference to the latter's
failure to disclose the evidence to the investigating authorities;

                   4.  that this
evidence is not to be used as positive evidence on the issue of innocence or
guilt to draw an inference of consciousness of guilt or otherwise;

                   5.  that the
evidence could be used as one factor in determining whether the evidence of the
co-accused is to be believed.  The failure to make a statement prior to trial
may reflect on the credibility of the accused or it may be due to other factors
such as the effect of a caution or the advice of counsel.  If the jury
concluded that such failure was due to a factor that did not reflect on the
credibility of the accused, then it must not be given any weight.

 

Application to this Appeal

 

39               There is no question in this
appeal that Creighton's right of full answer and defence was respected and he
was given full right of cross-examination on the appellant's pre-trial
silence.  The issue is whether the use of the appellant's pre-trial silence
violated his Charter  rights.  There was nothing in the manner or form of
the cross-examination that amounted to an improper use of this evidence. 
Ordinarily, the extent of the use to be made of the answers obtained in
cross-examination will not be apparent from the questions and answers
themselves and any limitations on such use must be imposed in the instructions
to the jury.  For the reasons which I have expressed above, I decline to accede
to the appellant's submission that counsel for the accused, Creighton, should
not have been allowed to cross-examine on the appellant's silence or that the
jury should have been instructed to disregard this evidence.  Accordingly, if
the charge to the jury had contained proper instructions limiting the use of
the evidence to credibility, then the appeal would have failed.  The Crown
concedes that the charge does not entirely follow the model which it proposes
but submits that it is not so far removed from it that it constitutes a
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  I agree with Weiler J.A. and for
the reasons that she gives that the charge and re-charge contain serious
misdirections.  The jury were clearly invited to consider the evidence of
pre-trial silence on the issue of innocence or guilt and as consciousness of
guilt.  The references to the right to remain silent did not mitigate this
misdirection.  The re-charge was not substantially different.  

 

40               It would be difficult to justify
the position that the distinction between the use of evidence for the purpose
of credibility and as positive evidence of guilt is a meaningful one but that,
on the other hand, failure to make it in this case did not have any significant
effect on the result.  I agree with Weiler J.A. that the Crown has not
satisfied its obligation under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 
to show that if a proper direction had been given the verdict would necessarily
have been the same. 

 

Disposition

 

41               The appeal is allowed and a new
trial ordered

 

//McLachlin J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

42               McLachlin
J. -- I agree that the appeal must be allowed and a new trial ordered,
but for different reasons than Justice Sopinka.

 

43               In my view, the dilemma ably
described by my colleague is best dealt with by exclusion of evidence that a
co-accused failed to give his version to the authorities at an early date.  The
co-accused has a constitutional right to silence.  He therefore cannot be
faulted for not giving his version to the police.   If the right to silence is
to be meaningful, no adverse inferences can be drawn from his failure to do so,
either as to guilt or credibility.  Pre-trial silence is either a right or it
is not a right.  If it is a right, the trier of fact should not be permitted to
draw adverse inferences from its exercise.  If adverse inferences are
permitted, then the right to silence is effectively lost, for no accused who
wishes to preserve the possibility of putting his story forth at trial can
afford to exercise it.  The right to silence, if it means anything, must mean that
a suspect has the right to refuse to talk to the police and not be penalized
for it.  Further, since the accused has been informed by the police of the
right not to speak, his exercise of it cannot logically found an inference as
to his credibility when he later testifies.  On this I agree with the unanimous
decision of the High Court of Australia:  ""the fact of insistence on the
right [to remain silent] in the face of questioning does not, of itself and
standing alone, have any probative force at all against an accused"" (Bruce
v. The Queen (1987), 6l Aust. L.J. Rep. 603, at p. 604).  See also David M.
Paciocco, Charter Principles and Proof in Criminal Cases (1987), at pp.
554-56.

 

44               The same considerations govern the
contention of the other accused in a joint trial, that he should be allowed to
cross-examine on the failure of his co-accused to disclose his version to the
police.  Since no valid inference can be drawn from exercise of the right to
silence, the evidence sought to be adduced should be excluded for lack of
relevancy.  Alternatively, even if slight probative value could be found, the
evidence should be excluded on the ground that it has insufficient probative
value to overcome the prejudicial effect on the trial process that arises from
the danger that the jury will follow the path of forbidden reasoning and infer,
not just lack of credibility, but guilt:  R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2
S.C.R. 577.

 

45               In summary, exclusion of evidence
of failure to disclose to the police is proper given the absence of probative
value of such evidence.  Because the evidence lacks probative value, it cannot
be suggested that its exclusion denies the co-accused the right to full answer
and defence.  There is no ""trumping"" of rights; one of them is simply
not attracted.  Exclusion also has the practical merit of avoiding putting the
accused to the task of justifying the exercise of his rights under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and the jury to the almost impossible task
of deciding whether ""failure to make a statement prior to trial . . .
reflect[s] on the credibility of the accused or . . . [is] due to other factors
such as the effect of a caution or the advice of counsel"" (as required by
the fifth part of Sopinka J's suggested charge to the jury, at p. 885).

 

46               Admission of evidence of a
co-accused's silence leads to this further difficulty.  The law of evidence
precludes the admission of prior consistent statements to bolster the
credibility of an accused.  If pre-trial silence can lead to a negative
inference as to credibility, the accused is placed in the anomalous situation
of being obliged to make a prior consistent statement in order to avoid
cross-examination on his silence, but being unable to tender that evidence in
support of his own credibility.

 

47               It follows, in my view, that the
evidence in question should have been excluded.  I would allow the appeal and
direct a new trial.

did not amount to obstruction.  In the circumstances of this case, no false
statement was made by the appellant to the court.  Nor did he withhold
information that he was obliged by law to disclose.  In our view, therefore,
the trial judge was entitled to conclude that in all the circumstances it was
not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had made a false

appellant had a duty to disclose.  He did not err in law in so concluding.

Breathalyzer test ‑‑ Presumption of accuracy -- Presumption of
identity ‑‑ Accused claiming to have consumed two miniature bottles
of vodka while waiting to take breathalyzer test ‑‑ Whether

must tend to show that accused's blood alcohol level was within permissible
limit at time of alleged offence ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C‑46 , s. 258(1) (c).

 

                   The accused was
charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while her blood
alcohol level was over .08, contrary to s. 253 (b) of the Criminal
Code .  She was stopped because a police officer saw her driving
erratically.  After speaking to her, the officer concluded that she had been
consuming alcohol.  The accused failed a roadside screening test and was taken
to the police station for breathalyzer tests.  She had to wait about an hour
for her testing session.  She went to the washroom three times during that
period.  The accused then provided two breath samples, each of which produced a
reading of 180 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.  Shortly after the
tests, the accused showed the officer two empty 50 ml vodka bottles and
told him she was an alcoholic and had consumed the contents of the bottles while
in the washroom, to calm herself.  The officer testified that the bottles
contained no residue, and did not smell of vodka.  The Crown relied on the test
results to prove that the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the
alleged offence was over .08, relying on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)
of the Code, which applies ""in the absence of evidence to the
contrary"".  The trial judge found that the presumption did not apply,
since there was evidence that the blood alcohol concentration at the time of
driving was different from that revealed by the test, and acquitted the
accused.  The summary conviction appeal court upheld the acquittal.  The Court
of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and directed that the accused be convicted
of the offence.

 

                   Held (La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and
the acquittal restored.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory,
Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The presumption of identity in s. 258(1)(c)
of the Code assists the Crown over the hurdle of having to prove in
every case that the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of driving was
the same as his or her blood alcohol level at the time of testing.  The
presumption of accuracy in s. 258(1) (g), on the other hand,
together with s. 25  of the Interpretation Act , establishes a
presumption that the reading received on the breathalyzer provides an accurate
determination of the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the testing. 
These two presumptions must be kept separate:  they arise from two entirely
different provisions, they help the Crown over two entirely different
evidentiary hurdles, and consequently the evidence necessary to rebut them is
different.  This Court's decisions in R. v. Moreau and R. v.
Crosthwait are distinguishable from the present case as they address the
presumption of accuracy rather than the presumption of identity.

 

                   ""Evidence to
the contrary"" in s. 258(1) (c) means evidence which shows that
the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of driving was different from his
or her blood alcohol level at the time of testing.  It need not show that the
accused's blood alcohol level at the time of driving was below .08.  The plain
wording of the section supports this conclusion.  The presumption of identity
is a temporal presumption designed to simplify the evidentiary necessity of
bridging the time gap between the breathalyzer test and the offence.  It is
simply a shortcut for the Crown, and if the accused is able to show that the
shortcut should not apply in this case, and that his or her blood alcohol level
was different at the time of driving from that at the time of the test, then it
would be unreasonable to apply the presumption, and on the wording of the
section, the presumption would be rebutted.  The elements of the offence can be
proved in other ways, however.  It may be possible to use expert evidence on
alcohol absorption rates to work backwards in order to establish what the
accused's blood alcohol level would have been at the time of driving.  The mere
fact that the presumption of identity is rebutted does not render the
certificate of analysis inadmissible.  It, along with the expert's testimony
and any other relevant evidence, may be easily capable of supporting a
conviction.  Moreover, even if a conviction on ""over 80"" is not
possible, a conviction for impaired driving may well be possible on the
strength of the arresting officer's testimony.

 

                   Requiring the
accused to show that his or her blood alcohol level at the time of driving was
below .08 would place the onus on the accused to establish his or her own
innocence.  Since this position arguably raises concerns under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , it should not be accepted, especially when
there is another interpretation that does not raise such concerns.  Finally,
s. 258(1) refers to s. 253  in language that indicates that the
presumptions operate with respect to impaired driving under s. 253 (a)
as well as the ""over 80"" offence in s. 253 (b).  This is
further argument to conclude that evidence to the contrary does not relate to
evidence showing a reading below the legal limit, but only to the temporal
presumption.

 

                   The effect of
normal biological processes of absorption and elimination of alcohol cannot of
and by itself constitute ""evidence to the contrary"", because
Parliament can be assumed to have known that blood alcohol levels constantly
change, yet it saw fit to implement the presumption.

 

                   The evidence that
the accused drank the two small bottles of vodka is ""evidence to the
contrary"" within the meaning of s. 258(1)(c).  Therefore, the
Crown cannot rely on the presumption that her blood alcohol level at the time
of the testing was the same as her blood alcohol level at the time of the
offence.  Since there was no other evidence establishing her blood alcohol
level at the time of the offence, she must be acquitted.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting):  ""Evidence to the
contrary"" of the presumption in s. 258(1)(c) is evidence which
tends to show that there is a legally material difference between the accused's
blood alcohol level at the time of testing and at the time of the offence. 
Section 258(1)(c) is the source of both the presumption of accuracy and
the presumption of identity.  ""Evidence to the contrary"" is evidence
which will tend to negate either (1) the presumption that the breathalyzer
result is an acceptably accurate indicator of the accused's blood alcohol level
at the time of the test; or (2) the presumption that the accused's blood
alcohol level at the time of the test is acceptably representative of his blood
alcohol level at the time of the offence.

 

                   Plain meaning must
not be used as an end in itself, particularly where it inevitably leads to
absurd results which must be inconsistent with what Parliament would have
intended, and with the purpose of the legislation.  The proposed ""plain
meaning"" approach to s. 258(1)(c) leads to absurd results.  In
the case of a ""drinking after driving"" defence, it would suffice for
an accused to adduce credible evidence of any amount of post‑driving
drinking, no matter how little, in order to rebut the presumption.  The Crown
would then have to undertake the time and expense of calling an expert
toxicologist to testify to the fact that the effect of the quantity of alcohol
consumed after driving would not have been significant enough, given the
accused's sex, weight and size, to raise a possibility that the accused's blood
alcohol would have been under the legal limit were it not for the additional
alcohol.  Even more absurd is the application of this approach to the
""last drink"" defence:  an accused would need only to adduce evidence
of having consumed one or several drinks in rapid succession immediately before
embarking in his vehicle in order to rebut the presumption in s. 258(1)(c). 
Moreover, preserving the distinction between the presumption of accuracy and
the presumption of identity would result in different standards as to what
constituted ""evidence to the contrary"" stemming from the very same
provision of the Code, and such an incongruous result could surely not
have been intended by Parliament.

 

                   Parliament enacted
the presumption in s. 258(1)(c) in clear recognition of the
difficulty and expense of requiring expert evidence in virtually every alcohol‑related
driving offence.  The presumption strikes a fair balance between collective and
individual interests by permitting the efficient and effective enforcement of
impaired driving laws in a way that does not in any material sense prejudice
the right of individual accused to a full and fair trial.  Parliament
could not have intended this presumption to be suspended in every case where
the accused invokes either the ""last drink"" defence or the ""post‑driving
drinking"" defence, where there is not even an iota of proof to suggest
that the discrepancy occasioned by the alcohol consumption would be of any
legal relevance to conviction or acquittal on a charge of ""over 80"",
and where the only effect in the vast majority of cases is to increase the time
and expense of successful prosecution.

 

                   References in
s. 258(1)(c) to actual blood alcohol levels, although legally
irrelevant for the purposes of conviction on an ""over 80"" charge, can
nonetheless have meaningful sentencing implications with respect to such
prosecutions.  Further, where the Crown seeks to rely on a breathalyzer result
for the purposes of supporting an impairment charge under s. 253 (a),
then any evidence tending to raise a doubt as to impairment is legally
material.

 

                   While the reversal
of burden created by s. 258(1)(c) may indeed constitute a breach of
s. 11 (d) of the Charter , since this statutory presumption
relieves the Crown of its duty to prove independently all the elements of the
offence beyond a reasonable doubt, such an infringement would very likely
survive Charter  scrutiny under s. 1  as a reasonable and
demonstrably justifiable limit on the right, given the overwhelming importance
of effective enforcement measures to curb the dangers of drunk driving.  Policy
considerations support the interpretation that ""evidence to the
contrary"" must go to a legally material issue.  If an accused wishes to
question the representativeness of the breathalyzer result on the basis that
the reading could be overestimating his blood alcohol level at the time of the
offence, and the reason for that discrepancy is his own wilful conduct, then it
would seem only just and consistent with the mischief that Parliament sought to
address by way of this presumption that he assume the burden of adducing some
evidence which tends to show that this discrepancy is legally relevant to the
outcome of the charge.

 

                   ""Evidence to
the contrary"" in this case must be evidence capable of raising a
reasonable doubt that the accused was under the legal limit at the time of the
offence.  Since no evidence was adduced to this effect, the Crown was entitled
to rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c) and consequently proved
all the elements of the offence.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

I.                 Iacobucci
J. -- This appeal raises the issue of the meaning of ""evidence to
the contrary"" found in s. 258(1) (c) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 

I. Factual Background

 

II.                On March 29, 1989, the appellant
was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while the
concentration of alcohol in her blood exceeded 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of
blood contrary to s. 253 (b) of the Criminal Code .  The appellant
was stopped because a police officer saw her driving her motor vehicle in an
erratic manner.  After speaking to her, the officer concluded that she had been
consuming alcohol.  The appellant failed an ALERT roadside screening device test
and was taken to the police station for two breathalyzer tests.

 








 

III.               Because the breathalyzer operator
was occupied with another driver, the appellant had to wait approximately one
hour for her testing session. In the interim, the appellant went to the
washroom at 1:33 a.m., returning at 1:36 a.m. At 1:42 a.m., the appellant had a
glass of water. At 1:56 a.m. the appellant had a second glass of water, and
entered the washroom a second time. At 2:14 a.m. she attended at the washroom a
third time, returning at 2:17 a.m.

 

IV.              The appellant provided breath
samples at 2:17 a.m. and 2:37 a.m., both of which produced a reading of 180 mg
of alcohol in 100 ml of blood. Shortly after the breath testing session, the
appellant was in the process of being fingerprinted and photographed when she
advised the police officer that she was an alcoholic and that she had consumed
two miniature 50 ml plastic bottles of vodka while in the washroom, to calm herself.
The appellant gave the two bottles to the officers. Constable Hardman testified
that the bottles contained no residue, and did not smell of vodka.

 

V.                At trial, the respondent Crown
relied on the test results to prove that the concentration of alcohol in the
appellant's blood at the time of the alleged offence exceeded 80 mg of alcohol
in 100 ml of blood.  The respondent did not call an expert to interpret those
results and had to rely on the presumption contained in s. 258(1) (c) of
the Criminal Code .  On August 23, 1990, Judge Reilly of the Provincial
Court of Ontario found that the presumption did not apply and acquitted the
appellant.

 

VI.              On July 15, 1991, Clarke J. of the
Ontario Court (General Division) dismissed the respondent's appeal:  (1991), 30
M.V.R. (2d) 13.  On September 10, 1992, the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed
the respondent's appeal, set aside the acquittal, directed that the appellant
be convicted of the offence under s. 253 (b) of the Criminal Code ,
and remitted the matter to the Ontario Court (General Division) for the
imposition of the appropriate penalty:  (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 215, 76 C.C.C.
(3d) 249, 39 M.V.R. (2d) 157, 16 C.R. (4th) 220, 58 O.A.C. 47.  Arbour J.A.
dissented.

 

II. Relevant Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

                   258. (1) In any proceedings under
subsection 255(1) in respect of an offence committed under section 253  or in
any proceedings under subsection 255(2) or (3),

 

                                                                    ...

 

                               (c)
where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken                              pursuant
to a demand made under subsection 254(3), if

 

(i)
[not proclaimed]

 

(ii)
each sample was taken as soon as practicable after the time when the offence
was alleged to have been committed and, in the case of the first sample, not
later than two hours after that time, with an interval of at least fifteen
minutes between the times when the samples were taken,

 

(iii)
each sample was received from the accused directly into an approved container
or into an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician, and

 

(iv)
an analysis of each sample was made by means of an approved instrument operated
by a qualified technician,

 

evidence
of the results of the analyses so made is, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, proof that the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the
accused at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was,
where the results of the analyses are the same, the concentration determined by
the analyses and, where the results of the analyses are different, the lowest
of the concentrations determined by the analyses;

 

                                                                    ...

 

(g)
where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand
made under subsection 254(3), a certificate of a qualified technician stating

 

(i)

certificate, that is suitable for use with an approved instrument,

 

(ii)
the results of the analyses so made, and

 

(iii)
if the samples were taken by the technician,

 

(A)
[not proclaimed]

 

(B)

III. Decisions Below

 

A. Provincial Court (Criminal
Division)

 

VII.             Reilly Prov. Ct. J. delivered oral
reasons. He stated that ""when there is a statutory departure from the
normal approach to strict proof within our system of justice, the section must
be interpreted strictly"".  Furthermore, ""it must be interpreted in a
way consistent with the interest of those impacted by the effect of the
statutory presumption"".  Reilly Prov. Ct. J. then stated that he preferred
to believe that Parliament intended that ""which it appears to have said,
that all the evidence that is required to the contrary is that there be some
evidence that the blood alcohol concentration was different from that revealed
by the machine"".  Reilly Prov. Ct. J. concluded that:

 

I
will say in all candor, that even had the matter remained as an application for
nonsuit prior to electing whether or not to call evidence, I would have granted
the application.  I agree entirely that it is not the function of a judge on an
application for directed verdict or nonsuit, to assess credibility or to weigh
the evidence.  I agree as well, that a court may, when the trial is completed,
accept or reject all or any of the evidence, but there must be some basis for
rejection. ... In my view, there is no basis upon which a trier of fact could
have anything other than a reasonable doubt on this evidence.  However
suspicious a trier of fact might be, a reasonable trier of fact would have to
believe that she may have (as she said she did) consumed that alcohol.  The
Court is not even able to assess her credibility as a witness on the stand.

 

In
any event, weighing the evidence, I would have, at the very least, some
reasonable doubt.

 

VIII.            Reilly Prov. Ct. J. added that it
might well be that the appellant was an alcoholic and that she consumed some
vodka or something else from the bottles she kept on her person for
emergencies.  Therefore, ""it may well be that the blood alcohol
concentration revealed by the machine was different from that at the time of driving"". 
Reilly J. concluded that it was not necessary for the defence to establish more
than the section appeared to require, that being that ""the blood alcohol
concentration would have been within permissible limits, or lower than the 80
milligrams percent, only that it was different from the concentration revealed
by the breathalyzer"".

 

B. Ontario Court (General Division)
(1991), 30 M.V.R. (2d) 13

 

IX.              Clarke J. stated that the issue was
whether there was ""evidence to the contrary"" within the meaning of s.
258(1) (c) of the Criminal Code  such that the respondent could not
rely on the breathalyzer tests as proof of the concentration of alcohol in the
blood of the appellant at the time she had care and control of the motor
vehicle.  Clarke J. was of the view that ""any evidence which raises a
reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact that the blood alcohol level
at the time of the breathalyzer test was higher than that at the time of
driving would be `evidence to the contrary' pursuant to s. 258(1) (c)""
(p. 15).  He stated (at p. 15) that:

 

...
if evidence is accepted that the accused consumed alcohol after driving but
before the breath tests, the trial Judge can take judicial notice that the
blood alcohol level would be greater but cannot take judicial notice as to what
extent it would be greater ... he would be left with a reasonable doubt as to
what the blood alcohol level was at the time of the test.

 

                   To
apply the presumption in s. 258(1) (c) when one entertains a reasonable
doubt as to the blood alcohol level at the time of the test would found a
conviction on evidence of which there is a reasonable doubt as to an essential
element of the offence.  That would be wrong in my view ... convictions cannot
be founded on evidence to which there is a reasonable doubt if it is evidence
upon an essential issue, as there then would be a violation of the presumption
of innocence.

 

Clarke J. disagreed with the cases
that indicated that ""in order to be evidence to the contrary, the evidence
must tend to show that despite the alcohol consumed after driving the blood
alcohol level at the time of driving was within prescribed limits"" (p.
15).  Clarke J. stated that, if a trial judge could not take judicial notice of
the extent to which alcohol consumed raised blood alcohol levels, ""I cannot
see how the above determination can be made"".  Clarke J. concluded (at pp.
15-16) that:

 

                   It
seems to me that the whole issue is a matter for Parliament to clarify in an
amendment to the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

                   In
this matter the learned trial Judge found that the alcohol consumed by the
[appellant], after driving, raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the blood
alcohol level at the time of the test was the same as at the time of driving
and therefore he had a reasonable doubt as to an essential element and he
acquitted the [appellant].

 

                   With
this result I agree, although I have stated the matter somewhat differently. 
The appeal is therefore dismissed.

 

C. Ontario Court of Appeal
(1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 215

 

Majority

 

X.                Galligan J.A. stated that the
issue was whether ""evidence to the contrary"" sufficient to rebut the
presumption was:

 

(a)evidence
which would tend to show that the blood alcohol level at the time of the test
was not the same as that at the time of the driving, or

 

(b)evidence
which tends to show that the blood alcohol level at the time of the driving was
not above the maximum permissible level of 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.

 

XI.              If evidence raises a reasonable
doubt that the blood alcohol level was over 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood
at the time of the driving, the accused should be acquitted.  However, when
courts discuss evidence which is legally capable of amounting to ""evidence
to the contrary"", they do so in the restricted sense of whether it is
legally capable of rebutting the presumption.  Galligan J.A. then stated (at
pp. 221-22) that:

 

If,
in order for evidence to constitute ""evidence to the contrary"", it
must tend to show that the blood alcohol level at the time of driving was not
over 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood, it would be irrelevant whether the
blood alcohol levels at the time of driving and at the time of testing were or
were not the same.  On the other hand, if, in order for evidence to constitute
""evidence to the contrary"", it need only tend to show that blood
alcohol levels at the time of driving and at the time of testing were not the
same it would be irrelevant whether the evidence tended to show that at the
time of driving the blood alcohol level was either above or below the
permissible limit.  I think it is one thing to show that the blood alcohol
level at the time of driving and at the time of testing were not the same.  It
is quite another thing, and perhaps a more difficult thing, to show that the
blood alcohol level at the time of driving was within the permissible limit.

 

It
is my opinion that this court must accept one or the other position.

 

XII.             Galligan J.A. noted that two years
after it decided R. v. Moreau, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 261, the Supreme Court of
Canada was again called upon to decipher what kind of evidence was legally
capable of amounting to ""evidence to the contrary"". He concluded that
the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Crosthwait, [1980]
1 S.C.R. 1089, removed any ambiguities that had led to erroneous
interpretations of R. v. Moreau. In order for evidence to amount legally
to ""evidence to the contrary"" in s. 258(1) (c), the evidence
must tend to show that at the time of the alleged offence the accused person's
blood alcohol level did not exceed 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood, viz.
that the blood alcohol level was within the lawful limit at the time of
driving.  Evidence only showing that the blood alcohol concentration at the
time of the test was not the same as at the time of the offence would not be
""evidence to the contrary"" legally capable of rebutting the statutory
presumption.

 

XIII.            Galligan J.A. pointed out that this
is the interpretation most often accepted by provincial appellate courts: R.
v. White (1986), 41 M.V.R. 82 (Nfld. C.A.); R. v. Creed (1987), 7
M.V.R. (2d) 184 (P.E.I.S.C.A.D.); R. v. Kays (1987), 3 M.V.R. (2d) 209
(N.S.S.C.A.D.); R. v. Gallagher (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 533 (N.B.C.A.); R.
v. Dubois (1990), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 90 (Que. C.A.); Batley v. The Queen
(1985), 32 M.V.R. 257 (Sask. C.A.).  Concluding his review, Galligan J.A.
stated (at p. 228):

 

...it
is my view that there should be consistency in the interpretation of an
important provision of the law which has as its object the reduction of the
widespread death and destruction caused by drinking drivers.  I have concluded
that this court should follow what I view to be the overwhelming weight of
appellate jurisprudence across the country.

 

XIV.            Applying this interpretation to this
appeal, the post-driving drinking evidence did not tend to show even the
possibility that the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of driving was
within the permissible limit.  It was thus not legally ""evidence to the
contrary"" within the meaning of s. 258(1) (c).

 

XV.             Galligan J.A. also stated that his
interpretation of ""evidence to the contrary"" was more in keeping with
Parliamentary intention in legislating against drinking and driving which is a
serious problem that endangers the lives and safety of innocent persons.  The
legislative scheme tests blood alcohol concentration through approved
breathalyzers.  To prove the test results and avoid unreasonably large public
expenditures on expert witnesses, a statutory presumption based on strict
requirements relating to the taking of samples was chosen.  The presumption
could only have been intended to prove either that:

 

(a)at
the time of driving the accused person had a concentration of alcohol in his or
her blood of more than 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood, or

 

(b)at
the time of driving the accused person had a certain, specific concentration of
alcohol in his or her blood.

 

XVI.            Given that the offence is driving
with a blood alcohol concentration of more than 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of
blood, the presumption must have been intended to prove only that the driver
had a concentration exceeding 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood at the time
of the offence.  Evidence ""contrary"" to the factual presumption that
the driver's blood alcohol concentration was over 80 at the time of the offence
would therefore have to be evidence which would tend to show that the driver's
blood alcohol concentration was not over 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood. 
The presumption was a vitally important element of the legislative scheme and
without it, it would be feasible to prosecute only a small number of the
offences detected by breathalyzer testing.  To interpret ""evidence to the
contrary"" as including evidence which shows only that the concentrations
at the time of driving and testing were not the same would permit rebuttal of
the presumption by the presentation of evidence which really only shows the
possibility of some uncertainty about that element of the scheme.

 

XVII.          Thus, Galligan J.A. allowed the appeal,
and entered a conviction.

 

Dissent

 

XVIII.          Arbour J.A. began her dissent by noting
that she was not satisfied that Galligan J.A.'s interpretation and that of
other provincial appellate authority accorded with the wording of the Criminal
Code  provision and Parliamentary intention.  Considering R. v.
Crosthwait, supra, she noted that s. 258(1) (c) serves a
function different from that of s. 258(1) (g).  Section 258(1) (c)
of the Criminal Code  contains a presumption which permits an inference
to be drawn that the blood alcohol level of the accused at the time of the
alleged offence is the same as it was when the breathalyzer test was
administered, provided that certain conditions are met, including the
requirement that the breath test be done as soon as practicable, but no more
than two hours after the accused was required to provide a breath sample (at
pp. 234-35):

 

                   The
presumption is thus a measure enacted to give effect to the       provision
which permits a delay of up to two hours before the breath test is performed. 
Without the benefit of the presumption, the Crown would be left with a reading
two hours after the event which, arguably, would not necessarily reflect
accurately the blood alcohol content of the accused at the time of the alleged
offence.  The presumption therefore assists the Crown in dispensing with the
need to bridge the gap, by expert evidence, between the offence and the delayed
taking of a breath sample.

 

                   This
is not an insignificant benefit as blood alcohol levels do not remain constant
over time and, in the absence of such a presumption, readings presumed accurate
at one point in time could be of limited assistance in establishing the levels
two hours before....

 

                   In
my opinion, it is in that context that the expression ""in the absence of
evidence to the contrary"" in s. 258(1) (c) must be understood.  If
the breath samples were taken in accordance with that section, it will be
presumed, everything else being equal, that the reading at the time of the
offence would have been the same as the reading at the time of the test.  The
accuracy of the readings at the time of the test, as stated in the certificate
of the analyst, is presumed, by the operation of s. 24 [now s. 25 ] of the Interpretation
Act , ""in the absence of evidence to the contrary"".

 

XIX.            As recognized in R. v. Gibson
(1992), 72 C.C.C. (3d) 28, case law establishes two distinct sets of
circumstances in which it has been argued that there was ""evidence to the
contrary"" within the meaning of s. 258(1) (c) and hence the
presumption should not apply. First, where evidence is tendered to show that
the reading was inaccurate at the time it was taken, for example cases where
the evidence suggests inaccurate reading results, margin of error in the
breathalyzer apparatus, or the quantity of alcohol consumed could not have
produced the results recorded: see R. v. Moreau, supra, R. v.
Crosthwait, supra, and R. v. Davis (1973), 14 C.C.C. (2d) 513
(B.C.C.A.). Second, where evidence is tendered to show that the blood alcohol
level at the time of the offence was likely to have been different from what it
was at the time of the test, for example cases where there is evidence that the
accused consumed some alcohol after his or her arrest, or testifies as to his
weight, quantity drunk, and expert evidence to suggest that the level at the
time of driving would likely have been within the permissible limit. In
the former group of cases, the Supreme Court has held that the presumption is
only displaced by evidence capable of raising a doubt that the results were
inaccurate to the point that the blood level of the accused at the relevant
time would have been, on that evidence, below the prohibited level.

 

XX.             Arbour J.A. stated (at p. 237):

 

                   Section
258 refers to both the presumption of accuracy and to what might be called the
presumption of identity; it presumes that the reading at hour X is the same as
the reading would have been at hour Y.  This presumption can be displaced by
evidence to the contrary; that is, any evidence which raises a reasonable doubt
that the levels at the two different points in time were in fact identical. 
When the Crown loses the benefit of the presumption, for instance because of
evidence indicating that the accused consumed alcohol between the two points in
time, the Crown does not lose the benefit of the presumption that the
certificate accurately represents the blood alcohol level at the time of the
test.  The Crown may still prove, with or without recourse to expert evidence,
that the blood level of the accused at the time of the offence was over 80. 
One of the relevant pieces of evidence will be, of course, the reading taken by
the breathalyzer, the accuracy of which is not disputed.

 

The certificate would still be
admissible as proof of its content, as long as it complied with s. 258(1) (g),
even if the Crown could not rely on the presumption contained in s. 258(1) (c).
Arbour J.A. continued (at p. 238):

 

If a
breathalyzer test, taken well within two hours of the arrest, shows a very high
concentration of alcohol in the blood, and the accuracy of that reading is not
in issue, evidence that the accused consumed a very small amount of alcohol
after his arrest, although it may be sufficient to raise a doubt that the
results would have been the same had the test been administered at the time of
the arrest, may be insufficient to raise any doubt that his blood alcohol
content was below 80 at the time of the alleged offence.

 

                   In
the same way, I see no difficulty with the defence introducing evidence tending
to show that the blood level of the accused at the time of the offence was
higher than it was at the time of the breathalyzer test.  In that case, the
Crown would lose the benefit of the presumption that the levels were identical,
but the accused would still have to be convicted on the strength of all the
evidence which would inescapably point to his blood alcohol level having been
above the permissible limit at the time of the offence.

 

XXI.            According to Arbour J.A., when the
presumption of identity is in question, an accused must introduce evidence
capable of raising a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol content at the
time of the alleged offence was not the same as the content recorded by the
breathalyzer.  There is no reason to require that ""the difference be of
any particular magnitude"" (p. 240).  The presumption ""permits the
Crown to rely on a legal fiction in order to prove a fact essential to
conviction"".  Furthermore, if that advantage were removed, by
""evidence to the contrary"", ""it is still open to the Crown to
prove that fact by other evidence"".  Arbour J.A. concluded (at p. 240)
that:

 

To
the extent that Crosthwait, supra, held that ""evidence to
the contrary"" in s. 258(1) (c) means evidence tending to show that
the accused's blood alcohol content at the time of the offence was below the
permissible limit, it should not be applied in a case such as the present one.

 

On this basis, both the trial judge
and the summary conviction appeal court were correct in their interpretation of
s. 258(1) (c) and Arbour J.A. would have dismissed the appeal.

 

IV. Analysis

 

(i) Introduction

 

XXII.          At the outset, I must state that I am
in agreement with the dissenting judgment of Arbour J.A. of the Ontario Court
of Appeal.  Evidence to the contrary, as articulated in s. 258(1) (c) of
the Criminal Code , means evidence sufficient to show that the temporal
presumption, or as Arbour J.A. calls it the presumption of identity, should not
operate to deem the blood alcohol level of the motorist at the time of
breathalyzer testing to be the same as the blood alcohol level at the time of
driving. The central issue of this appeal is the manner in which this
presumption may be rebutted. Before discussing that issue directly, I think it
important to review the operation of the presumptions that are employed in the Criminal
Code  in this area and to follow with a brief review of the jurisprudence
which I believe has introduced some confusion into the area.

 

(ii) Presumptions of Accuracy and
Identity

 

XXIII.         The scheme established in the Criminal
Code  for proving the offence of ""over 80"" contains presumptions
to assist the Crown in surmounting two important evidentiary hurdles.  But for
these presumptions, the Crown's task would be significantly more difficult. It
is crucial, therefore, to keep in mind that presumptions are merely legal or
evidentiary shortcuts designed to bridge difficult evidentiary gaps, and that
they are rebuttable upon the leading of ""evidence to the contrary"".
If such evidence to the contrary is led, the Crown can still proceed to try to
prove its case without the benefit of these evidentiary shortcuts.

 

XXIV.         To adopt the terminology of Arbour J.A.,
s. 258 refers to two presumptions, the presumption of accuracy (s. 258(1) (g))
and the presumption of identity (s. 258(1) (c)).  The first presumption
addresses the dilemma of how to prove in court what the accused's blood alcohol
content was at the time of testing on the breathalyzer.  Section 258(1)(g)
of the Code provides:

 

(g)
where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand
made under subsection 254(3), a certificate of a qualified technician stating

 

(i)
that the analysis of each of the samples has been made by means of an approved
instrument operated by the technician and ascertained by the technician to be
in proper working order by means of an alcohol standard, identified in the
certificate, that is suitable for use with an approved instrument,

 

(ii)
the results of the analyses so made, and 

 

(iii)
if the samples were taken by the technician,

 

(A)
[not proclaimed]

 

(B)
the time when and place where each sample and any specimen described in clause
(A) was taken, and

 

(C)
that each sample was received from the accused directly into an approved
container or into an approved instrument operated by the technician,

 

is
evidence of the facts alleged in the certificate without proof of the signature
or the official character of the person appearing to have signed the
certificate;

 

XXV.          In addition, s. 25  of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21 , reads:

                   25. (1)  Where an enactment provides that
a document is evidence of a fact without anything in the context to indicate
that the document is conclusive evidence, then, in any judicial proceedings,
the document is admissible in evidence and the fact is deemed to be established
in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.  [Emphasis added.]

 

XXVI.         Clearly, the result of these two
provisions is that a presumption that the reading received on the breathalyzer
provides an accurate determination of the accused's blood alcohol level at
the time of the testing is established. Hence, the certificate can be
tendered in evidence to prove what this blood alcohol level was.  However, if
the accused leads or points to ""evidence to the contrary"" which tends
to show that, in fact, his or her blood alcohol level, at the time of testing,
was not that shown on the certificate, then the certificate is no longer proof
of that fact. Therefore, for the Crown to be successful it must prove the
accused's blood alcohol level some other way. Indeed, the Crown may still prove
that the blood alcohol level of the accused at the time of the offence was over
80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.  This ""presumption of accuracy""
relates to the accuracy of the readings at the time of the test, as stated in
the certificate of analysis, and is presumed by the operation of s. 25  of the Interpretation
Act , in the absence of ""evidence to the contrary"".  This is not,
however, the presumption at issue in this case.

 

XXVII.        What is at issue in the instant case is
the second presumption which is set out in s. 258(1) (c), which reads:

 

                   258.  (1)  In any proceedings under
subsection 255(1) in respect of an offence committed under section 253  or in
any proceedings under subsection 255(2) or (3),

 

                                                                    ...

 

(c)
where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand
made under subsection 254(3), if

 

(i)
[not in force]

 

(ii)
each sample was taken as soon as practicable after the time when the offence
was alleged to have been committed and, in the case of the first sample, not
later than two hours after that time, with an interval of at least fifteen
minutes between the times when the samples were taken,

 

(iii)
each sample was received from the accused directly into an approved container
or into an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician, and

 

(iv) 
an analysis of each sample was made by means of an approved instrument operated
by a qualified technician,

 

evidence
of the results of the analyses so made is, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, proof that the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the
accused at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was,
where the results of the analyses are the same, the concentration determined by
the analyses and, where the results of the analyses are different, the lowest
of the concentrations determined by the analyses; [Emphasis added.]

 

XXVIII.      This presumption assists the Crown over the
hurdle of having to prove, in every case, that the accused's blood alcohol
level at the time of driving was the same as his or her blood alcohol
level at the time of testing, which could be as much as two hours later.
Section 258(1) (c) presumes that the breathalyzer reading at the time of
testing is the same as the reading would have been at the time of driving.  If
all of the conditions of the section are met, then the presumption applies,
unless there is some evidence to the contrary.  This presumption is the
so-called presumption of identity.

 

XXIX.         I agree with the following remarks of
Arbour J.A., found at p. 237, which distinguish between the two presumptions:

 

This
presumption [of identity] can be displaced by evidence to the contrary; that
is, any evidence which raises a reasonable doubt that the levels at the two
different points in time were in fact identical. When the Crown loses the
benefit of the presumption, for instance because of evidence indicating that
the accused consumed alcohol between the two points in time, the Crown does not
lose the benefit of the presumption that the certificate accurately represents
the blood alcohol level at the time of the test. The Crown may still prove,
with or without recourse to expert evidence, that the blood level of the
accused at the time of the offence was over 80. One of the relevant pieces of
evidence will be, of course, the reading taken by the breathalyzer, the accuracy
of which is not disputed.

 

XXX.          It is very important to keep these two
presumptions separate. They arise from two entirely different subsections, they
help the Crown over two entirely different evidentiary hurdles, and consequently
the evidence necessary to rebut them is different.  Also, as I will describe
below, courts frequently have had difficulty with the distinct nature of these
presumptions and have confused them, a matter to which I shall now turn.

 

(iii) The Jurisprudence

 

XXXI.         In R. v. Moreau, supra,
the accused had tested 90 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.  He called an
expert witness who testified that Borkenstein breathalyzers were subject to a
possible margin of error of 10 mg.  The issue was whether this was
""evidence to the contrary"" within s. 237(1)(c) (now s. 258(1) (c)). 
Beetz J. held that such evidence was not ""evidence to the contrary""
as it was general evidence aimed at denying the presumption.  Specific evidence
of the accused's condition would, however, have been admissible.  At page 271
Beetz J. stated there had to be evidence

 

which
tends to establish that the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused
at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was not the
same as that indicated by the result of the chemical analysis. There is no such
evidence in the case at bar.  Apart from the certificates, there is no evidence
of any kind directed at showing what was the proportion of alcohol in the blood
of the accused at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed.

 

Beetz J. thus related the
""evidence to the contrary"" to the nature of the presumption.

 

 

XXXII.        What has caused difficulty in appellate
interpretation of Moreau, supra, is that Beetz J. additionally
referred with approval to McFarlane J.A.'s dicta in R. v. Davis, supra,
at p. 516, that:

 

...the
concluding part of the subsection means that the result of the chemical
analysis is proof of the proportion of alcohol to blood at the time of the
offence in the absence of evidence that the proportion at that time did not
exceed 80 to 100.  Any evidence, therefore, tending to show that at the time
of the offence the proportion was within the permitted limits is ""evidence
to the contrary"" within the meaning of the subsection. [Emphasis
added.]

 

XXXIII.      The above passage created ambiguity and has
been relied upon by provincial appellate authority.  Nonetheless, it is
important to note that the two passages may be reconciled to state that any
evidence showing that the proportion is within legal limits does not preclude
evidence showing that the  proportion is higher at the time of the breathalyzer
than at the time of the driving offence.  Moreau is best categorized, as
Bayda C.J.S. did in R. v. Gibson, supra, at p. 37, as a case
involving evidence which generally concluded that all Borkenstein breathalyzers
were inherently subject to a margin of error of 10 mg.

 

XXXIV.      The second critical case is R. v.
Crosthwait, supra. This Court established that there is nothing in
s. 258(1) (c) of the Criminal Code  establishing a presumption of
accuracy.  In this case, an accused was being tried for ""over 80"",
and in defence he argued that the results of the breathalyzer were not reliable
because the technician did not confirm that there was less than a one degree
difference between the air temperature and the temperature of the solution, as
the manufacturer's instruction manual said must be done before an accurate
result could be obtained.  Pigeon J., for a unanimous Court, pointed out the
distinction between the presumption of identity, contained in s. 258(1) (c),
and the presumption of accuracy in s. 258(1)(g) and s. 25  of the Interpretation
Act .  After quoting these sections, Pigeon J. said (at p. 1099) that
""[i]t is clear from the wording of the Code that the rebuttable
presumption arises from the mere statements in the certificate itself.  The
presumption may no doubt be rebutted by evidence that the instrument used was
not functioning properly but the certificate cannot be rejected on that
account"".

 

XXXV.       In that case, the accused was not
attacking the presumption of identity, that is, he was not claiming that his
blood alcohol level as recorded on the breathalyzer was not the same as his
blood alcohol level at the time he was driving.  Rather, he argued that the
blood alcohol level recorded by the breathalyzer did not accurately reflect his
actual blood alcohol level, because the technician did not compare the
temperatures of the air and solution before proceeding.  In other words, he was
attacking the presumption of accuracy.  Therefore, the evidence he led to try
to rebut this presumption was not ""evidence to the contrary"" under s.
258(1) (c), but was ""evidence to the contrary"" under s. 25  of
the Interpretation Act .  Pigeon J. made this clear when he said (at p.
1100):

 

...while
the certificate is evidence by itself, the facts of which it is evidence are ""deemed
to be established only in the absence of any evidence to the contrary"". 
Thus, any evidence tending to invalidate the result of the tests may be adduced
on behalf of the accused in order to dispute the charge against him. . . .
Therefore, in my view, the situation here is that the certificate was evidence
of the results of the analyses by virtue of the express provisions of the Criminal
Code , however, the further question remained: Was there any evidence to the
contrary sufficient at least to raise a reasonable doubt? [Emphasis added.]

 

XXXVI.      It is important to note that the passage
quoted by Pigeon J. here was from what is now s. 25  of the Interpretation
Act , and not from (then) s. 237(1)(c) of the Code.  It is
clear that the question before Pigeon J. in Crosthwait, supra,
was what evidence was necessary in order to rebut the presumption of accuracy,
not the presumption of identity.

 

XXXVII.     Pigeon J. then went on to hold that the
evidence in the case before him was not ""evidence to the contrary""
within the meaning of s. 25  of the Interpretation Act , and so the
presumption of accuracy was not rebutted.  He concluded (at p. 1102) that:

 

                   In
my view in order to conclude that there was no evidence before the Magistrate to
rebut the certificate, it is enough to note that the only evidence was
merely of a possibility of a temperature difference without any indication that
this could have affected the results to a significant extent. [Emphasis added.]

                   

XXXVIII.    However, Pigeon J. also said (at p. 1101):

 

                   I
am therefore of the opinion that the evidence of Dr. Newlands does not
constitute evidence to the contrary under s. 237(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code .

 

XXXIX.      This last sentence must surely be
considered something of a ""slip of the pen"", since the presumption
with which Pigeon J. was concerned was not contained in s. 237(1)(c) of
the Code, but was instead contained in s. 237(1) (f) (now s.
258(1) (g)) and s. 25  of the Interpretation Act .  This is
confirmed by his earlier analysis of these sections, and the fact that he
quoted the Interpretation Act  in the passage reproduced above when
setting out the question to be answered.

 

XL.             Consequently, the case was not at
all concerned with establishing that the blood alcohol level recorded by the
breathalyzer was different from the blood alcohol level at the time of
driving.  Rather, the case was concerned with how to prove that the blood
alcohol level recorded by the breathalyzer was not an accurate recording of the
blood alcohol level at the time of the test.  Section 258(1) (c) does not
deal with this question.  It is dealt with by s. 258(1)(g) and s. 25  of
the Interpretation Act .

 

XLI.            I agree with Arbour J.A. that the
decisions of this Court in R. v. Moreau and R. v. Crosthwait are
distinguishable from the matter at hand as they address the presumption of
accuracy, rather than the presumption of identity.  The following passage from
the dissenting reasons of Arbour J.A. (at p. 237) is instructive:

 

In
those cases [Moreau, supra, and Crosthwait, supra],
it was suggested by the defence that the blood alcohol level of the accused at
the time of the offence was not what the breathalyzer recorded because those
results were inaccurate. It is in that context that the Supreme Court held that
the presumption was displaced only by evidence capable of raising a doubt that
the results were inaccurate to the point that the blood level of the accused at
the relevant time would have been, on that evidence, below the prohibited
level.

 

XLII.           Despite the fact that Crosthwait,
supra, deals entirely with the presumption of accuracy, some lower
courts have mistakenly used it to analyze the presumption of identity, without
recognizing the distinct nature of these two presumptions as established by
this Court.  For example see R. v. Pryor (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 108, R.
v. Andrews (1983), 22 M.V.R. 213 (N.S.S.C.A.D.), and R. v. Hughes
(1982), 70 C.C.C. (2d) 42 (Alta. C.A.), where the courts, with respect,
confused the two presumptions and improperly relied on R. v. Moreau and R.
v. Crosthwait to support their interpretation of evidence to the contrary
in s. 258(1) (c).

 

XLIII.           The majority of the Court of Appeal in
the instant appeal similarly cite cases which discuss ""evidence to the
contrary"" in s. 25  of the Interpretation Act  for rebutting the
presumption of accuracy. They, with respect, mistakenly apply these authorities
to the presumption of identity, without recognizing either the distinction
between the two types of presumptions or the reason why different evidence will
be required to rebut each one.  The short answer why evidence used for
rebutting the presumption of accuracy will not rebut the presumption of
identity is that they are two different presumptions, and therefore different
evidence will be required for each.  I now wish to discuss this point more
fully.

 

(iv) Evidence to the Contrary

 

XLIV.         The central question in this appeal is
whether ""evidence to the contrary"" in s. 258(1) (c) means (a)
evidence which shows that the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the
offence (driving) and the time of the testing has changed, or (b) evidence
which shows that the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of driving was
below .08.  Like Arbour J.A., I am of the view that the correct answer is the
former for several reasons.

 

XLV.           In the first place, the plain wording
of the section supports the conclusion that ""evidence to the
contrary"" means simply that the blood alcohol level at the time of the
test was different from the time of the offence.  It does not support
the conclusion that the evidence must show that the accused's blood alcohol
level was below .08.  I reproduce the section here with only the relevant
portions:

 

(c)
where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken . . . evidence of
the results of the analyses so made is, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, proof that the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the accused
at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was . . . the
lowest of the concentrations determined by the analyses;

 

XLVI.         To paraphrase, the section states that
the blood alcohol level at the time the accused was driving will be presumed to
be the same as the blood alcohol level at the time of the breathalyzer test,
unless the accused can lead evidence showing that they were not the same.  The
section clearly does not say that the accused must show that he or she was not
over .08 for the presumption not to apply. As stated earlier, the presumed fact
deals with presuming blood alcohol levels to be the same at two different
times. Evidence to the contrary must therefore be defined in relation to what
is being presumed. To rebut the presumption all that must be done is for the
accused to show that his or her blood alcohol levels at the two points in time
were different and, hence, to show that the temporal presumption should not
apply.  On this basis, I fail to see how the majority's position can be
supported on the plain wording of the section.

 

XLVII.        Moreover, the majority's concerns about
the Crown's ability to prove the offence if this interpretation is given to the
section are misplaced.  One point raised by the majority is that the section
should not require the Crown to prove an immaterial fact.  The majority says
that it does not matter exactly what the accused's blood alcohol level was,
just that it was over .08.  Therefore, the Crown should not be required to
prove by how much it was over .08, just that it was, in fact, over this
threshold.

 

XLVIII.       The problem with this line of reasoning is
that the majority is confusing the presumptions.  Their point is a valid one
with respect to the presumption of accuracy.  When an accused seeks to rebut
the presumption of accuracy, as contained in s. 258(1)(g) and s. 25  of
the Interpretation Act , it does not matter that they are able to prove
that their actual blood alcohol level should have been .150 instead of the .200
as recorded on the breathalyzer.  This is immaterial as far as the commission of
the offence is concerned.  This is why it is well established that, in order to
rebut this presumption, the accused must adduce or point to evidence which
tends to show that his or her blood alcohol level was actually under .08.

 

XLIX.         However, the same logic does not apply
to the presumption of identity, and cases dealing with the presumption of
accuracy cannot be used in support of this point for the presumption of
identity, as the majority of the Court of Appeal attempts to do.  The
presumption of accuracy establishes the blood alcohol level necessary for the
offence.  The presumption of identity in effect puts the accused in the car
with that blood alcohol level at a prior point in time. Hence, the presumption
of identity is a temporal presumption designed to simplify the evidentiary
necessity of bridging the time gap between the time of the breathalyzer and the
time of the offence.  The presumption is simply a ""short-cut"" for the
Crown, and if the accused is able to show that the short-cut should not apply
in this case, and that his or her blood alcohol level was different at the time
of driving from that at the time of the test, then it would be unreasonable to
apply the presumption, and on the wording of the section, the presumption would
be rebutted.

 

L.                Moreover, it may not matter a
great deal if the presumption is rebutted.  The majority's concerns about an
accused rebutting the presumption of identity by simply showing that his or her
blood alcohol level at the time he or she was driving was different, in that it
was higher, than at the time of the test are unfounded.  If an accused proves
that his or her blood alcohol level at the time of driving was actually higher
than at the time of the test, then the presumption of identity would be
rebutted because the evidence is that the blood alcohol level was different. 
The accused, however, could still be convicted because even without the
presumption of identity, the elements of the offence could be made out.  The
same holds true where the accused leads evidence to the effect that his or her
blood alcohol level at the time of driving was lower than at the time of the
test, but still over .08.

 

LI.               Therefore, the majority of the
Ontario Court of Appeal need not be so concerned about the presumption of
identity being rebutted here because if it is rebutted, the elements of the
offence can be proved in other ways. It may be possible to bridge the time gap
between the test and the driving by the use of expert evidence on absorption
rates of alcohol to work ""backwards"" in order to establish what the
accused's blood alcohol level would have been at the time of driving.  Thus,
for example, if an accused blew .250 on the breathalyzer, but had consumed 100
ml of vodka one hour before the test, it would be open for an expert in this
area to work backwards to give an opinion on what the accused's blood alcohol
level would have been at the time of driving.  Such an opinion would be given in
terms of a range, and if the expert said that the accused would have been
between .170 and .200, for instance, then a conviction would in all likelihood
follow because it must be remembered that the mere fact that the presumption of
identity is rebutted does not render the certificate of analysis inadmissible. 
This is still admissible evidence under s. 258(1) (g) for the facts
contained therein and it, along with the expert's testimony and any other
relevant evidence, may be easily capable of supporting a conviction.

 

LII.              The British Columbia Court of
Appeal recognized this fact in R. v. Kizan (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 444,
where they reached a conclusion essentially the same as Arbour J.A.'s in the
present case.  This was another case in which the accused had a swallow of
vodka between the time of driving and the time of the test.  The question is
whether this constituted ""evidence to the contrary"" within the
meaning of s. 258(1) (c).  McFarlane J.A., for a unanimous court, said
(at p. 446):

 

                   As
I put to counsel, and I say it again, if it be accepted that the respondent
swallowed a good drink of vodka very shortly after the time of the alleged
offence, if (and I repeat if) the taking of that drink could have any effect
whatever on the proportion of alcohol to blood, it must surely be to increase
the proportion of alcohol in the blood after the time of the alleged offence,
and before the test.

 

                   Accordingly,
on the circumstances of this particular case the evidence of the taking of that
drink was, in my opinion, clearly evidence to the contrary, within the meaning
of the subsection.

 

                   Now,
whether I am right in my last assertion or not, it is evidence which might tend
to show that the proportion of alcohol to blood at the time of the alleged
offence was not that shown by the certificate.  If that be so, it might be
either more or less, and the question then would be for the trier of fact to
decide whether the evidence did or did not, on the whole, satisfy him (a) that
the Crown had proved the offence beyond a reasonable doubt or (b) that upon the
whole of the evidence, including the certificates, the Crown had failed to
prove the commission of the offence to that degree.

 

LIII.            The British Columbia Court of Appeal
correctly noted, as did Arbour J.A., that the mere fact that the presumption of
identity is rebutted does not mean that the certificate of analysis is
inadmissible.  It is still open to the trial judge to convict if, on the basis
of all the evidence before him or her, the trial judge is satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused was over .08 at the time of driving.

 

LIV.            Moreover, even if a conviction on
""over 80"" is not possible, for whatever reason, a conviction on
impaired driving may well be possible on the strength of the arresting
officer's testimony.  In the present case, it so happens that the accused was
not charged with impaired driving, even though such a charge is routinely
laid.  In fact, the trial judge in this case inquired of Crown counsel why an
impaired charge was not laid, and said that such a charge may well have been
sustainable.

 

LV.             I should emphasize at this point
that it is important to recall the essential difference between a presumption
and evidence.  Section 258(1) (c) establishes a presumption that
the blood alcohol level at the time of driving was the same as at the time of testing,
but it does not provide evidence of this fact.  It is simply a short-cut for
the Crown.  If the accused is able to rebut the presumption by showing that the
blood alcohol level at the two times was different, then the Crown will have to
call evidence to prove its case.  The presumption simply establishes that the
blood alcohol level at the two times was the same.  The evidence called would
go to establishing what the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of
driving actually was.

 

LVI.            There is another aspect of the
approach of the majority of the Court of Appeal in this case that merits
comment. Essentially, the adoption of the line of reasoning advanced by the
majority would place the onus on the accused to establish his or her own
innocence. Specifically, if an accused were required to rebut the s. 258(1) (c)
presumption in the manner put forward by the majority, the accused would
necessarily have to prove that his or her blood alcohol content was less
than .08.  If this position is accepted, and the materiality of the evidence of
the accused depends upon reference to the legal limit, a grey area exists
between the breathalyzer result and the legal limit, and the burden of
clarifying this will be placed on the accused when, in fact, the burden should
rest with the Crown to prove its case.

 

LVII.            If the accused chooses not to call
evidence, as is his or her right, and the Crown does not present additional
evidence, the burden is in effect switched to the accused to establish that his
or her blood alcohol level was below .08 at the time of the offence, despite
the fact that the Crown has not proved its case. If the Crown cannot establish
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's blood alcohol level exceeded .08
this should not be sufficient to ground a conviction. If the Crown in this
appeal is correct, the accused must raise a doubt as to his guilt despite the
fact that the Crown may have introduced no evidence. Put another way, an
accused may be able to meet the test as elaborated by Arbour J.A., but he may
still not be able to pass the test proposed by the Crown without basically
bearing the burden of proving his innocence. This position arguably raises
concerns under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and,
accordingly, it should not be accepted, especially when there is another
interpretation that does not raise such concerns.

 

LVIII.          Finally, if the Crown's position on the
meaning of evidence to the contrary is correct, this view raises some problems
when one considers the operation of s. 253 (a) of the Criminal Code .
Section 253  establishes the offence of operating a vehicle while impaired by
providing the following:

 

                   253. Every one commits an offence who
operates a motor vehicle or vessel or operates or assists in the operation of
an aircraft or of railway equipment or has the care or control of a motor
vehicle, vessel, aircraft or railway equipment, whether it is in motion or not,

 

(a)
while the person's ability to operate the vehicle, vessel, aircraft or railway
equipment is impaired by alcohol or a drug; or

 

(b)
having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in the
person's blood exceeds eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres
of blood.

 

Section 258 refers to s. 253  when it
provides:

 

                   258. (1) In any proceedings under
subsection 255(1) in respect of an offence committed under section 253 
or in any proceedings under subsection 255(2) or (3), [Emphasis added.]

 

This language indicates that the
presumptions in s. 258 operate with respect to both paras. (a) and (b)
of s. 253 . Therefore, if the majority opinion of the Court of Appeal were
accepted, evidence to the contrary under s. 258 would only be evidence tending
to show that the accused's blood alcohol level was below .08. The question then
arises of how this approach would operate with respect to a charge under s.
253 (a) dealing with impaired driving. This is further argument to
conclude that evidence to the contrary does not relate to evidence showing a
reading below the legal limit, but only to the temporal presumption as
previously discussed.

 

LIX.            There remains one difficulty with the
above analysis or at least with the inherent nature of the presumption of
identity which presents something of a conundrum. If any evidence of
difference between the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the testing
and at the time of the driving could be considered ""evidence to the
contrary"" within the meaning of s. 258(1) (c) so as to rebut the
presumption, then the presumption could be rebutted in every case.  The simple
reason for this is that an intoxicated person's blood alcohol level is
constantly changing as a result of absorption and elimination of alcohol into
and out of the blood.  A person charged with ""over 80"" could simply
show that his blood alcohol level changed between driving and being stopped
because some of the alcohol had been metabolized in the interim, and suddenly
the presumption in s. 258(1) (c) would be gone.  In such cases, a
conviction would not be difficult to obtain, because in most cases the blood
alcohol level will have gone down after driving, or, if it was going up as a
result of absorption, in most cases it would not have risen rapidly if nothing
else was consumed.  But, with the presumption rebutted, the Crown would, in
every case, have to call expert witnesses to establish these facts and provide
a range of what the accused's blood alcohol level would have been.  If this
normal process of absorption and elimination were considered to be
""evidence to the contrary"", then the presumption would be useless,
since it could always be rebutted.

 

LX.             Arbour J.A. dealt with this by
saying, at pp. 238-39, that:

 

                   Scientific
evidence tending to show that in all cases the blood alcohol content two hours
before the test is not likely to be the same as the level recorded by the
machine would not constitute ""evidence to the contrary"" within the
meaning of the section.  This is because it would merely be tendered to show
that the presumption is a fiction, that it is ill-conceived and that it should
therefore not be applied. In the words of Beetz J. in Moreau, supra,
at p. 271 S.C.R., p. 533 C.C.C., such evidence would be aimed not at
""rebutting the presumption ... but at denying its very existence"".

 

LXI.            The effect of normal biological
processes of absorption and elimination of alcohol cannot of and by itself
constitute ""evidence to the contrary"", because Parliament can be
assumed to have known that blood alcohol levels constantly change, yet it saw
fit to implement the presumption.  Therefore, as Arbour J.A. states, to permit
this to become ""evidence to the contrary"" would, in effect, be
nothing more than an attack on the presumption itself by showing that it is a
legal fiction and therefore should never be applied. In my view, such an attack
on the presumption should not be allowed.

 

V. Conclusion

 

LXII.           In conclusion, I would not expect that
many people would likely drink an alcoholic beverage as the accused did in this
case.  Indeed, such individuals may be risking charges for obstruction of
justice, but it is not necessary for me to express any opinion on this matter.

 

LXIII.          In the result, I would agree with
Arbour J.A. in dissent in the Court of Appeal, and with the trial judge and the
summary conviction appeal judge, and hold that the evidence that the accused
drank the two small bottles of vodka is ""evidence to the contrary""
within the meaning of s. 258(1) (c).  Therefore, the Crown cannot rely on
the presumption that her blood alcohol level at the time of the testing was the
same as her blood alcohol level at the time of the offence.  Since there was no
other evidence establishing her blood alcohol level at the time of the offence,
she must be acquitted.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, and restore the acquittal.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé J.//

 

                   The reasons of La
Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

LXIV.         L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting) -- Can a person who voluntarily consumes alcohol (or
claims to have consumed alcohol) after driving yet before providing a
breathalyzer sample to police rely on evidence of this fact, per se, as
""evidence to the contrary"" to rebut the presumption in s. 258(1) (c)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ?  I must respectfully
disagree with my colleague's approach to this problem, as well as with his
conclusion.  I believe that there exists a third possible interpretation of
""evidence to the contrary"" in s. 258(1) (c) which it is open
for this Court to accept: that ""evidence to the contrary"" of the presumption
in s. 258(1) (c) is evidence which tends to show that there is a legally
material difference between the accused's blood alcohol level at the time
of testing and at the time of the offence.

 

LXV.           In my opinion, the distinction between
the ""presumption of identity"" and the ""presumption of
accuracy"" is an exercise in hairsplitting which runs contrary to the
essential purpose of this provision of the Criminal Code , to the past
jurisprudence of this Court, and to important policy considerations.  If
evidence of the fact of post-driving drinking is, indeed, all that is needed to
prevent the Crown from relying on the presumption in s. 258(1) (c), it
will either oblige the Crown to rely in all such cases on less precise evidence
of impairment or, alternatively, increase considerably the time and expense of
proceeding on an ""over 80"" charge by making it necessary for the
Crown to adduce expert toxicological evidence as part of its case against the
accused.  With respect, I believe that such a conclusion cannot possibly be
consistent with the spirit of the law, given the clear mischief that s. 258 of
the Code is intended to address.

 

I.  Relevant statutory provisions

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

                   253.  Every one commits an offence who
operates a motor vehicle or vessel or operates or assists in the operation
of an aircraft or of railway equipment or has the care or control of a motor
vehicle, vessel, aircraft or railway equipment, whether it is in motion or not,

 

(a)
while the person's ability to operate the vehicle, vessel, aircraft or
railway equipment is impaired by alcohol or a drug; or

 

(b)
having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in the
person's blood exceeds eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres
of blood.

 

                          258. (1) In any proceedings under
subsection 255(1) in respect of an offence committed under section 253 
or in any proceedings under subsection 255(2) or (3),

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(c)
where samples of the  breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a
demand made under subsection 254(3), if

 

(i)
[not in force]

 

(ii)
each sample was taken as soon as practicable after the time when the offence
was alleged to have been committed and, in the case of the first sample, not
later than two hours after that time, with an interval of at least fifteen
minutes between the times when the samples were taken,

 

(iii)
each sample was received from the accused directly into an approved container
or into an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician, and

 

(iv)
an analysis of each sample was made by means of an approved instrument operated
by a qualified technician, 

 

evidence
of the results of the analyses so made is, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, proof that the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the accused
at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was, where the results of the analyses
are the same, the concentration determined by the analyses and, where
the results of the analyses are different, the lowest of the concentrations
determined by the analyses; [Emphasis added.]

 

II.  Facts and Judgments

 

LXVI.         The facts of this case are compellingly
straightforward.  The appellant, Ms. St. Pierre, was stopped at approximately 1
a.m. by an officer who observed her driving erratically.  The officer
ascertained that she was intoxicated and asked that she provide a roadside
breath sample.  After three unsuccessful attempts, she provided a sample and
registered a fail on the ALERT test.  The officer issued a breathalyzer demand
and took her to the police station.  As the breathalyzer operator was occupied
with another driver, the appellant had to wait approximately one hour for her
testing session.  She used the washroom three times prior to taking the test. 
Both breathalyzer readings, taken 20 minutes apart, yielded a result of 180 mg
of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  Shortly after taking the second of the
breathalyzer tests, as she was being fingerprinted, the appellant showed two
empty 50 ml vodka bottles to the police officer and said that she had consumed
them while in the washroom.

 

LXVII.        At trial, the Crown sought to prove its
case that the appellant was ""over 80"" by relying on the breathalyzer
results and the evidence of the police officer.  The evidence of the two 50 ml
bottles was introduced at trial during the examination in chief of the
officer.  The officer testified that the bottles contained no residue, and did
not smell of vodka.  The Crown did not call an expert to bolster its case,
arguing that if the accused wished to rely on the fact of post-driving drinking
as ""evidence to the contrary"" of the presumption in s. 258(1) (c),
she had to adduce some evidence that would tend to show that, were it not for
the post-driving drinking, her blood alcohol level could have been below the
prescribed legal limit.  The accused did not testify.  O'Reilly J. granted
defence counsel's motion for a directed verdict following the close of the
Crown's case and the appellant was acquitted.  On the Crown's summary
conviction appeal, the trial judge's verdict was upheld: (1991), 30 M.V.R. (2d)
13.

 

LXVIII.       On a further appeal by the Crown to the
Ontario Court of Appeal, (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 215, Galligan J.A., writing for
the majority, stated that the decision of this Court in R. v. Crosthwait,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 1089, was determinative of this issue in that ""evidence to
the contrary"" must tend to show that the accused's blood alcohol
concentration was within permissible limits at the time in question.  Arbour
J.A., in dissent, held that evidence demonstrating any difference between the
accused's blood alcohol concentration at the time of the offence and the
breathalyzer reading at the time of the sample was sufficient to constitute
""evidence to the contrary"" of the presumption in s. 258(1) (c). 
In her view, it was not necessary for the appellant to adduce any evidence
suggesting that she could have been below the legal limit were it not for the
alcohol she had allegedly consumed after driving.  As such, even evidence
demonstrating a difference of ""no particular magnitude"" would suffice
to preclude the Crown from relying on that presumption.  

 

III.  Analysis

 

LXIX.         My colleague advances several arguments
in support of the conclusion that any credible evidence of post-driving
drinking will rebut the presumption in s. 258(1) (c).  He first adopts
the distinction drawn by Arbour J.A. between the ""presumption of
accuracy"" and the ""presumption of identity"".  He next argues
that this Court's previous decisions in R. v. Moreau, [1979] 1 S.C.R.
261, and R. v. Crosthwait, supra, are distinguishable from the
case at bar.  He then urges a ""plain meaning"" interpretation of s.
258(1) (c).  He finishes by noting concerns that any interpretation other
than his might fall afoul of the presumption of innocence, or operate unjustly
where the accused has been charged with impaired driving under s. 253 (a)
rather than with being ""over 80"" contrary to s. 253 (b).  I
shall address each of these arguments in turn, although not necessarily in the
same order, and demonstrate why I believe the correct interpretation of s.
258(1) (c) to be that which I outline above.

 

1.  Prior Jurisprudence:  R. v.
Moreau and R. v. Crosthwait

 

LXX.           The phrase ""evidence to the
contrary"" in s. 258(1) (c) was already twice the focus of this Court's
attention.  In my opinion, R. v. Moreau and R. v. Crosthwait
squarely apply.

 

LXXI.         In Moreau, an accused failed a
breathalyzer test with a reading of 90 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  He
was, in other words, just 10 mg over the legal limit.  He adduced expert
evidence to the effect that all Borkenstein Breathalyzers (the machine which
had recorded his result) were inaccurate within 10 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of
blood, and argued that this evidence constituted ""evidence to the
contrary"" of the presumption set out in what is now s. 258(1) (c). 
The Court rejected that argument on the basis that such evidence was aimed not
at rebutting the presumption but at defeating the scheme established by
Parliament.  What is more significant for our purposes, however, is the
majority's explanation of the meaning of the phrase ""evidence to the
contrary"".  Beetz J., at p. 271,  defined that phrase by citing with
approval the following passage from the judgment of McFarlane J.A. in R. v.
Davis (1973), 14 C.C.C. (2d) 513 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 516:

 

While
not expressed too clearly, I think the intention of Parliament becomes manifest
when it is remembered that the fact to be proved is the proportion of alcohol
to blood at the time of the offence.  The result of the chemical analysis is
one method of proving that fact:  and the certificates are evidence, inter
alia, of that result.  It follows, in my opinion, that the concluding part
of the subsection means that the result of the chemical analysis is proof of
the proportion of alcohol to blood at the time of the offence in the absence
of evidence that the proportion at that time did not exceed 80 to 100.  Any
evidence, therefore, tending to show that at the time of the offence the
proportion was within the permitted limits is ""evidence to the
contrary"" within the meaning of the subsection. [Emphasis added by Beetz
J.] 

 

Beetz J. then made the following
observation, at p. 271:

 

                   In
order to comply with the wording of the Code, ""evidence to the
contrary"" has to be evidence which tends to establish that the proportion
of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the offence was alleged
to have been committed was not the same as that indicated by the result of the
chemical analysis.

 

The apparent inconsistency between
these two passages has spawned a lively debate as to the true meaning of
""evidence to the contrary"" in s. 258(1)(c) of the Code. 
The second passage is relied upon by the appellant in support of her argument
that ""evidence to the contrary"" need not be capable of showing that
the accused was actually under the legal limit at the time of the offence.

 

LXXII.        Reading these two passages in the factual
and legal context in which they arose, however, demonstrates in my opinion that
Beetz J.'s remarks do not support the appellant's argument.  It must be
recalled that the accused was only 10 mg over the prescribed legal limit.  As
such, the expert evidence of a 10 mg margin of error in breathalyzers could be
seen as ""tending to show that at the time of the offence the proportion
was within the permitted limits"" (p. 271).  Put another way, a trier of
fact faced with this evidence could have entertained a reasonable doubt that
the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was within legal
limits.  Given that the accused's evidence appeared to satisfy this initial
threshold, Beetz J. therefore had to make it clear that ""evidence to the
contrary"" could not be general in nature, but must also relate to
the blood alcohol level of the particular accused.  He therefore
elaborated at p. 271 on his previous definition of what constitutes
""evidence to the contrary"" by stating that such evidence also must be

 

...evidence
which tends to establish that the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the
accused at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was
not the same as that indicated by the result of the chemical analysis.
[Emphasis added.]

 

He went on to note that the evidence
adduced did not relate to the accused, and therefore did not constitute
""evidence to the contrary"":

 

There
is no such evidence in the case at bar.  Apart from the certificates, there is
no evidence of any kind directed at showing what was the proportion of alcohol in
the blood of the accused at the time when the offence was alleged to have
been committed. [Emphasis added.]

 

In other words, Beetz J. concluded
that general challenges to the breathalyzer scheme did not tend to show that
this particular accused's blood alcohol level was any different at the
time of the alleged offence, and that such evidence could not, as a matter of
law, constitute ""evidence to the contrary"" because it did not relate
to the particular accused.  There is no ambiguity.  Moreau set
down a clear, two-part standard.  The confusion that followed stemmed from the
fact that many did not read Beetz J.'s comments in their proper context -- i.e.
in light of the fact that the expert evidence in that case pointed to a
discrepancy which could otherwise have brought the accused's blood alcohol
level down to within the legal limit.

 

LXXIII.       If any doubts as to the meaning of the
phrase ""evidence to the contrary"" in s. 258(1) (c) remained
after Moreau, however, they were resolved once and for all in Crosthwait,
decided some two years later.  Crosthwait raised the question of whether
expert evidence that the particular breathalyzer in question was not operated
properly -- and therefore may have been inaccurate -- constituted
""evidence to the contrary"" of the presumption in s. 258(1) (c). 
Pigeon J., for the Court, rejected that argument in the following terms (at p.
1101):

 

Mere
possibility of some inaccuracy will not assist the accused.  What is necessary
to furnish evidence to the contrary is some evidence which would tend to show
an inaccuracy in the breathalyzer or in the manner of its operation on the
occasion in question of such a degree and nature that it could affect the
result of the analysis to the extent that it would leave a doubt as to the
blood alcohol content of the accused person being over the allowable maximum.
[Emphasis added.]

 

It appears that Pigeon J. essentially
combined the two thresholds proposed by Beetz J. in Moreau into one: the
alleged discrepancy must tend to show that the accused's blood alcohol level
could have been below the legal limit at the time of the offence, and
the evidence must relate to the particular accused's blood alcohol level,
rather than to the scheme in general.

 

LXXIV.       The majority of the Court of Appeal in the
present case concluded, at p. 223, that this Court's judgments in Moreau
and Crosthwait were dispositive of the appeal:

 

I
think it must be taken as having been settled by the Supreme Court of Canada
that, in order for evidence to amount legally to ""evidence to the
contrary"" as that expression is used in s. 258(1) (c), the evidence
must tend to show that at the time of the alleged offence the accused person's
blood alcohol level did not exceed 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.

 

On the other hand, Arbour J.A., in
dissent, sought to distinguish these two cases from situations such as the
present one involving post-driving drinking.  Arbour J.A. identified a
distinction between what she refers to as the ""presumption of accuracy""
and the ""presumption of identity"".  It is to this question that I now
turn.

 

2.  The ""Presumption of
Accuracy"" and the ""Presumption of Identity""

 

LXXV.        According to Arbour J.A., the
""presumption of accuracy"" refers to the presumption that the
breathalyzer device correctly reflects the accused's actual blood alcohol level
at the time of the test.  The ""presumption of identity"", on the other
hand, refers to the presumption that the accused's blood alcohol level at the
time of the test is the same as that at the time of the offence.  To the extent
that Moreau and Crosthwait stand for the proposition that
""evidence to the contrary"" is only that which tends to show that the
accused's blood alcohol level at the time of driving was below 80 mg per 100 ml
of blood, it is argued that these two authorities do not govern a situation
where it is not the accuracy of the particular breathalyzer results that is
questioned (i.e. the presumption of accuracy) but rather the presumption that
these results reflect the blood alcohol level at the time of driving (i.e. the
presumption of identity).

 

LXXVI.       It is argued that these two presumptions
are not inconsistent because they flow from different provisions in the Code. 
The ""presumption of accuracy"" is said to flow from s. 258(1) (g),
whereas the ""presumption of identity"" is said to flow from s. 258(1) (c). 
With all due respect, I believe this interpretation to be incorrect.  In fact,
to invoke an argument that my colleague, himself, relies upon in his reasons, I
believe that it defies the ""plain wording"" of the two provisions. 
Section 258(1) (g) reads:

 

(g)
where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand
made under subsection 254(3), a certificate of a qualified technician
stating

 

                   (i)
that the analysis of each of the samples has been made by means of an approved
instrument operated by the technician and ascertained by the technician to be
in proper working order by means of an alcohol standard, identified in the
certificate, that is suitable for use with an approved instrument,

 

                   (ii)
the results of the analyses so made, and

 

                   (iii)
if the samples were taken by the technician,

 

                          (A)
[not in force]

 

                          (B)
the time when and place where each sample and any specimen described in clause
(A) was taken, and

 

                          (C)
that each sample was received from the accused directly into an approved
container or into an approved instrument operated by the technician, 

 

is
evidence of the facts alleged in the certificate without proof of the signature
or the official character of the person appearing to have signed the
certificate;
[Emphasis added.]

 

LXXVII.     Section 258(1) (g), taken together
with s. 25(1)  of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21 , is said
to create a presumption that the reading registered on the breathalyzer is an
accurate determination of the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the
testing.  It is therefore concluded that the certificate is evidence proving
the accused's actual blood alcohol level.  My reading of s. 258(1) (g),
however, is different.  Section 258(1) (g) only deems ""the facts
alleged in the certificate"" to represent, inter alia, the ""results
of the analyses so made"" (s. 258(1) (g)(ii)) (emphasis added). 
For lack of a better term, I would refer to this presumption as the
""presumption of the continuity of the evidence"".  This presumption is
very different from the ""presumption of accuracy"", since the latter
presumes that the results of the analysis are equal to the accused's actual
blood alcohol level at the time of testing.  There is no reference in s.
258(1) (g), however, to ""actual blood alcohol level"".  Put
another way, s. 258(1) (g) is nothing more than a documentary exception
to the hearsay rule (see also Martin's Annual Criminal Code 1995,
synopsis of s. 258 ).  ""Evidence to the contrary"" of s. 258(1) (g)
(pursuant to s. 25(1)  of the Interpretation Act ) would only be evidence
that tends to show that the information in the certificate is not
reflective of the actual results indicated by the breathalyzer (i.e. the
technician who administered the test reported the machine's result to the
accused as being 120 mg, and yet the certificate shows the accused's blood
alcohol level as being 220 mg).  With respect, the plain wording of s. 258(1) (g)
simply does not support my colleague's explanation of its evidentiary effects.

 

LXXVIII.    Moreover, I believe that my interpretation of
the evidentiary effect of s. 258(1) (c) is identical to that adopted by
Pigeon J. for the Court in Crosthwait.  Namely, Pigeon J. refused, at p.
1099, to find as an implicit condition of s. 237(1) (f) (now s. 258(1) (g))
a requirement that the breathalyzer instrument be shown to be working properly:

 

                   In
the instant case, the certificate filed at the trial fully complies with the
conditions stated in para. (f).  It was, therefore, by itself,
evidence of the results of the analyses.  With respect, I cannot agree that
there is another implicit condition namely, that the instrument used must be
shown to have been functioning properly....  The presumption [that the
breathalyzer result is accurate] may no doubt be rebutted by evidence that the
instrument used was not functioning properly but the certificate cannot be
rejected on that account. [Emphasis added.]

 

A requirement that the instrument be
shown to be in working order is integral to the ""presumption of
accuracy"".  If that requirement is not implicit in s. 258(1) (g),
then it follows that the ""presumption of accuracy"" cannot reside
there either.  Pigeon J. goes on at pp. 1100-1101 to conclude that where an
accused is seeking to challenge the accuracy of the breathalyzer on the basis
that the breathalyzer device was inaccurate, then this challenge must come
within the rubric of ""evidence to the contrary"" in s. 258(1) (c)
(then s. 237(1) (c)).  I am therefore in respectful disagreement with my
colleague's conclusion as to the significance of Crosthwait to the
present appeal.

 

LXXIX.       An examination of s. 258(1) (c), by
contrast, reveals it to be the source of both of Arbour J.A.'s presumptions. 
Section 258(1) (c) reads:

 

(c) where
samples of the  breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand made
under subsection 254(3), if

 

                   (i)
[not in force]

 

                   (ii)
each sample was taken as soon as practicable after the time when the offence
was alleged to have been committed and, in the case of the first sample, not
later than two hours after that time, with an interval of at least fifteen
minutes between the times when the samples were taken,

 

                   (iii)
each sample was received from the accused directly into an approved container
or into an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician, and

 

                   (iv)
an analysis of each sample was made by means of an approved instrument operated
by a qualified technician, 

 

evidence
of the results of the analyses so made is, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, proof that the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the accused
at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was, where the results of the analyses
are the same, the concentration determined by the analyses and, where
the results of the analyses are different, the lowest of the concentrations
determined by the analyses; [Emphasis added.]

 

Section 258(1) (c) presumes
breathalyzer results taken at a later point in time to equal actual
blood alcohol levels at the time of the offence.  ""Evidence to the
contrary"" of the presumption is evidence which will tend to negate either
(1) the presumption that the breathalyzer result is an acceptably accurate
indicator of the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the test; or
(2) the presumption that the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the
test is acceptably representative of his blood alcohol level at the time of the
offence.  The failure of either of these links breaks the logical chain
and removes from the Crown the comfort and convenience of relying on the
presumption.  Both of these logical links are contained within s. 258(1) (c).

 

LXXX.        I therefore conclude, on the basis of my
examination of both the plain wording of s. 258(1) (c) and (g) and
this Court's ruling in Crosthwait, that both the ""presumption of
accuracy"" and the ""presumption of identity"" actually flow from
the same provision:  s. 258(1) (c).  Given that both presumptions
actually relate to the same phrase in the same provision in the Code, I
am most unconvinced that it is still tenable to conclude that ""evidence to
the contrary"" can give rise to two completely different legal standards of
proof in relation to the same charge.

 

3.  The Plain Language of s.
258(1) (c)

 

LXXXI.       The appellant argues that s. 258(1) (c)
makes no mention of a requirement that the accused must show that he was not
over .08 for the presumption not to apply, and that this Court should reject
Galligan J.A.'s interpretation of ""evidence to the contrary"" in s.
258(1) (c) on the basis that it is not supported by the plain wording of
that provision.  It is further submitted that the plain meaning of s. 258(1) (c)
requires only that an accused adduce evidence that there is a difference, of no
particular magnitude, between the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of
testing and at the time of the offence.  At the same time, the authority of
this Court's decisions in Moreau and Crosthwait is accepted for
the proposition that challenges to the ""presumption of accuracy"" will
only be ""evidence to the contrary"" if they are capable of
demonstrating that the accused's blood level could have been below the legal
limit.

 

LXXXII.     I am unable to reconcile such inconsistency
between the ""presumption of accuracy"" and the ""presumption of
identity"", given that they both flow from the same phrase in the same
provision.  How can one conclude that the plain meaning of s. 258(1) (c)
must prevail in the context of the ""presumption of identity"" and yet
that it need not prevail with respect to the ""presumption of
accuracy""?  On the ""plain meaning"" of s. 258(1) (c),
evidence indicating that the particular breathalyzer test was inaccurate (i.e.
rebutting the ""presumption of accuracy"") is just as
""contrary"" to the presumption set out in s. 258(1) (c) as
evidence ""of no particular magnitude"" rebutting the ""presumption
of identity"".  On a consistent reading, evidence of either event
should disentitle the Crown from relying on that presumption.  Yet this Court
in Crosthwait effectively rejected one possible interpretation of s.
258(1) (c) -- the ""plain meaning"" approach advocated by the
appellant -- and adopted an interpretation that was more consistent with the
spirit of the law, having regard to the mischief which the legislation was
intended to address, as well as with the spirit and purpose of the presumption.

 

LXXXIII.    I believe that the distinction between the
""presumption of identity"" and the ""presumption of accuracy""
is artificial and unnecessary, given that both spring from the identical phrase
in the identical provision in the Code.  This Court should either
explicitly overrule Moreau and Crosthwait, and apply the same
""plain language"" standard across the board, or recognize that they
are still good law and apply them to the case at hand.  To accept one standard
for the former presumption and another, higher standard for the latter presumption
is needlessly confusing.  I believe, moreover, that effect can be given to an
equally viable ""plain meaning"" interpretation of s. 258(1) (c)
that uses a single legal standard for all circumstances, and that is completely
consistent with both Moreau and Crosthwait.  I will elaborate
below on why I prefer to define ""evidence to the contrary"" in s.
258(1) (c) as evidence which tends to show that there is a legally
material difference between the accused's blood alcohol level at the time
of testing and at the time of the offence.  What is legally material will, in
turn, depend on the charge in relation to which the Crown seeks to invoke the
benefit of the presumption in s. 258(1) (c).

 

4.  Requiring Legal Materiality to
Avoid Clear Absurdities

 

LXXXIV.    ""Plain meaning"" must not be used as
an end in itself, particularly where it inevitably leads to absurd results
which must be inconsistent with what Parliament would have intended.  The
thoughts of Justice Shamgar, President of the Supreme Court of Israel (as
reproduced in Selected Judgments of the Supreme Court of Israel, vol.
VIII (1992), at p. 263) strike me as particularly insightful:

 

...
language does not govern the purpose, rather it serves it.  The law is an
instrument for realizing legal policy, and therefore interpretation needs to
aim toward emancipating the wording from its semantic bonds, were these to
distance it from the legislative purpose which the words are intended to
realize.

 

""Under a purposive approach, the
court defers to the legislature not by decoding its language but by ensuring
that its plans are carried out"": Driedger on the Construction of
Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), at p. 35.  The absurdity that flows from a
""plain meaning"" approach to s. 258(1) (c) is borne out in
several possible contexts, all of which strongly suggest that a narrow
interpretation of the wording of s. 258(1) (c) distances us from the
legislative purpose and intent rather than bringing us closer.

 

LXXXV.     There are four basic means by which an
accused may seek to adduce ""evidence to the contrary"" within the
meaning of s. 258(1) (c):

 

1.Evidence
that the breathalyzer machine's results were in error and that a proper result
would have been less than 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood;

 

2.the
""Carter defence"" -- i.e. the accused disputes the accuracy of
the breathalyzer reading on the basis of what he or she had to drink prior to
driving (usually combined with evidence of a forensic toxicologist);

 

3.the
""last drink"" defence -- i.e. the accused alleges that his or her
pattern of alcohol consumption was such that the blood alcohol concentration
was still rising at the time he or she was driving and that it had not yet
exceeded 80 mg in 100 ml of blood;

 

4.the
""drinking after driving"" defence -- i.e. the accused alleges that he
or she consumed alcohol after driving but before the samples were taken.

 

(See S. Porter, ""`Evidence to the
Contrary' in Drinking and Driving Cases"" (1994), 5 J.M.V.L. 277, at
pp. 278-79.)  Questions going to the ""presumption of identity"" arise
in the third and fourth instances.  If this Court were to accept the
appellant's suggested approach to the presumption in s. 258(1) (c), then
it would suffice in the fourth instance for an accused to adduce credible
evidence of any amount of post-driving drinking, no matter how little, in order
to rebut the presumption.  As such, if it is credibly asserted that a 200-pound
man who has blown twice the legal limit on the breathalyzer test had consumed
half a beer after driving but before taking the breathalyzer, a court would
have to find that evidence of this consumption of alcohol is ""evidence to
the contrary"" of the presumption contained in s. 258(1) (c), and
would have to conclude that the Crown can no longer rely on that presumption. 
The same result would inure, for that matter, if an individual testified to
having taken even a single swallow from a flask in his pocket.  The Crown would
then have to undertake the time and expense of calling an expert toxicologist
to testify to the fact that the effect of the minimal quantity of alcohol
consumed after driving would not have been significant enough, given the
accused's sex, weight and size, to raise a possibility that the accused's blood
alcohol would have been under the legal limit were it not for the additional
alcohol.  All of this extra time and expense would be precipitated by evidence
which an accused need not even show is capable of being legally material
to the outcome of the charge.

 

LXXXVI.    Even more absurd, however, is the application
of the appellant's suggested approach to the third type of defence mentioned
above -- the ""last drink"" defence.  As I understand the implications
of that approach, an accused need only adduce evidence of having consumed one
or several drinks in rapid succession immediately before embarking in his
vehicle in order to rebut the presumption in s. 258(1) (c).  No expert
evidence would be necessary.  This conclusion flows irrevocably from two
premises: (1) the fact that judicial notice can be taken of the basic fact that
alcohol consumption will, over time, raise blood alcohol level (see Batley
v. The Queen (1985), 32 M.V.R. 257 (Sask. C.A.)) and (2) the fact that the
""presumption of identity"" would be rebutted by any credible
evidence (other than evidence about the normal fluctuations involved in
metabolizing alcohol) which tends to show that the breathalyzer result may be
unrepresentative of the accused's blood alcohol level at the time of the
offence.  

LXXXVII.   In fact, in such cases, it would be to the
accused's benefit not to adduce expert evidence, since the Crown would
inevitably cross-examine that expert and, should it turn out that in the
expert's opinion, the amount of alcohol consumed was incapable of lowering the
accused's blood alcohol level below the legal limit, then the Crown could use
the expert's evidence to overcome the fact that it cannot rely on the
presumption in s. 258(1) (c).  If, on the other hand, an accused simply
shows up with witnesses willing to support his story of recent alcohol
consumption, then the Crown will face three alternatives: (1) it can try to
find its own expert toxicologist who is available to testify on the spur of the
moment; (2) it can ask for an adjournment in order to obtain this expert at a
later date; or (3) it can withdraw the charges.  Both the first and second
alternatives are costly and time-consuming.  The third alternative will be an
all-too-easy escape route for Crowns whose dockets are already filled to
overflowing with drinking and driving cases.

 

LXXXVIII. Moreover, as I have already mentioned,
preserving the distinction between the ""presumption of accuracy"" and
the ""presumption of identity""  would result in different standards as
to what constituted ""evidence to the contrary"" stemming from the very
same provision of the Code.  If an accused were to allege that the
particular breathalyzer test was improperly administered and therefore
materially inaccurate, then he must provide evidence capable of raising a
reasonable doubt that his blood level was below the legal limit at the time of
the offence.  If, on the other hand, he were to invoke the ""last drink
defence"" or the ""drinking after driving defence"", then there
would be no obligation on him to show that this evidence, if believed, was
capable of raising a reasonable doubt that he was under the legal limit at the
time of the offence.  If he were to raise both defences, then the trial court
would have to wrestle with two completely different evidentiary standards in
relation to the same provision and the same charge.  Such an implication
strikes me as highly incongruous.  Surely this is an untenable approach, which
could not possibly have been intended by Parliament.

 

LXXXIX.    I believe that we need not even look beyond
the confines of the present appeal to find absurdities in the interpretation
suggested by the appellant.  At the close of the Crown's case, the trial judge
remarked upon the fact that he was acquitting the appellant even though he was
fully aware of the fact that the alcohol which the appellant claimed to have
consumed would not have affected her blood alcohol concentration enough to
raise a doubt that it was below the legal limit at the time of the offence:

 

Maybe
I am misunderstanding something but the Crown has adduced evidence in this case
that empty alcohol bottles were found on Mrs. St. Pierre's person and the Crown
sought to introduce a statement made by her that she had consumed alcohol from
those bottles after driving, and before giving the tests.

 

                                                                   .
. .

  

And
in the absence of a forensic toxicologist, who could tell me that 100
millilitres of vodka, rum, or any standard alcohol would not reduce 180
milligrams percent to below 80 milligrams percent?  I mean, we both know
that as a matter of reality, but I do not know that judicially. [Emphasis
added.]

 

Imposing a burden on the Crown to
adduce expert toxicological evidence in circumstances where, practically
speaking, there is not even an air of reality to the accused's defence seems
clearly at odds with the mischief that Parliament meant to address by way of
this presumption.  More significantly, it seems clearly at odds with the way in
which we generally treat evidentiary onuses on an accused to permit such an
onus to be displaced by evidence that is actually legally immaterial to the
outcome.

 

XC.             Parliament enacted the presumption
in s. 258(1) (c) in clear recognition of the difficulty and expense of
requiring expert evidence in virtually every alcohol-related driving offence. 
In Canada in 1992 alone, police recorded 132,377 impaired driving incidents, of
which 105,766 persons were charged with impaired driving related offences:
""Impaired Driving -- Canada, 1992"" (1994), 14:5 Juristat 1. 
The enormous burden on our court system posed by these offences must be
appreciated.  The presumption in s. 258(1) (c) is an important means by
which Parliament has sought to address this problem.  The presumption strikes a
fair balance between collective and individual interests by permitting the efficient
and effective enforcement of impaired driving laws in a way that does not in
any material sense prejudice the right of individual accused to a full and fair
trial.  I therefore cannot accept that Parliament could have intended this
presumption to be suspended in every case where the accused invokes either the
""last drink"" defence or the ""post-driving drinking""
defence, where there is not even an iota of proof to suggest that the
discrepancy occasioned by the alcohol consumption would be of any legal
relevance to conviction or acquittal on a charge of ""over 80"", and
where the only effect in the vast majority of cases is to increase the time and
expense of successful prosecution.  To adopt the approach suggested by the
appellant would be to disregard that clear intention.

 

XCI.            If ever a case existed for rejecting
a tightly tailored ""plain meaning"" approach in the face of
consequences that are both absurd and contrary to the spirit and purpose of the
law, it is raised in the present appeal.  Of course, it is not for a court to
second-guess the wisdom of the legislature since, subject to constitutional
constraints, the legislature is entitled to legislate irrationally if it so
chooses.  Nonetheless, this Court should not adopt an interpretation of s.
258(1) (c) that would lead to absurd consequences when the mischief
intended to be addressed is so poignantly clear (see Driedger, supra,
at pp. 80-99).  The wording of the provision, while not a model of clarity, can
be reasonably and purposively interpreted when placed within its proper
context.  Parliament could not have intended to be more lenient toward
individual drivers who, intentionally or not, act in such a way as to defeat
the very purpose of the scheme intended by Parliament to regulate their
potentially dangerous behaviour.

 

XCII.          This Court has on previous occasions
eschewed reliance on the ""plain meaning"" of provisions in the Criminal
Code  in instances where adopting that interpretation would frustrate
Parliamentary intent in an absurd and obviously unintended manner.  It would be
breaking no new ground to adopt a similar position in the present case.

 

XCIII.         In R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R.
3, this Court was called upon to interpret the meaning of former s. 586 of the Code,
which imposed a corroboration requirement on unsworn children's evidence.  The
plain meaning of that section appeared to require that the corroborative
evidence must, itself, implicate the accused.  Wilson J., speaking for the
Court, rejected this interpretation, notwithstanding the fact that it flowed
from the plain meaning of the provision.  She turned to a purposive analysis of
s. 586 and interpreted the provision ""liberally"" to mean that the
only evidence required was evidence that tended to demonstrate the truth of the
child's story (at pp. 28-29).  In the face of a ""plain meaning""
reading that seemed to defy both common sense and the purpose and intent of the
legislation, this Court adopted an interpretation that was consistent with the
mischief Parliament sought to avoid and yet that did not render the accused's
trial unfair.

 

XCIV.         In R. v. Penno, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
865, this Court was asked to clarify whether former s. 234(1) of the Code,
which made it an offence to assume care or control of a motor vehicle while
impaired, could operate in an instance where the accused claimed to be so
intoxicated that he recalled nothing of the events.  Arguably, the ordinary
meaning of ""care and control"" within its immediate context would
dictate the conclusion that an individual cannot have care or control if they
are too drunk to have such a capability.  McLachlin J. rejected such an
approach in the following terms (at pp. 899-900):

 

Impairment
being an essential element of the crime, it is illogical and contradictory to
suppose that Parliament intended that its express aim of making such impairment
criminal should be defeated by an unexpressed implication of law that the same
impairment may provide an effective defence.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   Failure
to recognize the inherent contradiction involved in the proposition that an
essential element of an offence may also be a defence leads to absurdity.  It
leads, for example, to the conclusion that the more impaired a person is, the
more likely he or she is to be acquitted of the offence of impaired driving. 
That a person should be too impaired to be convicted of impaired driving strikes
most people as ridiculous.  It represents, in short, a contradiction in terms.

 

 

I query whether it would not also
strike most people as ridiculous that a person who claims to have consumed
alcohol in the police station before submitting herself to a breathalyzer test
should be able to rely on that evidence, without taking any steps to show its
legal materiality, as a defence to a charge of driving ""over 80"",
requiring the Crown to adduce the expert evidence of a forensic toxicologist or
to proceed upon the less precise charge of impaired driving.

 

XCV.          Most recently, in R. v. Heywood,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 761, Gonthier J., dissenting, declined to follow the ordinary
meaning of the word ""loiter"", as it was used in s. 179(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code .  Rather, having regard to the legislative history,
the context, and the purpose of the legislation -- which was to protect
children against the material risk of recidivism in those convicted of sexual
assaults -- he concluded that ""loiter"" must include some element of
malevolent or ulterior purpose.  His reading of this term permitted him to find
that s. 179(1) (b) did not violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms .

 

XCVI.         I would note, as well, that references
in s. 258(1) (c) to actual blood alcohol levels, although legally
irrelevant for the purposes of conviction on an ""over 80"" charge, can
nonetheless have meaningful sentencing implications with respect to such
prosecutions.  If there were no legislative presumption that properly
administered breathalyzer results were retroactively accurate to the time of
the offence, or if s. 258(1) (c) only presumed the breathalyzer result to
be sufficiently accurate to determine that the accused was over the legal limit,
then it would follow that the Crown could not point to extremely high levels of
intoxication as an aggravating factor in sentencing unless it first adduced
expert evidence to prove the accuracy of the breathalyzer result as a measure
of the accused's alcohol level at the time of the offence.  Requiring such
expert evidence, however, would be both time-consuming and costly, and would
once again frustrate the very mischief that Parliament sought to avoid by way
of the presumption in the first place.  I think that this is a pertinent
consideration, however, which may partly explain why Parliament chose to
formulate this presumption in terms of actual blood alcohol levels rather than
in terms of whether the accused was presumably over or under the legally prescribed
limit. A preferable approach, in my view, would be to acknowledge that although
a discrepancy may not be legally material to conviction, it may nonetheless be
a legitimate consideration at the sentencing stage.

 

XCVII.        As such, in respect of a charge of
""over 80"" under s. 253(b) of the Code, I approve the
reasoning of Galligan J.A., speaking for the majority of the Ontario Court of
Appeal, at p. 230:

 

                   The
offence created by s. 253 (b) is driving with a blood alcohol concentration
of more than 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.  A conviction will result if
the concentration is over 80 and an acquittal if it is not.  There is no
obligation to establish the precise amount above 80 in order to prove the
offence.  So long as the concentration is over 80, the offence is established
and it is legally immaterial, for purposes of conviction by how much the
offence exceeds 80.  Thus, so long as it is over 80, the exact concentration
is legally immaterial.  I must then ask, did Parliament intend to provide a
presumption to prove the offence or to prove the exact amount by which the
driver was over 80?  The answer seems to me to be obvious.  Parliament would
not have intended to provide a mechanism to prove something which is legally
immaterial.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

He then concludes at p. 231:

 

 

It
is my opinion that to permit ""evidence to the contrary"" to be
interpreted to include evidence which shows only that the concentrations at the
time of driving and testing were not the same would permit the rebuttal of the
presumption by the presentation of evidence which really only shows the
possibility of some uncertainty about that element of the scheme.

 

                   On
the other hand, evidence which tends to show that an accused, at the time of
the offence, did not have a concentration of alcohol in his or her blood
exceeding 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood ...  constitutes evidence to the
contrary because it tends to rebut the presumption and does not produce the
absurd result produced by the other interpretation.  It does not render an
important part of the scheme ineffective.

 

As I have already mentioned, however,
I wish to qualify his remarks in one very important respect.  It must be
recalled that Galligan J.A. was addressing the presumption in s. 258(1) (c)
in the context of a proceeding in which the accused was only charged with being
""over 80"", contrary to s. 253 (b).  The same can be said of
both Moreau and Crosthwait.  As such, none of the above judgments
addressed the interaction between the presumption in s. 258(1) (c) and
the offence of impaired driving under s. 253 (a).  Although this question
does not arise on the facts of the present case and was not raised by either of
the parties, it is a concern mentioned by my colleague, and I will therefore
address it briefly.

 

5.  Application of s. 258(1) (c) to
a Charge of Impaired Driving

 

XCVIII.      My colleague observes that actual blood
alcohol levels, while not relevant to an ""over 80"" charge, may be of
considerable importance where the Crown elects to proceed against the accused
on an ""impaired driving"" charge pursuant to s. 253(a) of the Code. 
Indeed, breathalyzer results are frequently used as an element of proof of
actual impairment, and a breathalyzer reading of 180 mg is no doubt greater
support for a finding of actual impairment than would be a reading of 100 mg.  
I therefore agree with Justice Iacobucci that it could operate unfairly to the
accused to hold that the presumption in s. 258(1) (c) will not be
rebutted unless the accused adduces evidence tending to show that he could be
under the legal limit.

 

XCIX.         The same concerns, however, do not flow
from my proposed interpretation of ""evidence to the contrary"" in s.
258(1) (c).  Where the Crown seeks to rely on a breathalyzer result for
the purposes of supporting an impairment charge under s. 253 (a), then
any evidence tending to raise a doubt as to impairment is legally material
(other than, of course, fluctuations relating to the normal process of
metabolizing of alcohol in blood).  In such cases, materiality may very well
depend upon factors such as the accused's actual blood alcohol level, the
degree of discrepancy alleged, and the nature and extent of the other evidence
as to impairment.  In some cases, the exact breathalyzer reading may be highly
relevant to an essential element of the offence and even small differences will
be legally material.  The same cannot be said in relation to an ""over
80"" charge.

 

C.                There is no need to give s.
258(1) (c) different meanings depending on whether it applies in
conjunction with s. 253 (a) or (b).  Rather, we need only
recognize that a provision with one meaning may have different applications to
the two different charges to which it relates.  This proposition is hardly
controversial or new.  I hasten to add that it is certainly less novel than giving
a single phrase in a single provision two different interpretations in respect
of the same charge, which is the apparent result of the distinction between the
presumptions of accuracy and identity.

 

CI.              To summarize, then, I would only
emphasize again that the presumption in s. 258(1) (c) must be interpreted
in the context of the charge in relation to which it is being invoked. 
Moreover, as I have already mentioned, although actual blood alcohol levels may
be legally immaterial to conviction, they may be relevant in the context of
sentencing.  As such, evidence which shows that the blood alcohol level of the
convicted driver was lower than the test result may be a factor to consider in
sentencing.  I do not believe it to be either contrary to Charter  values
or in any way unjust to the accused to require that ""evidence to the
contrary"" be legally material in respect of the offence with which the
accused is charged.  The onus on the accused is purely evidentiary in nature,
and flows from an interpretation of the provision which avoids patent
absurdity.

 

6.  Section 258(1) (c) and the
Presumption of Innocence

 

CII.             I would also like to address briefly
my colleague's concern that the presumption in s. 258(1) (c) not be
interpreted so as to require the accused to prove his innocence, or so as to
impose a burden upon the accused to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt
before the Crown has put forward its entire case.  If ""evidence to the
contrary"" in s. 258(1) (c) is interpreted in the manner that I
suggest, then all that is necessary for an accused to rebut this presumption
will be for that individual to point to credible evidence which tends to show
that there is a legally material difference between the accused's blood alcohol
level at the time of the offence and the result indicated by the breathalyzer
reading.

 

CIII.            In the context of an ""over
80"" charge, it will be necessary for the accused to point to credible
evidence which tends to show that his blood alcohol level could have been
under the legal limit.  This evidence will typically take the form of expert
evidence to the effect that the alcohol consumed after driving (or immediately
before embarking) would generally affect a person of the accused's sex, height
and body weight within a certain range of values.  Thus, for instance, an
accused may adduce expert evidence indicating that when the effect of alcohol
allegedly consumed after driving is subtracted from the actual blood alcohol
reading on the breathalyzer, it would bring the accused's blood alcohol level
to anywhere between 70 and 120 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  This
evidence would amount to ""evidence to the contrary"" of the
presumption in s. 258(1) (c), and the Crown would no longer be able to
rely on that presumption to prove its case against the accused.  There is no
need for the accused to demonstrate that his blood alcohol level is
actually below .08.  He need only adduce credible evidence tending to show that
this is possible under the circumstances.  He needs to show, in other words,
that the discrepancy is legally material.  The onus on the accused is strictly
evidentiary in nature, and arises as a practical consequence of the Crown
justifiably relying on the presumption in s. 258(1) (c) until the accused
adduces some evidence to show that this reliance is unjustified to a legally
material degree.

 

CIV.            In the context of an impaired driving
charge, by contrast, it will only be necessary for an accused to point to
credible evidence of an overestimation of blood alcohol level that is
sufficiently large that it tends to raise a doubt as to impairment.  As I said
earlier, the magnitude of the discrepancy required to rebut the presumption is
a determination to be made in light of the totality of the facts in each case. 
Once again, however, the important point for our purposes is that the accused
need not demonstrate that the discrepancy is large enough to disprove
impairment, but need only point to evidence that is capable of raising a
doubt as to impairment.

 

CV.             I agree that the reversal of burden
created by s. 258(1) (c) may indeed constitute a breach of s. 11 (d)
of the Charter , as suggested by my colleague, since this statutory
presumption relieves the Crown of its duty to prove independently all of the
elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, I note without
deciding that such an infringement would very likely survive Charter 
scrutiny under s. 1  as a reasonable and demonstrably justifiable limit on the
right, given the overwhelming importance of effective enforcement measures to
curb the dangers of drunk driving.

 

7.  Policy Considerations 

 

CVI.            Ultimately, this case boils down to a
question of whether we impose the burden on the Crown or on the accused to
adduce expert toxicological evidence in instances in which a driver voluntarily
consumes (or claims to have consumed) alcohol either shortly before or after
driving but before supplying a breathalyzer sample.  I cannot agree that there
is any need for two different evidentiary burdens to flow from the identical
provision, in respect to the identical charge.  Moreover, it seems anomalous to
afford the benefit of the lesser evidentiary burden to drivers who have either
wilfully consumed alcohol after being involved in an offence or who have gulped
down material quantities of alcohol and then tried to drive home before the
alcohol took effect.  In most cases, moreover, there is good reason to suspect
that post-driving drinking (or just the claim thereof) is an act of mischief
intended to thwart police investigators.  All such cases, at the very least,
involve a significant degree of irresponsibility and a cavalier disregard for
the safety of others and the integrity of the judicial system.  This Court
should not encourage or, at the very least, lend legitimacy, to such
behaviour.  Surely, if an accused wishes to question the representativeness of
the breathalyzer result on the basis that the reading could be overestimating
his blood alcohol level at the time of the offence, and the reason for that
discrepancy is his own wilful conduct, then it would seem only just and
consistent with the mischief that Parliament sought to address by way of this
presumption that he assume the burden of adducing some evidence which tends to
show that this discrepancy is legally relevant to the outcome of the charge. 
He is, in effect, the artisan of his own jeopardy, and should not profit from
conduct which may very well verge on obstruction of justice.

 

CVII.          On a final note, I cannot help but
remark upon a possible practical implication of the interpretation urged by the
appellant.  Given the possibility that a sophisticated or mischievous accused
could either drink, or merely claim to have drunk, alcohol after having been
taken to the station for a breathalyzer test, as is the case here, police may
well begin to search individuals more systematically for alcohol containers in
an effort to thwart such activity.  Giving the appellant the benefit of the
doubt in the present case notwithstanding the legal irrelevancy of her
objection to the outcome of the charge may therefore precipitate a legitimate
investigative procedure that is even more invasive of the rights of the
individual than the adverse presumption to which the appellant objects in the
first place.

 

IV.  Application to the Facts

 

CVIII.         In a charge of driving ""over
80"", as was the case in the present appeal, ""evidence to the
contrary"" must go to a legally material issue.  As such, in this case, it
must be evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt that the accused was
under the legal limit at the time of the offence.  The appellant did not
testify.  Nor was evidence adduced to this effect.  The Crown was therefore
entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 258(1) (c), and consequently
proved all of the elements of the offence.  Since I can see no other defence
which the accused could possibly have advanced, I would agree with Galligan
J.A. that there is no need for a new trial, and that a conviction should be
substituted for the acquittal.

 

CIX.            Accordingly, I would dismiss the
appeal and dispose of the case in the manner proposed by the Court of Appeal.

                   The appellant was
convicted of two counts of assault causing bodily harm and two counts of
choking with intent to commit an indictable offence.  The four charges arose in
September and October, 1986, out of two separate attacks on women.  Both
victims were attacked immediately after leaving the underground parking area of
their respective apartment buildings.  The accused was arrested returning to
his car, which was parked in a parking garage, about 2 1/2 hours after the
attack on the second victim (M.S.F.).

 

                   Identity was the
only issue in dispute at trial.  The accused provided an alibi as to his
whereabouts during the time that the attack on M.S.F. occurred.  The Crown, to
counter the alibi, called a witness (Ms. Geurts) in rebuttal who testified
that, shortly before the time covered by the alibi, she had been followed by
the appellant in his car while she was driving to the garage of her apartment
building.  This testimony did not completely refute the alibi but served to
undermine the accused's credibility with respect to his whereabouts during the
course of that evening.  At the time this evidence was adduced, the Crown did
not specify its purpose and no objection was taken to its admissibility.  The
appellant was permitted to call surrebuttal evidence in response.

 

                   The appellant was
convicted by an all‑female jury.  Crown counsel had set out to empanel an
all‑female jury and succeeded in doing so by virtue of the unequal stand‑by
power given to the Crown under the former s. 634  of the Criminal Code . 
This section has since been found to be unconstitutional.  The appeal was
dismissed.  At issue here was:  (1) whether the use of the Crown's stand‑by
power to tailor the jury constituted an abuse of the jury selection process or
created a reasonable apprehension of bias; (2) whether the verdict was
unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence; and (3) whether the reply
evidence called by the Crown was properly admissible.

 

                   Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The evidence used by the Crown to
rebut the alibi was not properly admissible because the Crown split its case to
the prejudice of the defence.

 

                   The accused is
entitled to know the full case for the Crown at the close of the Crown's case
so that it is known from the outset what must be met in response.  Evidence may
be brought in rebuttal after completion of the defence case where the defence
has raised some new matter or defence which the Crown has had no opportunity to
deal with and which the Crown could not reasonably have anticipated.  Rebuttal
evidence is not permitted regarding matters which merely confirm or reinforce
earlier evidence adduced in the Crown's case which could have been brought
before the defence was made.

 

                   The evidence
tendered in rebuttal could potentially be relevant to rebut the appellant's
assertion regarding his whereabouts on October 28, 1986.  The rebuttal evidence
would also raise questions about his credibility with respect to other facts in
issue.  Aside from credibility, this evidence was also potentially admissible
as similar fact evidence going to the identity of the attacker in the second
assault.  The charge to the jury made it evident that the rebuttal evidence had
a dual purpose.

 

                   Permitting the
Crown to adduce the evidence in rebuttal, which was at least partly probative
as similar fact evidence tending to prove identity, enabled the Crown to split
its case improperly.  The Crown had to introduce all evidence on the key issue
of identity in the case in chief.  The defence had not raised any new or
unanticipated matter which required evidence in reply.  The opportunity to
present evidence in surrebuttal cannot remove the prejudice caused by splitting
the Crown's case since the appellant was deprived of the opportunity of knowing
the case to be met prior to deciding to testify.

 

                   It is unnecessary
to decide whether, if the reply evidence was tendered as being relevant to
credibility, the collateral fact rule was violated because the evidence was
limited to that purpose.  In fact, the Crown did not specify the purpose for
which it was being led and the trial judge actually invited the jury to
consider the evidence as similar fact evidence.

 

                   In light of this
instruction a jury might well have accepted this evidence as highly relevant to
the identity of the perpetrator of the assault on the complainant.  This
constituted a serious misdirection to the jury especially since the
identification evidence was already tenuous.  Section 686(1)(b)(iii) of
the Code could not be invoked to cure the error of law here.  A jury
acting reasonably and properly, absent the error of allowing the Crown to
adduce the similar fact evidence in rebuttal, could indeed have acquitted the
accused.

 

                   The surrebuttal
evidence did not cure the prejudice caused to the appellant.  Not only was the
importance of the evidence given in rebuttal unduly highlighted but also the
appellant was forced to take the witness stand a second time to answer the
Crown's case.  This alone has an adverse effect for it creates the impression
that the appellant was caught in a lie.  The appellant is also subjected to
cross-examination for a second time and the Crown is given a second chance to
attack his credibility when it ought to have put its entire case in evidence at
the outset.  Given the frailties of the identification evidence adduced at
trial, the rebuttal evidence may have been quite significant in convicting the
appellant.

 

                   The verdicts,
notwithstanding the frailties of the identification evidence, were not
unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(i)
of the Code.  Since the verdicts were not unreasonable,  appellant was
not entitled to be acquitted of the charges.  No opinion was expressed on the
admissibility of Ms. Geurts if properly introduced at the new trial.  A new
trial was warranted because of the error of allowing the Crown to split its
case.

 

                   It was not
necessary to deal with the issue of the Crown's alleged misuse of its right to
stand by potential jurors under the former s. 634 of the Code. 
That provision had been found to be unconstitutional and was repealed. 
Therefore, this issue could not recur and was only of academic interest.

 

                   Per Gonthier J.:  Sopinka J.'s
opinion on the issues of the reasonableness of the verdict given the evidence
and the admissibility of the evidence given in reply was shared.

 

                   The issue of
whether the Crown's use of its stand‑by power to obtain an all‑female
jury constituted abuse of the jury selection process giving rise to a
reasonable apprehension of bias was not academic and needed to be addressed. 
The Crown cannot fashion, and must not be perceived to fashion, a jury which
may seem favourable to it.  The actual effect of such a prosecutorial
practice on the fundamental characteristics of the jury is not a determining
element.  It is rather a matter of gauging the anticipated effect of the
Crown's conduct on the perception of a reasonable observer as to the
quality of the jury selected.  The Crown is also obliged to promote the
fairness of the trial and accordingly must make wise use of its powers in the
jury selection process in order to select one that is impartial, representative
and competent.  Impartiality is the most important of these three elements. 
Competence is more difficult to influence directly through the use of
stand-bys.  The selection process can more easily affect the representative
nature of the jury which is a characteristic furthering the perception of
impartiality even if not fully ensuring it.  Since impartiality is best
guaranteed by the unanimous verdict of a representative jury, an apparent
attempt by the Crown to exclude representativeness undermines that
impartiality.

 

                   Per McLachlin J.:  A jury must be
impartial and competent but need not be representative.  Representativeness is
a means of achieving impartiality and competence but is not essential if a jury
has these qualities, and absence of representativeness does not automatically
entitle an accused person to a new trial.  To set the standard that a jury must
be representative is to set one impossible to achieve merely because of the
many groups and variants into which society may be divided.

 

                   The Crown, in
empanelling an all‑female jury, did not deliberately abuse the system. 
No evidence suggested that it used its stand‑by powers to achieve a
favourable jury or that the jury was, or was perceived to be, anything but
impartial and competent.

 

                   A reasonable member
of the public would not see an all‑female jury as favouring the Crown. 
The question is not whether people might for irrational reasons object to an
all‑female jury but whether such people could reasonably object to an all‑female
jury whose members were otherwise found fit to judge the issues.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
(dissenting):  The reasons of Doherty J.A. of the unanimous Court of Appeal
were adopted with respect to the issues before this Court.

 

                   First, the Crown's
deliberate empanelling of an all‑female jury through the use of its
numerical superiority in standing by jurors did not require that the jury
verdicts be set aside as it did not lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias. 
A reasonable, well‑informed observer would not reasonably apprehend that
an all‑female jury would be favourably disposed to find for the Crown on
the identification issue upon which this case turned.  Making findings of
partiality on the basis of assumed stereotypical reactions based on gender is
dangerous and contrary to our concepts of equality and individuality.  Nothing
in the circumstances of this case lifted the submission that an all‑female
jury could give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias above the level of
unwarranted stereotyping.

 

                   Second, given the
evidence adduced at trial, the verdicts against the appellant were reasonable.

 

                   Third, the trial
judge did not improperly exercise his discretion in permitting the Crown to
adduce the evidence of Ms. Geurts in reply.  A reasonable trial judge properly
applying the principles relating to the admissibility of reply evidence could
have admitted this reply evidence.  While the reply evidence had little
relevance to the issue of identity, it became much more relevant after the
appellant had given a detailed account of his whereabouts.  Furthermore, the
appellant was not prejudiced by the admission of the reply evidence.

 

                   Finally, agreement
was expressed with McLachlin J.'s comments on the issue of jury
representativeness.

I.Facts

 

1                 The appellant was convicted of
two counts of assault causing bodily harm and two counts of choking with intent
to commit an indictable offence.  He was acquitted at trial of two other
charges.  The four charges arose out of two separate incidents relating to
attacks on a female complainant (C.L.F.) in September  1986, and on a second
female complainant (M.S.F.) in October 1986.  Both victims were attacked
immediately after leaving the underground parking area of their respective
apartment buildings.  Both women were beaten and choked and suffered bodily
harm.

 

2                 On September 25, 1986, C.L.F.
returned to her apartment building at about 1 a.m.  She parked her car in the
underground garage and went to the elevator.  While waiting, she heard
footsteps from behind but did not turn around.  At that moment, she was
attacked from behind as a black object came in front of her face and was then
pulled tightly around her neck.  After seeing her attacker briefly, C.L.F.
passed out as a result of the choking.  When she awoke, she noticed that her
purse was gone.

 

3                 On October 28, 1986, M.S.F.
returned to her apartment building between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.  After
parking her car in the underground garage she ran to the stairway leading to
the foyer.  She was confronted by a man who pushed her against a wall, punched
her and then beat her and stomped on her.  M.S.F. yelled ""fire"" and
her assailant got up, looked at her and walked out the door.  M.S.F. then went
for assistance and was taken to the hospital.

 

4                 At trial, the appellant
testified that, on the night of October 28, 1986, he was at a show from around
7:30 p.m. to 9:15 p.m.  He claimed that, after leaving the show early, he then
walked his dog and went to visit a friend who was not home.  The appellant
stated that he then drove to two bars and left his car at a parking garage
around 11:25 p.m.  Upon returning to his car, the appellant was arrested.  This
was approximately 2 1/2 hours after the attack of M.S.F.

 

5                 In order to refute the alibi of
the appellant, the Crown called the evidence of Ms. Ruth Geurts in rebuttal. 
She testified that, at around 8:30 p.m. that evening, she had been followed by
the appellant in his car, while driving to the garage of her apartment
building.  At the time this evidence was adduced, the Crown did not specify its
purpose and no objection was taken to its admissibility.  The appellant was
permitted to call surrebuttal evidence in response.

 

6                 The appellant was tried by an
all-female jury and was convicted on the four counts relating to the attacks on
C.L.F. and M.S.F.  Crown counsel had set out to empanel an all-female jury and
succeeded in doing so by virtue of the former s. 634  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (which has since been declared unconstitutional in R.
v. Bain, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 91).  That provision gave the Crown four
peremptory challenges and 48 stand-bys while the appellant had only 12
peremptory challenges and no stand-bys.

 

7                 Identity was the only issue in
dispute at trial.  The appellant appealed the verdict based on three grounds. 
First, he argued that the convictions were unreasonable due to the frailty of
the identification evidence.  Secondly, he argued that the reply evidence of
Ms. Geurts was not properly admissible, claiming that the Crown split its
case.  Finally, it was argued that, by empanelling an all-female jury, the
Crown abused its use of the stand-by power which was still in effect at the
time of the trial.

 

8                 The appeal was dismissed by a
unanimous Court of Appeal for Ontario ((1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 756).  Although it
was recognized that the identification evidence was admittedly less than ideal,
Doherty J.A. concluded that a properly instructed jury acting judicially could
reasonably have returned a guilty verdict on the four charges.  The Court of
Appeal also rejected the contention that the Crown's use of stand-bys to
empanel an all-female jury would create a reasonable apprehension of bias.  The
final ground of appeal relating to the admissibility of the reply evidence also
failed.  Doherty J.A. held that the evidence of Ms. Geurts became much more
relevant after the appellant had testified concerning his location at 8:30
p.m.  As well, there was no prejudice to the appellant since he was aware of
the nature of the evidence of Ms. Geurts and had an opportunity to respond to
it.  Thus, it was held that the trial judge did not err in admitting the reply
evidence.

 

II.Issues

 

9                 The appellant raised three
grounds of appeal:

 

1.Did
the Court of Appeal err in law in holding that the use by the Crown of its
stand-by power to tailor the jury did not constitute an abuse of the jury
selection process or create a reasonable apprehension of bias?

 

2.Did
the Court of Appeal err in holding that the verdict was not unreasonable or
unsupported by the evidence?

 

3.Did
the Court of Appeal err in holding that the reply evidence called by the Crown
was properly admissible?

 

10               I conclude that the appellant is
entitled to a new trial on the basis of the third ground.  The appeal fails on
the second ground and it is not necessary to deal with the first ground.  I
propose to deal with the issues in that order.

 

III.Analysis

 

A.                Was the Reply
Evidence Admissible?

 

11               The appellant submitted that the
evidence of Ms. Geurts, which was tendered in reply to the defence's case, was
not properly admissible because the Crown split its case to the prejudice of
the defence.  The appellant also contended that the admission of the evidence
violated the collateral fact rule.

 

12               The rationale behind the rule
against allowing the Crown to split its case was stated by this Court in John
v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 476.  The judgment of a unanimous Court was
delivered by Estey J. and Lamer J. (as he then was) who wrote, at pp. 480-81:

 

Clearly
this is the situation referred to in criminal practice as the prosecution
splitting its case.  The wrongs which flow from such a practice are manifold
and the practice has been prohibited from the earliest days of our criminal
law.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   These
are the consequences that flow from a violation of one of the fundamental
precepts of our criminal process, namely the dividing of the prosecution's case
so as to sandwich the defence.  This is a particularly lethal tactic where the
evidence in reply raises a new issue and attacks the accused's credibility for
this is the last evidence which the members of the jury hear prior to their
deliberations.  It also raises the question as to the propriety of the Crown's
conduct in the context of the accused's right to elect to remain silent or to
elect to enter the witness box in his own defence.  He must be given the
opportunity of making this decision in the full awareness of the Crown's
complete case.  This did not occur in these proceedings.

 

13               In R. v. Krause, [1986] 2
S.C.R. 466, McIntyre J., for the Court, explained under what circumstances the
Crown may call evidence in rebuttal.  At pages 473‑74 he noted that the
general rule is that the Crown cannot split its case.  McIntyre J. added:

 

The
Crown or the plaintiff must produce and enter in its own case all the clearly
relevant evidence it has, or that it intends to rely upon, to establish its
case with respect to all the issues raised in the pleadings; in a criminal case
the indictment and any particulars.... This rule prevents unfair surprise,
prejudice and confusion which could result if the Crown or the plaintiff were
allowed to split its case, that is, to put in part of its evidence -- as much
as it deemed necessary at the outset -- then to close the case and after the
defence is complete to add further evidence to bolster the position originally
advanced.  The underlying reason for this rule is that the defendant or the
accused is entitled at the close of the Crown's case to have before it the full
case for the Crown so that it is known from the outset what must be met in
response.

 

                   The
plaintiff or the Crown may be allowed to call evidence in rebuttal after
completion of the defence case, where the defence has raised some new matter
or defence which the Crown has had no opportunity to deal with and which the
Crown or the plaintiff could not reasonably have anticipated.  But rebuttal
will not be permitted regarding matters which merely confirm or reinforce
earlier evidence adduced in the Crown's case which could have been brought
before the defence was made.  [Emphasis added.]

 

14               The following excerpt from R.
v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 26, is also
relevant:

 

                   The
general rule with respect to the order of proof is that the prosecution must
introduce all the evidence in its possession upon which it relies as probative
of guilt, before closing its case....  The rule prevents the accused being
taken by surprise, and being deprived of an adequate opportunity to make a
proper investigation with respect to the evidence adduced against him.  The
rule also provides a safeguard against the importance of a piece of evidence,
by reason of its late introduction, being unduly emphasized or magnified in
relation to the other evidence.

 

                   Rebuttal
evidence by the prosecution is restricted to evidence to meet new facts
introduced by the defence.  The accused's mere denial of the prosecution's case
in the witness-box does not permit the prosecution in reply to reiterate its
case, or to adduce additional evidence in support of it.  In practice,
however, it may often be difficult to distinguish between evidence, properly
the subject of rebuttal, and evidence of facts relevant to prove guilt which
should have been proved in the first instance by a full presentation of the
prosecution's case....

 

                   The
Court has, however, a discretion to admit evidence in reply which has become
relevant to the prosecution's case as a result of defence evidence which the
Crown could not reasonably be expected to anticipate.  [Emphasis by
underlining added.]

 

15               In the present case, in my view,
the evidence tendered in rebuttal could potentially be relevant for two
purposes.  First, Ms. Geurts' testimony was relevant to rebut the appellant's
assertion regarding his whereabouts at around 8:30 p.m. on October 28, 1986.  While
the evidence did not directly refute the appellant's alibi, since the offence
occurred between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. that night, it impeached his
credibility with respect to his whereabouts during the course of that evening. 
As the Crown noted in its factum, the fact that the appellant may have lied
about his whereabouts at 8:30 p.m. would cast doubt on the credibility of the
appellant's testimony in respect of other facts in issue.

 

16               Aside from attacking the appellant's
credibility, the rebuttal evidence was also potentially admissible as similar
fact evidence going to the identity of M.S.F.'s attacker.  Given that identity
was essentially the sole issue at trial, the significance of this evidence
cannot be underestimated.  The nature of the evidence of Ms. Geurts was summed
up in the trial judge's charge to the jury, as follows:

 

                   Her
evidence would appear to therefore put Biddle on Holly Street at about 8:30
p.m., or let us say 8:30 to 8:45 p.m., in that area of time.  This was the time
when Biddle said that he was at the Reveen performance at Danforth and
Broadview.  It also puts Biddle in the sinister role of following a car
driven by a woman of about the same age and category of [C.L.F.] and [M.S.F.]
-- by ""category"" I mean young businesswomen driving cars. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

The charge to the jury, therefore,
made it quite evident that there was a dual purpose to the admission of the
reply evidence.

 

17               In oral argument, the Crown conceded
that if the reply evidence was tendered as similar fact evidence, then it ought
to have been adduced in the case in chief.  This was an appropriate concession
since the probative value of the similar fact aspect of Ms. Geurts' testimony
related to the identity of the appellant.  This was a key issue with respect to
the innocence or guilt of the appellant.

 

18               Permitting the Crown to adduce the
evidence of Ms. Geurts in rebuttal, which was at least partly probative as similar
fact evidence tending to prove identity, enabled the Crown to split its case
improperly.  It was clear that identity was the key issue at trial and the
Crown had an obligation to introduce all relevant evidence to this issue in the
case in chief.  It cannot be said that the defence had raised some new matter
or defence with which the Crown had no opportunity to deal and which the Crown
could not reasonably have anticipated.  The Crown was in possession of the
evidence of Ms. Geurts prior to the defence case and must have reasonably
anticipated that the appellant would challenge the identification evidence
presented.  As the appellant noted at the hearing of this appeal, the Crown
knew of his explanation of his whereabouts as he had given a statement to the
police.  Therefore, the rebuttal evidence ought not to have been admissible in
reply.  There was no reason that the Crown could not have adduced the evidence
of Ms. Geurts prior to the defence case.  By splitting the Crown's case, the
appellant was deprived of the opportunity of knowing the entire case to meet
prior to deciding whether or not to testify.  The opportunity to present
evidence in surrebuttal cannot remove this prejudice.

 

19               The Crown also sought to justify
the evidence on the ground that it impugned the appellant's testimony as to his
whereabouts early in the evening and therefore was relevant to credibility.  As
the assault was alleged to have taken place between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m. and
the evidence of Ms. Geurts related to a period between 8:30 to 8:45 p.m., it
did not directly tend to rebut the alibi.  Its admission would, therefore,
encounter the collateral fact rule.  This rule is subject to enumerated
exceptions and, although none of the recognized exceptions would appear to
apply in this case, it has been suggested that this is not a closed list.  See Cross
on Evidence (7th ed. 1990), at p. 310; Stanley A. Schiff, Evidence
in the Litigation Process (3rd ed. 1988), vol. 1, at pp. 534-35.

 

20               It is unnecessary and undesirable
to resolve that question in this case because, even if admissible for the
purpose of impeaching the appellant's credibility, its use was not limited to
that purpose.  The Crown did not specify the purpose for which it was being
led.  Although no objection was taken by the appellant at the time, this alone
does not prevent raising the illegality of the rebuttal evidence on appeal: see
Latour v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 361, at p. 368.  Furthermore,
the trial judge did not instruct the jury on the limited use of the rebuttal
evidence.  In fact, as illustrated by the above passage quoted from the charge
to the jury, the trial judge actually invited the jury to consider the reply
evidence as similar fact evidence.  In light of this instruction a jury might
well have accepted this evidence as highly relevant to the identity of the
perpetrator of the assault on the complainant.

 

21               In the circumstances of the case,
this constituted a serious misdirection to the jury.  As outlined by Doherty
J.A., the evidence of identification was already tenuous.  In my view, the
error could reasonably have affected the verdict of the jury.  It cannot be
said that, absent the error of allowing the Crown to adduce the similar fact
evidence in rebuttal, no jury acting reasonably and properly instructed could
have acquitted the accused (see R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345; R.
v. Leaney, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 393; R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R.
909; and R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599).  In John v. The Queen,
supra, at p. 481, it was held that s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of
the Code could not be invoked to cure an error of law where the Crown
had improperly split its case and was wrongly permitted to lead reply
evidence.  An appellate court cannot retry the case ""to assess the worth
of the residual evidence after the improperly adduced evidence has been
extracted from the record"" (John v. The Queen, supra, at pp.
481-82).  Furthermore, I note that the Crown made no arguments to substantiate
a claim that the improper admission of the evidence would not amount to a
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  The Crown did, however, submit
that by allowing surrebuttal evidence any prejudice to the appellant was
cured.  That submission is properly considered in relation to the application
of s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

 

22               It cannot be said that the
opportunity to present evidence in surrebuttal removes the prejudice suffered
by the appellant.  As was noted by McIntyre J. in R. v. Krause, supra,
and by Estey and Lamer JJ. in John v. The Queen, supra, an
underlying reason for the rule against splitting the case is that the accused
is entitled to know the entire case of the Crown which must be met.  It is only
where the accused has full knowledge of the Crown's case that one is able to
decide whether or not to testify.

 

23               Furthermore, in John v. The
Queen, supra, at p. 480, this Court held that to allow the Crown to
split its case ""is doubly wrong because the effect was to force the
accused to return to the witness box"".  Merely requiring the appellant to
enter the witness box for a second time has an adverse effect as it creates the
impression that he was caught in a lie.  As well, the appellant is subjected to
cross-examination for a second time.  In effect, the Crown is given a second
chance to attack the credibility of the appellant when it ought to have put its
entire case in evidence at the outset.

 

24               In R. v. Wood (1986), 28
C.C.C. (3d) 65 (Ont. C.A.), it was held that the Crown impermissibly split its
case.  Although the accused did not call evidence in surrebuttal, Goodman J.A.,
for the court, stated at p. 83 that:

 

                   The
probable detrimental effect of the improper admission of the reply evidence is
beyond question.  It constituted a direct contradiction of the evidence given
by the appellant with respect to his knowledge, possession and ownership of the
knife.  If the reply evidence was believed by the jury, it would have the
inevitable effect of destroying the credibility of the appellant and his
defence of self-defence and to a lesser extent his defence of provocation.  The
reply evidence was the last evidence to be heard by the jury with the attendant
risk to the appellant that it would carry more weight with the jury for that
reason.  Even if defence counsel had sought leave for the appellant to give
evidence in surrebuttal, it would have meant that the appellant would have been
subjected to a second cross-examination.  Wittingly or unwittingly, the
prosecution, in proceeding in the manner which it did, created a trap for the
appellant.  [Emphasis added.]

 

25               It should also be recognized that
the late introduction of evidence may have the effect of unduly magnifying its
importance and increasing its weight.  This would not otherwise occur but for
the improper splitting of the Crown's case.  I agree with the submission of the
appellant that, in this case, the timing and sequence of the evidence as it
unfolded before the jury added to the prejudicial impact of admitting the
evidence in reply.  In R. v. Campbell, supra, at p. 26, Martin
J.A. also acknowledged this aspect of the rule against splitting the case:

 

The
rule also provides a safeguard against the importance of a piece of evidence,
by reason of its late introduction, being unduly emphasized or magnified in
relation to the other evidence.

 

26               Given the frailties in the
identification evidence adduced at trial, the evidence of Ms. Geurts may have
been quite significant in convicting the appellant.  Placing this evidence
before the jury at the end of the trial, rather than in the Crown's case,
prejudiced the appellant by inordinately elevating its weight.

 

27               The respondent relies on the
decision of this Court in R. v. Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303, to support
the proposition that allowing surrebuttal evidence substantially cures any
prejudice caused by allowing the Crown to split its case.  In that case, Lamer
C.J. noted that the appellants could not make a serious argument that they
suffered prejudice as a result of the fact that the Crown tendered evidence in
rebuttal rather than in chief.  However, one must note the context in which
these comments were made.  In R. v. Chaulk, supra, it was held
that the Crown did not improperly split its case.  That is, the evidence was
properly admissible in rebuttal.  At page 1394, Wilson J. stated:

 

                   I
agree with Lamer C.J. that no issue of the Crown splitting its case arises here
and that the evidence adduced to rebut the defence of insanity was properly
admitted by the trial judge.

 

28               Thus, R. v. Chaulk, supra,
must be read in light of the above circumstances.  It cannot be said that, as a
general proposition, the ability to call surrebuttal evidence removes any
prejudice caused to an accused where the rebuttal evidence was improperly
adduced in the first place thereby allowing the Crown to split its case. 
Unlike in R. v. Chaulk, for the reasons noted above, here the appellant
can make a serious argument that the fact the Crown's evidence was adduced in
rebuttal rather than in chief was prejudicial, notwithstanding the ability to
call evidence in surrebuttal.

 

29               It is also worthy to note that if
one accepts the contention that calling surrebuttal evidence removes any
prejudice of allowing the Crown to adduce reply evidence which ought to have
been brought out in the case in chief, then the rule against splitting the case
would effectively be emasculated.  The Crown would be allowed to split its case
as long as the accused was given a chance to reply.  This would defeat the very
rationale behind the rule against splitting the case.  Surely, this is an
unacceptable result.

 

30               In the case at bar, I would
conclude that the surrebuttal evidence did not adequately address the prejudice
caused to the appellant.  Not only was the evidence of Ms. Geurts highlighted,
but also the appellant was forced to take the witness stand a second time to
answer the Crown's case.  I cannot, therefore, accept the Crown's submission that
any prejudice to the appellant was cured by allowing surrebuttal evidence.

 

31               In R. v. S. (P.L.), supra,
at p. 916, the majority stated:

 

                   On
the other hand, if the Court of Appeal finds an error of law with the result that
the accused has not had a trial in which the legal rules have been observed,
then the accused is entitled to an acquittal or a new trial in accordance with
the law.  The latter result will obtain if there is legally admissible evidence
on which a conviction could reasonably be based.  

 

The appellant is entitled to a new
trial.  He is not entitled to an acquittal, however, if there is admissible
evidence on which a conviction can reasonably be based.  This in substance is
the issue raised by the appellant in the next ground of appeal. 

 

B.Was
the Verdict Unreasonable or Unsupported by the Evidence?

 

32               The appellant contends that the
verdicts must be set aside because they are unreasonable and unsupported by the
evidence within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Code. 
The test to be applied by an appellate court is ""whether the verdict is
one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have
rendered"":  R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, at pp. 179-80.  If no
reasonable jury could have convicted the appellant on the evidence that was
properly admissible, then rather than order a new trial, the convictions must
be quashed and the respondent would be acquitted of all charges.

 

33               At the hearing of the appeal
before this Court, we did not call on the respondent to address this issue. 
Although it is apparent that the identification evidence in the present case
was not free from frailties, I am satisfied that the verdicts were not
unreasonable.  In this regard, I am in substantial agreement with Doherty J.A. 
Although he made reference to the evidence of Ms. Geurts, I agree with his
analysis of the other evidence which was properly admissible and, in my view, a
verdict based on this evidence would not be unreasonable.  Therefore, the
appellant is not entitled to be acquitted of the charges.  I should add that I
express no opinion on the admissibility of the evidence of Ms. Geurts if
properly introduced.  That will be a matter for the trial judge at the new
trial.

 

C.Did
the Crown Abuse its Stand-by Power to Empanel an All-Female Jury?

 

34               In light of my conclusion that a
new trial is warranted by virtue of the error of allowing the Crown to split
its case, it is not necessary to deal with the issue relating to the Crown's
alleged misuse of its right to stand by under the former s. 634 of the Code. 
Following upon our decision in R. v. Bain, supra, this provision
was repealed and this issue of law cannot recur.  It is therefore of academic
interest only.

 

IV.Disposition

 

35               The counts in respect of which the
appellant was convicted were joined in one indictment.  At trial the jury was
instructed that if satisfied that the same person committed both assaults, they
could use the evidence against the appellant as the perpetrator of one of the
assaults in determining whether the Crown had proved the assaults on the other
complainant.  An error with respect to the evidence relating to one complainant
is therefore an error that affects all counts for which the appellant was
convicted.

 

36               In the result, the appeal is
allowed, the convictions are quashed and a new trial is ordered.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

37               L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting) -- The appellant in this case was convicted at trial of
two counts of assault causing bodily harm and two counts of choking with intent
to commit an indictable offence.  The verdict was unanimously upheld by the
Court of Appeal ((1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 756).  Before us, the appellant raised
the following three grounds of appeal:

 

1.Did
the Court of Appeal err in holding that the use by the Crown of its stand-aside
power to shape the composition of the jury did not constitute an abuse of the
jury selection process or create a reasonable apprehension of bias?

 

2.Did
the Court of Appeal err in holding that the verdict was neither unreasonable
nor unsupported by the evidence?

 

3.Did
the Court of Appeal err in holding that the reply evidence called by the Crown
was properly admissible?

 

38               My colleague Justice Sopinka
accepts the third ground of appeal, rejects the second ground of appeal, and
does not deal with the first ground of appeal.  In the result, he would allow
the appeal and order a new trial.  I disagree.  In my view all three grounds of
appeal fail and the appeal should be dismissed.  In this respect, I adopt the
reasons of Doherty J.A. for the unanimous Court of Appeal of Ontario.

 

39               Specifically, on the first issue,
Doherty J.A noted that the appellant was tried by an all-female jury and that
it was clear from the record that the Crown had set out to empanel such a
jury.  In order to shape the composition of the jury, the Crown had made use of
then operative provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
which gave it numerical superiority in standing by potential jurors.  The
Crown's numerical superiority in standing by potential jurors was subsequently
ruled unconstitutional by this Court in R. v. Bain, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 91. 
However, the appellant's trial took place prior to R. v. Bain.  In this
respect, Doherty J.A. stated at p. 768:

 

                   The
two judgments constituting the majority in Bain took different
approaches to its application to cases tried before Bain was released. 
At p. 109 S.C.R., p. 513 C.C.C., Cory J., for three members of the four-person
majority, held that a verdict returned by a jury empanelled under the former
provisions of the Code could only be set aside if the appellant could
demonstrate an ""abuse"" of the stand-aside provisions by the Crown. 

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

                          In my view, the
""abuse"" described by Cory J. in Bain refers to both the misuse
of the stand-aside power and the resultant negative consequences on the
impartiality of the jury selected as a result of that misuse.  Consequently in
pre-Bain cases the court must address the Crown's use of its numerical
advantage to shape the composition of the jury, and must also decide whether
the jury selected by that process is one which would create a reasonable
apprehension of bias in the mind of a reasonable observer. 

 

 

Applying this test
to the case at hand, Doherty J.A. held at p. 770:

 

                          This case turned entirely on
the question of identification.  The victims' honesty was not in issue.  The
reliability of their identification evidence was very much in issue.  I am not
prepared to hold, because women may be particularly sensitive to the plight of
the victims, that an all-female jury would be unable to objectively assess the
reliability of the identification evidence provided by the victims.  More to
the point, I am not prepared to find that the reasonable, well-informed
observer would reasonably apprehend that an all-female jury would be favourably
disposed to find for the Crown on the issue of identification.

 

                          It is dangerous and contrary
to our concepts of equality and individuality to make findings of partiality on
the basis of assumed stereotypical reactions based on gender.  At heart, the
appellant's submission rests on just such assumptions.  There is nothing in the
circumstances of this case which lifts it above the level of unwarranted
stereotyping.  In this regard, it is instructive that trial counsel apparently
perceived no bias as he did not object during the jury selection process. 

 

In the result,
Doherty J.A. concluded that there was no reasonable apprehension of bias.  I
agree and therefore reject this first ground of appeal.

 

40                    On
the second ground of appeal, Doherty J.A. concluded, after reviewing the
evidence adduced at trial, that the verdicts against the appellant were
reasonable.  Like my colleague Sopinka J., I agree with this assessment and
reject the second ground of appeal.

 

41                     Finally,
on the third ground of appeal, Doherty J.A. stated at pp. 771-72:

 

                          The principles controlling the
admissibility of evidence in reply are well‑established. Those principles
do not yield absolute rules of exclusion or admission, but require that the
trial judge exercise a discretion through the application of these principles: R.
v. Krause, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 466, 29 C.C.C. (3d) 385; R. v. W. (A.)
(1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 171 at pp. 178‑81, 45 O.A.C. 359 (C.A.).

 

                          No objection was taken at
trial to the admission of the reply evidence. Consequently, the trial judge did
not direct his mind to the relevant principles or purport to exercise any
discretion. There is therefore no record upon which this court may review the
trial judge's decision to admit the evidence. In such circumstances (and absent
any suggestion of incompetent representation) the appellant can only succeed if
he can demonstrate that a reasonable trial judge, applying the applicable
principles, could not have admitted the evidence. In other words, if the case
is one in which some judges could properly have admitted the evidence while
others could properly have excluded it, the appeal cannot succeed.

 

                          The evidence of Ms. Guerts as
to the appellant's whereabouts about two hours before the attack had little
probative value in identifying the appellant as the perpetrator of the assault.
In this respect, the present case must be distinguished from R. v. Jackson
(1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 91 (B.C.C.A.), the authority relied on by the appellant.
In Jackson the reply evidence was directly relevant to the time period
when the assault occurred. Ms. Guerts' evidence became much more relevant after
the appellant, as part of a detailed account of his movements, put his
whereabouts at 8:30 p.m. in issue.

 

                          I also cannot see any
prejudice to the appellant by the admission of the evidence in reply. The
defence was apparently aware of the nature of Ms. Guerts' evidence when the
appellant testified and the defence had ample opportunity to respond to her
evidence.

 

                          In my opinion, a reasonable
trial judge properly applying the principles relating to the admissibility of
reply evidence could have admitted the evidence of Ms. Guerts in reply. I would
not give effect to this ground of appeal. 

 

I agree and therefore
reject the third ground of appeal.

 

 42                   Before
concluding, I note that since first writing these reasons I have had the
opportunity to read the reasons of my colleagues Justices Gonthier and
McLachlin, who both discuss the issue of jury representativeness.   On this
issue, I agree with the comments of McLachlin J. and respectfully disagree with
those of Gonthier J.

 

43                    For
the reasons outlined above, I would dismiss the appeal.

 

                          The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

44                    Gonthier J. -- I
have had the benefit of the reasons of Justice Sopinka, and I adopt his review
of the facts and of the judgments below.  I share his opinion with respect to
the second and third grounds raised by the appellant before this Court.  I
nevertheless believe that it is important to add some further comments. 
Sopinka J. holds that it is not necessary to address the first ground
raised by the appellant, namely that use by the prosecution of its power to
stand jurors by for the purpose of obtaining an exclusively female jury
constituted an abuse of the process of juror selection and gave rise to a
reasonable apprehension of bias.  Having regard to this Court's decision in R. v.
Bain, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 91, my colleague Sopinka J. believes this
question is purely academic.  With respect, I do not share this view.

 

45                    Prior
to that decision, the power of the Crown to stand jurors by had its source in
s. 634(1)  and (2)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 
(formerly s. 563(1) and (2), R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34).  In R. v. Bain,
supra, a majority of the Court found that these provisions infringed
s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and
that this violation was not justified under s. 1 .  The declaration of
invalidity was suspended for six months in order to allow Parliament to remedy
the situation if it deemed it appropriate to do so.  The change was
subsequently enacted by An Act to amend the Criminal Code (jury), 
S.C. 1992, c. 41, s. 2.

 

46                    In
the case at bar, the appellant's trial took place before the validity of
these provisions had been constitutionally challenged.  It is certainly true
that this fact is to be considered in weighing the effect of a pronouncement of
the Court on the issue.  It is obvious that, in practice, only a limited number
of cases can be affected.  Apart from that of the appellant, there are those
where the trial of an accused has taken place before July 1992, before
judge and jury, and in which the record has shown an extensive use of
peremptory challenges and of stand-bys by the Crown.  I acknowledge that this
number is necessarily likely to diminish with the passage of time.

 

47                     It
appears to me, nevertheless, that this circumstance is not the only one to be
considered.  Beyond the more immediate repercussions, the first ground raised
by the appellant essentially brings into scrutiny the fundamental element of
the conduct of the Crown in the unfolding of the trial.  One is bound to
acknowledge that this aspect is broader in scope; I therefore believe that it
is necessary to review the manner in which Doherty J.A., speaking for the
Ontario Court of Appeal, addressed the problem (decision reported at (1993), 14
O.R. (3d) 756).

 

48                    In
R. v. Bain, supra, the position in cases determined prior to the
actual declaration of invalidity of s. 634(1) and (2) of the Code
was not left unaddressed.  Cory J., for the majority, emphasized at
p. 104 that ""[t]he accused may always attempt to demonstrate that
there has been an abuse of the stand by provisions by the prosecution"". 
In the case at bar, Doherty J.A. consequently sought to give concrete
expression to this notion of abuse by suggesting the elements which, in his
view, ought to be examined in determining whether the conduct of the Crown
could be so considered.  He formulated a two-step test (at p. 768):

 

                          In my view, the
""abuse"" described by Cory J. in Bain refers to both the
misuse of the stand-aside power and the resultant negative consequences on
the impartiality of the jury selected as a result of that misuse. 
Consequently in pre-Bain cases the court must address the Crown's use of
its numerical advantage to shape the composition of the jury, and must
also decide whether the jury selected by that process is one which would create
a reasonable apprehension of bias in the mind of a reasonable observer. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

Thus, according to
Doherty J.A., not only must there be an improper use by the Crown of its
stand-by power, but the jury so selected must also, in practice, create
a reasonable apprehension of bias in the mind of a reasonable and properly
informed observer.

 

49                    In
my view, with respect, a further nuance must be considered in this regard.  The
laying down of these twin requirements in effect creates a risk that each
element will be considered separately and that the first element will become
blurred by the second.  In my view, it is in this way that the Court of Appeal
fell into error.  While Doherty J.A. certainly did note the fact that the
Crown had used its numerical advantage to select an exclusively female jury, he
did not truly take into account this element in his consideration of the second
step.  The real problem was in my view overlooked.

 

50                    In
fact, when approached in this manner, an improper use by the Crown of its power
to stand by may be condoned simply because the jury, when viewed quite apart
from the selection process, does not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of
bias.  In my view, if there is conduct which is not to be condoned, it is the
attempt by the Crown to fashion a jury which may seem favourable to it.  The actual
effect of such a prosecutorial practice on the fundamental characteristics of
the jury, namely impartiality, representativeness, and to a lesser extent,
competence, does not seem to me to be a determining element.  It is rather a
matter of gauging the anticipated effect of the conduct of the Crown in its
selection of the jury on the perception of a reasonable observer as to
the quality of the jury.

 

51                     The
necessity of a heightened scrutiny on the behaviour of the Crown flows
from the role which the Crown has always played in our judicial system.  In
this respect, it is helpful to refer once again to a passage of Rand J. in
Boucher v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 16, which marked a turning point in the
jurisprudence of this Court on this issue.  He made the following remarks at
pp. 23-24:

 

                          It cannot be over-emphasized
that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is
to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant
to what is alleged to be a crime.... The role of prosecutor excludes any notion
of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in
civil life there can be none charged with greater personal responsibility.  It
is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the
seriousness and the justness of judicial proceedings.

 

As I emphasized in R.
v. Bain, supra, the Crown is party to the fairness of the trial
which it also has an obligation to promote.  Even though, practically speaking,
the trial judge is the ultimate guardian of the fairness of the trial, this
does not authorize the prosecution to neglect this obligation nor to undermine
its importance.

 

52                    In
the context of the selection of jurors, this obligation of the Crown is
discharged through the wise use which it must make of the means at its disposal
in order to select a jury which is impartial, representative and competent.  In
the same way as this power of selection must not be used for the purpose of
obtaining a finding of guilt, the right to stand by must not be used to skew
the composition of the jury or to gain a tactical advantage, but rather, only
for the purpose of choosing the jury best qualified to judge a case.  One must
conscientiously strive to ensure that a jury possess the above-mentioned
qualities. 

 

53                    Of
these three elements, impartiality is without doubt the most important.  While
plainly the jury's competence is a fundamental requirement, one must
acknowledge that it is more difficult to exercise a direct influence on it
through a mechanism such as stand-bys.  Representativeness, on the other hand,
is more susceptible to being affected by the selection process.  The present
case is an excellent example of this.  As I observed in R. v. Bain, supra,
representativeness is a characteristic which furthers the perception of
impartiality even if not fully ensuring it.  While representativeness is not an
essential quality of a jury, it is one to be sought after.  The surest
guarantee of jury impartiality consists in the combination of the
representativeness with the requirement of a unanimous verdict.  Consequently,
an apparent attempt by the prosecution to modify the composition of the jury so
as to exclude representativeness, as occurred in this case, in itself
undermines the impartiality of a jury. 

 

54                    For
these reasons, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.

 

                          The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

55                    McLachlin J. -- I
agree with the reasons of Justice Sopinka.  Like him, I would not find it
essential to comment on the issue of jury selection, were it not for the
reasons of Justice Gonthier on the issue with which I respectfully do not
agree.

 

56                    Gonthier
J., at p. 787, suggests that a jury must be ""impartial, representative and
competent"".  I agree that a jury must be impartial and competent.  But,
with respect, the law has never suggested that a jury must be representative. 
For hundreds of years, juries in this country were composed entirely of men. 
Are we to say that all these juries were for that reason partial and
incompetent?

 

57                     To
say that a jury must be representative is to confuse the means with the end.  I
agree that representativeness may provide extra assurance of impartiality and
competence.  I would even go so far as to say that it is generally a good
thing.  But I cannot accept that it is essential in every case, nor that its
absence automatically entitles an accused person to a new trial.  

 

58                    To
say that a jury must be representative is to set a standard impossible of
achievement.  The community can be divided into a hundred different groups on
the basis of variants such as gender, race, class and education.  Must every
group be represented on every jury?  If not, which groups are to be chosen and
on what grounds?  If so, how much representation is enough?  Do we demand
parity based on regional population figures?  Or will something less suffice? 
I see no need to start down this problematic path of the representative jury,
provided the impartiality and competence of the jury are assured. 
Representativeness may be a means to achieving this end.  But it should not be
elevated to the status of an absolute requirement. 

 

59                    In
the case at bar there is no evidence that the Crown used its stand-by powers to
the end of achieving a jury which would be favourable to the Crown.  It is at
least equally open to infer, as Doherty J.A. suggests ((1993), 14 O.R. (3d)
756), that its aim was to secure a jury which would be capable of judging the
issues in an impartial and unbiased manner.  So the suggestion of deliberate
Crown abuse of the system is not made out.

 

60                    Nor
is there any evidence that the jury chosen was, or could reasonably be
perceived to be, other than impartial and competent.  Indeed, one must presume
the contrary, given that each party had the right to test each juror and object
to any juror who might be partial or incompetent.  The defence, in suggesting
partiality, asks in essence that we infer from the fact that the jury was
composed entirely of women that it would be partial to the Crown, or would be
seen by a reasonable person to be partial to the Crown.  These are inferences
which I cannot draw.  I see no reason to suppose that an all-woman jury cannot
be as impartial as all-male juries have been presumed to be for centuries.  Nor
can I see any reason to suppose that an all-woman jury would be seen by a
reasonable member of the public as favouring the Crown.  The question is not
whether people, or even a number of people, might for irrational reasons object
to an all-woman jury.  The question is rather whether such people could reasonably
object to an all-woman jury, each member of which has been judged to be
impartial and competent and, apart from gender, fit to judge the issues in the
case.  That question must, in my view, be answered in the negative.  Therefore,
I agree with the Court of Appeal below that no error was demonstrated in the
selection of the jury.  

 

61                     I
would allow the appeal for the reasons set out by Sopinka J.

                   C, a close friend
of the accused, was shot by B, a drug dealer.  At the time of the incident, B
was accompanied by the accused.  C survived the shooting and, as a party to the
offence, the accused was charged with attempted murder.  At trial, the accused
testified that on the night of the shooting he had accidentally run into B, who
indicated to him that he was armed with a handgun and ordered the accused to
take him to C's apartment.  When the accused refused, B punched him in the face
several times.  The accused stated that he feared for his life and believed
that B would shoot him if he did not cooperate with him.  B drove the accused
to a telephone booth where the accused, following B's orders, called C to ask
him to meet him in the lobby of C's apartment building in twenty minutes.
Shortly thereafter, the accused called C from the intercom outside the lobby
and asked him to ""come down"".  Before leaving his apartment C
unlocked the building front door.  B and the accused went into the lobby and,
when C arrived, he was grabbed by B.  After some discussion, B pushed C away
and shot him. The accused stated that he had repeatedly pleaded with B not to
shoot C.  C, however, testified that during the incident the accused said
nothing and made no effort to intervene.  After the shooting, B drove the accused
away from the scene of the shooting.  According to the accused's testimony, B
then threatened to kill him if he went to the police.  The next morning the
accused turned himself in.  Under cross‑examination, he declared that he
believed that he had had no opportunity to run away or warn C without being
shot.  In his charge, the trial judge told the jury that ""if [the accused]
joined in the common plot to shoot [C], under threats of death or grievous
bodily harm, that would negative his having a common intention with [B] to
shoot [C], and you must find [the accused] not guilty"".  He added that
""the accused [could] not rely on [the common law defence of duress] if a
safe avenue of escape exist[ed], which . . . is a matter for you to
find when you consider the evidence"".  The accused was acquitted of the
charge of attempted murder, but was convicted of the included offence of
aggravated assault.  The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   The fact that a
person who commits a criminal act does so as a result of threats of death or
bodily harm can, in some instances, be relevant to the question of whether he
possessed the mens rea necessary to commit an offence.  Whether or not
this is so will depend, among other things, on the structure of the particular
offence in question ‑‑ that is, on whether or not the mental state
specified by Parliament in its definition of the offence is such that the
presence of coercion can, as a matter of logic, have a bearing on the existence
of mens rea.  If the offence is one where the presence of duress is of
potential relevance to the existence of mens rea, the accused is
entitled to point to the presence of threats when arguing that the Crown has
not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the mental state
required for liability.

 

                   A person who
commits a criminal act under threats of death or bodily harm may also be able
to invoke an excuse‑based defence (either the statutory defence set out
in s. 17  of the Criminal Code  or the common law defence of duress,
depending on whether the accused is charged as a principal or as a party). 
This is so regardless of whether or not the offence at issue is one where the
presence of coercion also has a bearing on the existence of mens rea.

 

                   The mental states
specified in ss. 21(1)(b) and 21(2) of the Code are not
susceptible to being ""negated"" by duress.  This conclusion is based
on an interpretation of the particular terms of the two provisions.  Section
21(1) (b), which imposes criminal liability as a party on anyone who
""does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to
commit"" an offence, does not require that the accused actively view the
commission of the offence he is aiding as desirable in and of itself. 
Parliament's use of the term ""purpose"" in s. 21(1) (b) is
essentially synonymous with ""intention"" and does not incorporate the
notion of ""desire"" into the mental state for party liability.  This
interpretation, which best reflects the legislative intent underlying
s. 21(1) (b), is in accord with the common law principles governing
party liability, and avoids the absurdity that would flow from the equation of
""purpose"" with ""desire"".  As well, under s. 21(2) ,
which provides that ""persons [who] form an intention in common to carry
out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein"" are liable for
criminal offences committed by the principal that are foreseeable and probable
consequences of ""carrying out the common purpose"", the accused's subjective
view as to the desirability of the commission of the offence is not relevant. 
The expression ""intention in common"" in s. 21(2)  means only that
the party and the principal must have in mind the same unlawful purpose.  The
expression does not connote a mutuality of motives and desires between them.  A
person would thus fall within the ambit of s. 21(2)  if he intended to
assist in the commission of the same offence envisioned by the principal,
regardless of the fact that their intention might be due solely to the
principal's threats.  The comments in Paquette on the relation between
duress and mens rea in the context of s. 21(2)  can therefore no longer
be considered the law in Canada.  While it is not open to persons charged under
ss. 21(1) (b) and 21(2)  to argue that because their acts were
coerced by threats they lacked the requisite mens rea, such persons may
seek to have their conduct excused through the operation of the common law
defence of duress.

 

                   An accused person
cannot rely on the common law defence of duress if he had an opportunity to
extricate himself safely from the situation of duress.  The rationale for the
""safe avenue of escape"" rule is simply that, in such circumstances,
the condition of ""normative involuntariness"" that provides the
theoretical basis for the defences of both duress and necessity is absent. 
Indeed, if the accused had the chance to take action that would have allowed
him to avoid committing an offence, it cannot be said that he had no real
choice when deciding whether or not to break the law.  Furthermore, the
internal logic of the excuse‑based defence, which has theoretical
underpinnings directly analogous to those that support the defence of
necessity, suggests that the question of whether or not a safe avenue of escape
existed is to be determined according to an objective standard.  When
considering the perceptions of a ""reasonable person"", however, the
personal circumstances of the accused are relevant and important, and should be
taken into account.

 

                   The trial judge's
charge to the jury contained several errors.  First, the reference to the
relevant mental state in this case as being a ""common intention"" to
carry out an unlawful purpose was incorrect, since what was at issue here was
s. 21(1) (b), as opposed to s. 21(2) .  Second, the trial
judge's instruction that the mens rea for party liability under
s. 21(1) (b) could be ""negated"" by duress was also
incorrect.  Thirdly, and most importantly, the jury was not told that even if
the accused possessed the requisite mens rea his conduct could be
excused by operation of the common law defence of duress, if the jurors were of
the view that the necessary conditions for this defence's application were
present.  Since it cannot be said that the errors in the charge relating to the
nature of the defence of duress necessarily had no effect on the verdict, a new
trial should be ordered.  It should be noted, however, that the trial judge did
not err in instructing the jury that the accused could not rely on the defence
of duress if the Crown established that he had failed to avail himself of a
safe avenue of escape.  Furthermore, while the trial judge should have
instructed the jury that the existence of such an avenue was to be determined
objectively, taking into account the personal circumstances of the accused, on
the particular facts of this case his failure to do so did not affect the
jury's decision, since there was no indication, on the facts, that any of the
accused's personal attributes or frailties rendered him unable to identify any
safe avenues of escape that would have been apparent to a reasonable person of
ordinary capacities and abilities.

1                 Lamer
C.J. -- This appeal presents a number of important questions, each
having to do with the role of duress as a defence to criminal charges.  In
order to resolve these issues, we must first examine the theoretical basis
underlying the rule that criminal liability does not attach to a person who
commits the actus reus of an offence as a result of threats of death or
bodily harm from a third party.  In particular, this Court must decide whether
it is open to a person charged as a party to an offence to argue that, because
his or her actions were coerced, he or she did not possess the mens rea
necessary for party liability.  This argument  must be weighed against the
alternative position -- namely, that duress does not ""negate"" the mens
rea for party liability, but that persons who commit certain criminal acts
under duress may nonetheless be excused from criminal liability under the
common law ""defence of duress"".  It is also necessary for the Court
to address certain questions having to do with limitations on this defence's
availability.  Specifically, we are asked to determine whether accused persons
are foreclosed from recourse to the defence if they failed to avail themselves
of a ""safe avenue of escape"" from the situation of coercion when such
a safe avenue was available.  If this is indeed the case, we must go on to
consider whether the existence of such a ""safe avenue"" is to be
determined on an objective basis, or from the subjective viewpoint of the
accused.

 

 

I.  Factual Background

 

2                 On November 25, 1991, shortly
before 1:00 a.m., Fitzroy Cohen was shot four times with a semi-automatic
handgun as he stood in the lobby of the apartment building he lived in.  The
shots were fired by Mark Bailey, an acquaintance of Cohen whom Cohen knew by
his street names, ""Quasi"" or ""Dogheart"".  At the time of
the shooting, Bailey was accompanied by the appellant, Lawrence Hibbert, who
was a close friend of Cohen.  Cohen had descended from his apartment to the
lobby at the appellant’s request, unaware that Bailey was waiting below with
gun in hand.

 

3                 Cohen survived the shooting.  At
the appellant's trial, Cohen testified that for some time prior to the shooting
he had been aware that Bailey was seeking a confrontation with him.  Bailey,
Cohen believed, was seeking revenge for an incident that had taken place the
previous year, in which Bailey had been robbed by a rival drug dealer named
Andrew Reid while Cohen and several others stood by, watching and laughing. 
Cohen testified that he had been told that Bailey had subsequently attacked one
of the men involved in the robbery on a busy street, firing several shots at
him (but missing).  He also knew that Andrew Reid had been murdered.  Cohen
said that he had told the appellant, whom he described as his ""best
friend"", about the robbery of Bailey.

 

4                 The appellant, who testified at
trial, stated that at the time of the shooting he owed Bailey $100 as payment
for drugs he had purchased from him some months earlier.   He testified that he
had been attempting to avoid Bailey, but that on the evening of November 24,
1991 he had accidentally run into him in the lobby of an apartment building in
Etobicoke where he had gone to visit friends.  Bailey had approached the
appellant and indicated that he was armed with a handgun.  The appellant
testified that Bailey ordered him to take him to Cohen’s apartment.  When he
refused, the appellant stated, Bailey had led him to the basement and punched
him in the face several times.  The appellant testified that he feared for his
life, and that he believed that Bailey would shoot him if he continued to
refuse to assist him.  He stated that it was this fear that led him to agree to
lead Bailey to Cohen's apartment.

 

5                 Bailey and the appellant went
out to Bailey's car, where Bailey's girlfriend and another young woman were
waiting.  The appellant got into the back seat, while Bailey drove.  The women
testified that the appellant was quiet during the drive, but that his mood was
neither noticeably happy or unhappy.  At trial, one of the young women recalled
that the appellant had made a remark to the effect that ""this might be the
last time [I'm] going to see you"".

 

6                 Bailey dropped the two women off
at their apartment, and told the appellant to get into the front seat.  The
appellant testified that they stopped at a telephone booth, and that Bailey
ordered him to call Cohen and ask him to meet him downstairs in twenty
minutes.  The appellant did so, telling Cohen that he ""had something for
him"".  According to the appellant, Bailey stood by the phone booth during
his conversation with Cohen, and could hear what the appellant said to Cohen. 
Cohen and his girlfriend, Beverley St. Hillaire, confirmed that they had
received a telephone call from the appellant, essentially as the appellant
described.  They testified that the appellant had sounded ""normal"",
but that he had been more abrupt than he usually was.

 

7                 Bailey and Hibbert arrived at
Cohen's apartment building approximately half an hour after making the phone
call.  The appellant testified that Bailey drew his gun and pointed it at him
as they got out of the car.  They went to the front door of the building where,
following Bailey's orders, the appellant called Cohen's apartment on the
building intercom, while Bailey kept his gun trained on him.  The appellant's
testimony, which was confirmed by Cohen, was that ordinarily when visiting
Cohen he would not use the building’s front door, but would instead enter the
building through a side door that could be opened from the outside using a
technique Cohen had taught him.  Cohen also confirmed the appellant's testimony
that he had asked Cohen to ""come down"" to the lobby, but that he had
not asked Cohen to ""buzz him in"" (i.e., press a button on the
intercom that would unlock the building's outer door).  The appellant testified
that he had hoped that Cohen would not unlock the building’s front door, so
that when he came downstairs he would see Bailey through the locked glass outer
door and have a chance to retreat to safety.  However, Cohen buzzed the outer
door open without being asked to do so, and Bailey and the appellant went into
the lobby.

 

8                 According to the testimony of
both Cohen and Hibbert, Cohen took the stairs from his second-floor apartment
to the lobby.  When he emerged into the lobby, he was met by Bailey, who
grabbed him and pointed the gun at his chest, saying ""You're dead now
pussy.""  Bailey led Cohen into the ground floor hallway, where (according
to both Cohen and the appellant’s testimony) he turned to Hibbert and told him
to ""stay some place where I [can] see you"".  After a brief exchange
of words with Cohen, Bailey pushed Cohen away and fired four shots at him,
striking him in the groin, legs and buttocks.  Saying ""Come, Pigeon""
(the appellant’s nickname), Bailey and the appellant left the building by the
side door.  Cohen testified that during the incident the appellant said
nothing, and made no effort to intervene.  He described the appellant as
""all sweating"", and said that the appellant was unable to look at
him.  The appellant, however, testified that he had repeatedly pleaded with
Bailey, ""Quasi don't kill him.""

 

9                 The appellant testified that
from the moment he first encountered Bailey that evening he had believed Bailey
would shoot him if he refused to cooperate, and stated that he had been
""terrified"" throughout his time in Bailey’s company.  Under
cross-examination, he declared that he believed that he had had no opportunity
to run away or warn Cohen without being shot.

 

10               After leaving the building, Bailey
drove the appellant back to Etobicoke.  The appellant testified that Bailey
threatened to kill him if he went to the police.  Upon his return to Etobicoke,
the appellant spoke to Cohen's brother about what had happened, and called
Cohen's mother and Cohen's apartment.  He subsequently called his own mother,
before going to sleep.  The next morning, he turned himself in to the police. 
Bailey, however, was never apprehended.

 

11               The appellant was charged with
attempted murder.  On March 19, 1992, following a trial by jury in the Ontario
Court of Justice (General Division) presided over by Webber J., he was
acquitted of this charge, but was convicted of the included offence of
aggravated assault and sentenced to four years imprisonment.  On July 15, 1993
his appeal of his conviction to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed,
although the court allowed his appeal from sentence, reducing his sentence from
four years to time served (some fifteen months).

 

 

II.  Relevant Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

                   8. ...

 

                   (3)
Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a
justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force
and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any
other Act of Parliament except in so far as they are altered by or are
inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of Parliament.

 

 

                   17.  A person who commits an offence
under compulsion by threats of immediate death or bodily harm from a person who
is present when the offence is committed is excused for committing the offence
if the person believes that the threats will be carried out and if the person
is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby the person is subject to
compulsion, but this section does not apply where the offence that is committed
is high treason or treason, murder, piracy, attempted murder, sexual assault,
sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm,
aggravated sexual assault, forcible abduction, hostage taking, robbery, assault
with a weapon or causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, unlawfully causing
bodily harm, arson or an offence under sections 280 to 283 (abduction and
detention of young persons).

 

 

                   21.  (1) Every one is a party to an
offence who

 

(a) 
actually commits it;

 

(b) 
does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it;
or

 

(c) 
abets any person in committing it.

 

 

                   (2) 
Where two or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful
purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of them, in carrying out
the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have
known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying
out the common purpose is a party to that offence.

 

 

III.  Decisions Below

 

Ontario Court of Justice (General
Division)

 

12               Webber J. charged the jury on the
defence of duress in the following terms:

 

                   If
you find the Crown has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Hibbert did
acts or omitted to do something, for the purpose of, or with the intention of
aiding in the commission of the crime, he is not guilty.  If you do so find the
Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that situation, then Hibbert is
guilty, subject, of course, to the question of duress which was addressed to
you by counsel.

 

                   Duress
is a common law defence available to Mr. Hibbert.  The defence asserts Hibbert
participated in the shooting of Cohen because he was compelled to do so.  I
direct you, if Hibbert joined in the common plot to shoot Cohen, under threats
of death or grievous bodily harm, that would negative his having a common
intention with Quasi [i.e., Bailey] to shoot Cohen, and [sic] you must
find Hibbert not guilty.  These threats can be expressed or implied.  You look
to the evidence for that particular finding.  Put another way, a person whose
actions have been dictated by fear of grievous bodily injury cannot be said to
have formed a genuine common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose with
the person who has threatened him with those consequences if he fails to
co-operate.  Please note that the accused cannot rely on this defence if a safe
avenue of escape exists, which again, is a matter for you to find when you
consider the evidence.

 

                   Finally,
the onus always remains on the Crown throughout.  It is their duty to negative
the defence of duress.  The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, their
case, and if a doubt exists it must be resolved in favour of the accused.

 

13               During its deliberations, the jury
sent a note to the trial judge asking the following question:

 

Please
explain ""duress"" and how it may be negated, especially regarding a
reasonable opportunity to escape from confinement.  Thank you.  The jury is
unclear on this matter in order to determine  verdict.

 

After discussing the question with
counsel, Webber J. decided to repeat the portion of his original charge that dealt
with duress, and add to it portions of a standard jury charge taken from a book
prepared by British Columbia judges.  After an objection by the Crown, however,
it was agreed that he would omit all references in the latter charge to the
""reasonable person"" standard.  His recharge on the subject of duress
proceeded as follows:

 

                   Duress
is a defence available to Hibbert.  The defence asserts Hibbert participated in
the shooting of Cohen because he was compelled to do so.  I direct you, that if
Hibbert joined in the common plot to shoot Cohen under threats of death or
grievous bodily harm, that would negative his having a common intention with
Quasi [Bailey] to shoot Cohen and [sic] you must find Hibbert not
guilty.  Then I said to you, those threats can be expressed or implied, and you
look to all of the evidence to determine that issue.

 

                   Put
another way, a person whose actions had been dictated by fear of death or
grievous bodily injury cannot be said to have formed a genuine common intention
to carry out an unlawful purpose with the person who has threatened him with
those consequences if he fails to co-operate.  Please note, the accused cannot
rely on the defence of duress if a safe avenue of escape exists, which is a
question of fact for you as the judges of fact to find.  I concluded my remarks
to you by using these words:  finally, the onus remains on the Crown
throughout.  It is their duty to negative the defence of duress.  The Crown
must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  If a doubt exists, it must be
resolved in favour of the accused.

 

                   I
add two further matters to my original charge, the first dealing with escape
from the place.  This ingredient of duress is that the person must not have an
obvious safe avenue of escape from the person making the threat.  This means
that you should examine all of the evidence and determine whether Hibbert could
have avoided acting as he did by running away or by seeking police protection.

 

                   Then
the final point, which ties in with the matter of reasonable doubt.  I will put
it to you this way.  The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defence of duress cannot succeed.  The accused does not have to prove
anything.  Keep in mind these three things.

 

1)  
If you accept the evidence in support of the defence of duress, you must return
a verdict of not guilty.

 

2)  
If you do not accept the evidence in support of the defence of duress, but you
are left in a reasonable doubt by it, as I defined that term for you, you must
also return a verdict of not guilty.

 

3) 
Even if you are not left in a reasonable doubt by the evidence in support of
the defence of duress, you must still go on to consider whether or not, on the
basis of all of the evidence, the accused Hibbert is guilty.

 

14               After deliberating for nearly a
day, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the charge of attempted
murder, but convicted the appellant of the lesser included offence of
aggravated assault.  Webber J. subsequently sentenced him to a four-year prison
term.

 

Ontario Court of Appeal (Houlden, Tarnopolsky and Krever
JJ.A.)

 

15               The reasons of the Court of Appeal
dismissing the appellant's appeal from conviction were as follows (in their
entirety):

 

                   The
application to admit fresh evidence is dismissed.  Counsel for the appellant
concedes that, on the basis of the question from the jury, it is clear that the
jury found that the appellant was subjected to compulsion, but they were
concerned with whether he had a safe avenue of escape.  The trial judge left it
to the jury to determine whether the appellant had a safe avenue of escape. 
Defence counsel referred to the relevant evidence on this issue in her address
to the jury, and the trial judge summarized the relevant evidence in his
charge.  On the facts of this case we believe that the charge on this point was
sufficient.  The appeal against conviction is accordingly dismissed.

 

The Court of Appeal went on to allow
the appellant's sentence appeal, reducing his sentence to time served
(approximately fifteen months).

 

IV.  Grounds for Appeal

 

16               Lawrence Hibbert appeals his
conviction to this Court on the grounds that the trial judge's charge to the
jury on the issue of duress contained several errors.  First, he argues, the
trial judge erred by instructing the jury that the defence of duress operated
by ""negativing common intention"".  The appellant objects further to
the trial judge's statement that the defence of duress was unavailable to an
accused who failed to avail himself or herself of a ""safe avenue of
escape"".  As an alternative to the latter argument, the appellant submits
that even if the ""safe avenue of escape"" rule exists, the trial judge
erred by not advising the jury that the existence or non-existence of such an
avenue was to be determined by reference to the appellant's subjective belief.

 

V.  Analysis

 

A. Introduction

 

17               The issues raised in this appeal
must be analysed in several stages.  First, it is necessary to consider the
fundamental question of why it is that a person who performs an act that would
otherwise constitute the actus reus of a criminal offence will not be
held criminally liable at common law if he or she did so as a result of threats
of death or bodily harm.  That is, we must examine the theoretical nature of
the common law defence of duress, and determine its relationship to basic mens
rea principles. We must also consider the question of whether the
availability  of the defence of duress is limited by a ""safe avenue of
escape"" rule.  Once these questions have been addressed, it will then be
possible to assess the learned trial judge's charge to the jury on duress, and
to determine whether the jurors were correctly advised of the principles they
were to apply in their deliberations.

                   

B. The Relationship Between Mens
Rea and the Defence of Duress

 

                   (1) The Common
Law Defence of Duress in Canada

 

18               The defence of ""duress per
minas"" (""duress by threat"") has a long history at common
law.  References to the defence can be found in the writings of such venerable
commentators as Hale and Blackstone (see J. Ll. J. Edwards, ""Compulsion,
Coercion and Criminal Responsibility"" (1951), 14 Mod. L. Rev. 297,
at pp. 298-99; and P. Rosenthal, ""Duress in the Criminal Law""
(1989-90), 32 Crim. L.Q. 199, at pp. 200ff.).  In spite of the defence’s
antiquity, however, many important aspects of its nature and its details have
remained unresolved, or have been shrouded with uncertainty. As Professor
Edwards, supra, observed in 1951 (at p. 297):

 

                   Judged
by the absence of any satisfactory modern authority, it must be very rare for
the accused to set up as a defence that he committed the alleged crime under
the compulsion of another person.  Indeed the whole field of learning on this
defence to criminal liability is both meagre and unsatisfactory.

 

19               In Canada, a defence of duress was
included in the first Criminal Code  enacted in 1892 (S.C. 1892, c. 29). 
Section 12 of the original Code (the predecessor of the current Code's
s. 17 ) provided that ""compulsion by threats of immediate death or grievous
bodily harm from a person actually present at the commission of the offence
shall be an excuse for [its] commission"" (subject to certain specified
conditions being met).  For many years, it seems to have been generally assumed
(although never conclusively established) that the existence of a codified 
version  of the defence of duress left no room for further development of the
common law defence in Canada.  As Ritchie J. remarked, obiter, in R.
v. Carker, [1967] S.C.R. 114, at p. 117:

 

[I]n
respect of proceedings for an offence under the Criminal Code  the common
law rules and principles respecting ""duress"" as an excuse or defence
have been codified and exhaustively defined in s. 17 ....

 

In Paquette v. The Queen,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 189, however, this Court determined that s. 17 of the Code
does not constitute an exhaustive codification of the law of duress.  Rather,
the Court held, s. 17  applies only to persons who commit offences as principals. 
Accordingly, it remains open to persons who are liable as parties to
offences to invoke the common law defence of duress, which remains in existence
by virtue of s. 8(3) of the Code (which preserves those common law
defences not expressly altered or eliminated by Parliament).  The common law
rules governing situations of duress thus remain an important aspect of
Canadian criminal law.

 

20               The holding in Paquette
that the common law defence of duress is available to persons liable as parties
is clear and unambiguous, and has stood as the law in Canada for almost twenty
years.  The case has a second aspect, however, that is less firmly established,
having given rise to differing interpretations, and having been the subject of
considerable debate in the legal community.  The controversy stems from certain
comments made by Martland J. on the issue of the relationship between duress
and the mens rea for party liability under s. 21(2) of the Code. 
The facts in Paquette were as follows.  The accused had been charged as
a party to non-capital murder.  He had driven two acquaintances, Clermont and
Simard, to a store.  After Paquette had dropped them off, Clermont and Simard
robbed the store, and during the course of the robbery an innocent bystander
was shot and killed.  Paquette was not present at the shooting, having driven
away from the store once Clermont and Simard had entered.  Although he circled
the block and returned to the store, there was evidence that he had refused to
let Clermont and Simard get back into the car.  In a statement made to the
police, Paquette indicated that he had driven Clermont and Simard to the scene
of the crime only after Clermont had pointed a gun at him and threatened to
kill him if he refused.  At trial, the issue of duress had been left to the jury,
which acquitted the accused.  On appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a
new trial, on the grounds that the statutory defence of duress contained in s.
17 of the Code could not, by the express terms of the section, be
invoked as a defence to a charge of murder or robbery.

 

21               As noted above, the main holding
of the Court was that s. 17  applied only to principals and not to parties, from
which it followed that Paquette could rely on the common law defence of duress,
to which the restrictions set out in s. 17  did not apply.  Martland J. went on,
however, to make an observation regarding duress and the mental element of
party liability under s. 21(2) of the Code, stating (at p. 197):

 

A
person whose actions have been dictated by fear of death or of grievous bodily
injury cannot be said to have formed a genuine common intention to carry
out an unlawful purpose with the person who has threatened him with those
consequences if he fails to co-operate. [Emphasis added.]

 

The significance of this comment in
terms of the judgment as a whole is rather difficult to determine.  Martland J.
had earlier endorsed the decision of the House of Lords in Director of
Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland  v. Lynch, [1975] A.C. 653, in
which a majority of the House of Lords had clearly taken the view that the
common law defence of duress provided an excuse, rather than operating
by negating mens rea. Thus, Martland J. evidently did not intend to
suggest that duress provides a defence at common law only when the
accused’s culpable mental state can be said to have been ""negated"". 
Instead, he appears to have been holding out an alternative route by which a
person charged as a party under s. 21(2)  could escape criminal liability,
distinct from the ""defence of duress"" per se -- that is, a
""defence"" founded not on concepts of excuse or justification, but
based instead on the absence of an essential element of the offence.

 

22               Seen in this way, Paquette
stands for the proposition that duress can provide a ""defence"" in
either of two distinct ways -- as an excuse, or by ""negating"" mens
rea.  In the present case, the appellant argues that this is a correct view
of the law, and submits that the trial judge erred by not placing both
alternatives before the jury.  What  falls to be considered, therefore, is the
validity of the proposition that the mens rea for party liability under
the Criminal Code  can be ""negated"" by threats of death or
bodily harm.  That is, the Court is called upon to reconsider whether the
second aspect of our judgment in Paquette reflects a correct
understanding of the law of duress in Canada.

 

(2) Duress
and Mens Rea

 

23               That threats of death or serious
bodily harm can have an effect on a person’s state of mind is indisputable. 
However, it is also readily apparent that a person who carries out the actus
reus of a criminal offence in response to such threats will not necessarily
lack the mens rea for that offence.  Whether he or she does or not will
depend both on what the mental element of the offence in question happens to
be, and on the facts of the particular case.  As a practical matter, though,
situations where duress will operate to ""negate"" mens rea will
be exceptional, for the simple reason that the types of mental states that are
capable of being ""negated"" by duress are not often found in the
definitions of criminal offences.

 

24               In general, a person who performs
an action in response to a threat will know what he or she is doing, and
will be aware of the probable consequences of his or her actions. Whether or
not he or she desires the occurrence of these consequences will depend
on the particular circumstances.  For example, a person who is forced at
gunpoint to drive a group of armed ruffians to a bank will usually know that
the likely result of his or her actions will be that an attempt will be made to
rob the bank, but he or she may not desire this result -- indeed, he or she may
strongly wish that the robbers' plans are ultimately foiled, if this could
occur without risk to his or her own safety.  In contrast, a person who is told
that his or her child is being held hostage at another location and will be
killed unless the robbery is successful will almost certainly have an active
subjective desire that the robbery succeed.  While the existence of threats
clearly has a bearing on the motive underlying each actor’s respective
decision to assist in the robbery, only the first actor can be said not to desire that
the robbery take place, and neither actor can be said not to have knowledge of
the consequences of their actions. To determine whether mens rea is
""negated"" in a particular case, therefore, the first question that
must be asked is whether the mental element of the offence in question is
defined in such a way that either an actor’s motives or his or her immediate
desires have any direct relevance.  As A. W. Mewett and M. Manning explain:

 

                   Mens
rea...has more than
one meaning.  It can entail a purpose, a desire to  achieve an objective; it
can entail merely knowledge that consequences will follow or that circumstances
exist; it can entail only recklessness, that is, some advertent or perhaps
inadvertent disregard of the consequences or circumstances.  What suffices for
liability depends upon the particular offence with which we are dealing.  If a
person is compelled to do an act which he does not wish to do, and therefore
does it ""against his will"", why, it may be asked, does he have a
defence not of compulsion but simply of lack of mens rea?  The answer is
that this is quite true, but only if the mens rea required for the
particular offence in question is of the sort that is negatived by a person being
compelled to do something against his will.

(Mewett
& Manning on Criminal Law (3rd ed. 1994), at p. 520.)

 

25               As Dickson J. (as he then was)
observed in Lewis v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 821, at p. 831,
""[t]he mental element of a crime ordinarily involves no reference to
motive"". Instead, he noted, ""[i]n most criminal trials, the mental
element, the mens rea with which the court is concerned, relates to
‘intent’"".  Intention, however, is distinct from desire or subjective wish. 
As Lord Simon of Glaisdale (dissenting, but on another issue) stated in Lynch,
supra, at p. 690:

 

[A]n
intention to bring about a consequence of an act can co-exist with a desire
that such consequence should not ensue.... [A] wish is a particular
instance of desire.... [T]herefore, an intention to perform the
act with foreseen consequences can co-exist with a wish not to perform
an act or that its consequences should not ensue (this is crucial in
considering the juridical effect of duress). [Emphasis in original.]

 

Parliament is, of course, entitled to
define the mental element of criminal offences in whatever manner it sees fit
(subject, of course, to the requirements of s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms : see, for instance, Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 486; R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636; R. v.
Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633; and R. v. Logan, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
731).  Thus, Parliament could choose to make it an element of a given offence
that the perpetrator have some particular desire at the time of the
commission of the actus reus, or even make it a precondition for
liability that an actor have a particular motive for performing a
prohibited act.  In the present appeal, of course, we are not called upon to
conduct an exhaustive review of the Criminal Code  for the purposes of
identifying any or all offences with mental elements that might be capable of
being negated by duress.  Rather, the present case, like Paquette,
involves the special situation of liability under s. 21 of the Code. 
Thus, our analysis can be restricted to the question of whether the mens rea
requirements for party liability contained in s. 21  are of the sort that can,
in some circumstances, be ""negated"" by coercion.  Since the sole
aspect of s. 21  left with the jury in the appellant's trial was s. 21(1) (b),
the analysis could, strictly speaking, be restricted to that subsection.  It is
difficult, however, to embark upon an examination of the mental element of s.
21(1) (b) without being seen as inferentially commenting on s. 21(2) ,
thereby calling into question the Court's holding in Paquette, supra. 
In my view, in order to avoid creating undue confusion and uncertainty in the
law, it is appropriate that we address the issue of the continued validity of Paquette's
statements on the relation between duress and mens rea under s. 21(2) 
head on.  I will thus extend my analysis beyond what is strictly necessary for
the resolution of the present appeal by, considering s. 21(2)  in addition
to s. 21(1) (b).    

 

(3) The
Mens Rea Requirements for Party Liability Under Section 21

 

(a) Section
21(1) (b)

 

26               As noted earlier, s. 21(1) (b)
imposes criminal liability as a party on anyone who ""does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit"" an offence. 
Although a person who is a party to an offence is guilty of committing that
offence, rather than a separate crime (as is the case for accessories after the
fact), s. 21(1) (b) contains its own mens rea requirement,
distinct from that applicable to the principal who actually commits the
underlying offence.  As the subsection states, party liability as an
""aider"" requires acts or omissions ""for the purpose"" of
aiding the commission of the offence.  In order to understand what effect, if
any, duress might have on the mens rea of an aider, it is thus necessary
to determine what ""for the purpose"" means in this context.

 

27               It is impossible to ascribe a
single fixed meaning to the term ""purpose"".  In ordinary usage, the
word is employed in two distinct senses.  One can speak of an actor doing
something ""on purpose"" (as opposed to by accident) thereby equating
purpose with ""immediate intention"".  The term is also used, however,
to indicate the ultimate ends an actor seeks to achieve, which imports the idea
of ""desire"" into the definition.  This dual sense is apparent in the
word’s dictionary definition.  For instance, the Oxford English Dictionary
(2nd ed. 1989) defines ""purpose"" alternatively as ""[t]hat which
one sets before oneself as a thing to be done or attained; the object which one
has in view"" and as ""[t]he action or fact of intending or meaning to
do something; intention, resolution, determination"".  The first of these
definitions reflects the notion of one's ""purpose"" as relating to
one's ultimate object or desire, while the latter conveys the notion of
""purpose"" as being synonymous with ""intention"".

 

28               Commentators who have considered
the meaning of ""purpose"" in definitions of criminal offences have
come to differing conclusions on the question of which of these alternate
meanings is more appropriate in this context.  Professor E. Colvin, for
instance, argues on behalf of the ""purpose as desire"" interpretation
in his text Principles of Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1991).  He states (at
pp. 121-22):

 

The
terms ""direct intention"" and ""desire"" are sometimes used
instead of purpose.  The latter term, however, best describes the relevant
state of mind.  In ordinary language descriptions of action, the concept of
purpose usually refers to an actor's reasons for doing what he did....
[Emphasis in original.]

 

According to Colvin, ""an actor's
purpose was to accomplish something if the prospect of its occurrence played a
causal role in his decision to do what he did"" (p. 122).  The actor's
knowledge that his actions will result in the occurrence, however, is not
determinative.  As Colvin states (at p. 123):

 

                   If
it is to be concluded that an actor's purpose in doing something did not
include an outcome which was foreseen, then the actor must have been genuinely
opposed or indifferent to it.  Purpose is not negatived where an actor chose
to bring about the outcome as a means of attaining some further objective.
[Emphasis in original.]

 

29               Other commentators, however, have
questioned this equation of ""purpose"" with ""desire"",
arguing instead that a person who consciously performs an act knowing the
consequences that will (with some degree of certainty) flow from it
""intends"" these consequences or causes them ""on purpose"",
regardless of whether he or she desired them.  As Mewett and Manning
state:

 

[T]he
distinction between purpose/intent and knowledge/intent does not work, because
if there is, given an awareness of the consequences of an act, a freedom of
choice as to whether one acts or not, by choosing to act those consequences
have been chosen.  If intent is the choosing of consequences, it does not make
any difference to the existence of the intent whether the accused wants those
consequences to follow or merely knows that they will follow, without
necessarily desiring them to do so.

 

                   ""Intent"",
is not a very descriptive word.  Mens rea connotes volition on the part
of the accused, that is to say, given an awareness that certain consequences
will follow (or will probably follow) if he acts, an accused who chooses to act
when he has the alternative of not acting ""intends"" those consequences
in the sense of choosing to bring them about.  It seems not only unnecessary
but positively misleading to attempt to distinguish between purpose/intent and
knowledge/intent.

(Criminal
Law (2nd ed. 1985), at p. 113.)

 

A similar argument is made by the
English authors J. C. Smith and B. Hogan:

 

[A]
person may know that he cannot achieve his purpose, A, without bringing about
some other result, B.  If he is to bring about A, he knows he must also, at the
same time or earlier, bring about B.  It may be that, in any other
circumstances, he would much rather B did not happen, indeed its occurrence may
be abhorrent to him.  But, the choice being between going without A and having
A and B, he decides to have A and B.  It seems fair to say that he intends to
cause B as well as A.

(Criminal
Law (7th ed. 1992), at p. 55.)

30               As this debate reveals, the term
""purpose"" is capable of bearing two distinct meanings, both of which
can be supported by reasoned arguments.  In a case, such as this one, where an
interpretation of the term in a specific statutory context is required, the
court’s task is to determine which of the two possible meanings best accords
with Parliament's intention in drafting the particular statutory provision at
issue.  In other words, our task in the present case is to consider the meaning
of ""purpose"" as it is employed in s. 21(1)(b) of the Code
in light of the Parliamentary objective underlying the subsection.  It must be
emphasized, however, that the word ""purpose"" is employed in many
different sections of the Criminal Code , in a number of distinct
contexts.  My conclusions in the present case on the proper interpretation of
the word ""purpose"" as it is employed in s. 21(1)(b) of the Code
are thus restricted to this particular subsection.  It may well be that in the
context of some other statutory provision a different interpretation of the
term will prove to be the most appropriate.

 

31               As I said, when Parliament drafts
a statute in language that, on its face, supports more than one meaning, it is
appropriate for a court to consider which of the alternative interpretations
that are available best accords with Parliament’s intention (see my remarks in R.
v. McIntosh, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, at pp. 697ff.).  As I will explain, I am
of the view that in the context of s. 21(1)(b) of the Code, the
second of the two meanings of ""purpose"" discussed above -- that is,
the interpretation that equates ""purpose"" with ""intention""
-- best reflects the legislative intent underlying the subsection.  In
contrast, adopting the first interpretation of ""purpose"" (the
""purpose"" equals ""desire"" interpretation) to describe the mens
rea for aiding in s. 21(1) (b) would, in my view, create a number of
theoretical and practical difficulties that Parliament is unlikely to have
envisioned or intended. 

 

32               The problems associated with the
""purpose equals desire"" interpretation are several.  First,
incorporating the accused's feelings about the desirability of the commission
of an offence by the principal into the definition of the mens rea for
""aiding"" can result in distinctions being made which appear arbitrary
and unreasonable in light of the policy underlying s. 21(1) (b).  As
Professor Colvin notes, under the ""purpose equals desire""
interpretation a person would not be guilty of aiding in the commission of an
offence if he or she were ""genuinely opposed or indifferent to it""
(p. 123).  The reason for the aider’s indifference or opposition would be
immaterial.  The perverse consequences that flow from this are clearly
illustrated by the following hypothetical situation described by Mewett and
Manning:

 

                   If
a man is approached by a friend who tells him that he is going to rob a bank
and would like to use his car as the getaway vehicle for which he will pay him
$100, when that person is...charged under s. 21 for doing something for
the purpose of aiding his friend to commit the offence, can he say ""My
purpose was not to aid the robbery but to make $100""?  His argument would
be that while he knew that he was helping the robbery, his desire was to obtain
$100 and he did not care one way or the other whether the robbery was
successful or not.

(Criminal
Law, supra, at p. 112.)

 

I agree with the authors' conclusion
that ""[t]hat would seem an absurd result"" (p. 112). As I noted
in McIntosh, supra, at pp. 704-5, ""[a]bsurdity is a factor
to consider in the interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions"". 
That is, to quote the words of La Forest J.A. (as he then was) in New
Brunswick v. Estabrooks Pontiac Buick Ltd. (1982), 44 N.B.R. (2d) 201, at
p. 210, ""[t]he fact that the words as interpreted would give an
unreasonable result...is certainly ground for the courts to scrutinize a
statute carefully to make abundantly certain that those words are not
susceptible of another interpretation"".  In my view, the absurdity that
would flow from the equation of ""purpose"" with ""desire""
cannot legitimately be ascribed to Parliamentary intention. This serves to cast
considerable doubt on the correctness of this interpretation of the word
""purpose"" in this context, especially when one recalls that there
exists an alternative interpretation of the word that can just as accurately be
said to reflect its ""plain meaning"", under which this absurdity would
be avoided.

 

33               A further guide to Parliament's
intention can be gleaned from an examination of the common law governing party
liability.  Although s. 21 of the Code was intended to simplify the law
governing parties by eliminating the old distinctions drawn at common law
between principals in the first and second degree, accessories before the fact,
etc., there is no indication, in the section or elsewhere, of any intention by
Parliament to radically alter the basic principles of party liability,
including its mental element.  As Mewett and Manning state:

 

It
must...be kept in mind that the conduct that gave rise to criminal liability at
common law remains the basis of modern liability and while the former labels
have gone, the principles remain.

(Mewett
& Manning on Criminal Law, supra, at p. 268.)

 

For this reason, cases dealing with
party liability at common law can be instructive when interpreting s. 21 of the
Code.

 

34               The leading English case on the
issue of whether duress negates the  mens rea of parties to offences
(under the common law governing party liability) is the House of Lords’
decision in Lynch, supra.  As Professor G. Williams observes in
his Textbook of Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 624:

 

The
view taken by the majority of the House of Lords in Lynch was that
duress is a defence on its own, and does not negative either the doing of the
act charged or the mens rea.  This is plainly right.

 

Although five separate speeches were
delivered in Lynch, the general tenor of the reasons of those members of
the House who considered the issue is typified by Lord Edmund-Davies' statement
(at p. 710) that:

 

At
the end of the day, the defence of duress is probably best evaluated without
reference to its supposed relation to either actus reus or mens rea, for, in
the words of Professor Turpin [1972] C.L.J. 205, ""not every morally
exculpatory circumstance has a necessary bearing on these legal ingredients of
crime.""

 

While another aspect of the judgment
in Lynch -- the holding that the common law defence of duress was
available to persons charged with aiding or abetting murder -- was subsequently
overruled in R. v. Howe, [1987] 1 A.C. 417, in Howe the House of
Lords confirmed the statements that had been made in Lynch on the
relation between duress and mens rea.  As Lord Hailsham of Marylebone
L.C. stated in Howe (at p. 428):

 

                   The
. . . unacceptable view is that, possibly owing to a misunderstanding
which has been read into some judgments, duress as a defence affects only the
existence or absence of mens rea.  The  true view is stated by Lord Kilbrandon
(of the minority) in Lynch [1975] A.C. 653 and by Lord Edmund-Davies (of
the majority) in his analysis at p. 709.

 

Lord Bridge of Harwich took a similar
position, declaring (at p. 436), with reference to Lynch, that
""[t]he theory that the party acting under duress is so far deprived of
volition as to lack the necessary criminal intent has been clearly shown to be
fallacious....""

 

35               These English cases reveal that
the mens rea for party liability at common law is not of the sort that
is capable of being ""negated"" by duress. Put another way, it is not a
precondition for party liability at common law that an accused actively desire
that the underlying criminal offence be successfully committed.  As Lord Morris
of Borth-y-Gest stated in Lynch, supra, at p. 678 (referring to
the facts in that case):

 

If
in the present case the jury were satisfied that the car was driven towards the
garage in pursuance of a murderous plan and that the appellant knew that that
was the plan and intentionally drove the car in execution of that plan, he
could be held to have aided and abetted even though he regretted the plan or
indeed was horrified by it.  However great his reluctance, he would have
intended to aid and abet.

 

36               The position at common law, of
course, does not in and of itself determine the meaning to be ascribed to the
word ""purpose"" in the context of s. 21(1)(b) of the Code. 
It can, however, provide useful guidance when it comes to choosing between the
two interpretations of the term that are available -- one that accords with the
common law position and the other that contradicts it.  In the absence of
reason to believe that Parliament intended its enactment of s. 21(1) (b)
to radically alter the common law principles governing party liability, the
interpretation that accords with the common law would seem to also be the most
likely to accurately embody Parliament's intentions.  This observation
strengthens my conclusion that Parliament's use of the term ""purpose""
in s. 21(1) (b) should not be seen as incorporating the notion of
""desire"" into the mental state for party liability, and that the word
should instead be understood as being essentially synonymous with
""intention"".

 

37               This interpretation is, moreover,
consistent with the approach that has been taken on previous occasions by this
Court in connection with s. 21(1) (b).  In R. v. Kirkness, [1990]
3 S.C.R. 74, for instance, Cory J. (writing for a majority of the Court) stated
(at p. 88):

 

[T]he
person aiding or abetting the crime [of murder] must intend that death ensue or
intend that he or the perpetrator cause bodily harm of a kind likely to result
in death and be reckless whether death ensues or not.

 

It is implicit in this statement that
there is no requirement under s. 21(1) (b) that the person charged as a
party ""desire"" that the victim die (that is, subjectively wish that
this result come to pass), just as the principal’s intent to kill is not
negated even if, all other things being equal, he or she regrets the fact that
he or she is killing the victim.  Similarly, in R. v. Jackson, [1993] 4
S.C.R. 573, the Court commented on the mental element for conviction of murder
as a party under s. 21(1) .  Writing for the Court, McLachlin J. stated (at
p. 581):

 

In
this case, Jackson [the principal] committed the offence of murder.  It was
open on the evidence for the jury to find that Davy aided and abetted him in
that offence, and is guilty under s. 21(1) (b) and (c) of the Criminal
Code .  If he possessed the necessary mens rea for murder he could be
guilty of murder.

 

Since the mens rea requirement
for murder is satisfied if the accused means to cause the victim bodily harm
that he knows is likely to cause his death, it can be inferred that the Court
in Jackson did not believe that s. 21(1)  imposed any additional
requirement that an aider or abettor subjectively approve of or desire the
victim's death. 

 

38               Finally, I am satisfied that the
interpretation of the mens rea for liability under s. 21(1) (b)
that I am proposing will not result in unjust convictions in cases involving
coercion by threats of death or bodily harm, since in these cases the common
law defence of duress will remain available to the accused.  As I will explain
shortly, this defence, properly understood, provides an excuse to persons who
assist in the commission of offences as a result of threats of serious
violence.  On the other hand, interpreting ""purpose"" as equivalent to
""desire"" in s. 21(1) (b) would result in the introduction of
unnecessary complication into the law.  Under such an interpretation, juries in
duress cases would have to be provided with extremely complex instructions that
would, in the end, have very little, if any, impact on the final determination of
guilt or innocence.  As a matter of logic, the issue of whether an accused can
invoke an excuse or justification arises only after the Crown has proven
the existence of all the elements of the offence, including mens rea. 
Thus, if ""purpose"" were understood as incorporating
""desire"", and hence as being susceptible to ""negation"" by
duress, trial judges would have to instruct juries accordingly.  This would
require judges, and juries, to delve into the arcane issue of whether a person
who intentionally commits an offence in order to save his or her own skin
commits the offence ""on purpose"" -- a question of some philosophical
significance, perhaps, but no easy matter for a judge to explain succinctly, or
for a jury to comprehend readily.  At the same time, trial judges would also
have to  provide juries with alternative instructions on the excuse-based
common law defence of duress. While in many cases an aider who actively desires
the commission of the offence he or she aids will not be able to legitimately
claim that he or she acted under duress, this will not inevitably be so
(consider, for instance, the hypothetical example, discussed earlier, of the
parent whose child is held hostage by confederates of robbers, who is told that
the child will be released unharmed only if he or she  assists in the successful
commission of a robbery).  Consequently, in at least some cases juries would be
forced to consider two alternate legal routes leading to an acquittal by reason
of duress.  This complication would, however, have little or no practical
effect, since there will be few, if any, cases involving parties in which a
""defence"" of ""negation of mens rea by duress"" would
succeed where recourse to the excuse-based common law defence of duress would
not also lead to an acquittal.  As Professor D. Stuart observes (Canadian
Criminal Law: A Treatise (3rd ed. 1995)), introducing the notion of duress
""negating"" mens rea into the analysis serves only to muddy the
conceptual waters.  As he points out (at p. 420):

 

The
advantages [of viewing the operation of duress solely in terms of an excuse]
are more than linguistic.  If the defence of duress is viewed like any other
justification or excuse as based squarely on policy considerations allowing one
who has committed an actus reus with mens rea to escape in
certain circumstances, the policy issues are focussed without confusing the
matter as one of mens rea.

 

39               For these reasons, I conclude that
the expression ""for the purpose of aiding"" in s. 21(1) (b), properly
understood, does not require that the accused actively view the commission of
the offence he or she is aiding as desirable in and of itself. As a result, the
mens rea for aiding under s. 21(1) (b) is not susceptible of being
""negated"" by duress.  The trial judge's charge to the jury in the
present case was thus incorrect in two respects.  First, the reference to the
relevant mental state in the present case as being a ""common intention to
carry out an unlawful purpose"" was erroneous since, unlike Paquette,
what was at issue in the present case was s. 21(1) (b), as opposed to s.
21(2) .  Second, in light of the mental element for commission of an offence 
under s. 21(1) (b), the suggestion that duress might
""negate"" the accused's mens rea was also incorrect.

                   

(b) Section
21(2)  and the Decision in Paquette

 

40               The preceding discussion suffices
to resolve the question of the relation between duress and mens rea that
directly arises in the present case.  As I indicated earlier, however, I
believe that in the interests of avoiding undue confusion in the law that
applies to duress cases I should proceed further, and look expressly at the
question of whether the interpretation of s. 21(2) 's mental element that was
adopted by the Court in Paquette, supra, remains correct in light
of the interpretation of s. 21(1) (b) I am now adopting.  To be sure, the
respective mens rea requirements of the two subsections are defined
differently  -- while s. 21(1) (b) imposes party liability on
persons who ""do or omit to do anything for the purpose of aiding
any person to commit [an offence]"", s. 21(2)  establishes that
""persons [who] form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful
purpose and to assist each other therein"" are liable for criminal offences
committed by the principal that are foreseeable and probable consequences of
carrying out the ""common purpose"".   There is, however, a close
connection between the two subsections, arising from the evident similarities
that exist between certain aspects of s. 21(2) 's requirements and the
terms of s. 21(1) (b).  As I have explained in the previous section, a
person who does something ""for the purpose of aiding"" another to
commit a criminal offence (and who is thus liable under s. 21(1) (b))
invariably ""intends"" to assist the principal to carry out ""an
unlawful purpose"" -- an ""intention"" that is not susceptible of
being ""negated"" by the fact that it arises as the result of threats
of death or bodily harm.  Furthermore, the terms ""aid"" and
""assist"" are virtually synonymous.  Section 21(2) , however, contains
two further qualifications -- the accused's intention must be ""an
intention in common"" with the principal, and the intention to assist must
be reciprocal (that is, two or more persons must have ""an intention in
common...to assist each other therein"").  The question that must be
addressed, therefore, is whether these additional qualifications on the
requisite ""intention"" raise the prospect of an accused's mens rea
being ""negated"" by duress.  In particular, we must consider whether
the requirement that the accused have an ""intention in common""
with another person has this effect. 

 

41               As was the case with the term
""purpose"" in s. 21(1) (b), the phrase ""intention in
common"" is capable of being understood in more than one sense.  One
possible interpretation is that ""intention in common"" means no more
than that the two persons must have in mind the same unlawful purpose.  Alternatively,
however, it might be argued that the requirement of ""commonality""
requires that the two persons' intentions match in greater detail -- in
particular, that their motives or subjective views as to the desirability of
the commission of the ""unlawful purpose"" match up.  If this latter
interpretation were adopted, it could be argued that although persons who
assist others to commit criminal acts as a result of threats made by the others
would ""intend"" to provide such assistance, their intention would not
be ""in common"" with the intentions of the threatener, due to the
different motives and, possibly, views as to the immediate desirability of the
criminal activity at issue.  In contrast, under the former interpretation a
person would fall within the ambit of s. 21(2)  if they intended to assist in
the commission of the same offence envisioned by the principal, regardless of
the fact that their intention might be due solely to the principal's threats. 
Of course, it would be open to such a person to avoid criminal liability through
the common law defence of duress. 

 

42               As noted earlier, in Paquette,
supra, Martland J. took the position that ""intention in
common"" meant something more than ""intention to commit or aid in the
same offence"", arguing (at p. 197) that:

 

A
person whose actions have been dictated by fear of death or of grievous bodily
injury cannot be said to have formed a genuine common intention to carry out an
unlawful purpose with the person who has threatened him with those consequences
if he fails to co-operate.

 

The phrase ""intention in
common"" is certainly open to being interpreted in this manner.  However,
notwithstanding the considerable weight I place on and the respect I have for
the opinion of Martland J., I have come to the conclusion that, in the context
of s. 21(2) , the first interpretation discussed above is more consistent both
with Parliament's intention and with the interpretation of s. 21(1) (b)
I have adopted in these reasons.  Many of the factors I considered earlier in
the course of determining the meaning to be ascribed to the term
""purpose"" in s. 21(1) (b) apply with similar force to the
problem of interpreting s. 21(2) .  Parliament's purpose in enacting s. 21(2)  is
clear.  As the Ontario Court of Appeal (per Doherty J.A.) noted in R.
v. Jackson (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 385, at p. 421 (aff'd [1993] 4 S.C.R.
573):

 

[Section
21(1) ] is aimed at those who participate in the actual offence for which
liability is imposed.  Section 21(2)  widens the circle of criminal culpability
to include those who do not participate in the alleged crime but who do engage
in a different criminal purpose and foresee the commission of the alleged
offence by a party to that criminal purpose as a probable consequence of the
pursuit of the criminal purpose....

 

That is, Parliament has chosen to
impose liability on persons who engage in criminal conduct with others for
additional criminal acts that could be foreseen as likely to be committed in
furtherance of the underlying offence (within the limits imposed by the Charter :
see Logan, supra).  Interpreting the expression ""intention
in common"" as connoting a mutuality of motives and desires between the
party and the principal would restrict the scope of this section in a manner
that is difficult to justify on the basis of Parliamentary intention.  As was
the case with the interpretation of ""purpose"" in s. 21(1) (b),
adopting this interpretation of ""intention in common"" would remove
all manner of persons from the scope of s. 21(2)  in addition to those whose
intention is the product of threats of death or serious bodily harm since, once
again, the reason for the divergence in motive and desire would be
immaterial to the question of whether the party's and principal's
""intentions"" matched to a sufficient degree.  This result, I believe,
can no more be ascribed to Parliament's intention than could the similar result
that would flow from equating ""purpose"" with ""desire"" in
s. 21(1) (b), which I discussed earlier.  In my opinion, a much more
plausible interpretation of Parliament's purpose is that the
""commonality"" qualification on the subsection's mental element is
simply meant to ensure that accused persons are not convicted of crimes
committed in furtherance of offences to which they are not party to.   

 

43               Furthermore, as was the case with
s. 21(1) (b), the interpretation of s. 21(2) 's mens rea requirement
that was adopted by the Court in Paquette is not essential as a means of
ensuring the avoidance of unjust convictions in duress cases, since here, as in
cases involving s. 21(1) (b), accused persons who act under duress have
recourse to the protection from criminal liability provided by the common law
defence of duress.  At the same time, it can be seen that the interpretation of
s. 21(2)  adopted in Paquette significantly complicates the law of
duress, in so far as it requires juries to be instructed on both the manner in
which duress might ""negate"" mens rea and on the common law
defence of duress itself, notwithstanding the fact that both cover essentially
the same ground.  This problem would be exacerbated if the interpretation of s.
21(2)  in Paquette was preserved alongside the interpretation of s.
21(1) (b) that we are adopting in the present appeal.  In a significant
number of cases, the two subsections will be presented to the jury as
alternative bases for liability.  In such cases, a trial judge who was required
to follow both the holding in this case and Paquette would have to
instruct the jury that the accused's subjective view as to the desirability of
the commission of the offence was not relevant to s. 21(1) (b), but that
it was relevant to s. 21(2) , and that the existence of duress might
""negate"" mens rea under the latter (but not the former)
provision.  He or she would then have to go on to charge the jury, in the
alternative, on the common law defence of duress.  While complex jury instructions
are sometimes unavoidable if justice is to be done, I am of the view that
unnecessary complexity is something that courts should strive to avoid.  The
Canadian justice system places considerable faith in jurors' ability to follow
the trial judge's instructions.  In exchange, I believe it is incumbent on the
courts to do what they can to ease, rather than add to, the difficult burden we
call upon jurors to bear, subject, of course, to the overriding imperative that
trial fairness be preserved. 

 

44               For these reasons, I am of the
view that the comments of Martland J. in Paquette, supra, on the
relation between duress and mens rea in the context of s. 21(2)  can no
longer be considered the law in Canada.  I hasten to point out, however, that
overturning this holding in Paquette does not affect the validity of
that case's first aspect, namely, that the common law defence of duress continues
to apply in cases involving party liability under s. 21 of the Code. 
Furthermore, it can be noted in passing that, on the facts of Paquette,
the accused's acquittal could well have been supported on the basis of the
excuse provided by the common law defence of duress rather than on the notion
that his intention to assist in the commission of the robbery was
""negated"" by duress. 

 

(4)               
Conclusions on Duress and Mens Rea

 

45               The conclusions that can be
extracted from the discussion in the previous sections may be summarized as
follows:

 

1.The
fact that a person who commits a criminal act does so as a result of threats of
death or bodily harm can in some instances be relevant to the question of
whether he or she possessed the mens rea necessary to commit an
offence.  Whether or not this is so will depend, among other things, on the
structure of the particular offence in question -- that is, on whether or not
the mental state specified by Parliament in its definition of the offence is
such that the presence of coercion can, as a matter of logic, have a bearing on
the existence of mens rea.  If the offence is one where the presence of
duress is of potential relevance to the existence of mens rea, the accused
is entitled to point to the presence of threats when arguing that the Crown has
not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he or she possessed the mental state
required for liability.

 

2.A
person who commits a criminal act under threats of death or bodily harm may
also be able to invoke an excuse-based defence (either the statutory defence
set out in s. 17  or the common law defence of duress, depending on whether the
accused is charged as a principal or as a party).  This is so regardless of
whether or not the offence at issue is one where the presence of coercion also
has a bearing on the existence of mens rea.

 

3.The
mental states specified in ss. 21(1) (b) and 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  are not susceptible to being ""negated"" by duress. 
Consequently, it is not open to persons charged under these sections to argue
that because their acts were coerced by threats they lacked the requisite mens
rea.  Such persons may, however, seek to have their conduct excused
through the operation of the common law defence of duress.

 

It should be reiterated, however, that
the holding in the present case is based on an interpretation of the particular
terms of two specific offence-creating statutory provisions, ss. 21(1) (b)
and 21(2)  of the Criminal Code .  The question of whether other offences
can be found, either in the Code or in some other statute, that are
defined in such a way that the presence of coercion is relevant to the
existence of mens rea remains open.  

 

 

C. The ""Safe Avenue of
Escape"" Requirement in the Common Law of Duress

46

                   The second and
third issues raised by the appellant have to do with the so-called ""safe
avenue of escape"" rule.  The Court must decide whether such a rule in fact
exists, and, if it does, whether the availability of a ""safe avenue""
is to be determined on an objective or subjective basis.  In my opinion, it is
best to start the analysis by examining the juristic nature of the defence of
duress and its relationship to other common law defences, since I am of the
view that by so doing the answers to the questions posed in the present appeal
will become clear.

 

(1) The
Relation Between Duress and Other Excuses

 

47               As I have explained, the common
law defence of duress, properly understood, is not based on the idea that
coercion negates mens rea.  Rather, it is one of a number of defences
that operate by justifying or excusing what would otherwise be criminal
conduct.  Once duress is recognized as providing a defence of this type, it
becomes apparent that much can be learned about its juristic nature by
examining other existing legal excuses or justifications, such as the defences
of necessity, self-defence and provocation, and by considering the extent to
which analogies between these defences and the defence of duress can be drawn
and sustained.

 

48               In his submissions, the appellant
emphasized the similarities between duress and provocation, which raises a
partial defence to the charge of murder.  Although analogies can indeed be
drawn between duress and provocation, there exist significant differences
between the two defences that lessen the usefulness of comparing them. 
Firstly, and most obviously, provocation provides only a partial defence to a
single criminal offence, murder, leaving open the possibility of conviction for
manslaughter.  In contrast, the defence of duress applies to a wide range of
offences, and provides a complete bar to conviction rather than merely a
partial defence.  It is not necessary to explore the theoretical justifications
underlying these restrictions on the defence of provocation to see why their
existence poses problems for any analogies that could be drawn between
provocation and duress. 

 

49               Furthermore, there is a clear
conceptual distinction between situations where a person acts by reason of
provocation and those arising in the context of  self-defence, duress, or
necessity.  As Professor J. Horder observes (in ""Autonomy, Provocation and
Duress"", [1992] Crim. L.R. 706, at p. 709):

 

Pleas
of self-defence, duress and necessity all share [the following] common feature,
and this sets them apart in one vital respect from a plea of provocation.  For
those who act only to avert a threat act prospectively, from fear of
imminent harm, whereas those who lose their self-control and retaliate in the
face of provocation act retrospectively, inflicting injury in response
to a perceived wrongdoing that is now part of history, albeit recent history. 
If people who are threatened with imminent harm or the unjustified use of force
do not take the necessary evasive action, they believe that they will
themselves be harmed, perhaps gravely; but this is not true of people who have
been provoked but not threatened, who must know that, at most, all they have to
lose personally by inaction is their self-regard or reputation. [Emphasis in
original.]

 

For these reasons, examining the
defence of provocation does not, in my view, hold great potential as a tool for
gaining further understanding of the defence of duress.  I turn, therefore, to
the more promising analogies that can be drawn between duress and the defences
of self-defence and necessity.

 

50               The defences of self-defence,
necessity and duress all arise under circumstances where a person is subjected
to an external danger, and commits an act that would otherwise be criminal as a
way of avoiding the harm the danger presents.  In the case of self-defence and
duress, it is the intentional threats of another person that are the source of
the danger, while in the case of necessity the danger is due to other causes,
such as forces of nature, human conduct other than intentional threats of
bodily harm, etc.  Although this distinction may have important practical
consequences, it is hard to see how it could act as the source of significant
juristic differences between the three defences.  As Lord Hailsham of
Marylebone L.C. observed in Howe, supra, at p. 429:

 

There
is, of course, an obvious distinction between duress and necessity as potential
defences; duress arises from the wrongful threats or violence of another human
being and necessity arises from any other objective dangers threatening the
accused.  This, however, is, in my view a distinction without a relevant
difference, since on this view  duress is only that species of the genus of
necessity which is caused by wrongful threats.

 

In contrast, a distinction can be
drawn between self-defence, on the one hand, and duress and necessity, on the
other, that might well provide a basis for a meaningful juridical difference.
In cases of self-defence, the victim of the otherwise criminal act at issue is
himself or herself the originator of the threat that causes the actor to
commit what would otherwise be an assault or culpable homicide (bearing in
mind, of course, that the victim's threats may themselves have been provoked by
the conduct of the accused).  In this sense, he or she is the author of his or
her own deserts, a factor which arguably warrants special consideration in the
law.  In cases of duress and necessity, however, the victims of the otherwise
criminal act (to the extent that a victim can be identified) are third
parties, who are not themselves responsible for the threats or
circumstances of necessity that motivated the accused’s actions.  For this
reason, analogies between the defence of necessity and duress would appear to
be the most clearly supportable, and thus the most likely to be instructive.

 

51               The similarities between defences
of duress and necessity have been noted on previous occasions by other
commentators.  As Lord Simon of Glaisdale observed in his dissenting reasons in
Lynch, supra, at p. 692:

 

In
the circumstances where either ""necessity"" or duress is relevant,
there are both actus reus and mens rea.  In both sets of circumstances there is
power of choice between two alternatives; but one of those alternatives is so
disagreeable that even serious infraction of the criminal law seems
preferable.  In both the consequence of the act is intended, within any
permissible definition of intention.  The only difference is that in duress the
force constraining the choice is a human threat, whereas in
""necessity"" it can be any circumstance constituting a threat to life
(or, perhaps, limb).  Duress is, thus considered, merely a particular
application of the doctrine of ""necessity""....

 

In Canada, of course, a distinction
between the two defences exists as a result of the fact that the defence of
duress has been partially codified (in relation to principals) by s. 17 , while
necessity remains a purely common law defence: Perka v. The Queen, [1984]
2 S.C.R. 232.  In the present case, however, we are concerned only with those
cases of duress falling outside the ambit of s. 17 , where the common law
remains applicable -- that is, cases of party liability (Paquette, supra). 
In my view, the clear similarities between the factual circumstances in which
the common law defence of duress and the common law defence of necessity arise
imply that comparisons between the two remain highly relevant, notwithstanding
the existence of a partially codified version of the defence of duress
applicable in other situations.  It would, I believe, be highly anomalous if
the common law defence of duress were to be understood as based on
substantially different juridical principles from the common law defence of
necessity.

 

52               In Perka, supra, the
status of the defence of necessity in the common law of Canada was firmly
established.  In his majority reasons, Dickson J. summarized the considerable
debate in the academic literature over the question of whether the defence of
necessity should be conceptualized as a ""justification"" or an
""excuse"".  Dickson J. described the justification-based approach to
the defence of necessity in the following terms (at pp. 247-48):

 

                   As
a justification [the defence of necessity] can be related to Blackstone's
concept of a ""choice of evils"".  It would exculpate actors whose
conduct could reasonably have been viewed as ""necessary"" in order to
prevent a greater evil than that resulting from the violation of the law.  As
articulated, especially in some of the American cases, it involves a
utilitarian balancing of the benefits of obeying the law as opposed to
disobeying it, and when the balance is clearly in favour of disobeying,
exculpates an actor who contravenes a criminal statute.  This is the
""greater good"" formulation of the necessity defence: in some
circumstances, it is alleged, the values of society, indeed of the criminal law
itself, are better promoted by disobeying a given statute than by observing it.

 

He went on to reject this basis for
the defence.  Instead, he adopted an understanding of the defence of necessity
based on the alternative concept of an ""excuse"".  As he declared (at
pp. 248-49):

 

                   Conceptualized
as an ""excuse"", however, the residual defence of necessity is, in my
view, much less open to criticism.  It rests on a realistic assessment of human
weakness, recognizing that a liberal and humane criminal law cannot hold people
to the strict obedience of laws in emergency situations where normal human
instincts, whether of self-preservation or of altruism, overwhelmingly impel
disobedience.  The objectivity of the criminal law is preserved; such acts are
still wrongful, but in the circumstances they are excusable.  Praise is indeed
not bestowed, but pardon is, when one does a wrongful act under pressure which,
in the words of Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics [Book III, 1110a
(trans. D. Ross, 1975, at p. 49)] ""overstrains human nature and which no
one could withstand"".

 

53               Dickson J. continued by referring
to the position articulated by G. P. Fletcher in his treatise Rethinking
Criminal Law (1978).  In Fletcher’s view, excuses in criminal law can best
be understood as rooted in the notion of ""moral or normative
involuntariness"".  Dickson J. approved of this theoretical foundation for
excuses, stating (at p. 250):

 

                   I
agree with this formulation of the rationale for excuses in the criminal law. 
In my view this rationale extends beyond specific codified excuses and embraces
the residual excuse known as the defence of necessity.  At the heart of this
defence is the perceived injustice of punishing violations of the law in
circumstances in which the person had no other viable or reasonable choice
available; the act was wrong but it is excused because it was realistically
unavoidable.

 

Having set out this conceptual basis
for the defence of necessity, Dickson J. went on to examine the limitations on
the defence’s availability that he saw as flowing naturally from its
theoretical underpinnings.  As he stated (at pp. 250-51):

 

                   If
the defence of necessity is to form a valid and consistent part of our criminal
law it must, as has been universally recognized, be strictly controlled and
scrupulously limited to situations that correspond to its underlying
rationale.  That rationale, as I have indicated, is the recognition that it is
inappropriate to punish actions which are normatively ""involuntary"". 
The appropriate controls  and limitations on the defence of necessity are,
therefore, addressed to ensuring that the acts for which the benefit of the
excuse of necessity is sought are truly ""involuntary"" in the
requisite sense.

 

Dickson J. proceeded to establish
several preconditions that must be satisfied before the defence of necessity
could be invoked.  He was of the view that there were three primary
requirements: first, that there be an ""urgent situation of clear and
imminent peril"", second, that ""compliance with the law [be] demonstrably
impossible"" and third, that there be proportionality between the danger
facing the accused and the harm caused by his or her unlawful acts.  Dickson J.
explained the justification for the first and second requirements as follows
(at pp. 251-52):

 

                   In
Morgentaler [Morgentaler v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616], I
was of the view that any defence of necessity was restricted to instances of
non-compliance ""in urgent situations of clear and imminent peril when
compliance with the law is demonstrably impossible"".  In my opinion this
restriction focuses directly on the ""involuntariness"" of the
purportedly necessitous behaviour by providing a number of tests for
determining whether the wrongful act was truly the only realistic reaction open
to the actor or whether he was in fact making what in fairness could be called
a choice.  If he was making a choice, then the wrongful act cannot have been
involuntary in the relevant sense.

 

                                                                    ...

 

At a
minimum, the situation must be so emergent and the peril must be so pressing
that normal human instincts cry out for action and make a counsel of patience
unreasonable.

 

                   The
requirement that compliance with the law be ""demonstrably impossible""
takes this assessment one step further.  Given that the accused had to act,
could he nevertheless realistically have acted to avoid the peril or prevent
the harm, without breaking the law?  Was there a legal way out?  I think
this is what Bracton means when he lists ""necessity"" as a defence,
providing the wrongful act was not ""avoidable"".  The question to be
asked is whether the agent had any real choice: could he have done otherwise? 
If there is a reasonable legal alternative to disobeying the law, then the decision
to disobey becomes a voluntary one, impelled by some consideration beyond the
dictates of ""necessity"" and human instincts. [Emphasis in original.]

 

54               As I noted earlier, the common law
defences of necessity and duress apply to essentially similar factual
situations.  Indeed, to repeat Lord Simon of Glaisdale's observation,
""[d]uress is...merely a particular application of the doctrine of
""necessity"""".  In my view, the similarities between the two
defences are so great that consistency and logic requires that they be
understood as based on the same juristic principles.  Indeed, to do otherwise
would be to promote incoherence and anomaly in the criminal law.  In the case
of necessity, the Court has already considered the various alternative
theoretical positions available (in Perka, supra), and has
expounded a conceptualization of the defence of necessity as an excuse, based
on the idea of normative involuntariness.  In my opinion, the need for
consistency and coherence in the law dictates that the common law defence of
duress also be based on this juridical foundation.  If the defence is viewed in
this light, the answers to the questions posed in the present appeal can be
seen to follow readily from the reasons of Dickson J. in Perka.

 

                   (a) The Safe
Avenue of Escape Requirement

 

55               The so-called ""safe avenue of
escape"" requirement in the law of duress is, in my view, simply a specific
example of a more general requirement, analogous to that in the defence of
necessity identified by Dickson J. -- the requirement that compliance with the
law be ""demonstrably impossible"".  As Dickson J. explained, this
requirement can be derived directly from the underlying concept of normative 
involuntariness upon which the defence of necessity is based.  As I am of the
view that the defence of duress must be seen as being based upon this same
theoretical foundation, it follows that the defence of duress includes a
similar requirement -- namely, a requirement that it can only be invoked if, to
adopt Dickson J.'s phrase, there is ""no legal way out"" of the
situation of duress the accused faces.  The rule that the defence of duress is
unavailable if a ""safe avenue of escape"" was open to the accused is
simply a specific instance of this general requirement -- if the accused could
have escaped without undue danger, the decision to commit an offence becomes,
as Dickson J. observed in the context of necessity, ""a voluntary one,
impelled by some consideration beyond the dictates of ‘necessity’ and human
instincts"".

 

(b)Is
the Existence of a Safe Avenue of Escape to Be Determined Subjectively or
Objectively?

 

56               The remaining question on this
appeal raises a potentially more difficult issue, namely, the question of
whether the existence of a ""safe avenue of escape"" is to be
determined objectively or on the basis of the accused’s own subjective knowledge
and awareness at the time.  How this question is answered depends, in my view,
on how one conceives of the notion of ""normative involuntariness""
upon which the defence of duress is based.  That is, is an action
""normatively involuntary"" when the actor believes that he has
no real choice, or is this the case only when there is in fact no
reasonable alternative course of action available?

 

57               Cogent arguments can be made in
support of each of these positions.  The issue can be framed in slightly
different terms.  As H. L. A. Hart notes:

 

One
necessary condition of the just application of a punishment is normally
expressed by saying that the agent ‘could have helped’ doing what he did, and
hence the need to inquire into the ‘inner facts’ is dictated not by the moral
principle that only the doing of an immoral act may be legally punished,
but by the moral principle that no one should be punished who could not help
doing what he did. [Emphasis in original.]

(Punishment
and Responsibility (1968), at p. 39.)

 

The question of when a person
""could not help doing what he did"" (and thus performs a normatively
involuntary act) can, however, be understood in two different ways.  On the one
hand, it can be argued that actors who perform acts that appear reasonable in
relation to their knowledge of their surrounding circumstances ""cannot
help"" what they did, even if their understanding of their situation is
objectively unreasonable.  Put another way, it can be argued that a person’s
acts are normatively involuntary if he or she honestly believes there are no
reasonable alternatives, even if he or she has overlooked an alternative that a
reasonable person would have been aware of.  On the other hand, it can also be
argued that an actor’s failure to take steps to inform himself or herself of
the true state of affairs is itself a choice, and that a decision based on the
resulting erroneous view of the circumstances is thus not normatively
involuntary, since it could have been avoided.  In my opinion, the
latter argument accords most closely with the  view of normative
involuntariness adopted by the Court in Perka, which, as I have
explained, should be seen as the theoretical foundation of both the defences of
duress and necessity.  As Dickson J.’s reasons in Perka suggest, a
degree of objectivity is inherent to excuses that are based on the notion of
normative involuntariness, to the extent that this concept turns on the
objective availability, or lack of availability, of true choice.  Indeed,
Dickson J. clearly indicates that the operative standard for the defence of
necessity is to be an objective one, based on whether ""there is a reasonable
legal alternative to disobeying the law"" (emphasis added).

 

58               However, simply adopting the
second of the two arguments set out above does not fully resolve the issue of
the standard to be applied in assessing whether a safe avenue of escape
existed.  Even if it is accepted that an actor’s failure to take steps to
acquire reasonable knowledge of his or her full range of options can, in
itself, constitute a form of choice, it can still be argued that this only
holds true when the actor is able to acquire and process additional
information.  That is, a person does not ""choose"" inaction when he or
she is incapable in the first place of acting, or of knowing when to
act.  Thus, an argument can be made for framing the objective standard used in
determining the availability of alternative options, such as ""safe avenues
of escape"", in terms of the particular actor’s capacities and abilities.
This argument reflects a more general concern about the application of the
negligence standard in criminal law, which Hart, supra, has summarized
in the following terms (at p. 154):

 

If
our conditions of liability are invariant and not flexible, i.e. if they are
not adjusted to the capacities of the accused, then some individuals will be
held liable for negligence though they could not have helped their failure to
comply with the standard.

 

59               This Court has previously
indicated that when assessing the reasonableness of an accused's conduct for
the purposes of determining whether he or she should be excused from criminal
responsibility, it is appropriate to employ an objective standard that takes into
account the particular circumstances of the accused, including his or her
ability to perceive the existence of alternative courses of action.  For
instance, in R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, a self-defence case,
Wilson J., writing for a majority of the Court, declared (at p. 889):

 

I
think the question the jury must ask itself [in a case of self-defence] is
whether, given the history, circumstances and perceptions of the appellant, her
belief that she could not preserve herself from being killed by [her
""common-law"" spouse] that night except by killing him first was
reasonable.

 

Similarly, in R. v. Pétel,
[1994] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 12, I stated that in assessing self-defence ""the
jury must seek to determine how the accused perceived the relevant facts and
whether that perception was reasonable"".

 

60               The defences of self-defence,
duress and necessity are essentially similar, so much so that consistency
demands that each defence's ""reasonableness"" requirement be assessed
on the same basis.  Accordingly, I am of the view that while the question of
whether a ""safe avenue of escape"" was open to an accused who pleads
duress should be assessed on an objective basis, the appropriate objective
standard to be employed is one that takes into account the particular
circumstances and human frailties of the accused.

 

61               It should be noted that the
question of what sort of objective standard is to be used when assessing the
""reasonableness"" of the conduct of persons raising an excuse-based
defence is different in several key respects from the issue that was before the
Court in R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3.  In that case, in the
course of considering the mens rea for ""unlawful act
manslaughter"" under s. 222(5) (a) of the Criminal Code , a
majority of the Court was of the view that (at p. 61, per McLachlin J.):

 

[C]onsiderations
of principle and policy dictate the maintenance of a single, uniform legal
standard of care for [offences with a mens rea of negligence], subject
to one exception: incapacity to appreciate the nature of the risk which the
activity in question entails.

 

Although I dissented on this point in Creighton
(while concurring in the result), I now consider myself bound by the majority
judgment.  However, I do not believe that Creighton is applicable when
what is at issue is the standard of reasonableness to be used in establishing
the availability of an excuse-based defence, as opposed to the
determination of liability under an offence that is defined in terms of a
mental state of negligence.  In my view, the relevant ""considerations of
policy and principle"" in such cases are quite different from those
identifiable in the context of negligence-based offences.  Offences defined in
terms of negligence typically impose criminal liability on an accused person
for the consequences that flowed from his or her inherently hazardous
activities  -- activities that he or she voluntarily and willingly chose to
engage in.  In Creighton, supra, the majority was of the view
that people ""may properly be held to [a strict objective standard] as a
condition of choosing to engage in activities which may maim or kill other
innocent people"" (p. 66).  Even if a person fails to foresee the probable
consequences of their freely chosen actions, these actions remain the product
of genuine choice.  In contrast, excuse-based defences, such as duress, are
predicated precisely on the view that the conduct of the accused is involuntary,
in a normative sense -- that is, that he or she had no realistic alternative
course of action available.  In my view, in determining whether an accused
person was operating under such constrained options, his or her perceptions of
the surrounding facts can be highly relevant to the determination of whether
his or her conduct was reasonable under the circumstances, and thus whether his
or her conduct is properly excusable.

 

(2) Conclusions
on Duress and ""Safe Avenue of Escape"" Requirement

 

62               My conclusions on the second and
third issues raised by the appellant can thus be summarized as follows.  An
accused person cannot rely on the common law defence of duress if he or she had
an opportunity to safely extricate himself or herself from the situation of
duress.  The rationale for this rule is simply that in such circumstances the
condition of ""normative involuntariness"" that provides the
theoretical basis for both the defences of duress and necessity is absent -- if
the accused had the chance to take action that would have allowed him or her to
avoid committing an offence, it cannot be said that he or she had no real
choice when deciding whether or not to break the law.  Furthermore, I believe
that the internal logic of the excuse-based defence, which has theoretical
underpinnings directly analogous to those that support the defence of necessity
(as set out in Perka, supra), suggests that the question of
whether or not a safe avenue of escape existed is to be determined according to
an objective standard.  When considering the perceptions of a ""reasonable
person"", however, the personal circumstances of the accused are relevant
and important, and should be taken into account. 

 

D. Assessing the Charge to the Jury

 

63               Having set out the legal
principles that, in my view, are applicable in cases such as the one at bar,
what remains to be considered is whether the jurors in the present case were
correctly instructed on the law they were to apply during their deliberations. 
I hasten to add that the law today is not what it was yesterday, as a
consequence of this judgment.  While certain portions of the trial judge's
instructions to the jury in the present case must now be characterized as
containing ""errors"" as a result of the retrospective effect of the
instant judgment, it must be emphasized in all fairness to my colleague the
trial judge, that at the time of the trial Webber J. was simply following the
course laid by this Court in Paquette, supra, which we have now
revisited and altered.

                   

64               In the present case, Webber J. was
confronted with the difficult and unenviable task of charging the jury on a
very complex area of the common law  -- an area, moreover, that was (as Martin
J.A. remarked in R. v. Mena (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 304, at p. 319),
""in a somewhat unsatisfactory state"" at the time.  With the greatest
of respect, I am of the view that his charge to the jury contained several
instructions that, when read with reference to the law as set out in this
Court’s current decision, now can be identified as incorrect.  In his charge,
the trial judge told the jurors that ""if Hibbert joined in the common plot
to shoot Cohen, under threats of death or grievous bodily harm, that would
negative his having a common intention with Quasi to shoot Cohen, and [sic]
you must find Hibbert  not guilty"". In my respectful view, these
instructions contained several errors.  First, the reference to ""common
intention""-- an expression descriptive of the mental element in s. 21(2) 
-- was misplaced, in light of the trial judge’s earlier instruction that s.
21(1) (b) was ""the portion of s. 21 that applies to this particular
case"".  Second, as I have explained, it was incorrect to instruct the jury
that the mens rea for party liability under s. 21(1) (b) could be
""negated"" by duress.  Thirdly, and most importantly, the jury was not
told that even if the appellant possessed the requisite mens rea his
conduct could be excused by operation of the common law defence of
duress, if the jurors were of the view that the necessary conditions for this
defence’s application were present.

 

65               In order to assess what impact
these errors may have had on the verdict, it is necessary to examine other
portions of the jury charge.  Although the instruction that duress could
""negate mens rea"" was, as I have explained, incorrect, it
would not necessarily have  affected the outcome of the trial if the jury had
also been told that to be convicted the appellant actively had to
""desire"" the successful completion of the offence he was charged with
assisting.  While this latter instruction would, as I have explained, have been
an incorrect statement of the law, on the particular facts of this case any
determination that the appellant actively  desired that the attack on Cohen
take place would be tantamount to a finding that he did not act under duress. 
If this had been the case, the fact that the jury was not advised of the
excuse-based common law defence of duress would not have affected their
decision to convict the appellant.  Put another way, on the particular facts of
the case the impact of the trial judge’s error could conceivably have been
negated if he had made  a further error.   However, as an examination of the
charge reveals, the jury in the present case was not charged on the
applicable mens rea in this erroneous manner.  Rather, the trial judge
instructed the jury on the mental element of party liability under s. 21(1) (b)
in the following terms:

 

To
aid the commission of a crime, a person must associate himself with the
criminal venture by participating in it and trying to make it succeed.  Remember, it is no criminal offence
to stand by.  A mere passive spectator to a crime no matter how serious the
offence, is not guilty of the offence.  There must be an intentional
assistance of the crime for the accused to be guilty of aiding.  In order
for you to find the accused guilty on the basis of aiding, it is not sufficient
for the Crown to prove that his acts or omissions, in fact, had the effect of
aiding the commission of the crime.  The Crown must also prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that he did the acts, or he omitted to do something for the
purpose of, or with the intention of, aiding the commission of the crime.
[Emphasis added.]

 

This instruction clearly communicated
to the jurors that, in the context of s. 21(1) (b), ""purpose""
was synonymous with ""intention"".  I hasten to add that in this
respect the trial judge’s instructions were, as I have explained, perfectly
correct; however, in light of these correct instructions on the issue of mens
rea it cannot be said that the erroneous instructions on duress had no
effect on the jury’s verdict.  It is quite possible that the jury determined
that the appellant aided the assault ""intentionally"", in the sense
that he performed acts that he knew would probably assist Bailey to commit the
assault because he believed that if he did not Bailey would kill him.  The
jurors might have thus concluded that the appellant’s mens rea was not ""negated""
by duress, under circumstances in which they might well have  concluded that
his conduct could be excused if they had been aware of the existence of
the common law defence of duress, properly conceptualized.

 

66               The Ontario Court of Appeal was of
the view in the present case that the fact that the jury had asked a question
relating to the issue of the existence of a ""safe avenue of escape""
indicated  that the jurors must have already come to the conclusion that the
appellant had acted under compulsion, and that any errors contained in the
trial judge’s charge on the nature of the defence of duress thus had no effect
on the jury’s verdict.  With respect, I cannot accept this argument, for
several reasons.  First, there is no way of knowing whether the question posed
by the jury reflected a concern held by all the jurors, or merely by some of
them.  Second, even if it could be established that at the time the question
was posed all of the jurors were of the view that the appellant had acted under
duress, the jury continued to deliberate for nearly a full day after the trial
judge responded to its question.  Without having been present in the jury room
during the deliberations, there is no way of knowing with any degree of
certainty whether any jurors altered their views from those they held at the
time the question was posed.  Consequently, I do not believe that it can be
said that the errors in the charge relating to the nature of the defence of
duress necessarily had no effect on the verdict.

 

67               Although the errors identified
above are in themselves sufficient, in my opinion, to entitle the appellant to
a new trial, I will briefly address the other points raised by the appellant. 
As I have explained, I am of the view that the trial judge did not err in
instructing the jury that the appellant could not rely on the defence of duress
if the Crown established that he had failed to avail himself of a safe avenue
of escape.  Furthermore, while I believe the trial judge should have instructed
the jury that the existence of such an avenue was to be determined objectively,
taking into account the personal circumstances of the appellant, on the
particular facts of this case I am not persuaded that his failure to do so
affected the jury's decision, since there was no indication, on the facts, that
any of the appellant's personal attributes or frailties rendered him unable to
identify any safe avenues of escape that would have been apparent to a reasonable
person of ordinary capacities and abilities.

 

VI. Conclusion

 

68               With respect, I am of the view
that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury  on the law of
duress.  Since I do not believe that it can be said that this error necessarily
had no impact on the jury’s verdict, I believe that there should be a new
trial.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the appellant’s conviction is set
aside, and a new trial is ordered.

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Sentencing ‑‑ Trial judge ordering half of sentence to be served
before parole eligibility ‑‑ Whether or not order subject to review
by Court of Appeal ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
ss. 673 , 674 , 675(1) (b), 741.2 .

 

                   The trial judge, in
sentencing the appellant for forcible confinement, assault, uttering a death
threat, theft and assault with a weapon, ordered that he serve one half of the
sentence before being eligible for parole.  The order was made under
s. 741.2  of the Criminal Code .  The Court of Appeal denied, without
reasons, appellant's application for leave to appeal against his sentence
including the order made pursuant to s. 741.2 .  Leave was then granted to
this Court.  At issue is whether courts of appeal have jurisdiction to review
orders made under s. 741.2  as part of the ""sentence"" imposed by
the trial judge.  Section 674  provides that no proceedings other than those set
forth in the Code shall be taken by way of appeal in proceedings in
respect of indictable offences.  Pursuant to s. 675(1) (b), a person
convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to the court of appeal
""against the sentence passed by the trial court, with leave of the court
of appeal or a judge thereof unless that sentence is one fixed by law"". 
The difficulty arises in determining what constitutes a ""sentence""
under s. 675(1) (b).  Section 673  provides that ""sentence""
in this part of the Code includes a variety of orders, declarations and
dispositions provided for under various Code provisions.  The list does
not mention orders made under s. 741.2 .

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.

 

                   Courts of appeal
have jurisdiction to review orders made under s. 741.2 of the Code
as part of ""sentence"" under ss. 673  and 675(1) (b).

 

                   The lack of reasons
is not grounds for barring review since appeals under the Code are taken
not from the reasons of a lower court, but from its order.  This Court has
jurisdiction to review the discretionary decisions of lower courts though this
is a jurisdiction that should only be exercised sparingly.

 

                   Section 673 of the Code
provides that a sentence ""includes"" the listed orders, not that it is
""defined"" by them, or that it ""means"" only them.  A plain
reading of the word ""includes"" in this context suggests that the list
of reviewable orders under s. 673  is not exhaustive.  Moreover, on a
common sense understanding of the word ""sentence"", orders made under
s. 741.2  should qualify because they clearly affect the length of time
that a sentence is served and are relevant to the disposition of the trial
judge following conviction.  

 

                   A section 741.2 
order is not an administrative parole determination, within the exclusive
jurisdiction and absolute discretion of the Parole Board, but is instead
included in the Code as part of a trial judge's authority at
sentencing.  Parliament's decision to place this power in the Code
rather than in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act  should not be
ignored.  Section 741.2  explicitly allows a trial judge to reduce the
discretion of the Parole Board in certain circumstances.  

 

                   Two of the offences
here, theft (s. 334(b)(i)) and uttering a threat (s. 264.1(1)(a)),
are not listed in Schedules I and II of the Corrections and Conditional
Release Act  and should not have been included in the s. 741.2  order.

Forest J. -- The issue in this case is whether courts of appeal have
jurisdiction to review orders made under s. 741.2  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , as part of the ""sentence"" imposed by the trial
judge.

 

2                 The facts are not in dispute. 
The appellant pleaded guilty in the Provincial Court of New Brunswick before
McKee Prov. Ct. J. on one count of forcible confinement, one count of assault,
one count of uttering a death threat, one count of theft and two counts of
assault with a weapon.  He was sentenced in August 1993 to a total of 3 years
and 9 months imprisonment.  Pursuant to s. 741.2 of the Code, the trial
judge ordered that the appellant serve one half of his sentence before being
eligible for parole.

Code  provides as follows:

 

                   741.2  Notwithstanding subsection 120(1) of

offender, that the expression of society's denunciation of the offences or the
objective of specific or general deterrence so requires, order that the portion
of the sentence that must be served before the offender may be released on full
parole is one half of the sentence or ten years, whichever is less.

 

4                 The appellant applied for leave
to appeal against his sentence including the order made pursuant to s. 741.2 of
the Code.  The Court of Appeal of New Brunswick denied the appellant
leave to appeal and gave no reasons.  Leave was then granted to this Court.  At
the conclusion of the hearing in this Court, Lamer C.J. issued judgment
allowing the appeal, on the basis that an appeal lies to a provincial court of
appeal from an order made under s. 741.2 of the Code.  The record was
referred back to the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick for reconsideration of
the application for leave to appeal.  Reasons were to follow.  These are the
reasons.

 

5                 I should state at the outset
that it is my view that courts of appeal have jurisdiction to review orders
made under s. 741.2 of the Code as part of ""sentence"" under
ss. 673 and 675(1)(b) of the Code.  Before reaching this
substantive issue, however, a preliminary jurisdictional matter must be
addressed.

 

6                 The respondent argued that this
Court should not hear this appeal since it involves the review of a
discretionary decision of a lower court, made without reasons.  The lack of
reasons is not grounds for barring review, since appeals under the Code
are taken not from the reasons of a lower court, but from its order; see R.
v. Laba, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 965.  And it is clear from the decision of this
Court in MacDonald v. City of Montreal, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 460, that the
Court has jurisdiction to review the discretionary decisions of lower courts,
even if, as was emphasized in that case, this is a jurisdiction that should
only be exercised sparingly.

 

7                 It is true, as the respondent
pointed out, that we cannot be sure in this case that the New Brunswick Court
of Appeal refused the appellant leave to appeal his sentence on the basis of a
want of jurisdiction respecting the order made under s. 741.2 .  Still, in light
of other judgments issued by that court, there is reason to believe that leave
to appeal may have been refused at least in part on this basis.  In both R.
v. Watson (1993), 142 N.B.R. (2d) 327, and R. v. Landry (1993), 143
N.B.R. (2d) 183, the Court of Appeal held that it did not have jurisdiction to
review orders made under s. 741.2 .  The question of whether such orders can be
reviewed by courts of appeal has provoked some confusion in lower courts across
the country, and the case at bar presents us with an appropriate opportunity to
resolve the issue, which is clearly an important question of law relating to
the sentencing process, and therefore a matter upon which this Court should
pronounce; see R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, at p. 397.

 

8                 The argument respecting the
jurisdiction of courts of appeal to review s. 741.2  orders turns on the
application of ss. 673-675 of the Code.  Section 674  provides that no
proceedings other than those set forth in the Code ""shall be taken
by way of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences"".  Pursuant
to s. 675(1) (b), a person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal
to the court of appeal ""against the sentence passed by the trial court,
with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless that sentence is
one fixed by law"".  The difficulty arises in determining what constitutes
a ""sentence"" under s. 675(1) (b).  Section 673  provides that
""sentence"" in this part of the Code includes a variety of
orders, declarations and dispositions provided for under various Code
provisions.  The list does not mention orders made under s. 741.2 .

 

9                 It should first be observed that
s. 673  provides that a sentence ""includes"" the listed orders, not
that it is ""defined"" by them, or that it ""means"" only
them.  A plain reading of the word ""includes"" in this context
suggests that the list of reviewable orders under s. 673  is not exhaustive. 
Moreover, on a common sense understanding of the word ""sentence"" it
seems clear that orders made under s. 741.2  should qualify.  For these orders
clearly affect the length of time that a sentence is served, and are relevant
to the disposition of the trial judge following conviction; see R. v. Pawlyk
(1991), 72 Man. R. (2d) 1 (C.A.), at p. 6.  It seems to me artificial to
suggest that a s. 741.2  order is not part of the ""sentence"" imposed
on an offender.

 

10               The respondent argued that a s.
741.2  order is analogous to a parole order made under the Corrections and
Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20 .  As such, it is simply a
judicial, as opposed to a typically administrative, power to determine parole,
and is not part of a formal sentence.  Since the fitness for eligibility of
parole is generally not remediable under the Corrections and Conditional
Release Act , the respondent submitted, it was unnecessary for a trial
judge's decision made under s. 741.2  to be remediable.  Parliament has been
consistent, this argument runs, in giving the Parole Board exclusive
jurisdiction and absolute discretion in relation to the granting of parole
under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act , and in not providing
a right of appeal under the Criminal Code  for a judicial decision
regarding parole eligibility orders made under s. 741.2 .

 

11               My difficulty with this argument
is that the s. 741.2  order is not an administrative parole
determination, within the exclusive jurisdiction and absolute discretion of the
Parole Board, but is instead included in the Code as part of a trial
judge's authority.  Parliament's decision to place this power in the Code
rather than in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act  should not be
ignored.  The inclusion of s. 741.2 of the Code should, in my view, be
understood to indicate an intention on the part of Parliament explicitly to
allow a trial judge to reduce the discretion of the Parole Board in
certain circumstances, by requiring an accused to serve one half of his or her
term of imprisonment before being able to seek parole.  The point is that under
s. 741.2  the determination of conditional release eligibility has now become a
factor in sentencing, and not simply a matter exclusively in the hands
of the Parole Board.  I agree with the following comments of Griffiths J.A. in R.
v. Goulet (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 118 (C.A.), at pp. 122-23:

 

                   Section
741.2  clearly operates as an exception to the general statutory provision
governing parole eligibility [s. 120(1)  of the Corrections and Conditional
Release Act , which requires generally that one-third of a sentence be
served before an application for parole] and contemplates a further restriction
on the offender's liberty beyond that which normally flows from the prison term
imposed by the sentencing judge.  An order made under s. 741.2  restricting
eligibility for parole increases the punishment imposed by the sentence in a
very real way.  In making an order under s. 741.2  increasing parole
ineligibility the sentencing judge is looking into the future and declaring
that the offender should not even be considered for parole during some part of
what would otherwise be his or her period of parole eligibility.  A s. 741.2 
order pre-empts the normal role of the Parole Board during the added period of
parole ineligibility and replaces the case-by-case exercise of that expert
tribunal's discretion with an absolute order made years before the effect of
that order is felt.

 

12               In making its case, the respondent
also relied on the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Vaillancourt (1989), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 544, in which it was concluded that the
Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to review a jury determination
respecting parole made under s. 745 of the Code.  That section allows an
offender who has served 15 years of a sentence for murder to apply for a jury
determination as to whether his or her parole ineligibility period should be
reduced below the 25-year statutory minimum.  The Court of Appeal held that
such a determination could not be said to constitute part of the sentencing
process and therefore was not appealable as a ""sentence"" under s.
675(1) (b).  In my view this case is distinguishable from the case at
bar.  The determination of a jury respecting parole 15 years after an
offender's conviction is, I agree, difficult to cast as part of the sentence
imposed by the trial judge upon conviction.  By contrast, an order made under
s. 741.2  is clearly part of the punishment meted out by the trial judge; as
such, I believe it is appealable under s. 675(1) (b).  It should also be
noted that parole ineligibility orders made under s. 744 of the Code are
listed as part of sentence under s. 673 .  Section 744 provides that a trial
judge at the time of sentencing may increase the parole ineligibility period of
an offender convicted of second degree murder.  This power is analogous to that
granted a trial judge under s. 741.2 , and in my view the inclusion of s. 744
orders as part of sentence under s. 673  is indicative of Parliament's desire
that other similar orders should also be held to constitute part of sentence.

 

13               In concluding that courts of
appeal have jurisdiction to review orders under s. 741.2 of the Code, I
endorse the view taken by several courts of appeal across the country.  The
Ontario Court of Appeal has explicitly held that it has the jurisdiction to
review s. 741.2  orders as part of a ""sentence"" under the Code;
see R. v. Steel, [1993] O.J. No. 2563, and Goulet, supra. 
The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal also seemed to have been of this view in R.
v. Warren (1994), 128 Sask. R. 81, although in that case the Crown conceded
the court's jurisdiction.

 

14               In British Columbia, Alberta,
Manitoba, Quebec and Nova Scotia, courts of appeal have assumed the
jurisdiction to hear appeals from s. 741.2  orders without ruling on the issue;
see for example R. v. Forsythe (1994), 41 B.C.A.C. 294, R. v.
Viscount, [1994] A.J. No. 145, R. v. Boone (1993), 88 Man. R. (2d)
110, R. v. Cory (1993), 88 Man. R. (2d) 183, Dankyi v. R., [1993]
R.J.Q. 2767, R. v. Leblanc (1993), 59 Q.A.C. 250, and R. v. Hynes
(1993), 123 N.S.R. (2d) 447, application for leave to appeal dismissed, [1994]
1 S.C.R. viii.  While ruling on the application of s. 11 (i) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to s. 741.2  orders, the Newfoundland Court
of Appeal has specifically refrained from deciding the jurisdictional issue;
see R. v. Lambert (1994), 123 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 347, application for
leave to appeal dismissed, [1995] 1 S.C.R. x.

 

15               Only the New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island Courts of Appeal have held that they do not have jurisdiction to
hear an appeal from an order made under s. 741.2  because this order is not a
""sentence"" under s. 673 of the Code, but is instead an order
made after sentence; see Watson, supra, and Landry, supra,
and R. v. Richards (1994), 122 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 89.  A number of New
Brunswick Court of Appeal decisions made since the present case was decided
would appear to suggest, however, that its view that it does not have
jurisdiction to review s. 741.2  orders may be restricted solely to situations
where an appeal on the merits of the s. 741.2  order alone is proposed.  In R.
v. Ferris (1994), 153 N.B.R. (2d) 241, and R. v. McIntyre, [1995]
N.B.J. No. 178, the Court of Appeal granted leave to decide a s. 11 (i) Charter 
issue relating to the application of s. 741.2 , but in doing so, it specifically
upheld its earlier decision in Watson that it lacked jurisdiction to
review s. 741.2  orders alone on their merits.  More recently, in R. v.
Canney, [1995] N.B.J. No. 248, the Court of Appeal set aside a s. 741.2 
order, but it did so in the context of varying the entire sentence imposed by
the trial judge.

 

16               With respect, it is my view, for
the reasons stated above, that the New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island
Courts of Appeal are simply wrong to hold that they do not have jurisdiction to
review s. 741.2  orders on their merits.  The soundness of the view that courts
of appeal should be understood to have the jurisdiction to review s. 741.2 
orders is confirmed by a recently proposed amendment to the Criminal Code 
to this effect.  Bill C-45, An Act to amend the Corrections and Conditional
Release Act, the Criminal Code , the Criminal Records Act , the Prisons and
Reformatories Act  and the Transfer of Offenders Act, was reported to the
House of Commons on March 22, 1995 after being considered by the Standing
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.  It specifically provides for a right
of appeal in the Criminal Code  respecting orders made under s. 741.2 . 
At the time the present case was heard, Bill C-45 had not yet received second
reading in the House.  It contains the following provisions:

 

                   70. 
Section 675  of the Criminal Code  is amended by adding the following
after subsection (2):

 

                   (2.1) 
A person against whom an order under section 741.2  has been made may appeal to
the court of appeal against the order.

 

                   71. 
Section 676 of the Act is amended by adding the following after subsection (4):

 

                   (5) 
The Attorney General or counsel instructed by the Attorney General for the
purpose may appeal to the court of appeal against the decision of the court not
to make an order under section 741.2 .

 

17               There is no need for me to review
the merits of the s. 741.2  order made by the trial judge in this case, as we
have referred the matter back to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration of the
application for leave to appeal.  I do wish to note, however, that two of the
offences of which the appellant was convicted, theft under s. 334(b)(i)
of the Code and uttering a threat under s. 264.1(1)(a) of the Code,
are not listed as Schedules I and II of the Corrections and Conditional
Release Act  and thus should not have been included in the s. 741.2  order.

                   Appellant, a
lawyer, offered to pay a police officer a referral fee for every client
retained after failing a breathalyzer test.  The constable reported the
appellant's proposition to his superiors.  A police investigation confirmed, by
conversations intercepted through the use of a body pack, that three persons
referred had been retained and that another officer was involved in the
scheme.  The police were given legal advice that this type of interception was
constitutionally valid and that no criminal offence was being committed as long
as witnesses were not being subverted.  The police investigators called the Law
Society Discipline Committee for advice, and although the police did not pursue
their investigation of the appellant, they continued to communicate with and
supply information to the Law Society.

 

                   The Law Society
commenced its own investigation.  It advised the appellant of the nature of his
alleged misconduct, gave him details of the evidence and invited him to
respond.  The officer involved in the scheme and the three referral clients
complied with appellant's request that they sign statutory declarations
prepared by him.  The statutory declarations sworn by the three clients denied
being directed to the appellant by a police officer.  The one sworn by the
officer stated that the appellant had never paid or offered to pay him any
money for referring potential clients to him.  At trial, the three clients and
the officer involved in the scheme testified that these portions of the
statutory declarations were false.  The declarations, as well, were sworn by a
commissioner whose commission or authority did not extend to the declarations
sworn here.

 

                   The appellant was
charged with professional misconduct pursuant to the provisions of the Law
Society Act.  The police resumed their investigation of the appellant and
learned that the Law Society believed that the statutory declarations which the
appellant had submitted to it were false, and charged him with four counts of
attempting to obstruct justice (s. 139  of the Criminal Code ).

 

                   At trial, the
wiretap evidence, the statutory declarations and viva voce evidence
pertaining to them, were admitted notwithstanding appellant's challenges.  The
appellant was convicted and the conviction was unanimously upheld in the Court
of Appeal.  At issue here was whether the term ""course of justice"" in
s. 139  includes investigations and the scope of that term.  Also at issue
was whether the tapes of the intercepted conversations were properly
admissible, whether the solemn declarations were defective, and if found
defective, whether they should have been excluded because of solicitor‑client
privilege and because to admit them would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute contrary to s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

                   The term
""course of justice"" in s. 139(2) of the Code includes
investigations.  Section 139  and s. 118 , which defines judicial
proceeding, should be read together.  The definition of judicial proceeding in
s. 118  accordingly applies to all three subsections of s. 139  and the
phrase ""course of justice"" in s. 139(2)  is therefore not limited
to existing or proposed judicial proceedings.  A serious perversion of justice
can occur just as readily in the work of administrative tribunals or
disciplinary bodies.  An attempt to mislead an investigation into facts which
could give rise to a disciplinary hearing constitutes an attempt to pervert the
course of justice.  The commencement of proceedings invoking a tribunal's
jurisdiction to enforce rights and liabilities may set in train a relevant
""course of justice"".

 

                   The Law Society's
disciplinary proceedings comes within ss. 118 (d) (the person
presiding can administer oaths and compel evidence) and (e) (a legal
right or a legal liability may be established by the tribunal).  An
investigation is an essential first step in any judicial or quasi‑judicial
proceeding and may result in prosecution.  To mislead knowingly during the
first step of the investigation perverts the course of justice.  Here, a
conclusion by the Law Society staff that the allegations were unfounded would
result in disciplinary proceedings not being commenced.  Since a false
statement at the stage of the investigation could prevent any proceedings from
taking place and thus pervert the course of justice, s. 139(2)  must
encompass investigatory proceedings.  Section 139(2)  may be applicable to a
body created by statute and required to judge and in doing so to act in a
judicial manner.

 

                   The admission of
the tapes of intercepted conversations, even though the interceptions violated
the appellant's s. 8  Charter  right to be free from unreasonable search, did
not bring the administration of justice into disrepute contrary to
s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  The Charter  breach was not
serious.  The fairness of the trial was not affected.  The appellant was not
conscripted into incriminating himself in these conversations and would have
sought out and spoken to officer wearing the body pack to solicit clients. 
Both the police and the Law Society acted in good faith with no trickery or
activity as an agent provocateur.  The police acted in conformity with
what they very reasonably believed to be the law as it existed at the time. 
The situation of a police officer acting in breach of the police code of
professional conduct and of other officers were being approached in the same
manner was serious.  Indeed, it would have reflected adversely upon the
administration of justice if the evidence had not been admitted.

 

                   The actus reus
of obstructing justice was committed even if the impugned affidavits were
defective.  The appellant had full control over the signing of the declarations
and knowingly had the four declarants sign these statements, which he knew to
be false.  He also was aware that the ""affidavits"" were sworn in
circumstances beyond the powers of the commissioner for oaths.  These documents
were put forward with the intent of misleading the Law Society and to argue
that they should not be considered because of their allegedly defective form
was to use appellant's initial deceit of the Law Society to protect himself.

 

                   Whether or not the
documents were improperly executed did not need to be decided.  For the
purposes of s. 139(2) of the Code, what is put forward as an
affidavit or solemn declaration should ordinarily be accepted as such.  The
declarations do not in fact need to be statutory declarations:  it is not an
essential element of the offence of obstructing justice and does not form part
of the actus reus.  Even if the documents tendered were improperly
executed, the offence would have still been committed, since the appellant 
knowingly tendered false documents which were purported to have been duly
executed.

 

                   The documents in
question were submitted by a lawyer to the Law Society and were not covered by
solicitor‑client privilege.  The communication was made because the Law
Society was investigating the appellant's practice.  The false declarations
were intended to deceive the Law Society in its deliberations as to whether or
not discipline proceedings should be instituted.  Solicitor‑client
privilege cannot attach to the declarations in those circumstances.  Even if
the solicitor‑client privilege attached to the context in which the
declarations were made, the documents were prepared and submitted to further
the criminal purpose of obstructing justice and any privilege that might have
attached to them was certainly removed.

 

                   The appellant
cannot claim a constitutional remedy pursuant to s. 24(2)  based upon the
alleged violation of the affiants' Charter  rights.  This provision
provides a remedy only to an individual whose Charter  rights have been
violated.  The affiants' Charter  rights, however, were not violated
because the declarations were executed with the specific intention of assisting
the appellant with regard to the Law Society investigation and with the
expectation that the Law Society would act upon them.  The documents could not
be considered privileged in the circumstances.

Court was delivered by

 

1                 Cory
J. -- It should be noted at the outset that, at the conclusion of the
hearing before this Court, this appeal was dismissed with the provision that
these reasons would follow.  The principal issue raised on this appeal requires
an answer to the question what is the scope of the term ""the course of
justice"" which appears in s. 139  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C‑46 ?

 

Factual Background

 

2                 The appellant was for a number
of years a Crown Attorney in the city of Toronto.  He left that position and
set up his own practice specializing in the defence of persons charged with
drinking and driving offences.  On December 17, 1991, he was convicted of four
counts of attempting to obstruct justice and sentenced to 15 months'
imprisonment.

 

3                 The evidence at the trial
revealed that on March 23, 1989, the appellant approached Constable Stade, who
was a breathalyzer operator, with a proposal.  He suggested to Stade that he
would pay him $250 for each successful referral of persons who had failed the
breathalyzer test.  The appellant gave Stade some business cards to give to
people he referred to the appellant, and told him to mark the business cards in
a particular manner.  In that way, the appellant would know that it was Stade
who had referred the prospective client.  In the course of his conversation
with Stade, the appellant stated that Constable Thompson was already referring
people to him for the same amount.  He suggested that Stade might wish to
confirm this with Thompson.  Stade told the appellant that he would think about
his proposal.

 

4                 Stade disclosed the appellant's
proposition to a colleague and reported it to his superiors, who decided that
an investigation should be conducted.  Stade was instructed to feign agreement
with the appellant's proposal.  Pursuant to those instructions, Stade met the
appellant at the courthouse on March 30 and told him that he would participate
in the fee-for-referral scheme.  At the police station, Stade signed a form
consenting to the interception of his conversations and, while wearing a
bodypack, met with Constable Thompson on April 4.  In the course of the conversation,
Thompson confirmed that he was referring persons to the appellant and was
receiving $250 for each person who became a client.

 

5                 When the police investigators
obtained this information, they called the Law Society Discipline Committee for
advice.  The investigators also sought the views of Crown counsel who expressed
the opinion that, as long as the appellant was not seeking to have a witness
give false evidence, the appellant's fee-for-referral scheme did not amount to
a criminal offence.

 

6                 At the invitation of the
appellant, Stade went to his home on April 7.  He was wearing a bodypack.  In
the course of their conversation, the appellant confirmed his arrangement with
Thompson and instructed Stade as to the manner in which he was to mark his
business cards.  He told him that the referred persons were to be called
""fish"".  During the same conversation, the appellant told Stade that
he was aware of the danger that Stade might be wearing a bodypack and that he
would never ask a police officer to change his evidence.

 

7                 After the meeting at the
appellant's house, discussions took place between the police investigators, the
Law Society and Crown Counsel.  As a result of these discussions, Stade was
told to go along with the appellant's scheme.  In June of 1989, Stade referred
four persons to the appellant and gave each of them a business card marked in
the manner suggested by the appellant.  Three of these persons retained the
appellant to defend them.

 

8                 On June 19, Stade phoned the
appellant at his office to inquire whether there were any ""fishes""
yet, to which the appellant replied that there were.  The two men agreed to
meet at the appellant's home the next evening.  Once again Stade wore a
bodypack and recorded their conversation.  The appellant confirmed that he had
been retained by three of the persons and paid Stade $750 in cash, and
encouraged him to send more clients.  He suggested that Stade could make up to
$10,000 per year and wondered if Stade knew of anyone else who might refer
prospective clients to him.  Although the police did not pursue their
investigation of the appellant, they continued to communicate with and supply
information to the Law Society.  In the fall of 1989, the police provided the
Law Society with the evidence which they gathered from their investigation. 
The Law Society then commenced its own investigation.  It advised the appellant
of the nature of his alleged misconduct and gave him details of the evidence. 
The Law Society followed its usual procedure and invited the appellant to
respond to the allegations.

 

9                 In preparing his response, the
appellant spoke to Constable Thompson as well as to the three clients who had
been referred to him by Stade.  He asked each of them to sign a statutory
declaration which he had prepared.  All four complied with his request.

 

10               The statutory declaration signed
by the three clients contained a paragraph stating that:

 

At
no time did any police officer direct or suggest that I retain [the
appellant].  At no time did any police officer give me any business cards of
[the appellant].

 

11               The declaration signed by Thompson
stated that the appellant had never paid or offered to pay him any money for
referring potential clients to him.  At trial, the three clients and Thompson
testified that these portions of the statutory declarations were false.

 

12               On January 11, 1990, the Law
Society received the four statutory declarations, together with a letter from
the appellant responding to the allegations brought against him.  The Law
Society did not inform the police of the statutory declarations it had
received, but continued with its investigation.  On March 15, 1990, the
appellant was charged with professional misconduct pursuant to the provisions
of the Law Society Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 233.  In the fall of that same
year, the police received information that the appellant had requested another
former client to sign a false affidavit concerning his referral by an officer. 
As a result of this information, they resumed their investigation of the
appellant.  The police learned that the Law Society believed that the statutory
declarations which the appellant had submitted to it were false.  The police
obtained copies of the declarations together with the letter from the appellant
to the Law Society.  The appellant was subsequently charged with four counts of
attempting to obstruct justice.

 

13               At the trial, the appellant
challenged the admissibility of the wiretap evidence, the statutory
declarations and the viva voce evidence which pertained to them.  They
were all ruled admissible by the trial judge.  The appellant was convicted at
trial on the four counts of attempting to obstruct justice.  The conviction was
unanimously upheld in the Court of Appeal.  At the conclusion of the hearing
before this Court, the appeal was dismissed with reasons to follow.

 

Judgments

 

Ontario Court of
Justice, General Division (Trainor J., ruling on voir dire)

 

14               In his careful reasons delivered
at the conclusion of the voir dire, Trainor J. observed that both
the police and the Law Society acted in an exemplary manner throughout their
investigations.  He noted that the police were really involved in two separate
investigations.  He found that the evidence obtained during the first part of the
investigation, running from April 1989 to June of that year, only became
relevant as a result of the appellant's conduct in January 1990 when he
responded to the Law Society's letter by sending the four statutory
declarations to the Society.  He concluded that, as is so often the case, the
cover‑up was much more serious that the scheme itself.

 

15               Trainor J. pointed out that the
appellant was a very experienced Crown attorney and defence counsel.  He
concluded that, in light of his experience, the appellant knew that he was
acting in a manner contrary to the rules of conduct of his profession.  In addition,
he knew that Thompson and Stade would, in complying with his request for
referrals, be violating police conduct rules.  Trainor J. found as well that
the appellant knew that his plan could be thwarted if he solicited an honest
police officer and he was aware that his conversations could be recorded by
devices such as a bodypack.  He observed that it was significant that the
appellant had sought out the police and that they had followed his plan or, at
least in the case of Stade, appeared to do so.

 

16               Trainor J. decided that although
the recorded conversations constituted an unreasonable search and seizure
contrary to s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
the evidence should not be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2)  of the Charter . 
He once again emphasized that the police and the Law Society had acted in good
faith throughout, and that the police had reasonable and probable grounds to
believe criminal offences had been committed both by the appellant  and by those
who signed the statutory declarations.

 

17               Trainor J. turned next to the
question of the admissibility of the statutory declarations.  He found that
they were not subject to solicitor‑client privilege since they failed to
meet the first branch of the test set out in R. v. Gruenke, [1991] 3
S.C.R. 263, at p. 284, namely that ""[t]he communications must
originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed""
(emphasis in original).  Further, he determined that the preparing, swearing
and submitting of the statutory declarations formed the very actus reus
of the crime of wilfully attempting by any means to obstruct the course of
justice.  As a result, he found that no privilege attached to the documents.

 

Court of Appeal (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 583

 

                   Galligan
J.A.

 

18               Galligan J.A. first considered
whether the intercepted conversations were admissible.  He noted that it was
conceded that the appellant's rights under s. 8  of the Charter  had
been infringed, and that the issue, therefore, was whether the evidence ought
to have been rejected pursuant to s. 24(2) .  He stated that the factors to
be considered were set out in R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265.  He
noted as well that in assessing those factors, it was important to assess the
impact which the infringement of the Charter  would have on the fairness
of the trial.

 

19               Galligan J.A. found that the
police were in possession of information that justified their reasonable belief
that the appellant was engaged in very serious illegal activities.  Those
activities had already compromised one officer and would have compromised Stade
had he agreed to the scheme.  Galligan J.A. also found that Thompson's
participation in the scheme constituted an offence against police discipline
and that Stade's participation would also have had the same result.  He
expressed the view that the actions of Constable Thompson were such that he was
probably guilty of a criminal breach of trust and that the appellant, by
advising him to perform those acts, was a party to Thompson's offence.  He
determined that the police had taken every reasonable step to obtain legal
advice and that, in light of the law as it existed at the time, they had acted
reasonably.

 

20               Galligan J.A. put forward, as a
further reason for finding that the interception of the conversation was
reasonable, that it was important to demonstrate that Stade had not mistaken
the words of the appellant or in any way misinterpreted the statements made to
him.

 

21               He found that at the very least,
from the point of view of police conduct, the infringement of the Charter 
was not a serious one.  He concluded that the admission of the intercepted
conversations would certainly not bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

 

22               Galligan J.A. next considered
whether an investigation by the Law Society into allegations of professional
misconduct of a solicitor came within the meaning of the phrase ""the
course of justice"" set out in s. 139(2) of the Code.  He noted
that when allegations of misconduct were brought to the attention of the Law
Society, the first step was to investigate the situation.  If the Law Society
staff concluded that the allegations made against a solicitor were unfounded,
discipline proceedings would probably not be commenced.  He expressed the
opinion that the phrase ""course of justice"" would include an
investigation which could lead to proceedings being taken against the person. 
He was further of the opinion that those ""proceedings"" should not be
restricted to the investigation of true crimes under the Code.  He
concluded that the phrase would apply to any body which is authorized to act by
statute and ""which judges"".  He determined that the Law Society was
just such a body and that s. 139(2) of the Code extended to the
investigatory stages of potential disciplinary proceedings before the Law
Society.

 

                   Goodman J.A.
(concurring)

 

23               In his concurring reasons, Goodman
J.A. observed at p. 608 that if it had not been conceded that the
intercepted conversation constituted a breach of the appellant's rights under
s. 8  of the Charter , ""a strong argument could be made that no
such breach had occurred"".  However, in light of the concession, he went
on to consider whether the admission of the evidence would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.  He agreed with Galligan J.A. that
the intercepted conversations were properly admitted in evidence.  However, he
differed from Galligan J.A.'s opinion that the fact that the appellant had
anticipated the possibility of his conversation's being recorded could be taken
into account in considering whether the communication was a private one.  He
expressed the view that once it had been determined that the communication was
private, then the fact that the originator may have anticipated its recording
was not relevant in determining whether it should be admitted or excluded under
s. 24(2) .

 

                   Abella
J.A.

 

24               Abella J.A. agreed with the
conclusions reached by Galligan J.A. and generally concurred with the reasons
of Goodman J.A.

 

Analysis

 

Scope and Application
of the Phrase ""Course of Justice"" Appearing in s. 139(2) of the
Criminal Code

 

25               The prime issue raised in this
appeal is whether the phrase ""the course of justice"", which appears
in s. 139(2) of the Code, applies to the investigatory stage of
discipline proceedings before the Law Society of Upper Canada.  A consideration
of the phrase requires answers to two questions.  First, does s. 139(2)
apply to the investigation stage or just to the formal legal proceedings? 
Second, does s. 139(2) apply to matters other than criminal and quasi‑criminal
offences?  It may be helpful at this stage to set out the sections of the Code
which describe the offence of obstructing justice and that which defines
""judicial proceedings"".

 

Relevant Statutory
Provisions

 

26               The relevant statutory provision
are:

 

                   Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C‑46 

 

118.  In this Part,

 

                                                                   . . .

                                                                   . . .

 

Does the ""Course of Justice""
Include Investigations?

 

27               The proceedings of a court, or
indeed those of most administrative tribunals, will almost invariably commence
with an investigation.  Investigation is necessary to determine if a crime or
wrong has been committed.  It is the essential first step in any judicial or
quasi‑judicial proceeding which may result in a prosecution.  In the
ordinary course of events, one who perverts the course of an investigation also
perverts the course of justice.  For example, there is no question that someone
who lies to the police investigating a car accident as to the identity of the
driver is by that lie perverting the course of justice.  In the same way, there
can be no doubt that someone who lies to a safety inspector as to the condition
of a work site, thereby concealing its dangers, is, by that lie, perverting the
course of justice.  It follows that to mislead knowingly during that first step
of the investigation just as surely perverts the course of justice as would
making a bribe to a witness to change his or her testimony during a trial.  The
only difference is that, in the first example, the crime is committed at the
outset of the proceedings and, in the second example, towards the end.

 

28               The authorities support the
position that the phrase ""the course of justice"" must include the
investigatory stage.  In Kalick v. The King (1920), 61 S.C.R. 175, the
accused was convicted of having corruptly interfered with ""the
administration of justice"".  He had bribed a police officer to avoid being
charged with a violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance Act, S.S. 1917,
c. 23.  Anglin J. (as he then was) stated at p. 183:

 

                   It
is quite immaterial whether the police officer actually intended or
contemplated instituting a prosecution.  It suffices that the appellant gave
the bribe with intent to head off such a proceeding.  The due administration of
justice is interfered with quite as much by improperly preventing the
institution of a prosecution as by corruptly burking one already begun.

 

29               In a concurring opinion,
Brodeur J. stated at p. 186:

 

                   I
am of opinion that the ""administration of justice"" mentioned in
section 157  of the Criminal Code  should not be restricted to what takes
place after an information has been laid; but it includes the taking of
necessary steps to have a person who has committed an offence brought before
the proper tribunal, and punished for his offence.  It is a very wide term
covering the detection, prosecution and punishment of offenders.

 

30               It is true that the phrase
""the administration of justice"" is not the same as ""the course
of justice"".  Yet, I would have thought that the latter phrase is even
broader in meaning than the former.  Indeed, the Kalick decision has
been cited as an authority in cases where a breach of s. 139(2) has been
alleged.  See, for example, R. v. Morin (1968), 5 C.R.N.S. 297 (Que.
C.A.) at p. 299.

 

31               Similarly, in R. v. Spezzano
(1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 87 (Ont. C.A.), the accused gave a false name to the
police officer in an attempt to avoid being charged with the offence of driving
while disqualified.  There, Martin J.A. concluded that the expression
""course of justice"" in s. 139(2) includes attempts to obstruct,
pervert or defeat a prosecution which the accused contemplates may take
place.  He relied upon the Kalick decision to support his conclusion. 
The following appears in his reasons at p. 91:

 

The
expression ""the course of justice"" in s. 127(2) [now s. 139(2)]
includes judicial proceedings existed or proposed but is not limited to such
proceedings.  The offence under s. 127(2) also includes attempts by a
person to obstruct, pervert or defeat a prosecution which he contemplates may
take place, notwithstanding that no decision to prosecute has been made.

 

And at p. 93:

 

. .
. there was evidence to support the finding of the trial Judge that the
appellant made the false statement to the constable during an investigation by
the latter of a suspected offence and that it was made by the appellant to
escape prosecution for an offence which the appellant apprehended might ensue. 
In those circumstances the ""course of justice"" had commenced.

 

32               In R. v. Rogerson (1992),
174 C.L.R. 268, the Australian High Court took the next logical step and
extended this reasoning to disciplinary tribunals.  In that case, Mason C.J.
wrote at p. 277:

 

. .
. it is enough that an act has a tendency to frustrate or deflect a prosecution
or disciplinary proceeding  before a judicial tribunal which the accused
contemplates may possibly be instituted, even though the possibility of
instituting that prosecution or disciplinary proceeding  has not been
considered by the police or the relevant law enforcement agency.

 

33               In the case at bar, it is clear
from the evidence that if, as a result of its investigations, the Law Society
staff concluded that the allegations made against a solicitor were unfounded,
disciplinary proceedings would not be commenced.

 

34               In summary, since a false
statement at the stage of the investigation may prevent any proceedings from taking
place and thus pervert the course of justice, s. 139(2) must encompass
investigatory proceedings. 

 

The Scope that should
be given to the Phrase ""the Course of Justice""

 

                   (a)  Based
Upon the Provisions of the Criminal Code 

 

35               It now remains to be determined
whether s. 139(2) should, as a result of the phrase ""the course of
justice"", be applicable to disciplinary proceedings of the Law Society. 
At the outset, some assistance can be gathered from the wording and positioning
of ss. 118  and 139 .  Both these sections come within Part IV of the Code
which is entitled ""Offences Against the Administration of Law and
Justice"".

 

36               Section 139 describes the
acts which will constitute obstructions or perversions of justice.  It is
significant that s. 139(1)  refers to ""the course of justice in a
judicial proceeding"" and sets out two specific means by which the course
of justice may be obstructed, perverted or defeated.  Subsection 2 is
framed in the broadest possible way and refers to ""[e]very one who
wilfully attempts in any manner other than a manner described in
subsection (1) to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice"". 
Subsection 3 sets out further specific instances of prohibited acts.  It
provides that ""[w]ithout restricting the generality of
subsection (2), every one shall be deemed wilfully to attempt to obstruct,
pervert or defeat the course of justice who in a judicial proceeding, existing
or proposed"", acts in a manner which comes within the scope of
paras. (a), (b) and (c).

 

37               Clearly, subs. (2) describes
an offence which is much wider in its scope and which encompasses many more
acts than those described in subss. 1 and 3.  In my view, the phrase
""the course of justice"" must not only refer to the judicial
proceedings described in subss. (1) and (3) of s. 139 , but must also
include the judicial proceedings which are defined in s. 118 .  Once again,
that section provides:

 

""judicial
proceeding"" means a proceeding

 

(a)  in
or under the authority of a court of justice,

 

(b)  before
the Senate or House of Commons or a committee of the Senate or House of
Commons, or before a legislative council, legislative assembly or house of
assembly or a committee thereof that is authorized by law to administer an
oath,

 

(c)  before
a court, judge, justice, provincial court judge or coroner,

 

(d)  before
an arbitrator or umpire, or person or body of persons authorized by law to make
an inquiry and take evidence therein under oath, or

 

(e)  before
a tribunal by which a legal right or legal liability may be established,

 

whether
or not the proceeding is invalid for want of jurisdiction or for any other
reason. [Emphasis added.]

 

38               The Court of Appeal was of the
opinion that the s. 118  definition of judicial proceeding was of no
relevance in considering the scope of the phrase ""the course of
justice"".  With the greatest of respect, I cannot agree. 
Subsections 139(1)  and (3)  both specifically refer to a judicial
proceeding.  Subsection (2) is even broader in its terms.  It is, then,
reasonable and appropriate to take into account the definition section which
appears at the very beginning of Part IV of the Code and which pertains
to ""Offences Against the Administration of Law and Justice"". 
Section 139  and s. 118  should, in my view, be read together, and the
definition of judicial proceeding must apply to all three subsections of
s. 139 .  It follows that the phrase ""the course of justice"", as
it appears in s. 139(2), is not limited to existing or proposed judicial
proceedings.  Rather, it must include all those proceedings that fall within
the definition of ""judicial proceeding"" set out in s. 118 .

 

39               The Law Society's disciplinary
proceedings would come within s. 118 (d) since the person presiding
over a disciplinary hearing  (Law Society Act, s. 33(2)) ""may
administer oaths to witnesses and require them to give evidence under
oath"".  Further, the disciplinary proceedings of the Law Society would
clearly come within s. 118 (e) as a tribunal by which a legal right
or a legal liability may be established.  Section 139  should be given a
reasonably broad scope and a liberal definition.  This was suggested as early
as 1920 in Kalick, supra.  There it was held that s. 157 
(now s. 120) of the Code encompassed both criminal offences and
quasi‑criminal provincial offences.  Duff J. (as he then was) wrote at
p. 182:

 

. . .
[The appellant] argues that the application of the section is limited to
offenders or persons supposed to be or suspected of being or fearing that they
are offending against the criminal law strictly so called, that is to say,
against the criminal law as falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Parliament of Canada.  While the word ""crime"" in the Criminal Code 
generally speaking applies only to crimes strictly so called and probably has
that restricted meaning in this section, I think there is nothing requiring
us to limit the meaning of the words administration of justice in the way
suggested.  [Emphasis added.]

 

40               Similarly, the Ontario Court of
Appeal, in R. v. Zeck (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 551 (Ont. C.A.), found that
s. 139(2) was applicable to proceedings arising from the infraction of a
municipal parking by‑law.  In R. v. May (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 257
(Ont. C.A.), it was held that the section was applicable to the Ontario Highway
Traffic Act provisions pertaining to the issuing of traffic tickets.

 

(b)Cases Which Have Considered the Scope of
the Common Law Offence of Obstructing Justice

 

41               There are no Canadian cases
dealing with the applicability of s. 139  to proceedings held before
disciplinary tribunals.  However, cases from England and Australia which have
dealt with the common law offence of perverting the course of justice have indicated
that the phrase applies to proceedings of arbitration boards established by
statute and to professional disciplinary committees.

 

42               R. v. Vreones, [1891] 1
Q.B. 360, dealt with the falsification of evidence to be given before an
arbitrator.  The accused in that case was a party to a contract for shipping
wheat which provided that any disputes arising from the contract would be
settled through arbitration.  The contract also provided that samples of wheat
were to be taken upon delivery to verify the product's quality.  Samples were
duly taken, but the accused falsified them to make it appear that the bulk of
the cargo was of better quality than it really was.  Although no dispute arose
before the arbitration board, the accused was still charged with an attempt to
pervert the course of justice.

 

43               Pollock B. found that the actions
of the accused had indeed constituted an attempt to pervert the course of
justice even though the dispute arose from the provisions of a private
contract.  At page 369 he wrote:

 

The
real offence here is the doing of some act which has a tendency and is intended
to pervert the administration of public justice.  The question is, whether the
sending of these adulterated samples, which by previous arrangement  were to be
sent to the association in London to be used by the arbitrators, is such an act
as I have described.  I think that it was.  I think that the arbitrators are to
be considered as a tribunal administering public justice.  Such a tribunal is
one specially sanctioned by Courts of law, and its decisions are enforced and
carried out by the Courts of law.  I am of opinion that by tampering with the
evidence which was to be laid before that tribunal the defendant was interfering
with the course of justice.

 

44               Further, in Rogerson, supra,
the High Court of Australia held that an attempt to mislead an investigation
into facts which could give rise to a police disciplinary hearing constituted
an attempt to pervert the course of justice.  At page 276, relying upon Vreones,
supra, Mason C.J. held:

 

. . .
the course of justice is not confined to justice as it is administered by the
orthodox court system.  In Vreones, the offence consisted in the accused
adulterating samples to be used by arbitrators who were ""to be considered
as a tribunal administering public justice"", to quote once again the words
of Pollock B.  The course of justice relevantly includes the proceedings of
judicial tribunals, that is, tribunals having authority to determine the rights
and obligations of parties and having a duty to act judicially.

 

Brennan and Toohey JJ. concurred with
Mason C.J. who wrote at p. 283:

 

Neither
the police nor other investigative agencies administer justice in any relevant
sense.  However, it is their function to bring or to assist in bringing prosecutions
as part of their duty to enforce the law and, sometimes, to institute
proceedings of a disciplinary nature before an appropriate tribunal under an
applicable disciplinary code.  A tribunal whose jurisdiction extends to the
enforcing or adjusting of rights and liabilities in accordance with law and
whose procedure is judicial in character is engaged, when exercising that
jurisdiction, in administering justice so that the commencement of proceedings
invoking that jurisdiction may set in train a relevant course of justice.  The
offence of perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice may be
committed with respect to such proceedings before a tribunal as well as with
respect to proceedings before a court.

 

45               I find the reasoning expressed in Rogerson,
to be attractive and convincing.

 

46               It is apparent that s. 139(2)
applies to those investigations carried out with a view to determining whether
or not disciplinary proceedings should be taken by the Law Society.  That
finding is sufficient for the purposes of this case.  Yet, the Court of Appeal
carefully considered what the scope of the section should be and suggested a
rule that a decision-making body would come within the phrase ""the course
of justice"" if it was:  (1) ""a body which judges""; and (2)
""[i]ts authority to do so [was] derived from a statute"" (pp. 602-3). 
To this I would add that the decision making body must, by the terms of its
empowering statute, be required to act in a judicial manner.  It must for
example, be required to investigate and to institute proceedings to enforce
statutory standards of conduct, or of products or of discipline.

 

47               The Legislature or Parliament
granting such powers to a body will have considered that it would act
judicially and that decision must be recognized by the courts.  Further in
exercising such significant powers the body must act judicially or it would
deny natural justice to the parties appearing before it with all the
consequences that would entail.

 

48               In Rogerson, supra,
Mason C.J. wisely observed that the course of justice is not confined to
justice as it is administered by the orthodox court system.  His words
recognize the realities of today's society.  The rule proposed by the Court of
Appeal combined with the suggested additions accepts that reality and provides
a reasonable basis for approaching situations such as the investigation of
breaches of regulations or codes of conduct or of discipline which are
routinely entrusted to administrative boards or statutorily authorized
disciplinary tribunals.

 

49               There may be some reluctance on
the part of the courts to recognize that a serious perversion of justice can
occur just as readily in the work of administrative tribunals or disciplinary
bodies as it can in the proceedings of the courts.  Yet,  I think this is the
situation that exists in our contemporary society.  It cannot be forgotten that
so much of the conduct of people's affairs today is no longer controlled by the
courts but by statutory tribunals.  The courts simply cannot cope with the vast
multitude of problems requiring investigation, regulation and enforcement to
protect the health and safety of Canadians.  That role has of necessity been
undertaken by statutorily empowered administrative tribunals or discipline
panels.

 

50               Society must for its safety and
health be concerned with so many aspects of daily life.  Whether it is the
safety of the workplace or public buildings, the purity of food or water, the
cleanliness of restaurants or hotels, the failure to maintain the statutory
standards may have disastrous results for society.  Therefore, the various
statutorily authorized boards must investigate, inspect and commence
appropriate proceedings if those minimum standards are not maintained, or if
regulations are breached.  It seems to me that the course of justice can be
perverted if, for example, the investigations of those responsible for
maintaining the purity of water are knowingly misled just as surely as it would
be if a police officer were bribed to change his or her evidence in court.

 

51               The perversion of justice can
occur in a myriad of cases where a tribunal or entity is created by statute to
judge rights and obligations.  A random perusal of some Ontario Statutes bears
this out.  For example, the Meat Inspection Act (Ontario), R.S.O. 1990,
c. M.5, provides that no person shall slaughter an animal, sell, transport
or deliver meat, or engage  in the business of producing, processing or
handling meat except as provided by the regulations.  A licence must be
obtained from the Director, and the Director, in turn, when assessing whether a
licence should be issued, renewed, suspended or revoked, will hold a hearing. 
The Act also provides that an inspector may be appointed who may enter any
building other than a dwelling house to inspect the animals and meat contained
within them.  The Act further provides that no person shall hinder or obstruct
the Director or an inspector in the course of their duties.  Finally, a person
who contravenes any of the provisions of the Act is guilty of an offence and
liable on conviction to a fine or to imprisonment.

 

52               It is important that the
slaughtering of animals and sale of meats be carried on in a sanitary manner. 
The health of society depends upon it.  It follows that one who sought to
pervert the course of justice by giving false information to an inspector or
Director should come within the purview of s. 139(2).  Similar provisions
appear in the Motor Vehicle Dealers Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.42.  Once
again, if society is to be protected from unscrupulous dealers selling dangerous
vehicles, s. 139(2)  must apply to that Act.

 

Admissibility of the
tapes

 

53               The respondent conceded that the
interception of the conversations between Stade and the appellant violated the
appellant's right to be free from unreasonable search by virtue of s. 8  of the Charter . 
Therefore, it must be determined whether the admission of the tapes would bring
the administration of justice into disrepute pursuant to s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

54               The Court of Appeal correctly
stated that the three primary considerations which must guide any analysis as
to whether evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2)  have been set out in
Collins, supra, at pp. 284‑88.  They are:

 

1.Does
the admission of the evidence affect the fairness of the trial?

 

2.How
serious was the Charter  breach?

 

3.What
would be the effect of excluding the evidence on the repute of the
administration of justice?

 

55               On the first question, it seems readily
apparent that the admission of the evidence did not affect the fairness of the
trial.  The appellant could not by any stretch of the imagination be said to
have been conscripted into incriminating himself in these conversations. 
Rather, he would in any event have sought out and spoken to Stade to solicit
clients on his behalf.

 

56               On the question of the gravity of
the Charter  breach, it must be remembered that it was found both at
trial and in the Court of Appeal that both the police and the Law Society acted
in good faith.  There was no trickery or activity as an agent provocateur
on the part of the police.  Rather the appellant invited the police officer
into his home and spontaneously and voluntarily discussed the fee‑for‑referral
scheme.  The conversations were intercepted some months before the decision of
this Court in R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, was released, at a time
when the Ontario Court of Appeal had determined that such taping did not
contravene the Charter .  The police sought legal advice on the matter
and acted upon that advice in recording the conversation.  The police acted in
conformity with what they very reasonably believed to be the law as it existed
at the time.  Further, the situation presented to the investigating officer was
serious.  Thompson, one of their officers, had been persuaded to breach the
police code of professional conduct and other officers were being approached in
the same manner.  Finally, the appellant was not conscripted by the police to
provide evidence against himself.

 

57               Indeed, in the circumstances of
this case, it would have reflected adversely upon the administration of justice
if the evidence had not been admitted.  In passing, I would add that I am in
agreement with Goodman J.A. that once it has been determined that the
communication was private, the fact that the originator may have anticipated
that it might be recorded is not relevant in deciding whether it should be
admitted or excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

Solemn Declaration

 

58               The appellant submitted that there
were no solemn declarations given ""under oath"" as specified in the
indictment and that, accordingly, the actus reus of obstructing justice
had not been committed.  The appellant submits that the four impugned
affidavits, which were sworn by Ms. M. Matsuoka, were not in fact or in law
solemn declarations because:

 

(i)there
was no evidence that Ms. Matsuoka asked the affiants, as required by s. 41 
of the Canada Evidence Act , whether the facts declared were made
""conscientiously believing it to be true, and knowing it is of the same
force and effect as if made under oath"";

 

(ii)Ms.
Matsuoka was limited to taking affidavits and commissioning solemn declarations
only while in the employ of Wilmer H. Reid, Q.C., and only for matters
connected with his office; and

 

(iii)there
was no statutory requirement that solemn declarations be made in these
circumstances.

 

59               The Court of Appeal did not
consider this ground of appeal to have sufficient merit to warrant comment in
its reasons.  I agree that this ground of appeal is devoid of merit.

 

60               The appellant knowingly had the
four declarants sign false statements.  He referred to the statements in his
letter to the Law Society as ""affidavits"".  He asked Ms. Matsuoka to
act as the commissioner for oaths, knowing that her commission was limited so
as to exclude the circumstances presented in this case.  The declarations all
contained a statement that they were made ""conscientiously believing it to
be true, and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under
oath"".

 

61               The appellant had full control
over the signing of the declarations.  He knew them to be false, and put them
forward with the intent of misleading the Law Society.  He knew that Ms.
Matsuoka's commission was limited.  Despite all this, the appellant argues that
these declarations cannot be considered because they do not meet the
formalities for statutory declarations.  He is attempting to use his initial
deceit of the Law Society to protect himself.  This, particularly from an
experienced lawyer, is completely unacceptable.

 

62               It is not necessary to decide
whether the documents tendered in the case at bar were improperly executed.  It
is sufficient to note that for the purposes of s. 139(2) of the Code,
what is put forward as an affidavit or solemn declaration should ordinarily be
accepted as such.  The respondent has correctly observed that it is not an
essential element of the offence of obstructing justice that the declarations
be in fact statutory declarations.  It is not part of the actus reus of
the offence.  Thus, even if the documents tendered in the case at bar were
improperly executed, the offence would have still been committed, since the
appellant  knowingly tendered false documents which were purported to
have been duly executed.  This is the essence of the offence described
in s. 139(2).  Therefore, this ground of appeal must fail.

 

Exclusion of the
Statutory Declarations

 

63               The appellant contended that
documents submitted by a lawyer to the Law Society are covered by solicitor‑client
privilege and consequently they cannot be forwarded to a third party in the
absence of consent from either the lawyer who originally submitted them or the
person who signed them.  This ground of appeal was fully argued before the
Court of Appeal which indicated that the issue was devoid of merit.  I agree
that this submission must fail.

 

64               In Descôteaux v. Mierzwinski,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 860, the conditions precedent to the existence of a privilege
of confidentiality were reviewed.  The limits of privilege were described in
the following terms at p. 873:

 

                   There
are exceptions.  It is not sufficient to speak to a lawyer or one of his
associates for everything to become confidential from that point on.  The
communication must be made to the lawyer or his assistants in their
professional capacity; the relationship must be a professional one at the exact
moment of the communication.  Communications made in order to facilitate the
commission of a crime or fraud will not be confidential either, regardless of
whether or not the lawyer is acting in good faith.  [Emphasis added.]

 

65               In the case at bar, the
communication was made because the Law Society was investigating the
appellant's practice.  The declarations were false statements which were
submitted to deceive the Law Society.  The appellant must have hoped and
expected that the declarations would be read by all who would be involved in
determining whether discipline proceedings should be instituted.  They were
submitted with the intention that they would be acted upon.  It is difficult to
imagine that solicitor‑client privilege could attach to the declarations
in those circumstances.  Even if it were to be assumed that the solicitor‑client
privilege attached to the context in which the declarations were made it still
remains that the documents were prepared and submitted to further the criminal
purpose of obstructing justice.  This, in itself, would certainly remove any
privilege that might have attached to them.

 

66               Further, I find it difficult to
see how the appellant can claim a constitutional remedy pursuant to s. 24(2) 
based upon the alleged violation of the Charter  rights of third parties,
namely the affiants.  This section of the Charter  provides a remedy only
to the individual whose Charter  rights have been violated.  That is a
sufficient basis for dismissing this ground of appeal.  In any event there
could not be any violation of the affiants' Charter  rights.  It must be
remembered that the affiants executed the declarations with the specific
intention of assisting the appellant with regard to the Law Society investigation. 
They too must have expected members of the Law Society to read and act upon
their declarations.  They cannot have thought that the documents would be
privileged in these circumstances.  This ground of appeal cannot, therefore, be
accepted.

Provincial motor vehicle offence ‑‑ Absolute or strict liability ‑‑
Accused charged with driving motor vehicle while prohibited ‑‑
Whether combined effect of ss. 94(1) and 92 of British Columbia Motor
Vehicle Act creates absolute or strict liability offence.

 

                   The accused was
charged with driving a motor vehicle at a time when he was prohibited from
driving under s. 92 of the British Columbia Motor Vehicle Act,
contrary to s. 94(1) of that Act.  Section 92 provides that a person
convicted of an offence under certain sections of the Act, including
s. 94(1), is ""automatically and without notice"" prohibited from
driving a motor vehicle for 12 months.  Section 94(1) provides that a
person who drives a motor vehicle on a highway while he is prohibited from
driving under certain sections of the Act, including s. 92, commits an
offence and is liable to a fine and to imprisonment.  The accused was acquitted
at trial.  The trial judge found that s. 94(1), in combination with
s. 92, created an absolute liability offence for which imprisonment was a
penalty, thereby contravening s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .  Pursuant to s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 ,
the reference to s. 92  in s. 94(1)  was declared of no force or
effect.  The summary conviction appeal court and the Court of Appeal upheld the
trial judge's decision.

 

                   Held (La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier
and McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.  

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory,
Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The fundamental aspect of the offence created by
ss. 94(1) and 92 of the Motor Vehicle Act is that a person convicted of the
underlying offence is ""automatically and without notice"" prohibited
from driving a motor vehicle.  The words ""automatically and without
notice"" in s. 92 go far towards establishing that this is an absolute
liability offence.  The removal in 1986 of s. 94(2), which provided that s.
94(1) was an absolute liability offence, does not change the offence into one
of strict liability since the situation has not been altered in any significant
manner.  Furthermore, the defence of due diligence must be available to defend
a strict liability offence. When, as a result of the wording of the section,
the only possible defence an accused could put forward is his ignorance of the
fact that his licence had been suspended by the provisions of the provincial
statute, which constitutes a mistake of law and therefore is not available as a
defence, an accused is denied the defence of due diligence.  Here, because the
prohibition on driving in s. 92 is automatic and without notice,
s. 94(1) effectively prevents an accused who is unaware of the prohibition
from raising that defence.  In those circumstances, the offence ought to be
characterized as one of absolute liability. 

 

                   Nevertheless the
absolute liability offence created by s. 94(1) and s. 92 does not contravene
the Charter .  This conclusion flows from the application of s. 4.1 
and of s. 72(1) of the British Columbia Offence Act.  These
sections respectively indicate that, notwithstanding the provisions of any
other Act, no person is liable to imprisonment for an absolute liability
offence, and that the non‑payment of a fine will not result in
imprisonment.  Thus, an accused convicted under ss. 94(1) and 92 faces no
risk of imprisonment and there is, accordingly, no violation of the right to
life, liberty and security of the person under s. 7  of the Charter .

 

                   The legislature
could convert the offence to one of strict liability by permitting the defence
of due diligence to be raised.  If there was any concern that those accused of
the offence would defend on the basis that they had no knowledge of its effect,
a provision requiring that notice be given of its consequences could be added.

 

                    In this case an
order directing a new trial would ordinarily be the appropriate result. In the
present circumstances, however, to direct a new trial would be unfair and
unduly harsh to the accused, who has been brought before every level of court
at the Crown's instigation.  This appeal was lodged solely to determine whether
the offence in question was one of absolute or strict liability.  That question
is now resolved and the appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting): The Motor Vehicle Act is
public welfare or regulatory legislation.  The impugned provisions are aimed at
keeping bad drivers off the road; they are not prohibitions which are
""criminal in the true sense"".  As a result, this offence is prima
facie one of strict liability.  Further, the legislature has not clearly
indicated that the offence created by the combination of ss. 92 and 94(1)
is one of absolute liability.  The phrase ""automatically and without
notice"" simply highlights that the 12‑month statutory prohibition is
to take effect immediately and by operation of law without any requirement that
notice be given by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles or received by a driver
who is prohibited from driving under the statute.  An accused cannot seek
solace in the failure to provide notice of the applicable statutory
prohibition, since ignorance of the law is never an excuse for breaking the
law.  As well, the impugned provisions allow for the defences of reasonable
mistake of fact and due diligence. Accordingly, the prima facie
characterization of this public welfare legislation as being of strict
liability is confirmed.

 

                   A strict liability
offence requires the minimal mental element of negligence in order to ground a
conviction.  Negligence consists in an unreasonable failure to know the facts
which constitute the offence, or the failure to be duly diligent to take steps
which a reasonable person would take.  Since ignorance of the law is not an
excuse for breaking the law, due diligence consists in taking steps to fulfil a
duty imposed by law and not in the ascertainment of the existence of a
statutory prohibition or its interpretation.  Exceptionally, where knowledge
that conduct is prohibited is itself part of the mens rea, the absence
of knowledge provides a good defence.

 

                    Here, s. 92
creates the 12‑month driving prohibition which is effective automatically
and without notice upon conviction of one of the underlying offences.  The
factual element comprising the actus reus consists in the driving of a
motor vehicle having previously been convicted of one of the underlying
offences.  Since there is no mens rea specified, it must be inferred
from the actus reus and, because this is a regulatory offence, the mens
rea consists in negligence in relation to any of the elements of the actus
reus, but not in relation to the existence of this statutory prohibition or
its interpretation, since that would be ignorance or mistake of law. 
Consequently, a person charged with driving while under a statutory prohibition
can avoid conviction if he demonstrates, on the preponderance of the evidence,
that he made a reasonable mistake of fact as to the existence of his
conviction, or that he exercised due diligence to ascertain whether he had been
convicted of one of the underlying offences.  Defences are available in
relation to all the factual elements of the actus reus, and this
adequately meets the minimal constitutional requirement of fault for a public
welfare or regulatory offence such as driving while under a statutory
prohibition.  Sections 92 and 94(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act are
therefore entirely consistent with s. 7 of our Charter  without any
further requirements.

 

                   Since the impugned
provisions already allow for due diligence in relation to all the factual
elements of the actus reus, the due diligence called for by the
majority, presumably as a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7  of
the Charter , to cure the alleged constitutional deficiency in the
provisions is nothing less than due diligence in relation to the existence of a
legislative prohibition pertaining to a regulated activity or its
interpretation -- that is, a defence of ignorance of the law.  Our system of
laws, however, has long held as axiomatic that ignorance of the law is not an
excuse for breaking the law.  This cornerstone of our law remains secure even
after the passage of the Charter , and there is no conflict between it
and the principles of fundamental justice.  To expand the defence of due
diligence to comprehend a defence of ignorance of the law undercuts the mistake
of law rule and will render many of our laws unenforceable; as a corollary,
this Court's decision in Molis appears to be impliedly overturned
without any explanation.  Furthermore, the impugned prohibition is a regulatory
offence incident to a licensed activity.  A regulated actor is deemed to have
voluntarily accepted the terms and conditions attaching to the privilege of
participating in a regulated activity.  As a result, he cannot be described as
morally innocent when he commits a regulatory offence.  Finally, a legislature
may choose, as a matter of policy, to provide a defence of ignorance of the law
in relation to some, all or none of the statutory conditions of engaging in a
regulated activity.  Such a policy decision remains a matter over which the
relevant representative body is entirely sovereign.

 

                   The provision of
some form of notice of the law would convert the offence into one of full mens
rea, since the accused would then be driving with actual subjective
knowledge that he was prohibited under provincial legislation. Rather than an
offence of full mens rea, the province chose a solution appropriately
tailored to the regulatory context: an offence of strict liability.  That
solution adequately meets the exigencies of our Charter  and is therefore
a valid policy choice of full force and effect without any further requirement
of notice.

                   APPEAL from a
judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (1994), 89 B.C.L.R. (2d) 271,
1 M.V.R. (3d) 87, 19 C.R.R. (2d) 281, 40 B.C.A.C. 73, 65 W.A.C. 73, affirming a
judgment of Hood J. (1992), 37 M.V.R. (2d) 162, dismissing the Crown's appeal
from a judgment of Cronin Prov. Ct. J. rendered June 14, 1991, acquitting
the accused on a charge of driving a motor vehicle while prohibited.  Appeal
dismissed, La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. dissenting.

 

                   George H.
Copley, for the appellant.

 

                   Terrence L.

and Andrea M. Finch, for the respondent.

 

                   Bernard Laprade, for the intervener.

 

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

1                 Cory
J. -- The sole issue to be resolved on this appeal is whether the
combined effect of ss. 94(1) and 92 of the Motor Vehicle Act,
R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, creates an offence of absolute liability or strict
liability.

 

Factual Background

 

2                 The respondent was charged with
driving a motor vehicle in the city of Vancouver on August 3, 1990, at a time
when he was prohibited from driving pursuant to s. 92 of the Motor
Vehicle Act.

 

Relevant Statutory
Provisions

 

3                 Section 92 of the Motor
Vehicle Act provides in part:

 

                   92.  (1)  For the purpose of
this section, ""convicted"" includes the granting of an absolute or
conditional discharge. 

 

                   (2)  A
person who is convicted of

 

                   (a)
an offence under section 88, 94, 220.1(1) or 220.3(1), or

 

                   (b)
a motor vehicle related Criminal Code  offence

 

is
automatically and without notice prohibited from driving a motor vehicle for 12
months from the date of sentencing, the date that the passing of sentence is
suspended, the date of being granted an absolute or conditional discharge.
. . .

 

4                 Prior to December 1985,
s. 92 contained a third subsection which provided:

 

                   (3)  Subsection
(2) does not apply where neither the defendant nor his agent or counsel appear
before the court at the time of conviction.

 

5                 Section 94 of the Motor
Vehicle Act provides in part:

 

                   94. (1)  A person who
drives a motor vehicle on a highway or industrial road while

 

                   (a)he
is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle under section 90, 91, 92 or
92.1 of this Act . . . or

 

                   (b)his
driver's licence or his right to apply for or obtain a driver's licence is
suspended under section 82 or 92 as it was before its repeal and
replacement came into force . . .

 

commits
an offence and is liable,

 

                   (c)on
a first conviction, to a fine of not less than $300 and not more than
$2 000 and to imprisonment for not less than 7 days and not more than 6
months, and

 

                   (d)on
a subsequent conviction, regardless of when the contravention occurred, to a
fine of not less than $300 and not more than $2 000 and to imprisonment
for not less than 14 days and not more than one year.

 

6                 Prior to 1987, s. 94
contained the following subsection:

 

                   (2)  Subsection
(1) creates an absolute liability offence in which guilt is established by
proof of driving, whether or not the defendant knew of the prohibition or
suspension.

 

7                 Section 4.1 of the Offence
Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 305 (amended in 1990) provides:

 

                   4.1  Notwithstanding section 4
or the provisions of any other Act, no person is liable to imprisonment with
respect to an absolute liability offence.

 

8                 Further, s. 72(1) of the Offence
Act provides that the failure to pay a fine will not result in a jail term:

 

                   72. (1)  Subject to
subsection (6), but notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any other
Act, regulation, municipal bylaw or order made by a justice, no justice shall,
except under the Small Claims Act, order that a person be imprisoned by
reason only that he defaults in paying a fine.

 

9                 It should be noted that neither
the provisions of s. 4.1 of the Offence Act nor the absence of any
jail term for the non‑payment of fines was argued in the courts below. 
Obviously, if the offence is one of absolute liability, but there is no risk of
imprisonment, then the provision will not offend s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Similarly, if the statutory provisions are
found to create a strict liability offence, then by definition a defence of due
diligence must be available to the accused and there will be no infraction of
s. 7  of the Charter .  The sole difference will be that if the
offence is found to be one of strict liability, the possible sanction of a term
of imprisonment may be retained.

 

Courts Below

 

Provincial Court

 

10               Cronin Prov. Ct. J. found that
s. 94 of the Motor Vehicle Act, in combination with s. 92,
created an absolute liability offence for which imprisonment was a penalty,
with the result that the offence violated s. 7  of the Charter .  He
concluded that a person who was unaware of the fact that he had been prohibited
from driving pursuant to s. 92 of the Motor Vehicle Act could still
drive his motor vehicle, honestly believing that he was entitled to do so, yet
if he was charged under s. 94 he would have no defence available to him. 
This, he held, would follow from the decision in R. v. MacDougall,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 605, which held that ignorance of the fact that one's licence
had been revoked or suspended was ignorance of the law and therefore did not
constitute a defence.

 

11               Cronin Prov. Ct. J. found that the
situation presented to him was the same as that which faced the Court in Re
B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486.  He declared that the
reference to s. 92 in s. 94 of the Motor Vehicle Act should be
declared inoperative pursuant to s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 . 
In light of his finding that the legislation was invalid, he found the accused
not guilty.

 

Summary Conviction
Appeal Court

 

12               In careful and extensive reasons,
Hood J. upheld the decision of the trial judge:  (1992), 37 M.V.R. (2d) 162. 
It was his opinion that in order to constitute a strict liability offence that
conformed with s. 7  of the Charter , s. 94 of the Motor
Vehicle Act had to provide for a minimum fault requirement of negligence. 
This required that the defence of due diligence or reasonable care be available
to an accused.  In his view, the question to be resolved in the case was
whether the combination of ss. 94 and 92 of the Motor Vehicle Act,
in reality, left this defence open to an accused.

 

13               It was his opinion that the
decision in R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, did
not go so far as to require an accused to know that he had been prohibited from
driving.  On this point he wrote (at pp. 177‑78):

 

                   While
the essential ingredients of subjective mens rea, i.e., intent or knowledge of
the wrongfulness of the act on the part of the accused (a positive state of
mind) are not required, in my opinion knowledge of the essentials of the actus
reus are required where the minimum fault requirement is negligence; for it
seems to me that like intention, negligence presupposes knowledge of the
circumstances making up the actus reus.  If the accused does not have knowledge
of a particular event, it is difficult to see how he can carry out any duty
imposed by that event.  I find it difficult to see how it can be said that the
defence of due diligence was open to the accused when he did not know of the
fact that he was prohibited from driving, and therefore was unaware of the duty
imposed on him by that prohibition.  No care on his part could save him from
conviction and imprisonment.  Not knowing of the duty imposed on him by the law,
he would not have done anything factually in discharge of that duty which could
be later scrutinized on the issue of due diligence.

 

14               Hood J. emphasized that these
words did not mean that ignorance of the law was a defence.  He stated that the
situation was quite different in the case at bar ""which concerns knowledge
of an essential element of the actus reus and involves some voluntariness or
awareness on the part of the accused"" (p. 178).  It was his opinion
that it did not matter if the lack of knowledge of the essential element also
constituted ignorance of the law.  He found that ""[i]t is the lack of
knowledge of the essential element of the actus reus which prevents the defence
of due diligence from being available.  This is not to say that ignorance of
the law is a defence"" (p. 178).  On this question, he concluded that,
in the alternative, if there was a conflict between the principle that
ignorance of the law is no defence and the requirements of s. 7  of the Charter ,
then the Charter  must prevail.

 

15               Hood J. distinguished the decision
in MacDougall, supra, on the basis that in MacDougall the
accused had general knowledge of the provisions of the Nova Scotia Motor
Vehicle Act and therefore of the duties imposed upon him.  Further, he
observed that it did not appear that the defence raised in the case at bar,
namely that because of the nature of the prohibition under s. 92, an
accused charged under s. 94 simply would not have available to him a
defence of due diligence, was argued in MacDougall.

 

16               Hood J. held that s. 94 of
the Act, when read in combination with s. 92, created an absolute
liability offence.  He reached this conclusion by applying both the traditional
approach to the classification of offences set out in R. v. City of Sault
Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, and as well the constitutional approach
outlined by this Court in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra.

 

17               With regard to the traditional
approach, he found that there had been no significant change in s. 94 with
the invalidation of s. 94(2) following the Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act
decision.  He observed that as things presently stood, an accused could still
be convicted under that section whether or not he knew that he had been
prohibited from driving.  He found that the combined effect of ss. 92 and
94 was ""to remove from the accused any opportunity to prove that his
action in driving his motor vehicle while prohibited from doing so was due to
an honest and reasonable mistake of fact, or that he acted without guilty
intent"" (p. 187).  He concluded that the offence still remained one
of absolute liability.

 

18               Applying the constitutional
approach, he also concluded that the combination of ss. 94 and 92 offended
the principles of fundamental justice and thus contravened s. 7  of the Charter . 
As a result of the enactment making the driving prohibition automatic and
without notice, the legislation effectively withdrew from the accused any
possible defence of due diligence.  This defence of due diligence was required
in order to make negligence offences comply with the requirements of
s. 7 .  On this aspect he wrote (at p. 190):

 

                   In
order for s. 94 to withstand Charter  scrutiny it must require as an
essential element a minimum mens rea or fault requirement of negligence and
leave open or available to an accused at the least the defence of due
diligence.  It would then conform to s. 7  of the Charter  and the
principle of fundamental justice.  It does not do so.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

[B]y
making the prohibition automatic and without notice, the legislature
effectively withdrew from the unknowing accused all possible defences of due
diligence.  As I have already said, an accused having no knowledge of the
prohibition would have no knowledge of the duty imposed upon him.  No care on
his part could save him.  He would never be in a position to show that he took
all reasonable care to avoid breaching the statute.  Generally, the situation
is this.  The accused has knowledge of the essential elements of the actus
reus, the prohibited act, but does not know that it is illegal; for example,
driving a motor vehicle in a certain manner or manufacturing certain
chemicals.  He bona fide believes that what he is doing is legal.  He is
mistaken.  This is what is meant by ignorance of the law or mistake of law.  It
is no defence.

 

                   But
here the situation is different.  I am reasonably confident that the accused
would know the law, i.e., that it is illegal for a person to drive his motor
vehicle when he is prohibited from doing so.  What he is ignorant of, or
mistaken about, is the very fact that he has been prohibited from driving.  His
ignorance goes to an essential element of the actus reus; which must be a
conscious or voluntary act on the part of the accused.  Where the actus reus is
the offence, and negligence must be the minimum fault, the defence of due
diligence cannot be said to be open to the accused who has no knowledge of an
essential element of the actus reus.  This is so, in my opinion, even if it can
be said that the lack of knowledge of the essential element of the actus reus
at the same time constitutes ignorance of the law.

 

Court of Appeal

 

19               The Court of Appeal adopted the
reasons of Hood J. and dismissed the appeal:  (1994), 89 B.C.L.R. (2d) 271, 1
M.V.R. (3d) 87, 19 C.R.R. (2d) 281, 40 B.C.A.C. 73, 65 W.A.C. 73.

 

Analysis

 

Categories of Offences

 

20               It may be helpful to undertake a
very brief review of the reasons of Dickson J. (as he then was) in Sault
Ste. Marie, supra.  In that case, he noted that there were three
categories of offences.  First, he referred to the traditional criminal law
offence, which required proof of either an intent to commit the prohibited act
or a reckless disregard for the consequences of committing that act.  Second,
at the opposite end of the scale was the absolute liability offence which did
not permit of any explanation by the accused; the performance of the act alone
was sufficient to establish culpability.  Third, between these two categories
was the offence of strict liability.  In that category of offence, the accused
could escape liability by demonstrating that he had exercised due diligence by
taking all reasonable steps to avoid the commission of the prohibited act, or
that he reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would
render the act or omission innocent.

 

21               Dickson J. described the offences
in this manner (at pp. 1325-26):

 

1.Offences
in which mens rea, consisting of some positive state of mind such as
intent, knowledge, or recklessness, must be proved by the prosecution either as
an inference from the nature of the act committed, or by additional evidence.

 

2.Offences
in which there is no necessity for the prosecution to prove the existence of mens
rea; the doing of the prohibited act prima facie imports the
offence, leaving it open to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he
took all reasonable care.  This involves consideration of what a reasonable man
would have done in the circumstances.  The defence will be available if the
accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would
render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to
avoid the particular event.  These offences may properly be called offences of
strict liability. . . .

 

3.Offences
of absolute liability where it is not open to the accused to exculpate himself
by showing that he was free of fault. [Emphasis added.]

 

22               He then went on to indicate how a
distinction could be made between offences of strict liability and absolute
liability and described the manner in which the various offences could be
categorized (at p. 1326):

 

Offences
which are criminal in the true sense fall in the first category.  Public
welfare offences would prima facie be in the second category.  They are
not subject to the presumption of full mens rea.  An offence of this
type would fall in the first category only if such words as
""wilfully"", ""with intent"", ""knowingly"", or
""intentionally"" are contained in the statutory provision creating the
offence.  On the other hand, the principle that punishment should in general
not be inflicted on those without fault applies.  Offences of absolute
liability would be those in respect of which the Legislature had made it clear
that guilt would follow proof merely of the proscribed act.  The overall
regulatory pattern adopted by the Legislature, the subject matter of the
legislation, the importance of the penalty, and the precision of the language
used will be primary considerations in determining whether the offence falls
into the third category.

 

23               Subsequent to this decision, the
question arose as to what minimal intent should be required in light of the
passage of s. 7  of the Charter .  That section provides:

 

                   7.  Everyone has the right to
life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived
thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

24               In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act,
supra, Lamer J. (as he then was) found that absolute liability offences
which provided for a term of imprisonment as a sanction contravened s. 7 
of the Charter .  At page 515 of that decision he wrote:

 

                   I
am therefore of the view that the combination of imprisonment and of absolute
liability violates s. 7  of the Charter  and can only be salvaged if
the authorities demonstrate under s. 1 that such a deprivation of liberty
in breach of those principles of fundamental justice is, in a free and
democratic society, under the circumstances, a justified reasonable limit to
one's rights under s. 7 .

 

25               This principle that provincial
regulatory offences which provide for a sanction of imprisonment require a
minimum mental state was again confirmed in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2
S.C.R. 636.  At page 652, Lamer J. wrote:

 

In
effect, Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act acknowledges that, whenever the state
resorts to the restriction of liberty, such as imprisonment, to assist in the
enforcement of a law, even, as in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, a mere
provincial regulatory offence, there is, as a principle of fundamental justice,
a minimum mental state which is an essential element of the offence.  It thus
elevated mens rea from a presumed element in Sault Ste. Marie, supra,
to a constitutionally required element.  Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act
. . . inferentially decided that even for a mere provincial
regulatory offence at least negligence was required, in that at least
a defence of due diligence must always be open to an accused who risks
imprisonment upon conviction.  [Emphasis added.]

 

26               From the cases which followed the
passage of the Charter , the following can be derived:  first, generally
speaking, an offence of absolute liability is not likely to offend s. 7  of
the Charter  unless a prison sanction is provided; secondly, an accused
charged with an absolute liability offence cannot avoid liability by
demonstrating that he exercised due diligence; thirdly, one of the prime bases
for distinguishing a strict liability offence from an absolute liability
offence is the availability of the defence of due diligence; fourthly, any
provincial regulatory offence providing for a term of imprisonment must make a
defence of due diligence available to the accused.  I would leave open for
future consideration the situation presented by an absolute liability offence
punishable by fine with the possibility of imprisonment for its non‑payment
in those circumstances where the legislation provides that the imposition and
collection of any fine is subject to a means test.

 

Does Section 94,
in Combination with Section 92, Create an Absolute Liability Offence?

 

27               There are, I believe, two methods
of determining whether an offence is one of absolute liability.  First, as
suggested in Sault Ste. Marie, supra, regard may be had to the
overall regulatory pattern adopted by the legislature, the subject matter of
the legislation, the importance of the penalty and the precision of the
language used.

 

28               Second, the availability of a due
diligence defence must be considered. An absolute liability offence denies an
accused the opportunity to put forward a defence of due diligence.  Conversely,
in order for an offence to be one of strict liability, the defence of due
diligence must be available.

 

29               Considering first, the wording of
the Act, it will be remembered that it provides that a person convicted of an
underlying offence is ""automatically and without notice"" prohibited
from driving a motor vehicle for 12 months from the date of sentencing. 
Section 94 provides that a person who drives a motor vehicle on the
highway while he is prohibited from driving under s. 92 commits an offence
and is liable:

 

(c)on
a first conviction, to a fine of not less than $300 and not more than
$2 000 and to imprisonment for not less than 7 days and not more than 6
months, and

 

(d)on
a subsequent conviction, regardless of when the contravention occurred, to a
fine of not less than $300 and not more than $2 000 and to imprisonment
for not less than 14 days and not more than one year.

 

The fundamental aspect of the offence
is that a person convicted of the underlying offence will be automatically and
without notice prohibited from driving a motor vehicle.  The words
""automatically and without notice"" go far towards establishing that
this is indeed an absolute liability offence.

 

30               In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act,
supra, it was found that s. 94, as it was then worded, created an
absolute liability offence.  At the time of that decision, s. 94 contained
a subs. (2) which read:

 

                   (2)  Subsection
(1) creates an absolute liability offence in which guilt is established by
proof of driving, whether or not the defendant knew of the prohibition or
suspension.

 

That provision was found to contravene
the Charter  and was deleted from the Act in 1986.  However, I am of the
view that the removal of that subsection does not change the offence into one
of strict liability.  As all the judges in the courts below have found, the
situation has not been changed in any significant manner by the deletion of
that subsection.  The deleted subsection did no more than emphasize and
reiterate that this was an absolute liability offence.  Yet, the same
conclusion can be reached from a consideration of the remaining wording of
s. 94.  Section 94(1)(a) still refers to s. 92 which, in turn,
provides that a driver will ""automatically and without notice"" be
prohibited from driving for a period of 12 months.  In effect, the
combination of s. 92 and s. 94 provides for the conviction of the
prohibited driver whether or not he knows that he is prohibited from driving.

 

31               Section 94 goes further. 
Because the prohibition to drive in s. 92 is automatic and without notice,
s. 94 effectively prevents an accused who is unaware of the prohibition
from raising a defence of due diligence.  At this point, it may be helpful to
explore the nature of the defence of due diligence and how and when it may be
utilized.

 

Defence of Due
Diligence

 

32               The decision in Sault Ste.
Marie, supra, established that a person accused of a strict
liability offence may avoid conviction by proving, on the balance of
probabilities, either that he had an honest but mistaken belief in facts which,
if true, would render the act innocent, or that he exercised all reasonable
care to avoid committing the offence.  That is to say, he did what a reasonable
person would have done in the circumstances to avoid the occurrence of the
prohibited act.  In my view, if neither of these two facets of the defence of
due diligence is available to an accused, the offence cannot be said to be one
of strict liability.  By definition, a strict liability offence requires that
the defence of due diligence be available.  Put another way, if the offence
does not permit a due diligence defence, then it cannot be a strict liability
offence.

 

33               In determining whether either
facet of the defence of due diligence is available in this case, it is
important to remember the well-established principle, incorporated in s. 19  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , that a mistake of
law is no excuse.  In other words, a mistake as to what the law is does not
operate as a defence.

 

34               The application of this principle
leads to the conclusion that an accused cannot put forward as a defence that he
made diligent inquiries as to the legality of his actions or status.  The
submission of such a defence was specifically rejected in Molis v. The Queen,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 356.  In that case, the accused was charged with trafficking in
a drug restricted under the Food and Drugs Act .  The drug which the
accused had begun manufacturing had been unrestricted but later became
restricted.  At trial, the accused testified that he had exercised due
diligence to ascertain the state of the law.  This defence was rejected.  At
page 364 Lamer J. wrote:

 

                   It
is clear to me that we are dealing here with an offence that is not to be
considered as one of absolute liability and, hence, a defence of due diligence
is available to an accused.  But I hasten to add that the defence of due
diligence that was referred to in Sault Ste. Marie is that of due
diligence in relation to the fulfilment of a duty imposed by law and not in
relation to the ascertainment of the existence of a prohibition or its
interpretation.  [Emphasis added.]

 

35               These principles must be kept in
mind in the assessment of the Crown's contention that the decision of this
Court in MacDougall, supra, constitutes a complete answer to the
characterization of the offence.  In that case, following a conviction for
failing to remain at the scene of an accident, the accused was prohibited from
driving by the operation of s. 250(1) of the Nova Scotia Motor Vehicle Act. 
The accused subsequently drove while prohibited and was charged with that
offence.  At trial, he testified that he did not know of the prohibition. 
Ritchie J., on behalf of the Court, held that the offence was one of strict
liability, but that the defence of lack of knowledge of the prohibition was
tantamount to a defence of ignorance of the law which, in light of the
provision of s. 19  of the Criminal Code , could not provide a defence. 
Reliance is placed by the Crown upon this portion of the reasons of Ritchie J.,
found at p. 608:

 

                   I
am in agreement with all of the judges in the courts below, including the
dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, in finding that as the offence here
charged is one concerning the public welfare it was properly characterized as
""an offence of strict liability"" within the meaning of the
classification stipulated by Mr. Justice Dickson (supra) and that a
defence is accordingly available to the accused if he ""reasonably believed
in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render"" his act in
continuing to drive his motor vehicle without a licence, an innocent one. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

36               Two difficulties arise from the MacDougall
decision.  The first difficulty lies in its irreconcilability with the earlier
decision of R. v. Prue; R. v. Baril, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 547.  The second
lies in the fact that MacDougall was rendered prior to the Charter ,
and that the jurisprudence on the minimal fault requirement has evolved since
then.

 

37               In Prue, supra, the
accused were convicted of an offence under the Criminal Code .  As a
result, their licences were automatically suspended under the provisions of the
B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.  They nonetheless drove their vehicles and were
charged, not for a violation of the provincial statute under which the
suspension was made, but rather under s. 238  of the Criminal Code 
which at the time read:

 

                   238. . . .

 

                   (3)  Every
one who drives a motor vehicle in Canada while he is disqualified or prohibited
from driving a motor vehicle by reason of the legal suspension or cancellation,
in any province, of his permit or licence . . . is guilty of

 

(a)  an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years; or

 

(b)  an
offence punishable on summary conviction.  [Emphasis added.]

 

38               Laskin C.J. stated that as a
result of the inclusion of the offence in the Criminal Code , it was
necessary to import mens rea.  He then considered the submission of the
Crown that ignorance of the suspension was ignorance of the law, not a mistake
of fact, and therefore could not be put forward as a defence.  He then stated
at p. 552:

 

The
effect, if this is a correct appraisal, is to make s. 238(3) an offence of
absolute liability where the provincial suspension of a driving licence
is automatic under the provincial enactment . . ., but not
if the provincial suspension does not take effect without a requirement of
notice.  [Emphasis added.]

 

39               Laskin C.J. thus implied that an
offence which was automatic and without notice constituted an absolute
liability offence.  However, he went on to find that ignorance of the
suspension of a licence, in that case, was a mistake of fact.

 

40               With respect to the ignorance of
the suspension, these reasons simply cannot be reconciled with MacDougall,
supra.  It cannot be that a mistake as to the law under the Criminal
Code  constitutes a mistake of fact, whereas a mistake as to the provisions
of the provincial statute constitutes a mistake of law.  As an alternative to
his position that MacDougall should be overruled, the respondent
contended that there is a basis for distinguishing the decisions since, in the MacDougall
case, the evidence made it clear that the accused knew of the underlying
conviction and, more importantly, was aware in general terms of the provisions
of the Nova Scotia Act.  Yet, this is a very narrow distinction that I cannot
accept.

 

41               Perhaps it could be said that the Prue
decision was correct in the conclusion that where the provincial suspension is
automatic and without notice, the offence of driving while disqualified is an
offence of absolute liability, but incorrect in the conclusion that lack of
knowledge of the suspension is a mistake of fact.  On the other hand, it might
be said that the MacDougall decision was correct in its conclusion that
lack of knowledge of the suspension is a mistake of law.  However, I am of the
opinion that its characterization of the offence as one of strict liability
cannot prevail under the Charter .  This is the second difficulty raised
by the MacDougall decision.

 

42               It must be remembered that the MacDougall
decision was rendered prior to the Charter .  It thus did not consider
the constitutionally required minimal fault component outlined by this Court in
cases such as Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, and Vaillancourt,
supra.  The defence of due diligence must be available to defend a
strict liability offence.  If that defence is removed, the offence can no
longer be classified as one of strict liability.  When, as a result of the
wording of the section, the only possible defence an accused can put forward is
his ignorance of the fact that his licence had been suspended by the provisions
of the provincial statute, which constitutes a mistake of law and therefore is
not available as a defence, the accused is effectively denied the defence of
due diligence.  In those circumstances, the offence ought to be characterized
as one of absolute liability.

 

43               It seems to be clear that the
defence of due diligence is not available to an accused charged under
ss. 92 and 94 of the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.  There are a number of
examples which can illustrate this situation.  First, take the situation of an
accused charged with failure to give a sample of breath.  After trial he is
found guilty, fined and his licence suspended for 3 months.  Apparently,
in British Columbia, he would be given no notice of the automatic suspension of
one year provided by the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.  Yet, he would be
liable to conviction despite his honest and reasonable belief as a lay person
that the total sentence imposed by the court was a fine and a suspension of his
licence for a period of 3 months.  Certainly, to most people ""a
court"" is a court wherever it may be located and the sentence of that
court is what is binding upon them.  Even if an accused asked the court to
confirm that this was the total extent of his sentence, this would not amount
to a defence of due diligence since his error was as to the provisions of the
B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, and this constitutes an error of law.

 

44               Similarly, if an accused is
charged and convicted of impaired driving and sentenced to 6 months
prohibition from driving, he would leave the court room believing that this
sentence constituted the entire penalty.  However, by virtue of s. 92 of
the Act, he is also, without any notice to him, automatically prohibited from
driving for a period of 12 months from the date of conviction.  If he
drives after 6 months have expired and is stopped by the police, he would
be charged with ""driving while prohibited"", despite the fact that he
honestly and reasonably believed that he was no longer prohibited from
driving.  He would not be able to put this forward as a defence since ignorance
of the law cannot be invoked as a defence, even if he took steps at his
original trial to confirm before the convicting judge that this was the total
extent of his penalty.  Quite simply, the statute effectively deprives the
accused of the defence of due diligence.

 

Significance of Notice

 

45               The legislature could readily
convert this offence to one of strict liability by permitting the defence of
due diligence to be raised.  If there was any concern that those accused of the
offence would defend on the basis that they had no knowledge of its effect, a
provision requiring that notice be given of its consequences could be added. 
Notice could be given in many ways.  The following are a few examples.

 

46               Upon the issuance or a renewal of
a licence, notice could be given that upon conviction of the listed enumerated
offences, there will be an automatic suspension of the licence for a 12‑month
period.  Alternatively, notice of the consequences could be given with the
serving of the summons or charge for the underlying offence.  In still another
manner, the notice could be given as a matter of course upon conviction for the
underlying offence, and would thus form part of the record of the court
proceedings.  There is something so fundamentally fair about the giving of
notice that I find it commendable.  It must be remembered that regulatory
offences number in the tens of thousands.  There are federal regulations and
provincial regulations that will vary in their terms and provisions from coast
to coast.  Surely it is not asking too much that the accused be given some form
of notice.

 

Summary

 

47               In summary, it is my opinion that
ss. 92 and 94 of the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act create an absolute
liability offence since they effectively eliminate the defence of due
diligence.  Nevertheless, the absolute liability offence does not contravene
the Charter .  This conclusion flows from the application of s. 4.1
and of s. 72(1) of the Offence Act.  These sections respectively
indicate that, notwithstanding the provisions of any other Act, no person is
liable to imprisonment for an absolute liability offence, and that the non‑payment
of a fine will not result in imprisonment.  Thus, an accused convicted under
ss. 92 and 94 of the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act faces no risk of
imprisonment and there is, accordingly, no violation of the right to life,
liberty and security of the person under s. 7  of the Charter .

 

Disposition

 

48               In my opinion, the offence created
by ss. 92 and 94 of the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act is one of absolute
liability.  However, it is not constitutionally invalid since, by the operation
of s. 4.1 of the Offence Act, there is no sanction of imprisonment
attached to absolute liability offences.

 

49               In light of these reasons, an
order directing a new trial would ordinarily be the appropriate result.  Yet,
the respondent has been brought before every level of court at the instigation
of the Crown.  This appeal was really brought to determine whether the offence
in question was one of absolute or strict liability.  Throughout, the Crown
directed its submissions solely to this issue.  That question is now resolved. 
In these circumstances, to direct a new trial for Pontes would be unfair and
unduly harsh.  Consequently, the appeal is dismissed.

 

50               The constitutional question
reads:  ""Does s. 94 of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979,
c. 288, when read in conjunction with s. 92 of that Act create an
absolute liability offence which violates s. 7  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms ?""  The answer to the question must be that the
offence created by ss. 92 and 94 of B.C. Motor Vehicle Act is one
of absolute liability.  However, it is not constitutionally invalid since, by
the operation of s. 4.1 of the Offence Act, there is no sanction of
imprisonment attached to absolute liability offences.

 

                   The reasons of
La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were delivered
by

 

51               Gonthier
J. (dissenting) -- The constitutional question raised by this appeal was
stated by Lamer C.J. on September 8, 1994 as follows:

 

Does
s. 94 of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, when
read in conjunction with s. 92 of that Act create an absolute liability
offence which violates s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

52               I have had the benefit of the
reasons of my colleague Justice Cory.  I respectfully disagree with his
conclusion that the combined effect of ss. 92 and 94(1) of the Motor
Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, is to create an offence of
absolute liability.  In my view, these provisions create an offence of strict
liability where the fact of driving while prohibited by statute prima facie
imports the offence, but where it is nevertheless possible for an accused to
avoid conviction by demonstrating that he reasonably believed that he had not
been convicted of one of the underlying offences to which the 12-month
statutory prohibition attaches, or that he exercised due diligence in seeking
to acquire knowledge of the underlying conviction.  As a result, the impugned
provisions adequately provide for the constitutionally minimum mens rea
of negligence in order to ground a conviction and thus imprisonment for the
regulatory or public welfare offence of driving while prohibited by statute.  I
would therefore answer the constitutional question posed by Lamer C.J. in
the negative, allow the appeal and order a new trial.

 

53               I also respectfully disagree with
Cory J.'s position that the alleged constitutional deficiency in the
impugned provisions can be cured by expanding the defence of due diligence. 
Since in my view the provisions already allow for due diligence in relation to
all the factual elements of the actus reus, the due diligence which is
called for, presumably as a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is nothing less than due
diligence in relation to the existence of a legislative prohibition pertaining
to a regulated activity -- that is, due diligence is being expanded to
comprehend a defence of ignorance of the law.  But our system of laws has long
held as axiomatic that ignorance of the law is not an excuse for breaking the
law.  This cornerstone of our law remains secure even after the passage of the Charter ,
and I see no conflict between it and the principles of fundamental justice.  As
well, a regulated actor is deemed to have voluntarily accepted the terms and
conditions of engaging in a regulated activity.  Parliament or a legislature
may choose, as a matter of policy, to provide a defence of ignorance of the law
in relation to some, all or none of the statutory conditions of engaging in a
regulated activity.  Such a policy decision remains a matter over which the
relevant representative body is entirely sovereign.

 

I. Facts and Relevant
Legislation

 

54               Since my colleague Cory J. has
helpfully summarized the relevant factual and legislative background and the
decisions of the courts below, I need not repeat that discussion.  I would only
add that the record before this Court is silent as to the underlying offence of
which the respondent was convicted and which then gave rise, by operation of
law, to the 12-month driving prohibition.  The record is also silent as to
whether the respondent was aware that he was prohibited from driving by virtue
of ss. 92 and 94(1).  While these facts are not necessary to answer the
constitutional question since this appeal involves a facial challenge to the
constitutionality of the legislation, they are nevertheless relevant to the
disposition of the respondent's case because, as detailed below, I find that
this legislation is constitutionally valid without recourse to s. 4.1 of
the Offence Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 305.

 

55               It is also important to explore
briefly why the legislature of British Columbia may have decided that the
enacted 12-month prohibition should be effective without formal notice and
instead, simply by operation of law.  The most obvious explanation is that the
underlying offences which give rise to the 12‑month statutory prohibition
are some of the most serious driving offences.  They include:

 

1.Driving
while prohibited by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles or a police officer
(s. 88 of the Motor Vehicle Act);

 

2.Driving
while prohibited by court order or by operation of a law (s. 94 of the Motor
Vehicle Act);

 

3.Driving
with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood
(s. 220.1(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act);

 

4.Refusal
to give a blood sample (s. 220.3(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act);

 

5.Motor
vehicle related Criminal Code  offences:

 

(a)causing
death by criminal negligence (s. 220 );

 

(b)causing
bodily harm by criminal negligence (s. 221 );

 

(c)manslaughter
(s. 236 );

 

(d)dangerous
operation of motor vehicles (s. 249(1)(a));

 

(e)operating
a motor vehicle while impaired (s. 253);

 

(f)failure
to provide a breath sample (s. 254(5));

 

(g)impaired
driving causing bodily harm or death (s. 255);

 

(h)operating
a motor vehicle while disqualified from doing so (s. 259(4)).

 

It is thus readily apparent that the
Province decided that in order to protect the welfare of the public and keep
some of the most dangerous drivers off the roads, a prohibition would be
effective automatically by operation of law on conviction of one of these
underlying offences.  That the statutory prohibition is effective immediately
without being subject to the vagaries incidental to the giving of notice only
underscores the Province's seriousness of purpose.  It is, after all, trying to
protect the public from some criminally bad drivers, and it is indeed sobering
to read the list of offences which they have targeted.  And while it is perhaps
true that the giving of formal notice of the law could have been consistent
with this serious purpose, as I detail below the provision of such notice
affects only the wisdom of the legislation, not its constitutionality.

 

II. Analysis

 

A.The Sault Ste. Marie Scheme of Offences and
the Constitutional Requirement  of Fault

 

56               Since Cory J. has also helpfully
summarized the taxonomic scheme which this Court has developed to classify the
various offences in Canadian law, I need not review that discussion in detail,
save to offer a few observations to situate the analysis which follows.

 

57               In the seminal case of R. v.
City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at pp. 1325-26,
Dickson J. (as he then was) recognized that there are three categories of
offences in Canadian law rather than the traditional two, thus allowing strict
liability to occupy a half-way house between full mens rea offences and
those of absolute liability.  He suggested that only offences which were
""criminal in the true sense"" would be subject to the presumption of
full mens rea; that ""[p]ublic welfare offences would prima facie
be in the second category"" of strict liability offences; and finally, that
""[o]ffences of absolute liability would be those in respect of which the
Legislature had made it clear that guilt would follow proof merely of
the proscribed act"" (p. 1326 (emphasis added)).  The policy basis for
this common law interpretative presumption against conviction without fault was
and still is the obvious concern that the morally innocent should not be
punished (R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, at p. 652,
and R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606,
at p. 659).

 

58               In order to determine whether a
legislature has ""made it clear"" that the offence is of absolute
liability, Dickson J. suggested that regard may be had to the following
factors (at p. 1326):

 

The
overall regulatory pattern adopted by the Legislature, the subject matter of
the legislation, the importance of the penalty, and the precision of the
language used will be primary considerations in determining whether the offence
falls into the third category.

 

59               It is also important to remember
that even assuming that the legislature has not clearly indicated that the
offence is to be one of absolute liability, it is still necessary to determine
the appropriate level of fault or mens rea for the offence in question. 
Where the legislature has not used language which clearly indicates the mental
element of the offence, then the mental element must be judicially inferred
from the actus reus, the prohibited act.  For a regulatory or public
welfare offence, the appropriate inference is that there should be no
conviction without negligence.  For an offence which is criminal in the true
sense, the appropriate inference is that there should be no conviction without
some form of mens rea.  The Sault Ste. Marie scheme is thus
of fundamental importance in helping to determine the most appropriate degree
of fault given the nature of the offence.

 

60               With the entrenchment of the Charter ,
the element of fault was raised from a common law interpretative presumption to
a constitutional guaranty (Vaillancourt, supra, at p. 652,
and Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, supra, at p. 659). 
Differently put, the Charter  now requires that the inferred mens rea
also be minimally constitutionally sufficient given the nature of the offence. 
This Court has ruled that negligence in relation to the elements of the actus
reus is the constitutionally minimum degree of fault for a public welfare
or regulatory offence and where conviction allows for the possibility of
imprisonment (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, and Vaillancourt,
at p. 652).  We have also held that subjective mens rea reflecting
the particular nature of the offence may be constitutionally necessary for a
very few crimes to which a special social stigma attaches or for which severe
punishments are available (Vaillancourt, at p. 653).  Examples of
such special stigma crimes are murder and theft (R. v. Martineau, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 633, at p. 645, and R. v. Logan, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
731, at p. 744).  However, for the vast majority of criminal offences, the
Charter  only requires that there be ""an element of personal fault
in regard to a culpable aspect of the actus reus, but not necessarily in
regard to each and every element of the actus reus"" (R. v.
DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, at p. 965 (Sopinka J. for the
Court)).

 

B.The Place of the British Columbia Motor
Vehicle Act in the Sault Ste. Marie Scheme of Offences

 

61               Where, then, do the impugned
provisions of the British Columbia Motor Vehicle Act most appropriately
fit in the Sault Ste. Marie tripartite scheme of offences?  Here, the
subject matter of the statute quite clearly suggests that this is public
welfare or regulatory legislation.  The impugned provisions are aimed at
keeping bad drivers off the road; they are not prohibitions which are
""criminal in the true sense"".  As a result, this offence is prima
facie one of strict liability.  I note, nevertheless, that such a public
welfare purpose is consistent with both strict and absolute liability. 
Furthermore, considerations such as the overall regulatory pattern adopted by
the legislature and the importance of the penalty do not offer much guidance in
assessing whether the offence is of strict as opposed to absolute liability. 
These factors are generally of greater assistance in determining, when the
legislature has not specified a mental element, whether the offence ought to be
subject to the presumption of full mens rea or whether the offence is
simply one of absolute liability.

 

62               The appellant, however, suggests
that since the impugned provisions provide for a mandatory minimum period of
imprisonment, this militates against considering them as creating an absolute
liability offence, because this Court has already ruled in Re B.C. Motor
Vehicle Act, supra, that absolute liability and imprisonment cannot
be combined without running afoul of s. 7  of the Charter .  But
plainly this is circular reasoning.  The impugned provisions predate this
Court's ruling in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, and the appellant's
argument cannot be accepted unless the British Columbia legislature can be
credited with prescience.

 

63               It is for these reasons that I
believe that in this case the only factor listed by Dickson J. in Sault
Ste. Marie which is of any assistance in determining whether the impugned
provisions create an offence of absolute liability is the precision of the
language used.

 

64               On this score, my colleague
Cory J. suggests that the fact that the 12‑month statutory
prohibition attaches ""automatically and without notice"" goes
""far towards establishing that this is indeed an absolute liability
offence"" (para. 29).  He suggests that ""[i]n effect, the
combination of s. 92 and s. 94 provides for the conviction of the
prohibited driver whether or not he knows that he is prohibited from driving""
(para. 30).  I agree that knowledge of the enacted prohibition is not an
element of this offence.  But as I elaborate below, this does not render the
offence one of absolute liability.

 

65               In my view, the phrase
""automatically and without notice"" simply highlights that the 12‑month
statutory prohibition is to take effect immediately and by operation of law
without any requirement that notice be given by the Superintendent of Motor
Vehicles or received by a driver who is prohibited from driving under the statute. 
While the Act does contemplate notice from the Superintendent in certain
circumstances, this is only if the prohibition is made by the
Superintendent in the exercise of his or her discretionary authority.  For
example, s. 86(1) of the Act gives the Superintendent the authority to
order a prohibition when he or she ""considers it to be in the public
interest"", and then lists a number of criteria to be considered in
exercising this discretion, including whether the person has ""failed to comply
with this Act or the regulations"", because the person ""has a driving
record that in the opinion of the superintendent is unsatisfactory"", where
the person's license has been suspended in another Canadian or American
jurisdiction, or for any other cause ""that relates to the use or operation
of motor vehicles"".  Section 88(3) then lists the formal requirements
for such notice.  Finally, s. 88(1) states that it is an offence for a
person to drive ""knowing that he is prohibited"" by the Superintendent,
and specifies a mandatory prison term of not less than seven days and not more
than six months on a first conviction.

 

66               If a person then drives while
prohibited by the Superintendent under a discretionary order, it is open to the
accused to argue that he did not receive notice of the prohibition, since that
may be a reasonable mistake of fact.  This point was made lucidly by
Ritchie J. in dissent in R. v. Prue; R. v. Baril, [1979]
2 S.C.R. 547, at pp. 557-58:

 

                   It
will be readily apparent that a wide difference exists between the case of a
man who acts in ignorance of the provision for automatic suspension and is
therefore acting under a mistake of law, and a man who resides in a province
where the imposition of such a suspension can only be effected as the result of
the intervention of some administrative act by the authorities.  The latter
situation is evidenced in jurisdictions where provision is made for the clerk
of the court, the presiding magistrate or some other official giving notice to
the accused of the suspension of his licence before that suspension can be
effective.  In the latter type of case when the requisite administrative step
or steps have not been taken and the accused can show that he was therefore
ignorant of the fact of his suspension, his ignorance is one of fact and not of
law, and in this event it has been consistently held that he has a valid
defence to the charge.

 

67               As I will explain more fully
below, the respondent in this case cannot seek solace in the failure of the
Superintendent or the court convicting him of the underlying offence to provide
notice of the applicable statutory prohibition, since that prohibition was
effected automatically and without notice, by operation of law.  The ignorance
which the respondent pleads that the legislature should have cured with some
form of notice is his ignorance of the law prohibiting his conduct.  In this he
cannot succeed because ignorance of the law is never an excuse for breaking the
law.

 

68               It is my view, then, that the
British Columbia legislature has not used language of sufficient precision to
make it clear that the offence created by the combined effect of ss. 92
and 94 is to be of absolute liability.  In this respect, the language in the
impugned provisions falls far short of the express language employed in the now
repealed s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, which read:

 

                   94.  ...

 

                   (2) 
Subsection (1) creates an absolute liability offence in which guilt is
established by proof of driving, whether or not the defendant knew of the
prohibition or suspension.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Speaking for a majority of the Court
on the constitutionality of this provision in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act,
supra, Lamer J. (as he then was) stated at pp. 518-19:

 

                   No
doubt s. 94(2) enacts in the clearest of terms an absolute liability
offence, the conviction for which a person will be deprived of his or her
liberty, and little more, if anything, need be added.

 

69               Notwithstanding this ruling, my
colleague Cory J. suggests that s. 94(2) ""did no more than
emphasize and reiterate that this was an absolute liability offence""
(para. 30).  In other words, s. 94(1) created an absolute liability
offence regardless of s. 94(2).  This conclusion effectively equates
""automatically and without notice"" in s. 94(1) with
""absolute liability"" in s. 94(2).  I have some difficulty with
this conclusion.  If the legislature of British Columbia was simply emphasizing
and reiterating in s. 94(2) the legal effect of s. 94(1), it is
curious indeed that in obeying this Court's decision in Re B.C. Motor
Vehicle Act on the unconstitutionality of combining absolute liability with
the possibility of imprisonment, that same legislature would choose to repeal
only s. 94(2) and not also s. 94(1) (Motor Vehicle Amendments Act,
1986, S.B.C. 1986, c. 19, s. 5, assented to June 17, 1986).  With
respect, Cory J.'s interpretation impliedly imputes to that sovereign body
ignorance, indifference, or worse, possibly even contempt for this Court's
ruling.

 

70               Of course, whether, as I believe,
the legislature intended s. 94(1) to be a strict liability offence is not
dispositive of this case.  Whatever the legislative intention, the legal effect
may nevertheless have been to create an offence of absolute liability.  In the
absence of clear words, such a possibility is entirely dependant upon whether
an accused can escape liability by proving that he is not at fault, that is,
whether he can still avail himself of the defences of due diligence or
reasonable mistake of fact.  I next consider whether the impugned provisions have
eliminated these defences.

 

C.Strict Liability Defences and the Principle
that Ignorance of the Law Does Not Excuse

 

71               This Court in Sault Ste. Marie
stated that an offence could only be classified as being of strict liability if
the defences of due diligence and  reasonable mistake of fact are available to
an accused.  Dickson J. described (at p. 1326) these defences in
defining strict liability offences as

 

[o]ffences
in which there is no necessity for the prosecution to prove the existence of mens
rea; the doing of the prohibited act prima facie imports the
offence, leaving it open to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he
took all reasonable care.  This involves consideration of what a reasonable man
would have done in the circumstances.  The defence will be available if the
accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would
render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to
avoid the particular event.  These offences may properly be called offences of
strict liability.

 

Dickson J. also observed that the
due diligence defence is often spoken of ""as being that of reasonable
mistake of fact"".  He continued, at pp. 1314-15:

 

The
reason is that the offences in question have generally turned on the possession
by a person or place of an unlawful status, and the accused's defence was that
he reasonably did not know of this status: e.g. permitting an unlicensed person
to drive, or lacking a valid licence oneself, or being the owner of property in
a dangerous condition.  In such cases, negligence consists of an
unreasonable failure to know the facts which constitute the offence.  It is
clear, however, that in principle the defence is that all reasonable care was
taken.  In other circumstances, the issue will be whether the accused's
behaviour was negligent in bringing about the forbidden event when he knew the
relevant facts.  Once the defence of reasonable mistake of fact is accepted,
there is no barrier to acceptance of the other constituent part of a defence of
due diligence.  [Emphasis added.]

 

72               It is thus apparent that while the
defences of reasonable mistake of fact and due diligence may operate differently
in any given case, they are really just two aspects of the requirement that
there be negligence as the constitutionally minimum fault before an accused can
be imprisoned for a regulatory offence.

 

73               The content of the defences of due
diligence and reasonable mistake of fact was further clarified by Lamer J.
in Molis v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 356.  That case concerned a
charge of trafficking in a restricted drug contrary to s. 42(1) of the Food
and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27.  The accused had been
manufacturing a chemical which, when he began his manufacturing operation, was
not listed in Schedule H of the Act as a restricted drug.  The drug was,
however, subsequently added by regulation to the list of prohibited substances,
and the accused then charged with trafficking.  The accused adduced evidence on
voir dire that he had in fact been duly diligent in attempting to
ascertain whether the chemical was on the list of prohibited substances, and
before this Court he argued that Sault Ste. Marie entitled him to avoid
conviction by invoking this defence.  The Court unanimously upheld the
conviction imposed at trial.  In so doing, Lamer J. had this to say, at
p. 364, about the availability of the defence of due diligence:

 

                   It
is clear to me that we are dealing here with an offence that is not to be
considered as one of absolute liability and, hence, a defence of due diligence
is available to an accused.  But I hasten to add that the defence of due
diligence that was referred to in Sault Ste. Marie is that of due
diligence in relation to the fulfilment of a duty imposed by law and not in
relation to the ascertainment of the existence of a prohibition or its
interpretation.  [Emphasis added.]

 

74               As Lamer J. rightly
indicated, the defence of due diligence obviously does not extend to efforts to
ascertain the existence of a statutory prohibition or its interpretation, since
that would amount to a conflict with s. 19  of the Criminal Code ,
which codified the fundamental common law principle that ignorance of the law
is no excuse for breaking the law.  Section 19  reads:

 

                   19.  Ignorance of the law by a person who
commits an offence is not an excuse for committing that offence.

 

75               This Court has nevertheless
recognized that ignorance of a law may excuse, but only if the knowledge that
one's actions are contrary to law is itself part of the mens rea of the
offence.  In R. v. Docherty, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 941, we considered the
mens rea for the offence of wilfully failing or refusing to comply with
a probation order contrary to s. 666(1)  of the Criminal Code .  The
probation order required the accused to ""keep the peace and [to] be of
good behaviour"".  The question before us was whether the commission of a
criminal offence was sufficient to be in breach of this order regardless of the
mental element required to sustain a conviction for the underlying offence. 
This Court unanimously found that the mens rea under s. 666(1) 
requires that the accused knew that his actions in breaching the order were
contrary to law.  Otherwise, ignorance that the underlying offence was unlawful
may provide a good defence to a charge under s. 666(1)  notwithstanding
s. 19 .  Wilson J.'s careful reasoning in arriving at this conclusion
is worth citing at length (at pp. 960-61):

 

                   Mewett
and Manning in their text, Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1985) discuss at
p. 320 what is meant by the maxim ignorance of the law is no excuse:

 

                   It
is often said that ignorance of the law is no excuse and as a general maxim --
now incorporated in s. 19 of the Code -- it is a harmless cliché.  It is
more accurate, however, to say that knowledge that one's act is contrary to the
law is not one of the elements of the requisite mens rea and hence a
mistake as to what the law is does not operate as a defence.  That is to say,
this belief that an act is lawful, however much it might affect sentence, does
not affect liability.

 

                   While
I agree with the authors' general proposition I believe that where the
commission of a criminal offence is relied on as the actus reus of the
offence under s. 666(1)  ..., knowledge that one's act is contrary to law
... is an element of the requisite mens rea of wilfully failing
to comply with a probation order.  I believe, in other words, that
s. 666(1)  constitutes an exception to the general rule expressed in
s. 19  in a case where the commission of a criminal offence is relied on as
the actus reus under the section.  An accused cannot have wilfully
breached his probation order through the commission of a criminal offence
unless he knew that what he did constituted a criminal offence.  However, the
conviction is evidence of the mens rea under s. 666(1)  only to the
extent that wilfulness can be inferred from the actus reus as indicated
above.  Such mens rea must be proved and s. 19  of the Criminal
Code  does not preclude the respondent from relying on his honest belief
that he was not doing anything wrong to negate its presence.  Where knowledge
is itself a component of the requisite mens rea, the absence of
knowledge provides a good defence.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

76               This exception to the ignorance of
the law rule has also been recognized in the United States, where it has been
stated as the principle that ""ignorance or mistake of fact or law is a
defense when it negatives the existence of a mental state essential to the
crime charged"" (W. R. LaFave and A. W. Scott, Jr., Substantive
Criminal Law (1986), vol. 1, at p. 575).  Another way of
formulating this exception is simply to say that ignorance of the law is an
excuse if Parliament or a legislature has provided that it is an excuse (LaFave
and Scott, supra, at p. 585, footnote 55).

 

77               The fundamental principle that
ignorance of the law is not an excuse for breaking the law was recently
reaffirmed by Lamer C.J. in R. v. Forster, [1992] 1 S.C.R.
339.  The essential facts for present purposes are as follows.  A member of the
Canadian Armed Forces tendered her resignation in writing to her Commander the
day before she was obliged to begin a new posting.  She did not report to that
posting.  She was charged with being absent without leave contrary to
s. 90  of the National Defence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. N-5 , since
s. 23 of the Act provided that a person's enrolment in the Armed Forces
""binds the person to serve in the Canadian Forces until the person is, in
accordance with regulations, lawfully released"".  Notwithstanding her
resignation, the accused had not been lawfully released under s. 23 . 
While the accused did not argue that her purported resignation was lawfully
effective, she did claim that she honestly believed that she had resigned from
the Forces and thus that she did not possess the requisite mens rea for
the offence under s. 90 of being absent without leave.  Speaking for the
unanimous Court on this point, Lamer C.J. observed (at p. 346):

 

Even
if we take the appellant's assertions about her beliefs at face value, she did
not labour under any mistake about what she in fact did:  she deliberately
refrained from reporting to her new posting in Ottawa.  Instead, she was
mistaken about the legal consequences of her actions, because of her failure to
understand that she was under a continuing legal obligation to report for duty
notwithstanding her purported resignation by letter from the Forces.  Thus,
while she may not have intended to commit any offence under military law, this
lack of intention flowed from her mistake as to the continuing legal obligation
to report for duty which that regime imposed upon her until properly
released....

 

                   It
is a principle of our criminal law that an honest but mistaken belief in
respect of the legal consequences of one's deliberate actions does not furnish
a defence to a criminal charge, even when the mistake cannot be attributed to
the negligence of the accused:  Molis v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R.
356.  This Court recently reaffirmed in R. v. Docherty, [1989]
2 S.C.R. 941, at p. 960, the principle that knowledge that one's
actions are contrary to the law is not a component of the mens rea for
an offence, and consequently does not operate as a defence.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

78               It is thus evident that the
principle that ignorance of the law is not an excuse for breaking the law
remains firmly rooted in Canadian law.

 

79               The above discussion can be
summarized as follows.  An offence of strict liability requires the minimal
mental element of negligence in order to ground a conviction.  Negligence
consists in an unreasonable failure to know the facts which constitute the
offence, or the failure to be duly diligent to take steps which a reasonable
person would take.  Since ignorance of the law is not an excuse for breaking
the law, due diligence consists in taking steps to fulfil a duty imposed by law
and not in the ascertainment of the existence of a statutory prohibition or its
interpretation.  Exceptionally, where knowledge that conduct is prohibited is
itself part of the mens rea, the absence of knowledge provides a good
defence.

 

80               Given this understanding of the
relationship between the defence of due diligence and the principle that
ignorance of the law is not an excuse for breaking the law, I now consider
whether the impugned provisions provide for the constitutionally minimum fault
of negligence required for a strict liability offence.

 

D.  Application to the
British Columbia Motor Vehicle Act

 

81               In my view, the impugned
provisions do allow for the defences of reasonable mistake of fact and due
diligence, and accordingly, the prima facie characterization of this
public welfare legislation as being of strict liability is confirmed.

 

82               Section 92 creates the 12-month
driving prohibition which is effective automatically and without notice upon
conviction of one of the underlying offences.  The factual element comprising
the actus reus consists in the driving of a motor vehicle having
previously been convicted of one of the underlying offences.  Since there is no
mens rea specified, it must be inferred from the actus reus.  And
because this is a regulatory offence, under Sault Ste. Marie, the mens
rea consists in negligence in relation to any of the elements of the actus
reus, but not in relation to the existence of this statutory prohibition or
its interpretation, since that would be ignorance or mistake of law. 
Consequently, a person charged with driving while under a statutory prohibition
can avoid conviction if he demonstrates, on the preponderance of the evidence,
that he made a reasonable mistake of fact as to the existence of his
conviction, or that he exercised due diligence to ascertain whether he had been
convicted of one of the underlying offences.

 

83               This is not, I grant, the most
extensive range of available defences, but it nevertheless amply satisfies what
is constitutionally required.  Defences are available in relation to all
the factual elements of the actus reus, and this adequately meets the
minimal constitutional requirement of fault for a public welfare or regulatory
offence such as driving while under a statutory prohibition.  Accordingly,
ss. 92 and 94(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act are entirely consistent
with s. 7 of our Charter .

 

84               It is interesting to observe that
Southin J.A. in R. v. Heywood (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 502
(B.C.C.A.), anticipated the characterization of the impugned offence as being
of strict liability.  She said, at pp. 522-23:

 

                   If
Parliament were to enact that a person convicted of impaired driving should not
thereafter drive a motor car or that a person convicted of robbing a bank
should not thereafter enter a bank, in both cases on pain of imprisonment,
would Parliament be enacting a crime of absolute liability?

 

                                                                    ...

 

[T]he
actus is driving, having been earlier convicted of the named offence. 
The necessary intent would consist of the knowledge of the conviction and the
conscious driving of the motor vehicle.  In my opinion, Parliament, if it were
to enact the crimes I have mentioned, would not be creating crimes of absolute
liability....  There was a time in Canada when the possession of opium was
lawful.  When Parliament first made the possession of opium unlawful, it did
not create a crime of absolute liability.

 

85               It is evident, then, that I
disagree with Cory J.'s conclusion that a defence of due diligence is not
available in relation to the impugned offence.  Cory J. comes to this
conclusion because he finds that the only defence effectively available to an
accused who has been charged with driving while under a statutory prohibition
is his ignorance of the fact that his license has been suspended by the
provisions of a provincial statute; but since this is mistake or ignorance of
the law, it is not an available excuse.  Furthermore, Cory J. suggests two
examples to illustrate his claim that a due diligence defence is unavailable. 
In both examples, he suggests that an accused who is prohibited under a court
order from driving for any period less than 12 months for having committed one
of the underlying offences may be misled into believing that he is entitled to
drive after the expiry of that prohibition, since he has had no notice of the
continuing automatic prohibition effective by virtue of ss. 92 and 94(1). 
He suggests that such a person would be liable to conviction ""despite his
honest and reasonable belief as a lay person that the total sentence imposed by
the court was a fine and a suspension of his licence for a period of"" less
than 12 months (at para. 43).

 

86               I agree that Cory J.'s
examples are within the realm of possibility, and also that there may be a
sense in which they can be considered as giving rise to some unfairness.  But
if this is so, it is an unfairness which our legal system has long countenanced
in refusing to allow ignorance of the law to serve as a valid excuse.  As a
matter of principle, it is no more unfair to convict the accused in this case
than it was in Molis, supra, for the trafficking of a substance
he honestly and reasonably believed was not prohibited, or to disallow the
accused in Forster, supra, from relying on her letter of
resignation to demonstrate that she lacked the intent for being absent without
leave.

 

87               Of course, this is not to say that
ignorance of the law cannot be successfully pleaded as a factor in mitigation
of sentence (C. Ruby, Sentencing (4th ed. 1994), at
p. 196).  In such a case, it may well be appropriate to sentence an
offender to the minimum fine of $300 and to seven days' imprisonment under
s. 92(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act.

 

88               Finally, I note that the appellant
raised the possibility that a driver whose license is suspended and who is
prohibited from driving by operation of law may also be able to avail himself
of the defence of ""officially induced error"".  This defence was not
raised here and has yet to be formally recognized by this Court, though it was
referred to in obiter by Ritchie J. in R. v. MacDougall,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 605, at p. 613, by Lamer C.J. in Forster,
supra, at p. 346, and by myself in dissent in R. v. Tremblay,
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 932, at p. 947.  (See also D. Stuart, Canadian
Criminal Law: A Treatise (3rd ed. 1995), at pp. 312-21, and Mewett
& Manning on Criminal Law (3rd ed. 1994), at pp. 382-84; and
for a summary of the American position, see LaFave and Scott, supra, at
pp. 591-95.)  Assuming without deciding that such a defence would be
available if an accused were misled by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles or
by some other official responsible for the administration of the Motor
Vehicle Act, such a defence would not demonstrate absence of negligence in
relation to the actus reus of driving while under a statutory
prohibition, but rather would be an additional defence thereto, operating as an
exception to the rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse.  As a result,
the potential availability of such a defence does not assist in the
characterization of the impugned provisions as being of strict liability.

 

E.  Consistency with
Earlier Rulings of this Court

 

89               Before addressing Cory J.'s
discussion on how the alleged constitutional defects in the impugned provisions
can be cured, it is important to offer a few words on the relationship between
my finding that the impugned offence is of strict liability and this Court's
rulings in the pre-Charter  cases of Prue, supra, and MacDougall,
supra.

 

90               First, in Prue, the accused
were charged under the Criminal Code  with driving while their licenses
were suspended under provincial law.  The provincial suspensions had been
automatic under the Motor Vehicle Act of British Columbia, and the trial
judge made findings of fact that neither accused knew that his license to drive
had been suspended.  The issue before the Court concerned whether the Criminal
Code  offence of driving while prohibited ""by reason of the legal
suspension or cancellation"" of the accused's licenses to drive required
proof of mens rea.  The Crown had argued that the accused could not
plead their ignorance of the automatic provincial suspension, since that would
be ignorance of the law, an argument which was unavailable in light of
s. 19  of the Criminal Code .

 

91               Speaking with the concurrence of
three other justices, Laskin C.J. noted that the effect of this argument
would make the offence ""an offence of absolute liability where the
provincial suspension of a driving licence is automatic under the provincial
enactment (proof of such suspension being made), but not if the provincial
suspension does not take effect without a requirement of notice""
(p. 552).  He stated that this would have the undesirable consequence of
giving a Criminal Code  offence a variable effect across the country
contingent on the character of the relevant provincial legislation.  He also
observed that the very fact of inclusion in the Criminal Code  ought to
import a requirement of mens rea for the offence of driving while
prohibited.  Consequently, he found that for the purposes of the Criminal
Code  ignorance of a suspension under provincial legislation was a mistake
of fact, a position he thought to be unaffected by (at p. 553):

 

...
whether the provincial legislation operates to make a suspension automatic or
whether it arises only upon some notice or other action to be taken
thereunder.  For the purpose of the Criminal Code , whether there has
been an effective suspension is simply a question of fact.

 

92               Ritchie J., dissenting with
the concurrence of one other justice, did not accept this distinction between
federal and provincial mistakes of law.  He found that the Criminal Code 
offence of driving while prohibited was a strict liability offence with an
available defence of due diligence.  However, such a defence would not operate
in relation to the fact of suspension since this took effect automatically by
operation of provincial law rather than under the discretionary authority of
the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles.  Ritchie J. would have upheld the
conviction because he found, at p. 559, that there was:

 

...
no evidence that either of the respondents made any effort to determine whether
their licences had been suspended or not and this is not a case involving
ignorance of some regulation or technicality which might have been understandably
unknown to the driving public and thus to the respondents.

 

93               Beetz J. also dissented.  He
stated that he did not believe it necessary to express an opinion on whether
the offence was a mens rea offence or one of strict liability, but
assuming it was a mens rea offence, the culpable intent could be
""inferred from the nature of the act committed and cannot be negated by
the accused's ignorance of the law"" (p. 560).  Interestingly, he then
added, at p. 560, the following important comments:

 

                   Respondents
had knowledge of the fact that caused the suspension of their licences, namely
their convictions for offences as a result of which such suspension took place
automatically, ipso facto.  I agree with my brother Ritchie that their
ignorance of this result was an ignorance of the law which is no excuse and
cannot be considered as a defence.

 

94               It is important to note that since
the Criminal Code  offence did not expressly require that the accused
drive with knowledge of the prohibition enacted under provincial law, that
offence cannot come within the narrow exception to s. 19  recently
recognized by this Court in Docherty, supra.

 

95               In the case of MacDougall, supra,
the Court again considered the characterization of the offence of driving while
under a statutory prohibition, this time under s. 258(2) of the Nova
Scotia Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.N.S. 1967, c. 191, which read:

 

                   258.  ...

 

                   (2) 
A person shall not drive a motor vehicle while his license or privilege of
obtaining a license is cancelled or suspended under this Act.

 

The accused's driving privileges had
been suspended by the provincial Registrar of Motor Vehicles after he had been
convicted of a driving related criminal offence.  The accused received notice
of his license suspension.  However, he appealed his conviction and a notice of
re-instatement of his driving privileges was sent to him.  His appeal was
dismissed, and soon thereafter his lawyer advised him of this, a fact which
Ritchie J. stated was ""of particular importance in this case""
(p. 609).  The accused continued to drive, and was duly charged with
driving while prohibited under provincial law.  He only received notice by mail
of the revocation of his license as a result of losing his appeal on the
evening of the day for which he was charged.

 

96               Unfortunately for the accused,
s. 250(3) of the Act stipulated that a driver's license is automatically
""revoked and shall remain revoked"" if the appeal was
""dismissed"".  Speaking for the unanimous Court, Ritchie J.
stated, at p. 614, that ""[i]t would be difficult to conceive of more
clear or imperative language"" than this.  He observed that ""[t]he
failure to appreciate the legal duty imposed by that law is of no solace to the
appellant"".

 

97               It is important to recognize that
in determining the appropriate mens rea under s. 258(2),
Ritchie J. classified the statute as public welfare legislation within the
Sault Ste. Marie scheme of offences.  He accordingly noted that a
defence was ""available to the accused if he `reasonably believed in a
mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render' his act in continuing to
drive his motor vehicle without a licence, an innocent one""
(p. 608).  It was in this context that Ritchie J. spoke of the
""particular importance"" of the fact that the accused knew that his
appeal had been dismissed.  Curiously, in concluding his reasons Ritchie J.
also stated, at p. 615:

 

                   I
am of the opinion that nothing in the foregoing reasons runs counter to the
decision of the Court in Prue and Baril.

 

98               My colleague Cory J. finds
two difficulties with this Court's decision in MacDougall, supra. 
First, Cory J. points to its inconsistency with Prue; and second,
since it was decided prior to the Charter , it did not consider the
constitutionally required minimum fault component outlined by this Court in
cases such as Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act and Vaillancourt, supra.

 

99               On the first point, I agree that MacDougall
is difficult to reconcile with the majority decision in Prue.  But in my
view, the dissent in Prue is better reasoned than the majority decision
and more consonant with this Court's subsequent jurisprudence on mistake of
law.  It cannot be that ignorance of a provincial law is a mistake of fact for
the purposes of applying federal law, but a mistake of law under provincial
law.  Furthermore, to the extent that there is inconsistency between these
decisions, surely the later decision of MacDougall ought to govern.  It
was the judgment of the unanimous Court, including Laskin C.J., unlike Prue
where the Court was divided.

 

100             On the second point, in my view MacDougall
is completely consistent with this Court's jurisprudence on the constitutional
requirement of fault.  Ritchie J. considered Sault Ste. Marie, and
was at pains to stress that the accused in MacDougall was entitled to
the defence of due diligence for the strict liability offence of driving while
prohibited by statute.  He impliedly found, however, that since the accused
knew that his appeal had been dismissed, he could not avail himself of the
defence.  Knowledge of the statutory prohibition was not itself part of the mens
rea, since ignorance of the law is not an excuse.  Consequently,
Ritchie J. did indeed entertain the defence of due diligence for this
regulatory offence, and this would have been sufficient to satisfy the
constitutional requirement of fault mandated by s. 7  of the Charter .

 

101             As a result, my ruling in the case
at bar is entirely consistent with MacDougall, which in turn is faithful
to the constitutional requirement of fault.

 

F.  Is the Defence of
Ignorance of the Law a Constitutional Requirement?

 

 

102             Finally, my colleague Cory J.
suggests that the alleged deficiency in the impugned provisions can be cured in
two different ways.  He first suggests that ""[t]he legislature could
readily convert this offence to one of strict liability by permitting the
defence of due diligence to be raised"" (para. 45).  Second, he
observes: ""If there was any concern that those accused of the offence
would defend on the basis that they had no knowledge of its effect, a provision
requiring that notice be given of its consequences could be added""
(para. 45).  I take it that in this last passage Cory J. is referring to
the legal effect and the legal consequences of being convicted of
one of the underlying offences to which the 12-month prohibition attaches. 
With respect, I have a number of difficulties with these suggestions.

 

103             First, and most obviously, as I have
already indicated the offence is one of strict liability with allowance made
for the defences of due diligence and reasonable mistake of fact.  It is open
to an accused to avoid conviction by demonstrating that he reasonably believed
that he had not been convicted of one of the underlying offences to which the
12-month statutory prohibition attaches, or that he exercised due diligence in
seeking to acquire knowledge of the underlying conviction.  The impugned
provisions are therefore constitutional without any further requirements.  

 

104             That being the case, any further
content of the due diligence defence that might be constitutionally compelled
but is absent in this legislation remains unclear.  But one is entitled to ask:
what should the British Columbia legislature have provided in the impugned
legislation in order to have avoided violating the Charter ?  Inasmuch as
I have explained that defences are available with respect to all the factual
elements of the actus reus, by a process of elimination one is lead to
conclude that any further requirement would encompass a defence in relation to
the existence of the relevant statutory prohibition or its interpretation.  In
other words, there would be a constitutional requirement for the defence of due
diligence to cover an accused's ignorance or mistake of the law.  If that were
the case, the conclusion must be that the ignorance of the law rule no longer
applies in light of s. 7  of the Charter .

  

105             It goes without saying that such a
suggestion completely undercuts the principle that ignorance of the law is not
an excuse for breaking the law.  If a defence of due diligence in relation to a
statutory prohibition or its interpretation is now a principle of fundamental
justice, and therefore also a constitutional obligation which Parliament or a
legislature must discharge when it attaches a sanction of imprisonment,
I fear that as currently worded many of our criminal and regulatory statutes
will be all but impossible to enforce.  In short, if a defence of due diligence
now comprehends a defence of ignorance of the law, I can see no reason in
principle why such a constitutional requirement would be limited to the
circumstances of this case.  

 

106             The second difficulty which I have
with Cory J.'s suggestions as to how the alleged constitutional defect in this
legislation can be remedied is therefore as follows.  I do not believe that the
""principles of fundamental justice"" under s. 7  of the Charter 
require that an accused who is charged with a regulatory offence be entitled to
claim due diligence in relation to the existence of the relevant statutory
prohibition or its interpretation  -- that is, to avail himself of the defence
of ignorance of the law.  The defence of due diligence does not need to be
expanded to meet the exigencies of the Charter .  Indeed, to do so would
eviscerate the ignorance of the law rule and render many of our laws
unenforceable.  To date, our Court has refused to find that ignorance of the
law is an excuse for breaking the law.  Nor have we ever held that ignorance of
the law should be viewed differently in the regulatory and criminal contexts. 
I respectfully suggest we refrain from doing so henceforth.

 

107             I would add that if the defence of
due diligence has been expanded in light of s. 7  of the Charter  to
comprehend a defence of ignorance of the law, then it also appears that this
Court's ruling in Molis, supra, has been overturned.  As already
indicated, in Molis, Lamer J. stated unambiguously that the defence of
due diligence refers to ""due diligence in relation to the fulfilment of a
duty imposed by law and not in relation to the ascertainment of the existence
of a prohibition or its interpretation"" (p. 364).  To my mind, Molis
should remain good law and is indistinguishable from the case at bar.  It is no
more necessary, as a principle of ""fundamental justice"", to allow the
respondent to avail himself of his ignorance of a prohibition from driving by
virtue of provincial legislation of general application, than it was to allow
the accused drug traffickers in Molis to avail themselves of their
ignorance that 3‑4 methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine had been added as a
prohibited substance to Schedule H of the Food and Drugs Act .

 

108             My third difficulty with
Cory J.'s reasoning is that it appears to ignore the context of the
present case.  The impugned prohibition is a regulatory offence incident to a
licensed activity.  In such a context, unique considerations inform what is
fair and when an accused can be considered as being at fault.  Such
considerations are commonly referred to as the ""licensing argument""
for the distinctive legal character of regulatory offences and for justifying
their different treatment from ""true crimes"".  The licensing argument
postulates that since a regulated actor voluntarily chooses to enter the
regulated field, that actor can be taken to have known of and accepted certain
terms and conditions of entry.  Indeed, in R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, at pp. 229-31, Cory J. offered a very helpful
discussion of the licensing argument.  He observed (at pp. 228-29):

 

                   The
licensing argument is directed to [the] question of choice.  Thus, while in the
criminal context, the essential question to be determined is whether the
accused has made the choice to act in the manner alleged in the indictment, the
regulated defendant is, by virtue of the licensing argument, assumed to have
made the choice to engage in the regulated activity.  The question then becomes
not whether the defendant chose to enter the regulated sphere but whether,
having done so, the defendant has fulfilled the responsibilities attending that
decision.  Professor Richardson puts the position this way in ""Strict
Liability for Regulatory Crime:  the Empirical Research,"" [1987] Crim. L.R.
295, at pp. 295-96:

 

...it
can be argued that the strict liability regulatory offender is not a
""blameless innocent"".  By indulging in the regulated activity she has
voluntarily adopted the risks of regulatory infraction and her supposed
""innocence"" flows from the law's traditional tendency to view the
criminal act ""only in the context of its immediate past"".

 

                   The
licensing concept rests on the view that those who choose to participate in
regulated activities have, in doing so, placed themselves in a responsible
relationship to the public generally and must accept the consequences of that
responsibility.  Therefore, it is said, those who engage in regulated
activity should, as part of the burden of responsible conduct attending
participation in the regulated field, be deemed to have accepted certain terms
and conditions applicable to those who act within the regulated sphere. 
Foremost among these implied terms is an undertaking that the conduct of the
regulated actor will comply with and maintain a certain minimum standard of care. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

109             In further explaining the reasons
for the differential treatment of crimes and regulatory offences, Cory J.
went on in Wholesale Travel to cite approvingly the following comments
of K. R. Webb in ""Regulatory Offences, the Mental Element and the Charter : 
Rough Road Ahead"" (1989), 21 Ottawa L. Rev. 419, at
p. 452:

 

Criminal
Code  offences are
typically but not always outright prohibitions of certain conduct, not part of
a larger administrative regime which permits specified behaviour to take place
under controlled circumstances.  This is in direct contrast to regulatory
offences, which are typically an adjunct to legal schemes permitting activities
within pre-established limits and subject to certain conditions.  Before a
regulator will authorize a regulatee to engage in controlled activities, the
regulatee must agree to abide by a set of rules, and must be found fit to carry
out the regulated activity.  A driver's licence is a good example of such an
arrangement.  In effect, this arrangement establishes and certifies that the
regulatee knows the standards which he or she must meet, is capable of meeting
them, and accepts that should his or her conduct fall below these standards, he
or she may be subject to administrative actions and penalties prescribed in
legislation, according to procedures which take into account the special
knowledge of a regulatee.  The fact that an accused is participating in a
regulated activity and has met the initial ""entrance requirements""
leads to a legally imposed or assumed awareness on his or her part of the risks
associated with that activity.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

Webb later adds, at p. 476:

 

The
fact that a strict liability offence is a component in a larger regulatory
system justifies the assumption that as a pre-condition to engaging in
regulated activity, regulatees have been made aware of the standards which they
must meet, and accept that should their conduct fall below these standards,
they may be subject to penalties pursuant to procedures which reflect their
special position as regulatees.

 

110             Thus, as a necessary incident of
being permitted by the state to engage in a regulated activity, the regulated
actor voluntarily accepts the risks of regulatory infraction.  In other words,
such an actor is deemed to have accepted the terms and conditions attaching to
the privilege of participating in the regulated activity.  As a result, a
regulatory actor cannot be described as morally innocent when he commits a
regulatory offence.  I think it is telling that Webb refers to the license to
drive as a ""good example"" to illustrate the principles applicable to
regulatory offences; I would go further, and say that it is the paradigmatic
example of regulated activity.  

 

111             It is trite to observe that a
licensed driver is aware that the activity of driving is regulated, and also
understands or ought to understand that there are regulations concerned with
license revocation for driving offences.  Indeed, this Court has expressly
stated that ""[m]erit point and driving license revocation schemes are
prime examples"" of laws that have generally been brought to the attention
of the public; they have been ""`digested' by society"":  Nova
Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, supra, at p. 635.  

 

112             As a result, when a licensed driver
violates one of the conditions attaching to his license he should not be
considered as being without fault simply because he was unaware of that
condition.  There is no fundamental right to drive a motor vehicle, any more
than there is a fundamental right to own a gun or any other instrument of
potential destruction.  It is a privilege, a privilege which, sadly, is often
abused with tragic repercussions.  A legislature can provide for consequences
which are to attach when this privilege is abused and stipulate standards of
behaviour for continued licensing.  There is therefore no injustice, far less
any fundamental injustice, if a court convicts an accused of a regulatory
offence when the only defence offered is that he was unaware of a statutory
condition attaching to the activity __ that is, his ignorance of the
law.  This is, of course, all the more true when the condition is of a
character which has been brought to the attention of the public and
""digested"" by society.

 

113             The licensing justification also
underscores that Parliament or a legislature is faced with a policy choice in
deciding whether to give notice to the regulated actor of a particular regulatory
prohibition, or whether to allow such an actor to be considered ""morally
innocent"" if he can demonstrate his ignorance of the relevant law.  Our
governing bodies may, in their wisdom, decide to provide such notice or such a
defence; but they also may decide not to.  But whatever they decide, a
particular policy choice is not constitutionally compelled.  To conclude
otherwise would be to convert what is fundamentally a policy decision into a
constitutionally mandated requirement. 

 

114             To summarize, then, my concerns with
respect to the first solution offered by Cory J.:  first, the impugned
provisions are constitutional without any further requirements; second,
expanding the defence of due diligence to comprehend ignorance or mistake of
law undercuts the mistake of law rule and will render many of our laws
unenforceable; as a corollary, this Court's decision in Molis appears to
be impliedly overturned without any explanation; third, the proffered solution
ignores the regulatory context of the present case, which context justifies the
imputation that the respondent accepted the terms and conditions incident to
the privilege accorded to him in his license to drive; and finally, such a
solution usurps what is fundamentally a policy decision -- whether to provide a
defence of ignorance of the law -- and converts it into a constitutionally
mandated requirement.

 

115             The second suggestion which
Cory J. makes is the provision of some form of notice of the law.  He
offers a number of examples to demonstrate how notice of the legal effect or
legal consequences of being convicted of one of the underlying offences could
readily be provided.  Plainly, such notice would convert the offence into one
of full mens rea, since the accused would then be driving with actual
subjective knowledge that he was prohibited under provincial legislation.  No
doubt the province could have chosen this solution as a matter of policy.  I
readily acknowledge that in cases such as the one at bar notice is generally
desirable.  Indeed, several provinces already provide for notice where a
license is revoked (see, for example, the Ontario Highway Traffic Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, ss. 52 and 53, and the Quebec Highway Safety
Code, R.S.Q., c. C‑24.2, ss. 105, 106.1 and 550.1). 
However, the fact remains that the British Columbia legislature has not chosen
this solution.  Rather than an offence of full mens rea, the province
instead chose a solution appropriately tailored to the regulatory context: an
offence of strict liability.  That solution adequately meets the exigencies of
our Charter , and is therefore a valid policy choice of full force and
effect without any further requirement of notice.

 

G.  Conclusion

 

116             I therefore conclude that the
impugned provisions create an offence of strict liability where the fact of
driving while prohibited by statute prima facie imports the offence, but
where it is nevertheless possible for an accused to avoid conviction by
demonstrating that he reasonably believed that he had not been convicted of one
of the underlying offences to which the 12-month statutory prohibition
attaches, or that he exercised due diligence in seeking to acquire knowledge of
the underlying conviction.

 

III - Disposition

 

117             As a result, I would answer in the
negative the following constitutional question posed by Lamer C.J.:

 

Does
s. 94 of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, when
read in conjunction with s. 92 of that Act create an absolute liability
offence which violates s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

118             I would allow the appeal and order a
new trial, at which point the respondent can adduce evidence as to his exercise
of due diligence or his reasonable mistake of fact with respect to any of the
elements of the offence of driving while prohibited under this provincial
statute.

                   The appellant was
convicted of trafficking in cocaine.  An undercover officer arrived at the
scene of the transaction at 2:18 p.m.  The half-minute transaction took place
sometime thereafter and was completed not later than 2:25 p.m.  The undercover
officer identified the individual involved as the appellant, who was then
arrested, at about 3:40 p.m.  The appellant presented alibi evidence at trial
that he was at home with his mother at the time of the alleged transaction. 
The trial judge considered this evidence to be significantly weakened because
of want of formal disclosure of the alibi and noted that this finding may have
had a significant effect on the outcome of the trial.  A conversation which
took place between the accused's mother and the police when she was arranging
bail was considered to be inadequate disclosure of the alibi.  The mother
claimed during this conversation, which focused on determining the time of the
arrest, that the accused was with her at 2:30, 3:00 and 3:15 p.m.  An
appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.  The issues here were whether or
not the disclosure of the alibi evidence was properly characterized as untimely
or insufficient, and if so, whether or not the conviction could nevertheless be
upheld pursuant to the provisions of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code .

 

                   Held (Sopinka and Major JJ.
dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Gonthier and
Iacobucci JJ.:  Proper disclosure of an alibi has two components: 
adequacy and timeliness.  The consequence of a failure to disclose an alibi
properly is that the trier of fact may draw an adverse inference when weighing
the alibi evidence heard at trial.  Improper disclosure can only weaken alibi
evidence; it cannot exclude it.  The rule, which is one of expediency, is
intended to guard against surprise alibis fabricated during testimony at
trial.  It has been adapted to conform to the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  norms in that disclosure is proper when it allows the prosecution
and police to investigate the alibi evidence before trial.  The criteria of
timeliness and adequacy are thus evaluated on the basis of whether a meaningful
investigation could have been undertaken as a result of disclosure.  Neither
disclosure at the earliest possible moment, nor disclosure by the accused is
necessary.  Third party disclosure is sufficient.

 

                   The timeliness of
the disclosure was not at issue.  The statement to the police by the accused's
mother was unclear and confused and did not disclose sufficient detail and
coherence to enable the police to undertake a meaningful investigation of the
evidence supporting the alibi.  The key factor to be considered was the time of
the commission of the offence in question.  The mother's statements to the
police focused on the accused's whereabouts at the time of his arrest.  The
claim that he was with her at 2:30, at 3:00 and at 3:15 (the times the officer
recited to her), did not strictly relate to the time of the commission of the
offence, which was between 2:18 and 2:24.  This fact undermined further the
suggestion that this conversation was sufficient to put the police on notice as
to the alibi.  The assertion that the accused was not present at the location
of the crime, when it was committed, is missing from the alibi.  The trial
judge was entitled to draw a negative inference based on the evidence before
him.

 

                   Per Sopinka and Major JJ.
(dissenting):  The requirement that disclosure of an alibi defence be made is
one of expediency, not of law.  If the police are not given adequate notice to
allow for an investigation of the alibi, the trial judge may draw a negative
inference given the potential for fabricating alibi evidence.  The disclosure
requirements have been modified by Charter  considerations, especially
with respect to an accused's right to silence.  Disclosure need only be made in
sufficient time for the police to be able to investigate.  It need not be made
at the earliest possible time or in a formal manner.  Disclosure may be made by
a third party who is a witness to the alibi.

 

                   Disclosure of an
alibi defence must include:  a statement that the accused was not present at
location of the crime when it was committed, the whereabouts of the accused at
that time and the names of any witnesses to the alibi.  Although formal
disclosure of an alibi defence, either at a bail hearing, the preliminary
hearing or by a letter from defence counsel to the Crown, is preferable where
practicable, less formal disclosure may suffice, given the accused's right to
silence.  In this case, the charge was not sufficiently serious to warrant a
preliminary hearing and the appellant was not represented by counsel at the
bail hearing.

 

                   An overly strict
approach to disclosure should not be applied.  The mother's conversation with
police constituted sufficient disclosure of the alibi defence.  It was not so
disjointed as to be unintelligible.  The officer clearly understood that she
was asserting that an arrest at 2:30 p.m. would have been impossible.  A
reasonable police officer would have assumed that this alibi was worth
investigating.  The officer, but not the mother, knew at the time of the
conversation the exact time of the drug transaction.  The evidence at trial
indicated that the alibi covered the entire period.  Here, the finding that the
disclosure of the alibi defence was untimely and insufficient and the drawing
of a negative inference such that the alibi defence was ""considerably
weakened"" constituted errors of law.

 

                   The conviction
cannot be upheld under the curative provision of s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code.  The outcome of the trial would not necessarily have been
the same if the negative inference had not been drawn against the alibi
evidence as was explicitly recognized by the trial judge.  The alibi defence
was the only defence relied upon and was clearly relevant to the issue of
identification.

//Iacobucci J.//

 

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and Gonthier and Iacobucci JJ. was delivered by

 

1                        Iacobucci
J. -- I have read the reasons of my colleague Justice Major and, with
respect, I do not arrive at the same conclusion he does.  In my view, the trial
judge did not err in concluding that there was inadequate disclosure of an
alibi.  The trial judge reviewed the applicable principles governing disclosure
of an alibi and applied them correctly to the facts.  His conclusions are
supported by the evidence, and as such this Court should not intervene.

 

2                 Although I agree with the review
of the facts stated by my colleague, I must underline one fact, namely, the
importance of the time of the commission of the offence.  As was noted by the
trial judge, the main issue at trial was the whereabouts of the accused between
2:18 and 2:24 p.m. on July 26, 1990.  The Crown alleged that at that time the
accused was selling $40 worth of crack cocaine to an undercover officer.  The
accused countered that he was at home with his mother watching television.

 

3                 At issue in this appeal is
whether the alibi defence raised by the accused at trial was properly disclosed
to the Crown.  As outlined by my colleague, proper disclosure of an alibi has
two components: adequacy and timeliness.  This principle was recently
reiterated in R. v. Letourneau (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (B.C.C.A.),
where Cumming J.A. wrote for a unanimous court at p. 532:

 

                   It
is settled law that disclosure of a defence of alibi should meet two
requirements:

 

                   (a)it
should be given in sufficient time to permit the authorities to investigate:
see R. v. Mahoney, supra, at p. 387, and R. v. Dunbar and Logan
(1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 13 at pp. 62-3 ... (Ont. C.A.);

 

                   (b)it
should be given with sufficient particularity to enable the authorities to
meaningfully investigate: see R. v. Ford (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at
pp. 504-5 ... (B.C.C.A.).

 

                   Failure
to give notice of alibi does not vitiate the defence, although it may result in
a lessening of the weight that the trier of fact will accord it ....

 

4                 As stated above, the consequence
of a failure to disclose properly an alibi is that the trier of fact may
draw an adverse inference when weighing the alibi evidence heard at trial (Russell
v. The King (1936), 67 C.C.C. 28 (S.C.C.), at p. 32).  However, improper
disclosure can only weaken alibi evidence; it cannot exclude the alibi.  My
colleague correctly notes that the rule governing diclosure of an alibi is a
rule of expediency intended to guard against surprise alibis fabricated in the
witness box which the prosecution is almost powerless to challenge.  Again as
noted by my colleague, the development of the rule since its formulation in Russell
shows that the rule has been adapted to conform to Charter  norms.  As
such, disclosure is proper when it allows the prosecution and police to
investigate the alibi evidence before trial.  The criteria of timeliness and
adequacy are thus evaluated on the basis of whether a meaningful investigation
could have been undertaken as a result of disclosure.  The flexibility of the
standard is demonstrated by the fact that neither disclosure at the earliest
possible moment, nor disclosure by the accused him- or herself is required in
order for the criteria to be met.  Third party disclosure is sufficient.  Thus,
the fact that Mrs. Foster allegedly made disclosure of the alibi instead of the
accused is immaterial.  What matters is whether she properly disclosed the
alibi to police through her statements to them on July 26, 1990.  To the extent
that my colleague suggests that the trial judge discredited Mrs. Foster's
attempts at disclosure because she was only a witness to the alibi, I must
respectfully disagree.  I cannot find any holding in the reasons of the trial
judge that suggests that the accused's mother was, by being a witness to the
alibi, incapable of meeting the criteria for disclosure of an alibi.

 

5                 Turning to the disclosure
itself, I must immediately note that the timeliness of the disclosure is not at
issue.  Statements concerning potential alibis, made shortly after the arrest,
are timely (R. v. Hogan (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 557 (Ont. C.A.)).  The
main difficulty with Mrs. Foster's statement to the police is that it is
unclear and confused.  Was there sufficient detail and coherence in Mrs.
Foster's statement to enable the police to undertake a meaningful investigation
of the evidence supporting the alibi?  With great respect for my colleague, I
am of the view that the trial judge did not err in finding that the statement
was so disjointed that he could not imagine how her statement could be
considered as a disclosure of an alibi, let alone adequate disclosure of an
alibi.  He characterized her words as a protest and an expression of disbelief
at the arrest of her son.  The trial judge heard Mrs. Foster repeat her words
in the witness box; it was open to him to conclude that the statement was too
unintelligible to alert police as to a possible defence of alibi.  I cannot
conclude that the findings of the trial judge in this regard are unreasonable
or unsupported by the record.

 

6                 As I mentioned earlier, the key
factor to consider is the time of the commission of the offence in question. 
Mrs. Foster's statements about her son's whereabouts concern the time of his
arrest.  This is understandable, as she probably assumed that the offence
for which her son was arrested occurred just before his arrest.  She claimed he
was with her at 2:30, at 3:00 and at 3:15 (the times the officer recites to
her), but this does not strictly relate to the time of the commission of the
offence, which was between 2:18 and 2:24.  This fact undermines further the
suggestion that Mrs. Foster's words to police were sufficient to put them on
notice of the fact that the accused was with his mother at the time relevant to
the offence.  In fact, it was open to the police to believe that Mrs. Foster
was telling the truth about her son's whereabouts at 2:30, 3:00 and 3:15,
without this causing them to think that at 2:18 the accused was not the person
selling crack cocaine to an undercover officer.  This is especially so since
there is evidence in the record of a close proximity between the location of
the offence and the residence of the accused.  Thus, on the basis of my
colleague's assessment of the three pieces of information required in order to
disclose an alibi sufficiently, one very important one is missing -- an
assertion that the accused was not present at the location of the crime, when
it was committed.  Given this fact, I cannot agree with my colleague that
the trial judge erred in drawing a negative inference, as a result of the
inadequate disclosure.  Moreover, I do not find that the fact that the trial
judge believed the evidence of Mrs. Foster concerning her conversation at the
police station prevents him from drawing such an inference.  The content of her
conversation is not at issue; it is whether the words she uttered constituted
disclosure.  The trial judge concluded they did not, and thus was entitled to
draw a negative inference.

 

7                 With this review as to the
adequacy of the disclosure of alibi, I turn to the merits of the alibi.  It is
important to note that once the trial judge concluded that the alibi had not
been adequately disclosed, he went on to review the evidence before him
concerning the merits of the alibi.  He concluded that he did not believe the
accused and his mother with respect to the alibi; he noted there were
inconsistencies in both the accused's and his mother's testimony.  By contrast,
he did believe the testimony of the police officers.  He found that a reasonable
doubt had not been raised with respect to the alibi and that as a result, the
defence of alibi failed.

 

8                 Given the trial judge's findings
on the merits on the alibi defence, I am not prepared to attribute any weight
to his speculative remarks concerning the possible significance the alibi might
have had in the event proper disclosure was made.  The fact remains that the
trial judge was barely convinced that Mrs. Foster's statement was a disclosure
at all, let alone a sufficient one.  To my mind, it is difficult to suggest
that the trial judge erred in drawing a negative inference because disclosure
was inadequate where he had doubts as to whether disclosure had been made at
all.  It is clear that the trial judge did not think much of the alibi defence
to begin with.  In summary, upon reading his reasons, I find that he was
entitled to draw a negative inference concerning the alibi defence based on the
evidence before him.  His conclusions are supported by the evidence and should
not be interfered with by this Court.

 

9                        I would dismiss the
appeal.

                   The reasons of
Sopinka and Major JJ. were delivered by

 

                   Major
J. (dissenting) --

 

I.                 Facts

 

10               The appellant was convicted in the
Ontario Court (Provincial Division) on a charge of trafficking in cocaine and
sentenced to four months' imprisonment.  An appeal to the Ontario Court of
Appeal was dismissed, Abella J.A. dissenting.

 

11               The appellant appeals as of right
on the points of law raised in Abella J.A.'s dissent, i.e., whether the trial
judge erred in law by characterizing the disclosure of the appellant's alibi
defence as untimely or insufficient and if so, whether the error could be cured
by the provisions of s. 686  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 

12               Evidence was lead that on July 26,
1990, at 2:25 p.m., a man sold $40 worth of crack cocaine to an undercover
officer, Constable Norman, in the area of Jane and Woolner Streets in Toronto. 
That person was wearing a yellow shirt and black pants with an unusual haircut
featuring the design of an arrow shaved into the side of his head.  Upon the
completion of the transaction, he walked north through a hydro field towards an
apartment complex.

 

13               At 3:40 p.m. Constable Norman saw
the appellant, dressed in a brown muscle shirt and blue jeans, coming south
through the hydro field from the apartment complex.  At a distance of 50 feet,
Constable Norman identified the appellant as the man who had sold him cocaine
earlier in the day and gave a signal to other undercover officers who arrested
the appellant.

 

14               The appellant presented alibi evidence
that he was at home with his mother, Marvelyn Foster, at the time of the
alleged sale.  Both the appellant and his mother testified that the appellant
did not own a yellow shirt or black pants, that the appellant had worn a brown
muscle shirt and blue jeans throughout the day in question, and that the
appellant had been in the house watching television and writing letters
throughout the entire episode of the soap opera ""One Life to Live""
which ran from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. that day.

 

15               The appellant's mother also
testified that when she attended at the police station shortly after the
appellant's arrest, she told the officers she was with the appellant at 2:30
p.m.  Her trial testimony about this conversation was:

 

 

 

                   Q.   Now
did you talk to the police about where Devon [the appellant] was that day?

 

                   A.   When
I went there, there was police officer -- a woman officer and another officer. 
I don't know if she was a police, but she is in plain clothes.  And I said:__

 

                   ""Good
evening.""

 

Nobody
answer.  So, the woman in the plain clothes, she was sitting aside and she was
eating something.  She come over and she say:__

 

                   ""Can
I help you?""

 

I
say:__

 

                   ""Yes. 
I hard [sic] that they had my son here.  I would like to          speak
to the officer."" 

 

She
showed me to a room and I was sitting in the room and he [sic] is going

II.                Judicial History

 

A.                Ontario Court
(Provincial Division)

 

16               The trial judge accepted the evidence
of the appellant's mother with respect to the conversation which occurred
between her and the officers at the police station, but he did not agree that
this conversation was sufficient to constitute disclosure of an alibi defence:

 

                   It
is with great respect that I find that the conversation with the mother and
whoever she spoke to, whether it be one, or more than one police officer, or
whether it was someone other than a police officer and whether it be male or
female, was so disjointed and so unintelligible and so lacking in follow
through and coherence, that I can't, for the life of me, make a finding and
refuse to make a finding that this was disclosure of an alibi.  I find that the
comment, or the conversation, was nothing more than idle, perhaps,
conversation, or some type of protest.  I questioned what information the
mother had with her at that particular time to be able to come up with the
finding that she did come up with.  In any event, I find that if, in fact, it
was meant to be a disclosure of an alibi, it was inappropriate disclosure.

 

17               The trial judge relied upon
comments on the alibi defence contained in a lecture, ""Advising an
Arrested Client"" by Patrick T. Galligan, in Special Lectures of the Law
Society of Upper Canada 1963, Part IV, Representing an Arrested Client and
Police Interrogation, 35.  The author suggests (at p. 42) three methods for
the disclosure of the defence of alibi: calling the witnesses of the alibi at
the preliminary hearing, a statement by defence counsel at the end of the
preliminary hearing giving the names, addresses and synopsis of the evidence of
the witnesses, or a letter from defence counsel to the Crown Attorney setting
out these details.  The trial judge also quoted from a lecture,
""Preliminary Hearings"" by G. Arthur Martin, Q.C., in Special
Lectures of the Law Society of Upper Canada 1955, Evidence, 1, at p. 18:

 

. .
. the Supreme Court of Canada has held in R. v. Russell, 67
C.C.C. 28, that where an alibi is not set up at an early stage in the
proceedings, the trial judge is entitled to comment on the fact and the alibi
is thereby considerably weakened.

 

18               On the basis of these authorities,
the trial judge held that the Crown was not appropriately advised of the
defence of alibi, presumably because the alibi was not disclosed in the manner
that was suggested by the authorities he relied on.  As a result he held that
the alibi was considerably weakened.  The trial judge noted that the failure to
disclose the alibi the way he thought proper may have had a significant effect
on the outcome of the trial:

 

                   I
find as a fact that the Crown was never appropriately advised that the defence
of alibi would be put forward in this trial and I find   -- unless someone
can persuade me otherwise -- that the first that the Crown realized -- by
""the Crown"", I'm referring to the office of the Crown -- that an
alibi would be put forward was today during the course of the trial. 
Accordingly, I must take the position that the alibi is considerably weak.  It
might have been significant if the Crown was appropriately advised of the
alibi: of what would be said at the trial; of what witnesses might be of some
assistance; the names and addresses of witness, or witnesses who might be able
to support the alibi so that the Crown -- and upon instructions from the Crown,
the police could investigate the alibi.  That may very well have been of
significant assistance to the accused, I don't know.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   Following
these cases that I have referred to and these various authorities that I have
referred to, be they cases or articles or lectures that were given, the alibi
is, of course, considerably weakened.  In relation to the alibi, I accept the
evidence of the Crown witnesses and reject the evidence of the accused and the
defence witnesses.

 

B.                Ontario Court of
Appeal

 

19                      The endorsement reads:

 

In
light of the strength of the identification evidence and the fact that the
trial judge did  weigh the alibi defence, we don't think that the adverse
inference that he drew from the non-disclosure could have effected [sic]
the outcome of the case.  We would therefore dismiss the appeal. (Arbour J.A.
and Austin J.A.)

 

Abella
J.A. would have set aside the conviction on the ground that the trial judge
erred in his characterization of the alibi evidence as untimely or insufficient
and that this error could not be cured by the proviso.

 

III.               Issues

 

1.Did
the trial judge err in his characterization of the disclosure of the alibi
evidence as untimely or insufficient?

 

2.If
the trial judge erred in his characterization of the disclosure of the alibi
evidence, can the conviction nevertheless be upheld pursuant to the provisions
of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.

 

 

 

IV.              Analysis

 

20               The governing principle on alibi
evidence is that a failure to disclose an alibi at a sufficiently early time to
permit it to be investigated by the police is a factor which may be considered
in determining the weight to be given to it:  see R. v. Mahoney (1979),
50 C.C.C. (2d) 380 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834, R. v. Dunbar and
Logan (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 13 (Ont. C.A.), R. v. Parrington
(1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 184 (Ont. C.A.), R. v. Ford (1993), 78 C.C.C.
(3d) 481 (B.C.C.A.), Taillefer v. R., [1989] R.J.Q. 2023 (Que.
C.A.).

 

21               The principle that an alibi
defence ought to be disclosed to the Crown prior to trial has a long history in
the common law.  Hudson J., writing for this Court in Russell v. The King
(1936), 67 C.C.C. 28, at p. 32, held that it was a rule of expediency and not
of law that an alibi should be set up at ""the earliest possible
moment"" and that failure to do so could affect the weight to be given to
the alibi evidence:

 

                   Apparently
the Judge was quoting from Crankshaw, at p. 1103, where it is stated:__""The
defence of an alibi ought to be set up at the earliest possible moment and
ought to include a statement of where the defendant was at the time of the
taking place of the alleged offence."" 

 

...

 

                   This
is not a statement of any rule of law but rather a statement of a rule of
expediency in advancing the defence of an alibi and a test that may well be
applied by a jury in weighing the evidence. 

 

22               The principal reason for drawing
an adverse inference against alibi evidence in the absence of adequate notice
to the Crown is because such evidence can readily be fabricated.  This
potential problem with alibi evidence is discussed by R. N. Gooderson in his
text Alibi (1977), at pp. 29-30:

 

It
must be conceded that there is good reason to look at alibi evidence with
care.  It is a defence entirely divorced from the main factual issue
surrounding the corpus delicti, as it rests upon extraneous facts, not
arising from the res gestae.  The essential facts of the alleged crime
may well be to a large extent incontrovertible, leaving but limited room for
manoeuvre whether the defendant be innocent or guilty.  Alibi evidence, by its
very nature, takes the focus right away from the area of the main facts, and
gives the defence a fresh and untrammelled start.  It is easy to prepare
perjured evidence to support it in advance.

 

23               The potential for the fabrication
of alibi evidence requires that a negative inference may be drawn against such
evidence where the alibi defence is not disclosed in sufficient time to permit
investigation.  Nevertheless, it must be remembered that the requirement that
an alibi defence be disclosed to the Crown prior to trial is an exception to
the accused's right of silence:  see R. v. P. (M.B.), [1994] 1
S.C.R. 555, at p. 578, per Lamer C.J., R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1
S.C.R. 451, at p. 516, per Iacobucci J.  Cory J. held in R. v.
Chambers, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, at p. 1316, the right of an accused to
pre-trial silence is basic tenet of our legal system which falls within the
ambit of s. 7  of the Charter :

 

                   The
importance of the principle was emphasized by Martin J.A. in R. v. Symonds
(1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 227: 

 

                   It
is fundamental that a person charged with a criminal offence has the right to
remain silent and a jury is not entitled to draw any inference against an
accused because he chooses to exercise that right.

 

                   Further
the right to silence has now been recognized as a basic tenet of our legal
system and as such is a right protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .  As a basic tenet of our law it falls within the ambit of s.
7  of the Charter .  See R. v. Woolley (1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 531
(Ont. C.A.), and particularly R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151.  It
follows that an accused person has the right to remain silent at the
investigation stage as well as at the trial.

 

24               Respect for the accused's right to
silence in the investigation stage has mandated some changes to the rule on the
disclosure of an alibi from its original formulation by this Court in Russell,
supra.  As noted at the outset of this analysis, the appropriate
requirement now is that the disclosure of the alibi is made sufficiently early
to permit investigation by the police and not that it is made at the earliest
possible moment nor that it is made in a particular way.

 

25               It is no longer permissible to
draw a negative inference against alibi evidence on the grounds that the
accused did not disclose that alibi immediately upon arrest, nor to draw an
inference that an innocent person would have made such immediate disclosure. 
In Parrington, supra, at pp. 187-88, Cory J.A. (as he then was)
held that cross-examination of the accused by the Crown on the failure to
disclose alibi evidence immediately upon arrest in order to establish his
innocence was quite improper.  LeBel J.A., writing for the Quebec Court of
Appeal, chose the same approach in Taillefer, supra, at p. 2039:

 

                          [TRANSLATION] More recently, in R. v. Parrington cited
earlier, Cory J.A. stated the following concerning this problem:

 

The
governing principle is that a failure to disclose an alibi at a sufficiently
early time to permit it to be investigated by the police is a factor to be
considered in determining the weight to be given to the alibi evidence... 
Where, as in this case, there is adequate time for investigation then the time
of disclosure is no longer a factor for consideration and no reference should
be made to it in the charge to the jury.  Those two grounds are sufficient in
themselves to require a new trial.

 

                   As
stated by Cory J.A., where an alibi is raised sufficiently early to permit it
to be investigated, questions on this point should not be authorized or
tolerated by the judge, any more than comments by the Crown in oral argument. 
They might violate the accused's rights to silence.

 

26               The respondent argued that an
alibi must be disclosed by the accused and that disclosure by third party is
insufficient, even if that third party is the witness to the alibi.  I
disagree.  It is another principle which arises from the right to silence at
the investigative stage that disclosure of the alibi need not be made by the
accused but may also be made by a third party who is a witness to the alibi.

 

27               This latter principle is also a
matter of common sense.  For instance, if an accused were in an unconscious
state at the time that the crime was committed, or for some other reason had no
recollection of where he was at that time, there is no reason that his alibi
should be given less weight merely because it is disclosed and supported by the
evidence of third parties rather than by the accused himself.

 

28               In Mahoney, supra,
the accused was charged with murder.  At trial he led evidence in support of an
alibi defence that he had been at another house with a man called Weedmark at
the time that the murder was committed.  The accused did not notify the police
of Weedmark at the time of the arrest nor did he bring him to the attention of
the police.  However, Weedmark notified police that the accused had been with
him on the night prior to the murder and the Crown called Weedmark as a witness
in order to establish when the accused had left Weedmark's residence.  The
trial judge instructed the jury that the failure of the accused to notify the
police of the fact that he had been with Weedmark on the night before the
murder might be taken into account in determining the weight to be given to the
accused's alibi.  The Ontario Court of Appeal disapproved of this instruction
to the jury and Brooke J.A., writing for the court, commented at p. 387:

 

                   In
such circumstances, where the witness called by the Crown was available to it
at such an early moment, the appellant's alibi has been disclosed in time to
afford the police a very adequate opportunity to test it.

 

                   The
jury could only take from the charge that the failure to disclose the fact that
he had been with Weedmark might be taken into consideration in determining the
weight to be given to the appellant's alibi.  That alibi depended upon
Weedmark's testimony.  The fact that the accused said nothing of Weedmark at
the time of his arrest was of no significance in judging Weedmark's evidence
... . 

 

Mahoney stands as authority for the proposition that no
negative inference may be drawn against alibi evidence simply because the
police became aware of that evidence from the witness to the alibi rather than
from the accused person.

 

29               Applying these principles to the
case at bar, I find that sufficient disclosure of an alibi defence was made by
the appellant's mother, Marvelyn Foster, when she appeared at the police
station in order to bail out her son.

 

30               The full description of that
conversation from the testimony of Mrs. Foster is set out in the facts above. 
Although the trial judge accepted the truth of Mrs. Foster's testimony about
this conversation, he held that it was too disjointed and unintelligible to
constitute disclosure of an alibi.  After consideration of the formal methods
for disclosure of an alibi recommended to defence counsel in the 1963 lecture
by Patrick Galligan (as he then was), the trial judge held that the disclosure
of an alibi in an informal manner by the principal witness to the alibi was
insufficient.  In my opinion, the trial judge erred on both of these points.

 

31               I respectfully disagree that the
conversation recalled by Mrs. Foster at the trial was so disjointed as to be
unintelligible.  Although it is clear that she may have had some difficulty
expressing herself lucidly in English in court, three important points are made
in her testimony.  First, Mrs. Foster specifically requested to speak to the
officer in charge of her son's case and subsequently spoke to the officer
produced to her.  Second, when the officer produced to her suggested that the
arrest had occurred at 2:30 p.m., she stated that this was not possible.  She
stated that the appellant had been with her at that time:  ""No. You
couldn't hold him at 2:30.  At 2:30, he was there.""  Third, the officer
clearly understood that the appellant's mother was asserting that an arrest at
2:30 p.m. would have been impossible because he proceeded to suggest later
times, until she was finally satisfied by his answer that the arrest took place
after 3:00 p.m.

 

32               The disclosure of an alibi should
be given with sufficient particularity to enable the authorities to
meaningfully investigate: see Ford, supra, at p. 505.  In my
opinion, three pieces of information are necessary for sufficient disclosure of
an alibi defence: a statement that the accused was not present at location of
the crime when it was committed, the whereabouts of the accused at that time
and the names of any witnesses to the alibi:  see Mahoney, supra,
and also R. v. Laverty (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 151 (Ont. C.A.).  The
appellant's mother gave the police all of this critical information: the
appellant could not have been present at 2:30 p.m., the appellant was at home
watching television with his mother at that time, and she was the witness. 
Therefore, in my opinion, the discussion which the appellant's mother had with
the police officer constituted sufficient disclosure of an alibi defence under
the circumstances.

 

33               My colleague, Justice Iacobucci,
accepts the argument of the respondent that the disclosure of the alibi by the
appellant's mother was insufficient because the alleged offence took place
minutes earlier than the time covered by her disclosure.  With respect I cannot
agree with this overly strict approach to the contents of disclosure.  The record
indicates that although the officer arrived at the scene at 2:18, the drug
transaction did not occur until 2:25 and lasted for only half a minute:

 

                   Q. 
Okay.  And your transaction, you said, took place in almost half a minute?

 

                   A. 
That's correct.

 

                   Q. 
And it was at what time?  What time did it happen?

 

                   A. 
I arrived in the area at 2:18 p.m.  I was walking north-bound on Jane Street. 
It would have been approximately 2:25, 2:25 -- in between there sometime.

 

34               In the conversation which the
officer in charge had with the appellant's mother subsequent to the appellant's
arrest, that officer suggested a number of times to the appellant's mother, one
of which was 2:30.  The mother clearly indicated that she was with the appellant
at that time.  When the alibi was disclosed, the officer, but not the mother,
knew the precise time of the alleged offence.  Given that the mother did not
know what time the alleged offence had been committed, it is not surprising
that the mother did not pinpoint the time of the alibi to the nearest minute. 
In my opinion, a reasonable police officer would have assumed that an alibi at
the appellant's mother's house at 2:30 was worth investigating for a crime
alleged to have been committed in a field at 2:25.  At the time of the
disclosure, the police did not have any information as to the distance between
the appellant's house and the location of the drug transaction.  The police
could have ascertained whether the alibi disclosed for 2:30 also applied at
2:25.  It should be noted that the evidence of the appellant and the mother at
trial indicated that the alibi covered the entire period from 2:00 until after
3:00.

 

35               The more formal disclosure of an
alibi defence either at the preliminary hearing or by a letter from defence
counsel to the Crown as suggested in the lecture referred to by the trial judge
is preferable where practicable.  Nevertheless, each case must be evaluated on
its own facts and in some cases a less formal manner of disclosure may suffice,
particularly when appropriate consideration is given to the accused's right to
silence.  In this case, the charge was not sufficiently serious to warrant a
preliminary hearing and the appellant was not represented by counsel at the
bail hearing, which would have been another appropriate time for formal
disclosure of the alibi defence.

 

36               Finally, it should be remembered
that the drawing of a negative inference against alibi evidence is not a rule
of law but a rule of expediency (Russell, supra) designed to
protect against perjured testimony.  Alibi evidence is not automatically
""considerably weakened"" by the failure to formally disclose the
defence.  As stated by Martin J.A. in Dunbar and Logan, supra, at
p. 62:

 

                   The
governing principle is that a failure to disclose an alibi at a sufficiently
early time to permit it to be investigated by the police is a factor to be
considered in determining the weight to be given to the alibi 

evidence....
[Emphasis added.]

 

Thus, a judge must determine whether,
in all the circumstances of the case, the untimeliness or insufficiency of the
disclosure suggests that a negative inference should be drawn against the
testimony.

 

37               In this case, the main witness to
the alibi disclosed the alibi to the police within a few hours of the arrest
and before she had an opportunity to discuss the matter with the appellant. 
Moreover, the content of the alibi, (that the appellant had been at home
watching television with his mother at the relevant time), was substantially
the same as the evidence which she and the appellant gave in furtherance of the
alibi defence at trial.  In these circumstances, given that the trial judge
accepted the testimony of the appellant's mother as to the conversation which
occurred in the police station, there was no reason to draw an adverse
inference against the alibi evidence.

 

38               In this case, the trial judge
found that the disclosure of the alibi defence by the appellant's mother was
insufficient and therefore that alibi was not disclosed in a timely fashion. 
As a result, the trial judge drew a negative inference such that the alibi
defence was ""considerably weakened"".  In the circumstances of the
case, the finding that the disclosure of the alibi was insufficient and the
drawing of the negative inference constituted errors of law.

 

39               The conviction in this case cannot
be upheld under the curative provision of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code: 
see R. v. Arcangioli, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, at p. 146:

 

                   The
principles and tests to be applied under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code , the ""curative provision"", are a matter of settled
jurisprudence.  That section places a burden on the Crown to justify the denial
of a new trial despite the presence of an error in the lower court.  While the
satisfaction of that onus is a condition precedent to the application of the
curative provision, the curative provision need not be applied even if the onus
is met.  In Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, at p. 744, the
applicable test was stated to be whether ""the verdict would necessarily
have been the same if such error had not occurred"".  See also Wildman
v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at pp. 328-29; R. v. S. (P.L.),
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, at p. 919; R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, at
p. 620; R. v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697, at pp. 736-37; and R.
v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 617.

 

In this case the verdict would not
necessarily have been the same if the trial judge had not erred by finding that
the alibi defence was considerably weakened by the late disclosure.

 

40               The alibi defence was the only
defence relied upon by the appellant in this trial and it was also clearly
relevant to the issue of identification which was the most contentious issue in
the trial.  The credibility of the appellant's witnesses and the Crown
witnesses respectively was critical to the outcome of this trial.  It cannot be
said that the outcome of the trial would have been the same if a negative
inference had not been drawn against the evidence given by the appellant's
witnesses.  The comments of Brooke J.A. in Laverty, supra, at p.
153, are equally appropriate in this case:

 

                   Crown
counsel has urged us that if this was indeed in error, it was of no account,
because the trial Judge had elected to believe the evidence of the Crown
witness.  We do not agree.  The importance of this evidence was obvious.  If
the appellant's witness' evidence was misjudged because improper principles
were applied in determining the weight to be given to it, the criteria for
balancing the scales of justice may have been something other than the test of
reasonable doubt.  On this ground alone, the appeal must succeed.

 

41               Furthermore, the trial judge
stated that if he had not drawn a negative inference against the alibi evidence:
""[t]hat may very well have been of significant assistance to the accused,
I don't know.""  When a trial judge recognizes that the outcome may have
been significantly affected by his decision on a point, it is clear that the
conviction cannot be upheld under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) if the appellate
court finds that the trial judge erred on that point.

 

V.                Disposition

 

42               In the result I would allow the
appeal, quash the conviction of the appellant and direct a new trial.

Criminal law ‑‑ Evidence ‑‑
Prior inconsistent statements ‑‑ Admissibility ‑‑
Accused and complainant making separate statements containing similarities to police
‑‑ Accused and complainant recanting at trial ‑‑
Whether trial judge erred in inviting jury to compare complainant's prior
inconsistent statement with accused's statement to police in determining if
prosecution had established guilt.

 








The accused was arrested following a report that he
had engaged in sexual activities with his 13-year-old daughter.  In the course
of being interviewed by the investigating officer, the daughter stated that her
father had been having sexual intercourse with her on a regular basis since
December 1987 and described various sexual activities.  The last time her
father had had sex with her was the previous night.  The officer then
questioned the accused.  He admitted that he had had sex with his daughter many
times, described the same sexual activities she had described, and stated that
the most recent intercourse had been the previous night.  The accused was
charged with a number of sexual offences.  His statement to the police was
admitted as Crown evidence through the testimony of two officers.  The Crown
also called the complainant daughter as a witness.  Although she admitted that
she had made the allegations against the accused in her statement, the
complainant asserted that the allegations of sexual assault were untrue.  The
accused also testified at trial.  While he admitted having made an inculpatory
statement to the police, he denied the truth of much of the statement's
contents, including his admissions of having engaged in sexual activity with
his daughter.  The accused was convicted of one count of incest and two counts
of sexual touching.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority judgment, upheld the
conviction.  At issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in
inviting the jury to compare the complainant's unadopted prior inconsistent
statement with the accused's unadopted statement to the police in determining
if the prosecution had established guilt.

 

Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The orthodox rule that
prior inconsistent statements are not admissible for the truth of their
contents is a particular instance of the rule against admitting hearsay.  In
recent years, however, this Court's decisions have established that the
traditional inflexible approach to the hearsay rule and its exceptions is to be
rejected in favour of an approach which allows evidence to be admitted and used
substantively when it is shown to be reliable and necessary.  Both necessity
and reliability must be interpreted flexibly, taking account of the
circumstances of the case.  When the reliability and necessity criteria are
met, prior inconsistent statements of witnesses other than the accused are
substantively admissible, provided that they would have been admissible as the
witness's sole testimony.  The gravest danger associated with hearsay evidence,
namely the absence of contemporaneous cross‑examination, simply does not
exist in the case of prior inconsistent statements because the witness is
available for cross‑examination.  The other two dangers, absence of an
oath and absence of demeanour evidence, can be met through appropriate police
procedures and occasionally appropriate substitutes can be found.  Finally, the
prior statement is necessary evidence when a witness recants.

 

A threshold of reliability can sometimes be
established, in cases where the witness is available for cross‑examination,
by a striking similarity between two statements.  In order to eliminate, or at
least substantially reduce, the likelihood of a similarity between two
statements arising through coincidence, the similar factual assertion must be
so striking that it is highly unlikely two people would have independently
fabricated it.  In some cases, the necessary degree of similarity will result
from the unique nature of particular factual assertions in both statements.  In
other situations it may be that the cumulative combination of similar points
renders the overall similarity between the two statements sufficiently
distinctive to reject coincidence as a likely explanation.

After the calling party invokes s. 9  of the Canada
Evidence Act , and fulfils its requirements in the voir dire held
under that section, the party must then state its objectives in tendering the
statement.  If the statement will only be used to impeach the witness, the
inquiry ends at this point.  If, however, the calling party wishes to make
substantive use of the statement, the voir dire must continue so that the
trial judge can assess whether a threshold of reliability has been met.  The
necessity criterion need not be assessed as it is met whenever a witness
recants.  If the reliability criterion is to be met, in rare cases, by the
striking similarity between the statement being assessed and another statement
which is already clearly substantively admissible, the trial judge must be
satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there are striking similarities
between the two statements, and that there was neither reason nor opportunity
for the declarants to collude, nor improper influence by interrogators or other
third parties.  The trial judge must also ascertain that the prior statement
relates evidence which would be admissible as the witness's sole testimony.  If
the trial judge determines that the statement meets the threshold reliability
criterion and is thus substantively admissible, he or she must direct the trier
of fact to follow a two‑step process in evaluating the evidence.  The
trier of fact must first be certain that the statement which is being used as a
reliability referent was made, without taking into account the prior
inconsistent statement under consideration.  Once the trier of fact is
satisfied that the other statement was made, the trier of fact may compare the
similarities between the two statements and, if they are sufficiently striking
that it is unlikely that two people would have independently fabricated them,
the trier of fact may draw conclusions from that comparison about the truth of
the statements.

 

In this case, the recanting witness was cross‑examined
in detail about her reasons for changing her story at a preliminary inquiry, on
a voir dire under s. 9  of the Canada Evidence Act , and
before the jury.  She provided a comprehensive explanation for changing her
story which could be assessed by both the trial judge and the jury and
therefore eliminates the most important danger of hearsay evidence.  The
statements made by the accused and by his daughter contained both a significant
number of similarities in detail and the strikingly similar assertion that the
most recent sexual contact between the two had been the previous evening.  As a
voir dire was also held with regard to the accused's statement, there
was sufficient evidence presented to found a conclusion that the accused and
his daughter had neither a reason nor an opportunity to collude, and that the
accused was not improperly influenced by the police officers who took his
statement.  The complainant's statement was therefore substantively admissible
at trial.  The absence of correct jury instructions does not alter the outcome
of this appeal as the statements are so strikingly similar that the jury would
inevitably have been satisfied as to their reliability.  The objection that the
jury instructions left open the possibility that the daughter's statement would
be used for the truth of its contents does not arise given the conclusion that
the statement was substantively admissible.

 

Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.: 
The complainant's prior inconsistent statement was admissible for the purpose
of comparison with the accused's confession, as found by Lamer C.J.  The
similarities between the two statements need not be ""striking"",
however, before the jury can be permitted to use the prior inconsistent
statement for such a purpose.  So long as there are significant similarities
between the two statements, as there clearly were in this case, a witness's
prior inconsistent statement will be admissible for purposes of comparison with
an accused's unadopted confession in order to assess the truth of that
confession.  As found by Lamer C.J., the trial judge adequately instructed the
jury in this case concerning the use it could make of the complainant's prior
inconsistent statement.

I. Introduction

 

1                 This
appeal, which comes to this Court as of right based on a dissent in the Ontario
Court of Appeal, raises a single issue: when is a witness's prior inconsistent
statement substantively admissible?   To resolve this issue, this Court must
once again consider the hearsay rationale for the orthodox rule regarding prior
inconsistent statements and what modifications to that rule are appropriate in
light of our reform of the hearsay rule in R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
531, R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, and R. v. B. (K.G.),
[1993] 1 S.C.R. 740.

II. Statement of Facts

 

2                 The
appellant, F.J.U., emigrated from Peru to Canada in 1975, shortly after the
birth of his daughter J.U.  His daughter remained in Peru with her grandmother
C.O.-V., the appellant's mother, until December 1987, when they both joined the
appellant in Canada.  The three shared a residence in Mississauga along with
the appellant's brother until the spring of 1988, when C.O.-V. returned to Peru
and the appellant and his daughter moved to Brampton.  In September 1988,
C.O.-V. returned to Canada, and from September 1988 to October 11, 1988 (the
date of the appellant’s arrest) she resided with the appellant and J.U. in
Toronto.

 

3                 On
October 11, 1988, C.O.-V. reported to the police that the appellant had engaged
in sexual activities with his daughter.  The police went to the U.'s residence,
in the company of a Spanish interpreter, and spoke to J.U.  The appellant was
arrested and taken to the police station.  J.U. and her grandmother were taken
to the police station in a separate car.

 

4                 After
arriving at the police station, J.U. was interviewed by Sergeant Hector
Colantoni, the investigating officer.  Her grandmother was present during the
interview, as was Constable Tom Job, a Spanish-speaking officer who acted as an
interpreter when J.U. had difficulty understanding Sergeant Colantoni's
questions or responding to them in English.  In the course of the interview,
J.U. stated that her father had been having sexual intercourse with her on a
regular basis since December 1987 when she came to Canada.  She told the police
that these incidents occurred more frequently after her grandmother had
returned to Peru in April 1988, and that between this date and her
grandmother’s return to Canada in September 1988 her father had sex with her
“almost every day”.  She declared that the sexual activity generally took place
late at night in her bedroom.  She also indicated that on a few occasions the
appellant had had her perform oral sex on him, and that on a few other
occasions he had performed oral sex on her.  In addition, she stated, the
appellant ""would have sex in my bum many times"".  The last time her
father had had sex with her, she declared, was the previous night (October 10,
1988).  J.U. also stated that the appellant had physically assaulted her on two
separate occasions, the first time striking her with a length of wire, and the
second time punching her in the face.  At the appellant's trial, Sergeant
Colantoni testified that he had attempted to tape his interview with J.U., but
that the tape recorder had malfunctioned and nothing had been recorded.  He
stated that he had subsequently prepared a summary of J.U.'s anticipated
evidence, based in part on notes he had made during the interview and in part
on his memory.

 

5                 After
interviewing J.U., Sergeant Colantoni proceeded to question the appellant,
accompanied by Constable Tony McKenzie.  Sergeant Colantoni testified that he
took notes and that the interview was not taped.  According to Sergeant
Colantoni's testimony, the appellant admitted that he had had sex with his
daughter “many times”, and also stated that she had performed oral sex on him
“two or three times when we lived in Mississauga, but she didn't like it”.  He
also declared that he had performed oral sex on her “once or twice”.  Sergeant
Colantoni also testified that the appellant had further admitted to having had
anal sex with J.U. “three or four times”, stating that this had taken place
most recently “last night” (i.e., October 10, 1988).  The appellant also
described two incidents in which he had physically assaulted his daughter,
stating that on one occasion he had struck her with a wire-reinforced belt, and
that on the second occasion he had slapped her in the face.  The appellant
refused, however, to make a written statement, and indicated that he would not
sign anything.

 

6                 The
appellant was charged with three counts of sexual interference (s. 151 , of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ), one count of incest (s. 155 ) and one count of
anal intercourse (s. 159 ).  The terms of the indictment were particularized as
follows:

 

 

Count 1: Touching the mouth of J.U. with
his penis for a sexual purpose, between September 1 and October 10, 1988, in
Toronto.

 

Count 2: Anal intercourse with J.U. on
or about October 10, 1988, in Toronto.

 

Count 3: Incest with J.U. between
September 1 and October 10, 1988, in Toronto.

 

Count 4: Touching the mouth of J.U. with
his penis for a sexual purpose, between September 1, 1987 and August 31, 1988,
in Toronto and Mississauga.

 

Count 5: Touching J.U.'s vagina with his
mouth for a sexual purpose, between September 1, 1987 and August 31, 1988, in
Toronto and Mississauga.

 

7                 The
appellant was tried in the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) before a
jury, with Allen J. presiding.  His statement to the police, which Allen J.
ruled had been made voluntarily and obtained in accordance with the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , was admitted as Crown evidence through the
testimony of Sergeant Colantoni and Constable McKenzie.  The Crown also called
J.U. as a witness.  Although she admitted that she had made the allegations
against the appellant contained in the “will-say” statement that had been
drafted by Sergeant Colantoni following his interview with her, J.U. asserted
that the allegations of sexual assault were untrue.  She maintained, however,
that the allegations of non-sexual assault she had made in her statement were
true.  According to J.U.'s trial testimony, she had lied to the police at the
behest of her grandmother, because she was concerned that her father was
planning to send her back to Peru to live with her mother.  She stated that her
grandmother had threatened to commit suicide if J.U. were taken away from her,
and had given J.U. instructions about details of the false allegations of
sexual misconduct she was to make.  

 

8                 The
appellant also testified at trial.  While he admitted having made an
inculpatory statement to the police, he denied the truth of much of the
statement's contents.  He testified that the conduct of the police during the
interview had brought back memories of his imprisonment and torture by the
Peruvian police, and that his resulting fear had led him to make a false
confession.  He believed that as long as he refused to sign anything his
confession could not be used against him.  

 

9                 When
cross-examined on his statement, the appellant denied having made several of
the utterances attributed to him by Sergeant Colantoni and Constable McKenzie. 
In particular, he denied having told the officers that he had had anal
intercourse with his daughter, or telling them that his sexual activity with
J.U. was intended to ""protect"" her from having sex with other
people.  While he agreed that the remainder of the officers' testimony
accurately reflected what he had said to them, he testified that none of his
admissions of having engaged in sexual activity with his daughter were true. 
He confirmed, however, that the portion of his statement describing the two
physical assaults on his daughter was true.

 

10               After
deliberating for over nine hours, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on
counts 1 and 2 and guilty on counts 3, 4 and 5.  The appellant was sentenced to
a term of incarceration of two years less one day, and to a period of
probation.  The appellant's appeal of his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal
was dismissed, Houlden J.A. dissenting: (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 541, 72 O.A.C.
117, 32 C.R. (4th) 378.

 

III. Judgments Below

 

Ontario Court of Justice (General Division)

 

11               In
the course of charging the jury, Allen J. commenced his discussion of the
evidence by making the following observations:

 

The evidence was relatively
brief.  It is for you to decide what that evidence establishes, proves to your
satisfaction.  You are faced with a situation where both [the appellant] and
[J.U.] have made statements to the police or utterances to the police.  Each of
them in turn has for the most part acknowledged having made those utterances
which the police officers have recited to you and which they have attributed to
[the appellant] or to [J.U.] as the case may be, but now both [the appellant]
and [J.U.] say that he or she, as the case may be, was not truthful when
speaking with the police officers at the times and places indicated by the
police officers.

 

Allen J. addressed the appellant's inculpatory statement as follows:

 

What [the appellant] told the police
may in your discretion be used by you to establish his guilt on these charges
or any one or more of them as you determine.  He did testify before you that he
did not tell the truth to the police officers when they interviewed him, and he
has explained to you or told you his reasons for that absence of truth at that
time.  He said that that was based on his unfortunate experiences with the
police authorities in Peru some several years ago.  It is for you to weigh the
testimony of the police officers as to [the appellant's] utterances and conduct
when interviewed by them.  Of course, you must also weigh [the appellant's]
testimony before you as to those matters.

 

I have said it is for you to
decide what the evidence was, but as I have understood [the appellant's]
evidence, he acknowledges that he made most of the utterances attributed to him
by the police, and he does deny having made some of the utterances which the
police have recorded and have stated in their testimony to you.  If you find
that you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that [the appellant] made an
utterance to the police officers as they have testified, and if you are
satisfied that that utterance was and is true, you will apply that utterance in
your deliberations as to his guilt or innocence.  If you find that the
utterance he made to the police was not true, or if you have a reasonable doubt
as to it being true, you will not apply that particular utterance or alleged
utterance to your deliberations.

 

 

Allen J. then addressed the issue of the appellant's and J.U.'s
credibility:

 

 

Certainly the contradiction between [the appellant's]
utterances to the police and his testimony before you can be applied by you in
assessing his credibility as a witness before you.  Similarly, you will consider
the contradiction between [J.U.'s] utterances to the police and her testimony
before you as you assess her credibility as a witness.

 

Allen J.'s subsequent instruction, advising a comparison between the
two statements, led to the division in the Court of Appeal:

 

You might wish to review [J.U.'s]
utterances to the police, those which she acknowledged she had made, and those
which you find [the appellant] made to the police.  You may find some
similarity in details which may assist you in your deliberations.  One that
comes to my mind as I was reviewing my notes was with reference to the time of
the last sexual or alleged sexual activity between the two of them.  Each, on
the basis of the police testimony, said that that occurred the night before the
police interview with them.  However, all of that sort of thing is in your
domain, and it will be for you to review all of the evidence and look at it
very carefully with the benefit  of the twelve minds and memories being applied
to it.

 

12               After
Allen J. had completed his charge, counsel for the appellant raised several
objections, including an objection to the instruction to look for similarities
between the complainant's and appellant's unadopted statements.  The trial
judge, however, chose not to recall the jury.  After deliberating for several
hours, the jury made the following request:

 

We would like to see a copy of [the appellant's]
statement to police.  We would also like to see [J.U.'s] statement to police. 
What parts of the police statement did [the appellant] deny he said?

 

Allen J. discussed the matter with counsel  and decided to have the
court reporter read back the relevant portions of the testimony of the two
officers, J.U. and the appellant.  Defence counsel observed that his concern
that the jury would compare and contrast the statements in an impermissible
fashion was coming to fruition. 

 

Court of Appeal for Ontario (1994), 90 C.C.C.
(3d) 541

(1)  Osborne J.A. (Carthy J.A. concurring)

 

13               Osborne
J.A. reviewed the trial judge's instructions on the use that could be made of
the appellant's and J.U.'s prior statements, the objection of defence counsel
and the question from the jury.  He held that it was reasonable to conclude
that the jury did compare the accused's admission and his daughter's prior
inconsistent statement but continued (at p. 555): 

 

I think that it is also reasonable to assume that the
jury followed the trial judge's clear direction that the complainant's prior
inconsistent statement could not be used as proof of the truth of the
statement's contents.  The critical question is whether, in the circumstances,
the trial judge's instruction that the jury could compare the appellant's
confession with the complainant's prior inconsistent statement resulted in an
impermissible use being made of the complainant's statement.

 

Citing the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in B. (K.G.),
supra, Osborne J.A. observed that ""the rationale for the exclusion
of a prior inconsistent statement as evidence of the truth of its contents is
the rule against the admission of hearsay evidence"" (p. 556).  He noted,
however, that prior inconsistent statements can be admitted both on the issue
of the witness's credibility and when the fact that the statement is made is
otherwise relevant.  Osborne J.A. referred to the English decision in Mawaz
Khan v. R., [1967] 1 All E.R. 80 (P.C.), as an example of a case where the
similarity of out-of-court statements was used to draw non-hearsay inferences
about something other than credibility.  He distinguished the case of McFall
v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 321, by noting that in that case the jury had
been invited to use the statements of co-accused for their truth, not for the
fact that they were made.  Continuing, Osborne J.A. declared (at pp. 558-59):

The central question is did the fact that the
complainant made her statement (which she admitted in her trial evidence she
did make) constitute evidence which is capable of enhancing the likelihood that
the appellant's confession was true, notwithstanding his denial of its truth at
trial.

. . . Put another way, the fact that the complainant
said what she did in her statement adds value to the appellant's confession to
the police.  The comparison which the jury was invited to make would test the
coincidence which is evident from a consideration of the substance of both
statements.  This analysis does not depend on the truth of the complainant's
statement but rather on the fact that she made it.

 

Osborne J.A. also acknowledged that the same thought process could
support a finding that the complainant's statement was true, but held that this
was a closed avenue of analysis under the hearsay rule. 

 

14               Having
earlier rejected the appellant's claim that his statement had been improperly
admitted, Osborne J.A. dismissed the appeal.

 

(2)  Houlden J.A. (dissenting)

 

15               Houlden
J.A. dissented on the question of whether the jury should have been invited to
compare the complainant's and appellant's unadopted statements for the purpose
of assisting them in determining whether the appellant's statement was true. 
In his view, the most striking similarity between the two statements was the
similar assertion that the most recent sexual activity between the appellant
and J.U. had occurred on October 10.  Observing that the complainant's
unadopted statement would be admissible solely for assessing her credibility if
the appellant had not also made a statement, Houlden J.A. asked (at p. 544): 
""Does the fact that the appellant gave a statement to the police and that
that statement contains some details similar to those contained in the
complainant's statement lead to a different result?""  In his view, it did
not.  He held that the use of the statement sanctioned by the majority in
effect means that the truth of the statement is being assessed.  In his view,
the majority opinion would constitute a shift in the law (at p. 544): 

 

It is not at all uncommon, in my
experience, for a prior statement of a witness, which is denied by the witness
at the trial, to relate events that are similar to those contained in a
confession by the accused.  If the trial judge can charge a jury that they can
use the assertions in the prior inconsistent statement that are similar to
those contained in the confession, to prove  the truth of what is contained in
the confession, this constitutes a dramatic change in the law, and I know of no
authority for it.

 

In Houlden J.A.'s view, juries would not be able to resist using the
witness's unadopted statement for the truth of its contents.

 

16               Houlden
J.A. also held that s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  could
not be applied.  He disagreed with Osborne J.A.'s view that the jury would have
followed the trial judge's direction that they were not to use the
complainant's statement for its truth.  In his opinion (at p. 545):

 

Once the complainant's prior statement was used to
prove the truth of what was contained in the appellant's statement, the jury
were clearly using the statement to prove the truth of what was contained in
the complainant's statement.

 

17               Houlden
J.A. would have allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and ordered a new
trial.

 

IV. Grounds of Appeal

18               The
appellant, who appeals as of right based on the dissent in the Court of Appeal,
advances one ground of appeal, namely:

 

Did the Learned Trial Judge err in inviting the jury
to compare the complainant's unadopted prior inconsistent statement with the
Appellant's unadopted statement to the police in determining if the prosecution
had established guilt?

 

V. Analysis

 

19               This
case requires us to determine the permissible uses of a witness's prior
inconsistent statement when the witness is not the accused and is available for
cross-examination.  This Court recently addressed the same issue, against a
different factual background, in B. (K.G.), supra.  In a majority
opinion in that case, the orthodox rule regarding permissible uses of prior
inconsistent statements was modified to bring it in line with our approach to
hearsay outlined in Khan, supra, and Smith, supra. 
To resolve the issue here, I will review that approach, as well as the specific
rationale behind my decision in B. (K.G.).  That rationale is equally
appropriate here, given the particular circumstances of the case.

 

A.  The Court's Approach to Hearsay

 

20               Briefly
stated, Khan and Smith announced this Court's commitment to
ensure that the rule against the admission of hearsay as evidence would be
sufficiently flexible to adapt to new situations.  The hearsay rule and its
rigidly formulated exceptions had become a sometimes illogical and frequently
confusing series of pigeon-hole categories.  Khan and Smith
examined the principles underlying the hearsay rule to ensure that new
developments in the evidentiary treatment of hearsay would reflect those
tenets. 

 

21               
Khan, a case addressing the admissibility of a young child's statement
to her mother regarding a sexual assault, enunciated new criteria to be applied
generally when considering whether to admit hearsay evidence: reliability and
necessity (at p. 542).  These criteria reflect the concerns that hearsay is not
sufficiently reliable and its reliability cannot be tested, and the position
that first-hand evidence is always preferable.  McLachlin J. was careful to
state that neither of these criteria is characterized by absolute parameters. 
As the goal of our modifications of the principles governing hearsay has been
to end the rigid artifice of pigeon-hole exceptions, it is important that new
criteria remain flexible.  In Khan, McLachlin J. said that
""[n]ecessity for these purposes must be interpreted as `reasonably
necessary'"" (p. 546).  She dealt with reliability as follows (at p. 547):

 

Many considerations such as timing, demeanour, the
personality of the child, the intelligence and understanding of the child, and
the absence of any reason to expect fabrication in the statement may be
relevant on the issue of reliability.  I would not wish to draw up a strict
list of considerations for reliability, nor to suggest that certain categories
of evidence (for example the evidence of young children on sexual encounters)
should be always regarded as reliable. 

 

In Smith, supra, writing for a unanimous Court, I
confirmed that Khan had expressed the new broadly applicable approach to
assessing the admissibility of hearsay evidence (at p. 932):

 

. . . Khan should not be understood as turning
on its particular facts, but, instead, must be seen as a particular expression
of the fundamental principles that underlie the hearsay rule and the exceptions
to it.  What is important, in my view, is the departure signalled by Khan
from a view of hearsay characterized by a general prohibition on the reception
of such evidence, subject to a limited number of defined categorical
exceptions, and a movement towards an approach governed by the principles which
underlie the rule and its exceptions alike. 

 

My decision in B. (K.G.), as well as this ruling, are
applications of the Khan and Smith principles to the particular
branch of the hearsay rule which traditionally prevented the substantive
admission of witnesses' prior inconsistent statements.

 

B.  The Orthodox Rule Regarding Prior Inconsistent Statements

 

22               This
Court first adopted the rule that prior inconsistent statements are only
admissible to impeach credibility in Deacon v. The King, [1947] S.C.R.
531.   Rand J. expressed it thus (at pp. 537-38):

 

That such statements generally are
limited to credibility and cannot be used as evidence of the truth of the facts
to which they relate, is well established: Rex v. Dibble (1908),
1 Cr. A.R. 155, Rex v. Harris (1927), 20 Cr. A.R. 144, Rex
v. Francis & Barber, [1929] 3 D.L.R. 593.   It is quite true that it
may be difficult to dissociate the matters of such statements from the facts
brought before the jury by the witness and to nullify the influence they may
have on the minds of the jurors in dealing with the evidence as a whole; but
anything short of this would expose a person to a fabricated account of events,
too dangerous to risk.  But the whole field of cross-examination, in the
discretion of the court, is opened and the matters of the statement can thus be
brought within the test of the testimonial response of the witness.  This might
be taken as a reason for leaving all the facts, including the statement, to the
consideration of a jury, but the long experience of the courts is against it. 

 

As I emphasized in B. (K.G.), the orthodox rule regarding
prior inconsistent statements is a particular instance of the rule against
admitting hearsay.  Hearsay is inadmissible as evidence because its reliability
cannot be tested.

 

23               In
addition to impeaching credibility, under the orthodox rule a prior
inconsistent statement can be used if the fact that it was made has some
probative value in and of itself.  This ""non-hearsay"" use of what
would otherwise be hearsay was considered at length in R. v. Evans,
[1993] 3 S.C.R. 653.  In that case, statements made to witnesses that an
individual had a pregnant dog and was in the chain-link fencing business were
considered admissible.  Whether the statements were true was irrelevant; the
probative value came from the fact that the accused also had these
characteristics.  Sopinka J. stated (at pp. 662-63):

 

Quite apart from the truth of the contents, the
statements have some probative value on the issue of identity.  On the issue of
identity, the fact that certain representations are made is probative as it
narrows the identity of the declarant to the group of people who are in a
position to make similar representations . . . .

 

. . . The statement has probative value without
assuming the truth of the statement because the mere fact that it was made
tells us something relevant about the declarant that connects him to the
accused.

 

While Evans did not deal specifically with a prior
inconsistent statement, the rule it enunciates applies to all statements which
would be disallowed under the hearsay rule if tendered for the truth of their
contents. 

 

24               The
Crown in this case did not assert that the daughter's statement was admissible
for the truth of its contents on the basis of the B. (K.G.) modification
to the orthodox rule, which I will discuss below.  Accordingly, the case was
argued in this Court, as in the court below, under the orthodox rule.  The
Crown took the position that the trial judge's instruction to the jury to
compare the daughter's statement to the accused's did not require that the
daughter's statement be true.  The fact that the daughter made a statement with
certain striking similarities to her father's admission was asserted to be
probative on the issue of whether his statement was true, regardless of whether
her statement was true.  This reasoning was accepted by the majority of the
Court of Appeal (per Osborne J.A.), which stated (at p. 559):

 

When the appellant's admissions to a significant
degree mirror the allegations made by the complainant, as they did here,
it seems to me to follow that the fact that the appellant's confession was as
similar as it was to the complainant's allegations of sexual misconduct, is
evidence which increases the likelihood that the appellant's confession was
true.  Put another way, the fact that the complainant said what she did in her
statement adds value to the appellant's confession to the police.  The
comparison which the jury was invited to make would test the coincidence which
is evident from a consideration of the substance of both statements.  This
analysis does not depend on the truth of the complainant's statement but rather
on the fact that she made it.

 

 

I acknowledge that one could
resort to the same thought process to support a finding that the complainant's
statement was true.  That, however, is a closed avenue of analysis as the
complainant's statement is not admissible as proof of the truth of what she
said in it.  The hearsay rule forecloses that use of her prior inconsistent statement.
[Emphasis in original.] 

 

25               Under
this reasoning, the prior inconsistent statement, which according to the
hearsay rule cannot be relied upon for its truth, is used to bolster the
inference that the accused's admission is true.  However, with respect, it
seems obvious that if the admission is true, the prior inconsistent statement
must therefore also be true.  In other words, it is impossible to undertake the
chain of reasoning accepted by the majority in the court below without also
inferring that the daughter's prior inconsistent statement is true.  This was
precisely the basis of Houlden J.A.'s dissenting opinion. He stated (at p.
544):

 

Osborne J.A., while acknowledging
that the prior inconsistent statement of the complainant could not be used by
the jury to prove the truth of its contents, is of the opinion that it could be
used to prove the truth of what was contained in the appellant's statement. 
With respect, I do not agree.  By using the statement in that fashion, the
prior inconsistent statement of the complainant is, in effect, being used to
prove the truth of what is contained in the complainant's statement.

 

Referring to the chain of reasoning which Osborne J.A. had suggested
was permissible, he continued (at p. 544):

 

. . . when the members of the jury compare the two
statements, I do not believe that they will be able to prevent themselves from
travelling that prohibited avenue. 

 

26               With
respect to Osborne J.A., I am in agreement with Houlden J.A.'s assessment of
the chain of reasoning proposed by the majority.  The principle that a
statement which would be hearsay if tendered for the truth of its contents is
admissible for proof that it was made, provided that the fact it was made is
probative, remains valid.  Nonetheless, its application in this particular case
is inappropriate because every scenario in which the daughter's prior
inconsistent statement is probative leads necessarily to some inference about
whether it is true. 

 

27               Having
reached this conclusion however, with respect, I am not prepared to agree with
Houlden J.A.'s proposed resolution of the case.  As I detailed in my judgment
in B. (K.G.), supra, the orthodox rule against the substantive
use of prior inconsistent statements has been harshly criticized as
unnecessarily rigid in light of the evidentiary dangers against which the
hearsay rule aims to provide protection.  Before discussing how I apply the
rationale underlying B. (K.G.) to this case, I will briefly restate the
essential points of that judgment to emphasize their continued importance.

 

C.  The Rationale of the R. v. B. (K.G.) Decision

 

28               In
my majority decision in B. (K.G.), supra, I reviewed the history
and development of the orthodox rule against substantive use of prior
inconsistent statements, the hearsay rationale underlying the rule, and the
gradual erosion of the rule.  The objective of this review was to demonstrate
the logic of reforming the orthodox rule to make our treatment of witnesses'
prior inconsistent statements consistent with our rulings on hearsay in Khan,
supra, and Smith, supra.  These steps are equally
important in my analysis here and I will, therefore, recapitulate the essential
points.  The orthodox rule is a particular branch of the hearsay rule because
the dangers it aims to minimize are precisely those which the hearsay rule is
aimed at: the absence of an oath; the inability of the trier of fact to assess
the demeanour of the declarant as the statement is made; and the lack of
contemporaneous cross-examination.  Academic commentators have criticized the
orthodox rule primarily on the basis that the risks associated with hearsay are
ill-founded or non-existent when the recanting witness is on the stand.  

 

29               The
orthodox rule that prior inconsistent statements are not admissible for the
truth of their contents was first stated in Wright v. Beckett (1833), 1
M. & Rob. 414, 174 E.R. 143.  Challenges to it, on the basis that when a
witness is present to be cross-examined the trier of fact should be free to
decide which version of their story is preferable, date at least from Attorney
General v. Hitchcock (1847), 16 L.J. Ex. 259.  The rule was first adopted,
unanimously, by this Court in Deacon v. The King, supra.  The
only hint of dissension respecting the orthodox rule in Canada was contained in
the reasons of Estey J. in McInroy v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 588. 
While Estey J. rejected the orthodox rule on the narrow basis of the proper
interpretation of s. 9(2) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
E-10 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 ), he reviewed the hearsay rationale of the rule
and noted its weakness given that the declarant is on the stand available for
cross-examination.  Since McInroy, the orthodox rule was not challenged
directly in this Court in any case prior to  B. (K.G.).

 

30               In
my view, the most serious of the hearsay dangers is the absence of
contemporaneous cross-examination.  In B. (K.G.) the central question to
be answered was whether the absence of contemporaneous cross-examination was a
sufficient reason to exclude the statement from the jury as substantive
evidence.  I concluded that it was not.  I also noted that law reformers on the
bench, in legislatures, and on law reform commissions, have often sought to
modify the orthodox rule.  In particular, it has been abandoned in most
jurisdictions in the United States.

 

31               In
my analysis in B. (K.G.), I next proceeded to construct a reformed rule
concerning prior inconsistent statements based on the principles set down in Khan,
supra, and Smith, supra.  These cases established that the
traditional inflexible approach to the hearsay rule and its exceptions, which
relied on fitting different types of evidence into rigid categories or
pigeon-holes, was to be rejected in favour of an approach which would allow
evidence to be admitted and used substantively when it is shown to be reliable
and necessary (at p. 783):

 

I am of the view that evidence of
prior inconsistent statements of a witness other than an accused should be
substantively admissible on a principled basis, following this Court's
decisions in Khan and Smith.  However, it is clear that the
factors identified in those cases -- reliability and necessity -- must be
adapted and refined in this particular context, given the particular problems
raised by the nature of such statements. 

 

I concluded that when the reliability and necessity criteria were
met, prior inconsistent statements of witnesses other than the accused are
substantively admissible, provided that they would have been admissible as the
witness's sole testimony.  

 

32               While
the ultimate reliability of the statement and the weight to attach to it are to
be determined by the trier of fact, the judge will always be required to make a
threshold determination of reliability.  I suggested that the best way to
ensure reliability would be to ensure that the statement had been given under
oath, solemn affirmation or solemn declaration, made after a warning that the
witness would be amenable to prosecution for lying.  However, I clearly stated (at
p. 792):

 

. . . I do not wish to create technical categorical
requirements duplicating those of the old approach to hearsay evidence.  It
follows from Smith that there may be situations in which the trial judge
concludes that an appropriate substitute for the oath is established and that
notwithstanding the absence of an oath the statement is reliable.  Other
circumstances may serve to impress upon the witness the importance of telling
the truth, and in so doing provide a high degree of reliability to the
statement.  While these occasions may not be frequent, I do not foreclose the
possibility that they might arise under the principled approach to hearsay
evidence. 

 

I continued by stating that the objection regarding inability to
observe the witness making the prior statement is met when the earlier
statement is videotaped in its entirety.  I stated, however, that this
requirement was not absolute and that ""it may be possible that the
testimony of an independent third party who observes the making of the
statement in its entirety could, in exceptional circumstances, also provide the
requisite reliability with respect to demeanour evidence"" (p. 794). 
Finally, with regard to the most serious hearsay danger, the lack of
contemporaneous cross-examination, I held that this was the most easily
remedied of all dangers, given that the witness was on the stand at trial.

 

33               The
above considerations, confronting the dangers associated with hearsay evidence,
all contribute to ensuring the evidence is reliable.  The second factor guiding
admissibility of hearsay outlined in Khan and Smith is
necessity.  In the case of prior inconsistent statements, the evidence is
considered necessary because evidence of the same value could not otherwise be
obtained.

 

34               In
sum, I held in B. (K.G.) that the gravest danger associated with hearsay
evidence simply does not exist in the case of prior inconsistent statements
because the witness is available for cross-examination.  The other two dangers,
absence of an oath and absence of demeanour evidence, can be met through
appropriate police procedures and occasionally appropriate substitutes can be
found.  Finally, the prior statement is necessary evidence when a witness
recants.  The trial judge must make a threshold assessment of reliability at a voir
dire; however, the ultimate determinations of how reliable the prior inconsistent
statement is and what weight it should have remain with the trier of fact.

             

35               Khan
and Smith establish that hearsay evidence will be substantively
admissible when it is necessary and sufficiently reliable.  Those cases also
state that both necessity and reliability must be interpreted flexibly, taking
account of the circumstances of the case and ensuring that our new approach to
hearsay does not itself become a rigid pigeon-holing analysis.  My decision in B.
(K.G.) is an application of those principles to a particular branch of the
hearsay rule, the rule against the substantive admission of prior inconsistent
statements.  The primary distinction between B. (K.G.), on the one hand,
and Khan and Smith, on the other, is that in B. (K.G.) the
declarant is available for cross-examination.  This fact alone goes part of the
way to ensuring that the reliability criterion for admissibility is met.  The
case at bar differs from B. (K.G.) only in terms of available indicia of
reliability.  Necessity is met here in the same way it was met in B. (K.G.):
the prior statement is necessary because evidence of the same quality cannot be
obtained at trial.  For that reason, assessing the reliability of the prior
inconsistent statement at issue here is determinative.

 

D.  Assessing the Reliability of Prior Inconsistent Statements

 

(1)   The Reliability Risks

 

36               As
I discussed at length in B. (K.G.), there are primarily three concerns
about the reliability of hearsay: (i) it is not subject to contemporaneous
cross-examination; (ii) it is not given under oath; and (iii) the trier of fact
does not have an opportunity to observe the declarant making the statement.  In
B. (K.G.), I considered appropriate substitutes for the latter two
reliability concerns, in light of my conclusion that cross-examination of a
recanting witness at trial was an almost perfect substitute for contemporaneous
cross-examination.  I emphasize here that all three of these criteria,
together, go to the question of reliability.  

 

37               Criticism
of the orthodox rule against prior inconsistent statements has focused
primarily on the fact that the declarant is available at trial to be
cross-examined and absence of cross-examination is the most important risk
underlying the hearsay rule.  Wigmore links cross-examination to the theory underlying
the hearsay rule:

 

The fundamental test, shown by experience to be
invaluable, is the test of cross-examination.  The rule [against
hearsay], to be sure, calls for two elements, cross-examination proper, and
confrontation; but the former is the essential and indispensable feature, the
latter is only subordinate and dispensable.

 

1.  The theory of the hearsay rule
is that the many possible deficiencies, suppressions, sources of error and
untrustworthiness, which lie underneath the bare untested assertion of a
witness, may be best brought to light and exposed by the test of cross-examination
.... It is sufficient here to note that the hearsay rule, as accepted in our
law, signifies a rule rejecting assertions, offered testimonially, which
have not been in some way subjected to the test of cross-examination:

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

In the preceding passages, the testing required by the
hearsay rule is spoken of as cross-examination under oath.  But it is
clear beyond doubt that the oath, as thus referred to, is merely an incidental
feature customarily accompanying cross-examination, and that cross-examination
is the essential and real test required by the rule. [Emphasis in original.]

 

(Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 5 (Chadbourn Rev.
1974), §1362, at pp. 3 and 10.)

The importance of cross-examination to assuring that evidence which
would otherwise be hearsay is acceptable is also emphasized in the Law Reform
Commission of Canada's Report on Evidence (1975).  Commenting on the
recommendation that prior statements, both consistent and inconsistent, be
substantively admissible, the Report states (at p. 70):

 

. . . if a witness is on the stand and can be
cross-examined about a prior statement made by him, there is little reason not
to accord this statement the same status as one made by him on the witness
stand.  In many instances the prior statement will have been made under
circumstances that tend to render it more reliable than statements made by him
on the witness stand.  It might have been made when his memory of the event was
fresher, and before he was influenced by the parties or subsequent events.  In
any case if the prior statement is inconsistent with the witness' present
testimony, the witness will have the opportunity of denying it or explaining
the inconsistencies.  If the prior statement is consistent with the witness'
present testimony, the cross-examiner will be able to explore the circumstances
surrounding the making of the prior statement to reveal the weight that should
be given to it. 

 

38               When
a witness takes the stand at a trial and, under oath, gives a different version
of the story than one previously recorded, doubt is cast on the credibility of
the witness and on the truth of both versions of the story.  This is what
effective cross-examiners hope to achieve.  In discussing Rule 801(d)(1) of the
American Federal Rules of Evidence, which states that a prior inconsistent
statement given under oath and subject to cross-examination is not hearsay,
McCormick comments on the value of cross-examination in this situation:

 

The witness who has told one story aforetime and
another today has opened the gates to all the vistas of truth which the common
law practice of cross-examination and re-examination was invented to explore. 
The reasons for the change of face, whether forgetfulness, carelessness, pity,
terror, or greed, may be explored by the two questioners in the presence of the
trier of fact, under oath, casting light on which is the true story and which
the false.  It is hard to escape the view that evidence of a prior inconsistent 
statement, when declarant is on the stand to explain it if he can, has in high
degree the safeguards of examined testimony.  In addition, allowing it as
substantive evidence pays a further dividend in avoiding a limiting instruction
quite unlikely to be heeded by a jury.

 

(McCormick on Evidence (4th ed. 1992), at p.
120.)

 

39               Cross-examination
alone, therefore, goes a substantial part of the way to ensuring that the
reliability of a prior inconsistent statement can be adequately assessed by the
trier of fact.  In B. (K.G.), I wrote that prior inconsistent statements
subject to cross-examination, made under oath and videotaped would be
substantively admissible because each of the hearsay dangers would be addressed. 
I also, however, indicated that in certain particular circumstances a prior
inconsistent statement could be admitted even in the absence of an oath and a
video record, although not in the absence of cross-examination.  In my
assessment, this is one of the cases where there are sufficient circumstantial
guarantees of reliability that the statement of the complainant ought to have
been admitted for the truth of its contents.

 

(2)   Beyond B. (K.G.)

 

40               In
addition to the situations I described in B. (K.G.), a threshold of
reliability can sometimes be established, in cases where the witness is
available for cross-examination, by a striking similarity between two
statements.  When two statements contain similar assertions of fact, one of the
following must be true:

 

1.    The similarity is purely
coincidental.

2.    The similarity is the
result of collusion between the two declarants, before one or both of their
statements were made.

 

3.    The second declarant knew
of the contents of the first statement, and based his or her statement in whole
or in part on this knowledge.

 

4.    The similarity is due to
the influence of third parties, such as an interrogator, who affected the
contents of one or both of the statements.

 

5.    The similarity occurred
because the two declarants were both referring to an actual event -- that is,
they were both telling the truth.

 

The first four explanations are, of course, equally consistent with
the similar portions of the statement being true or false.  It becomes possible
to conclude that the similar portions of the statements are true only when it
can be established that none of the first four alternatives are likely, and
that the fifth option is thus the only likely explanation.  Consequently,
striking similarities between two statements will only enhance the likelihood
that either of the statements is reliable when there is a basis for rejecting
as unlikely all the alternative explanations.

 

41               In
order to eliminate, or at least substantially reduce, the likelihood of a
similarity between two statements arising through coincidence, the similar
factual assertion must be so striking that it is highly unlikely two people
would have independently fabricated it.  If the similarities between two
statements are not sufficiently striking, comparing them will not provide the
circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness necessary to meet the threshold
requirement of reliability since coincidence will not have been ruled out as an
explanation.  In some cases, the necessary degree of similarity will result
from the unique nature of particular factual assertions in both statements.  In
other situations, while there may not be any points of similarity that are
sufficiently striking to render coincidence unlikely when viewed standing
alone, it may be that the cumulative combination of similar points renders the
overall similarity between the two statements sufficiently distinctive to
reject coincidence as a likely explanation. 

 

42               In
general, it will only be possible to reject the possibility that the second
statement was tainted by outside influence or collusion if the statements were
made in circumstances providing sufficient guarantees against the possibility
of collusion by the declarants, prior knowledge of the first statement by the
second declarant, or influence by the interrogator or some other third party. 
In cases involving an accused's purely incriminatory statement, the prospect of
there having been collusion between the accused and the other declarant will
tend to be remote, unless there is evidence indicating that the accused had a
reason to conspire with a witness to falsely incriminate himself or herself. 
In other situations, however, it may not be possible to rule out the
possibility of collusion -- for example, an accused might make a statement that
is partly inculpatory and partly exculpatory and then attempt to argue that
similarities with a witness's exculpatory statement justify substantively
admitting the witness's statement. 

 

43               To
eliminate the possibility that the second declarant's statement was influenced
by prior knowledge of the first declarant's statement, there must ordinarily be
evidence that the two declarants did not have an opportunity for communication
prior to the making of the second statement, as well as evidence that the
second declarant did not have access to a record of the contents of the first
statement.  Similarly, to remove the possibility of suggestion by the
interrogator, it will generally be necessary to have evidence of how the
interviews were conducted -- whether the interrogator knew of the first
statement or asked leading questions, and so on.  If the second statement was
videotaped or audiotaped, there will ordinarily be sufficient evidence for a
judge or jury to determine if the similar portions of the statement were really
the product of the declarant's own mind rather than third party suggestion.  If
no taped record is available, the testimony of persons present during the
making of the second statement may suffice to eliminate the possibility of
similarities between the two statements at issue having arisen as a result of
outside suggestion.  

 

44               When
these circumstances exist in the case of a prior inconsistent statement being
compared to another statement which is already substantively admissible, and
when the declarant is available for cross-examination, the trial judge may rule
the prior inconsistent statement meets the threshold of reliability to be
substantively admissible.  The ultimate determination of whether the prior
inconsistent statement is credible or reliable as proof of its contents rests,
of course, with the trier of fact. 

 

45               I
anticipate that instances of statements so strikingly similar as to bolster
their reliability will be rare.  In keeping with our principled and flexible
approach to hearsay, other situations may arise where prior inconsistent
statements will be judged substantively admissible, bearing in mind that
cross-examination alone provides significant indications of reliability.  It is
not necessary in this case to decide if cross-examination alone provides an
adequate assurance of threshold reliability to allow substantive admission of
prior inconsistent statements.

 

E.  The Voir Dire

 

46               I
set out the proper procedure for the voir dire in my reasons in B. (K.G.),
at pp. 799-804.  After the calling party invokes s. 9  of the Canada Evidence
Act , and fulfils its requirements in the voir dire held under that
section, the party must then state its objectives in tendering the statement. 
If the statement will only be used to impeach the witness, the inquiry ends at
this point.  If, however, the calling party wishes to make substantive use of
the statement, the voir dire must continue so that the trial judge can
assess whether a threshold of reliability has been met.  The necessity
criterion need not be assessed as it is met whenever a witness recants.  The
first factor contributing to reliability is the cross-examination of the
witness.  If the witness provides an explanation for changing his or her story,
the trier of fact will be able to assess both versions of the story, as well as
the explanation.  However, where a witness does not recall making an earlier
statement, or refuses to answer questions, the trial judge should take into account
that this may impede the jury's ability to assess the ultimate reliability of
the statement.  

 

47               If
the additional indicia of reliability I specified in B. (K.G.) are
present, an oath or affirmation following a warning of penal consequences for
lying, and a videotape of the statement, the reliability assessment can be
relatively easily made.  If the reliability criterion is to be met, in rare
cases, by the striking similarity between the statement being assessed and
another statement which is already clearly substantively admissible, the trial
judge must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there are striking
similarities between the two statements, and that there was neither reason nor
opportunity for the declarants to collude and no improper influence by
interrogators or other third parties.  

 

48               At
this stage, the trial judge need only be convinced on a balance of probabilities
that the statement is likely to be reliable, as this is the normal burden of
proof resting upon a party seeking to admit evidence.  The trial judge must
also ascertain at this stage that the prior statement relates evidence which
would be admissible as the witness's sole testimony.

 

49               I
would also highlight here the proviso I specified in B. (K.G.) that the
trial judge must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the
statement was not the product of coercion of any form, whether involving
threats, promises, excessively leading questions by the investigator or other
person in a position of authority, or other forms of investigatory misconduct.

 

50               The
trial judge at this stage is not making a final determination about the
ultimate reliability and credibility of the statement.  The trial judge need
not be satisfied that the prior statement is true and should be believed in
preference to the witness's current testimony.    

51               If
the trial judge determines that the statement meets the threshold reliability
criterion and is thus substantively admissible, he or she must direct the trier
of fact to follow a two-step process in evaluating the evidence.  The trier of
fact must first be certain that the statement which is being used as a
reliability referent was made, without taking into account the prior
inconsistent statement under consideration.  Once the trier of fact is satisfied
that the other statement was made, the trier of fact may compare the
similarities between the two statements and, if they are sufficiently striking
that it is unlikely that two people would have independently fabricated them,
the trier of fact may draw conclusions from that comparison about the truth of
the statements.

 

52               Finally,
where the trial judge finds that the statement is not sufficiently reliable to
be used substantively, it may still, of course, be used to impeach credibility
or for the fact that it was made.  In other words, the orthodox rule will still
apply if the minimum reliability threshold is not met.

 

F.  Application to This Appeal

 

53               In
this case, the recanting witness was cross-examined in detail about her reasons
for changing her story at a preliminary inquiry, on a voir dire under s.
9  of the Canada Evidence Act , and before the jury.  She provided a
comprehensive explanation for changing her story which could be assessed by
both the trial judge and the jury and therefore eliminates the most important
danger of hearsay evidence.  The statements made by the accused and by his
daughter contained both a significant number of similarities in detail and the
strikingly similar assertion that the most recent sexual contact between the
two had been the previous evening.  As a voir dire was also held with
regard to the accused's statement, there was also sufficient evidence presented
to found a conclusion that the accused and his daughter had neither a reason
nor an opportunity to collude, and that the accused was not improperly
influenced by the police officers who took his statement.  On the basis of all
these factors, I conclude that her statement was, therefore, substantively
admissible at trial.

 

54               The
jury was not, of course, instructed in accordance with the procedures I have
set out here.  Nonetheless, the statements in question are so strikingly
similar that I am satisfied that had the instruction been given, the jury would
inevitably have been satisfied as to their reliability on the basis which I
have outlined above.  In these circumstances, the absence of a specific
instruction in this regard did not occasion any wrong or miscarriage of
justice. The objection that the jury instructions left open the possibility
that the daughter's statement would be used for the truth of its contents does
not arise given my conclusion that the statement was substantively admissible.

 

55               Accordingly,
I would dismiss the appeal. 

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

56               L'Heureux-Dubé J. -- The appellant was
charged with having committed a number of sexual offences against his daughter,
the complainant.  He was tried before a judge and jury and convicted of one
count of incest and two counts of sexual touching.  He was sentenced to two years
less a day of incarceration, and to a period of probation.  The appellant
appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, a majority of which (Houlden J.A.
dissenting) dismissed the appeal: (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 541, 72 O.A.C. 117, 32
C.R. (4th) 378.  It is from this decision that the appellant appeals to this
Court as of right.

 

57                      As
the Chief Justice points out, the sole ground of appeal raised by the appellant
concerns a prior inconsistent statement made by the complainant to the police. 
Prior to trial, the complainant told the police that the appellant had, since
mid-December 1987, regularly engaged in a variety of sexual acts with her.  In
her statement, she described these acts and when they had occurred.  These descriptions
were similar to those contained in a confession the appellant made to the
police following his arrest.  At trial, the complainant acknowledged making her
pre-trial statement, but testified that these allegations concerning the
relevant sexual encounters were false.  Similarly, the appellant acknowledged
making most of the statements attributed to him by police.  However, he too
testified that his statements regarding the relevant sexual encounters were
false.  Specifically, he claimed to have made them up due to his fear of the
police.

 

58                      The
question raised on this appeal is twofold.  First, was the complainant's prior
inconsistent statement admissible for the purpose of comparison with the
appellant's unadopted confession in order to determine whether the unadopted
confession was to be believed?  Second, did the charge to the jury adequately
explain the use which could be made of the complainant's prior inconsistent
statement? 

 

59                      As
regards the first issue, I agree with the Chief Justice that, in the case at
hand, the complainant's prior inconsistent statement was admissible for the
purpose of comparison with the appellant's confession.  However, unlike my
colleague, I do not believe that the similarities between the two statements
must be ""striking"" before the jury can be permitted to use the prior
inconsistent statement for this purpose.  In my view, so long as there are
significant similarities between the two statements, as there clearly were in
this case, a witness's prior inconsistent statement will be admissible for
purposes of comparison with an accused's unadopted confession in order to
assess the truth of that confession.  In this respect, I adopt the following
statement by Osborne J.A. at the Court of Appeal (at p. 559 C.C.C.):

 

The
appellant's confession and the complainant's statement concerned the same
events.  They were made separately, in circumstances which militated against
joint fabrication.  Each statement referred to relevant, and personal, events
in generally similar terms.  Both statements referred to two incidents of
non-sexual assault.  Both statements referred to sexual intercourse having
taken place on the night before the statements were made.  In the
circumstances, only the appellant and the complainant would have had knowledge
of the relevant events.  When the appellant's admissions to a significant
degree mirror the allegations made by the complainant, as they did here,
it seems to me to follow that the fact that the appellant's confession was as
similar as it was to the complainant's allegations of sexual misconduct, is
evidence which increases the likelihood that the appellant's confession was
true.  Put another way, the fact that the complainant said what she did in
her statement adds value to the appellant's confession to the police.  The
comparison which the jury was invited to make would test the coincidence which
is evident from a consideration of the substance of both statements.  This
analysis does not depend on the truth of the complainant's statement but rather
on the fact that she made it.  [Underlining added; italics in original.]

 

60                      As to the second issue raised
by this appeal, the adequacy of the jury charge, I agree with the Chief Justice
that the trial judge adequately instructed the jury concerning the use it could
make of the complainant's prior inconsistent statement and would, accordingly,
dispose of the appeal as suggested by the Chief Justice.

Appeal dismissed.

J. ‑‑ The only ground in
this appeal is based on alleged error in the charge to the jury with respect to

                   In giving their evidence, the
psychiatrists called by the defence did not particularize the statements from
the accused, on which they relied in order to arrive at their opinions.  Such
statements as were specifically referred to were properly characterized as
hearsay in that they consisted of statements by the accused as to his past
state of mind at the time of the offence.  These were not statements from which
the experts inferred the accused's state of mind.  Moreover, we are not
satisfied that the statements meet the criteria of R. v. Khan, [1990] 2

                   In the circumstances, the

considered in determining the weight to be given to the evidence of the
experts.

I.                 Introduction

 

                   On December 8,
1993, this Court handed down judgment from the bench in this case: [1993] 4
S.C.R. 834.  However, we reserved the right to hand down additional reasons as
regards the procedure to be followed when a trial judge rules that there is no
evidence upon which a jury properly instructed may convict and so allows a
motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.  This stems from the fact that it
is with great reluctance that the jury finally acceded to the trial judge's
directions to enter a verdict of not guilty.

 

                   In the 15 years I
have been on this Court, this is the first opportunity we have had to address
the issue under circumstances that clearly reveal that there is understandably
a reluctance on the part of jurors to hand down a verdict with which some, if
not all of them, disagree.  Although this is the first case to come before this
Court, I have as a trial judge had personal knowledge and thereafter taken
judicial notice of the fact that the problem exists.  In addition, the Director
of Appeals and Criminal Law Policy for Alberta submitted the following
statement to this Court:  ""A number of our prosecutors can recall
instances where despite being directed to bring in a verdict of acquittal, the
jury has nevertheless returned verdicts of guilty.""  I do not think it
necessary or wise to wait for this Court to be asked to rule on a case where
the jurors resisted the judge's instructions and a mistrial thereby resulted.

 

                   We therefore
invited the parties to make written submissions on this issue, which, I may
say, they very helpfully did.

 

 

II.                The Facts

 

                   In the case at bar,
the trial judge directed the jury to acquit the accused: 

 

                   Since
the accused have been placed in your hands, it is not for me to acquit them. 
It is for you to do so.  I told you at the beginning of the case you would have
to take your law from me.  It was not expected that you would take it in quite
the straight forward and simple way in which I am going to direct you, but it
is still in principle true, and I tell you as a matter of law that these
accused are entitled to your verdict of not guilty for the reason I have just
mentioned.  I must therefore ask you to retire to your jury room to elect a
foreperson to present your verdict and to return to the courtroom with a
verdict finding each of the accused not guilty of the charges.

 

                   The jury left the
courtroom at 3:05 p.m. and returned at 3:26 p.m.  The registrar asked the
members of the jury whether they had agreed upon their verdict and the
following exchange took place:

 

                   THE
FOREPERSON:  We have, your honour, but there are a number of questions that
some of the jurors have and we would like permission to have some of them
answered, if the court so wishes.

 

                   THE
COURT:  If the jury have questions before rendering their verdict, we do the
best we can to answer them.  If they are necessary prior to your having reached
a verdict to have these answered, then we should deal with them now.  If they
are questions that are not pertinent to the verdict, then we should have the
verdict first and we can have a discussion if you wish afterwards, but if
they're pertinent to the verdict then we'd better deal with them now.

 

                   THE
FOREPERSON:  Could I have a moment?

 

                   THE
COURT:  Certainly.

 

---
Discussion among the jury sotto voce.

 

                   A
JUROR:  I don't think all of us think that it's not guilty.  Sorry.  Some of us
still believe a guilty verdict should go through.

 

                   THE
COURT:  Well, I have to explain again that it's a question that, you are the
judges of the facts, but I'm the judge of the law, and as a result of legal
argument that we have had here I have had to instruct you as a matter of law
the Crown has not established a case for guilt here because they have not
established that which they set out to establish; the only thing of which these
accused could be convicted is exactly what the Crown charged, and they have not
established the essential elements of that in law.  So whatever the facts may
be, whatever it may appear, if the Crown has not established what they charged
then the accused are entitled to be acquitted.

 

                   If
my law is wrong, the Court of Appeal will correct me and there will be a
retrial.  If my law is right, then I'm right.  That's a question to be decided
in another forum on another day.  But for today, as a matter of law, the Crown
has not proved a case upon which you can bring in a verdict of guilty.

 

                   A
JUROR:  I think there's a general feeling at the moment, in a way it's been a
bit of a waste.  It feels that we've spent almost four weeks and it all ends
like this, without us being able to make a decision.

 

                   THE
COURT:  I'm certainly prepared to discuss that with you, although I don't know
if that has to do with the verdict, so perhaps we should deal with that
afterwards.

 

                   A
JUROR:  All right.

 

                   THE
FOREPERSON:  Your honour, we find the accused not guilty of the charges.

 

                   THE
REGISTRAR:  Members of the jury, harken to your verdict as the court hath
recorded it.  You find the accused not guilty.  So say you all?

 

                   Thank
you.

 

                   THE
COURT:  Thank you, members of the jury.

 

III.               Analysis

 

(1)               The Issue

 

                   The issue here is
the proper procedure to be followed by a trial judge sitting with a jury when
satisfied on a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.  Is the judge
required to instruct the jury to deliberate and return a verdict of not guilty
or may the judge discharge the jury and enter the acquittal him- or herself?

                   

(2)               The Current
Position

 

                   A directed verdict
is not a creature of statute but rather of the common law.  Although the
appropriate test for a directed verdict has been the source of great
controversy, the actual procedure a judge should follow once he or she
has decided to direct the jury to bring in an acquittal has been relatively
uncontroversial: 

 

Where
there is a jury present, the proper practice is for the judge, upon finding
that there is no evidence to go before a jury, to direct the jury to acquit and
discharge the accused.  A judge who instead withdraws the case from the jury
errs in so doing.

 

(Law
Reform Commission of Canada, Working Paper 63, Double Jeopardy, Pleas and
Verdicts (1991), at pp. 38-39.)

 

The common law authority for this
proposition is generally traced to Walker v. The King, [1939] S.C.R.
214, at pp. 216-17:

 

                   The
proper practice, where the trial judge decides that there is no evidence to go
to the jury in the well understood meaning of those words, is to direct the
jury to acquit and discharge the accused.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

It
is to be observed that the question with which the trial judge was dealing was
a question of law alone, a question upon which it was the duty of the jury to
act under his direction; their duty, in other words, to render a verdict of not
guilty upon a direction given by him. . . .

 

                   In R. v. Steele
(1939), 73 C.C.C. 147, the Prince Edward Island Supreme Court considered an
appeal expressed as follows (at p. 148):

 

...
that the learned trial Judge improperly withdrew the case from the jury and
discharged the prisoner on the ground that there was no evidence of a crime to
go to the jury and that the learned trial Judge erred in discharging the
prisoner without a verdict of the jury whose ""true deliverance""
between our Sovereign Lord the King and such prisoner had been committed to
them.

 

The Prince Edward Island Supreme Court
explicitly relied on Walker and concluded that the trial judge had
erred.

 

                   In R. v. Jans
(1946), 87 C.C.C. 76, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal also concluded that a
trial judge should not withdraw the case from the jury instead of instructing
the jury to bring in a verdict of not guilty.

 

                   More recently, in R.
v. Boyer, [1969] 1 C.C.C. 106, at p. 111, the British Columbia Court of
Appeal relied on this case law:

 

                   The
proper practice where the trial Judge decides that there is no evidence
to go to the jury in the well-understood meaning of those words is to direct
the jury to acquit and discharge the accused: Walker v. The King, 71
C.C.C. 305, [1939] 2 D.L.R. 353, [1939] S.C.R. 214.  The jury alone can acquit
an accused and, if the Judge withdraws the case from the jury and himself
discharges the prisoner without the verdict of the jury, there must be a new
trial: R. v. Steele, 73 C.C.C. 147, [1940] 1 D.L.R. 779, 14 M.P.R. 321.
[Emphasis in original.]

                   

Leave to appeal in Boyer was denied
by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1969, [1969] S.C.R. vii.

 

                   The common theme in
the case law is that a trial judge commits an error if he or she withdraws the
case from the jury and enters an acquittal him- or herself rather than
directing the jury to bring in a verdict of not guilty.

 

 

 

(3)               The Case for
Reform

 

                   The Law Reform
Commission of Canada has recommended that the procedure prescribed in the
common law be modified.  In Working Paper 27, The Jury in Criminal Trials
(1980), the Law Reform Commission recommended at p. 145:

 

                   24.1.  At the conclusion of the
prosecution's case, if the judge rules, either on the motion of a defendant or
on the court's own motion, that there is no evidence to sustain a conviction of
one or more offences charged, the judge shall order the entry of a judgment of
acquittal.  Such a motion by the defendant, if dismissed, shall not bar the
defendant from offering evidence.

 

The Law Reform Commission explained at
p. 146 that ""it is recommended that if a motion for a directed verdict is
granted that the judge simply order a judgment of acquittal.  Under the present
practice he must direct the jury to return a verdict of acquittal.  This would
appear to be a needless formality"".

 

                   In Working Paper 63,
Double Jeopardy, Pleas and Verdicts, supra, the Law Reform
Commission recommended at p. 94:

 

35. ...

 

                   (2)
Where satisfied that there is no evidence of the crime charged, the judge
should enter a verdict of not guilty.

 

The Law Reform Commission recognized,
at p. 94, that:

 

                   ...
this test does propose a change to the present law.  It proposes that on a jury
trial, where there is no evidence of the crime charged, the judge, instead of
directing the jury to acquit the accused, should discharge the jury and enter a
verdict of not guilty.  In this way, the judge is not obligated to delay
proceedings by awaiting the jury's decision, nor is the risk run that the jury
will disregard the judge's direction.

 

                   I think that these
Law Reform Commission recommendations make sense for a number of reasons.

 

                   (i)    Common
law status of directed verdicts and the Criminal Code 

 

                   Section 672  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , preserves the common law respecting the
conduct of trials by jury except in so far as the common law is inconsistent
with the Criminal Code :

 

   672. 
Nothing in this Act alters, abridges or affects any power or authority that a
court or judge had immediately before April 1, 1955, or any practice or form
that existed immediately before April 1, 1955, with respect to trials by jury,
jury process, juries or jurors, except where the power or authority, practice
or form is expressly altered by or is inconsistent with this Act.

 

                   Prior to 1955, the
courts had the authority to establish procedures for directed verdicts of acquittal. 
The proposed exercise of that authority (i.e., reforming the procedure as
proposed) is consistent with the Criminal Code .  Therefore, it is open
to this Court to adopt the proposed reform and modify the common law rule
concerning the procedure for directed verdicts of acquittal.

 

(ii)The
original justification for the traditional procedure is not relevant to the
proposed procedural reform

 

                   It seems likely
that the original justification for the traditional procedure for directed
verdicts was the prevention of abuses of the judges' authority to discharge
juries.  The traditional procedure was adopted, in part, to prevent a judge
from discharging a jury to preserve a faltering prosecution and to prevent an
accused from obtaining an acquittal.

 

                   This original
justification was explored in R. v. Charlesworth (1861), 31 L.J.M.C.
25.  Cockburn C.J. described the abuses at p. 30:

 

...
both at the Old Bailey and on the circuits it was the habit and practice of the
Judges, in cases where the prosecution appeared about to break down from
failure of proof, to discharge the jury, in order that an opportunity might be
afforded of supplying the deficiency. ... this practice of discharging juries
for the purpose of furthering the administration of justice and preventing its
frustration was converted into an engine of party and political oppression. . .
.

 

Similarly, Crompton J. said, at p. 38,
that:

 

...
what was complained of as mischievous in the practice adopted in the earlier
times was its abuse -- in the time of Charles the Second, and probably before
that, the practice was an abuse of the former practice of discharging juries
when it became necessary -- and that there was not any doubt what the result
would be, if this improper discharge took place.  I look at the proceedings in
the case of Fenwick and Whitbread (where this practice of discharging
juries was used in so odious and dangerous and unconstitutional a manner that
it cannot be too strongly reprobated), as having been taken for the very
purpose of having the prisoners tried afresh; inasmuch as the Judges knew that,
if they discharged the jury, a man had not the benefit of an acquittal, and
that, therefore, he was liable to be tried again.

 

                   Blackburn J. summed
up the abuse and the response to the abuse, at pp. 43-44:

 

Before
the Revolution it certainly was the practice to discharge a jury, whenever the
Judge thought the interests of justice required it, in order that there might
be a second trial. ... After the Revolution no alteration was made, by the Bill
of Rights or any other act, in the law or practice as to criminal trials; but
the practice was changed.  The reaction against the old abuses was great.

 

                   However, this
original justification is not relevant to the proposed procedural reform. 
First, judicial abuses of authority can now be protected against and corrected
by the rights of appeal set out in the Criminal Code  and by appeals
based upon claims of Charter  rights violations or abuse of process. 
Second, the proposed procedural reform involves no prejudice to the accused
since it gives the judge the authority to remove the case from the jury and enter
an acquittal.  That is, it does not give a judge the authority to remove
the case from the jury and leave the accused vulnerable to another trial for
the same offence (of course a new trial might still be ordered if the acquittal
is overturned on appeal).  Therefore, while concerns about judicial abuses of
authority may have originally justified the procedure they do not present any
obstacle to reforming the procedure now.

 

(iii)               Avoidance
of unnecessary delay and needless formality

 

                   Requiring the trial
judge, the counsel, the court staff, the accused, and everyone else involved to
wait for the jury to retire, elect a foreperson, discuss the case amongst
themselves, and return with a predetermined verdict results in unnecessary
delay and needless formality in the administration of justice.  This
unnecessary delay and needless formality flies in the face of the legal maxim
""lex neminem cogit ad vana seu inutilia"" -- ""the law
constrains no man to do that which is vain or futile"" (Wills & Sons
v. McSherry, [1913] 1 K.B. 20, at p. 25, and Bremer Handelsgesellschaft
m.b.H. v. Vanden Avenne-Izegem P.V.B.A., [1977] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 133 (Q.B.
(Com. Ct.)), at p. 160).

 

(iv)              Reduction
of jury frustration

 

                   The frustration
caused by the traditional procedure is evident upon the record in the case at
bar.  The jury members were understandably upset at having sat through a
lengthy trial only to be told that they were obliged to return the verdict the
trial judge told them to return no matter what their opinion on the case.  Any
directed verdict procedure will inevitably carry with it an element of
frustration for the jury and that is unfortunate but unavoidable.  However, it
seems to add insult to injury to force the jury to bring back a verdict that
they have not arrived at themselves.  I believe that the frustration would be
lessened by the actual removal of the decision from them rather than the
artificial retention of it by them.

 

(v)               Reduction
of the risk of jury ""disobedience""

 

                   With the current
system, there is the risk that a jury will simply refuse to enter the verdict
directed by the trial judge.  It is not clear what response a trial judge would
take in the face of such ""disobedience"".  However, it is clear that the
inevitable result would be an increased burden on the administration of justice
(i.e., appeals).  This risk can be reduced by removing the case from the jury
entirely.

 

(vi)              Preservation
of jury independence

 

                   Having the trial
judge withdraw the case from the jury and enter the verdict him- or herself
leaves intact the notion of the independent jury.  Jury members are supposed to
make up their own minds about the guilt or innocence of the accused.  It makes
a mockery of this independence to allow the trial judge to direct the jury to
find the accused not guilty.

 

(vii)Preservation
of the division of responsibilities between judge and jury

 

                   In a trial by jury,
it is the judge's responsibility to decide questions of law and it is the
jury's responsibility to decide questions of fact.  The jury must weigh the
evidence placed before it.  However, in cases in which there is no
evidence, then there is nothing for the jury to weigh and there are no
questions of fact.  In such cases, the judge must decide the question of law
and determine that, as a matter of law, the accused must be acquitted. 
Otherwise the dividing line between the responsibilities of judge and jury will
be blurred.

 

(viii)             Conclusion

 

                   There is no
statutory bar to reforming the traditional procedure for directed verdicts of
acquittal.  The original justification for the traditional procedure is not
relevant to the proposed procedural reform.  There are considerable policy
justifications for reforming the procedure.  I therefore conclude that the
traditional procedure for directed verdicts of acquittal should be reformed.

 

(4)               Caveats

 

 

(i)                United
States of America v. Shephard

 

                   The Attorney
General of Canada raised some concerns about the implications of the proposed
procedural reform for the test for a directed verdict set out in United
States of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067 (i.e., that there must
be no evidence of an essential element of the offence charged). 
However, nothing that I have said in these reasons alters the test for a
directed verdict set out in United States of America v. Shephard.  These
reasons are simply about the procedure that should be followed once that
test has been passed.

 

(ii)               Section
676(1) (a) of the Criminal Code 

 

                   The Attorney
General of Nova Scotia raised some concerns about the implications of the
proposed procedural reform for the right of the Attorney General to appeal to a
court of appeal under s. 676  of the Criminal Code :

 

                   676. (1)  The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

 

(a)
against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by
indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone;

 

                   He submitted that
the traditional interpretation of ""trial court"" is ""the
jury"", but that ""trial court"" in s. 676(1) (a) should be
interpreted as ""the jury"" or ""the judge alone"".  This will
ensure that the Attorney General continues to have a right to appeal to a court
of appeal from a directed verdict of acquittal.

 

                   Indeed, for the
purposes of a directed verdict of acquittal entered by a judge following
removal of a case from the jury, ""trial court"" in s. 676(1) (a)
should be interpreted as ""the judge alone"".

 

(iii)
              Section 606(4)  of the Criminal Code 

 

                   The appellants
asked this Court to turn its attention to the issue of the proper procedure to
be followed in cases where the accused enters a plea under s. 606(4)  of the Criminal
Code :

 

606. . . .

 

                   (4)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, where an accused or defendant
pleads not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of any other offence
arising out of the same transaction, whether or not it is an included offence,
the court may, with the consent of the prosecutor, accept that plea of guilty
and, if the plea is accepted, the court shall find the accused or defendant not
guilty of the offence charged and find him guilty of the offence in respect of
which the plea of guilty was accepted and enter those findings in the record of
the court.

 

This issue is collateral to the case
at bar.  However, since the appellants made submissions on the issue and since
the respondent agreed with the appellants' submissions, I see no need to wait
for a case squarely on this issue to be brought to this Court.  As I said
earlier in these reasons, we are dealing here with judge-made law and it is
open to us to reform that law.

 

                   The traditional
interpretation of ""court"" in s. 606(4)  is ""the jury"".  The
most recent reliance on this interpretation is found in R. v. Chrétien
(1989), 70 C.R. (3d) 43 (Que. C.A.).  However, the reasons outlined earlier as
reasons to change the common law procedure re directed verdicts of acquittal
are also reasons to change the common law interpretation of ""court""
in s. 606(4) .  Therefore, I conclude that ""court"", for directed
verdicts under s. 606(4) , should be interpreted as ""the judge
alone"".  The proper practice after an accused has been given in charge to
the jury and wishes to plead guilty with prosecutorial consent, is for the trial
judge, in the absence of the jury, to consider the appropriateness of the plea
and rule whether it is acceptable.  If the plea is acceptable, then the jury
may be discharged and the ""court"" (now consisting of the judge alone)
may record the verdict of not guilty to the offence charged and guilty to the
lesser offence admitted. 

 

(iv)Section
536  of the Criminal Code  and s. 11 (f) of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms 

 

536. . . .

 

                   (2)
Where an accused is before a justice charged with an offence, other than an
offence listed in section 469, and the offence is not one over which a
provincial court judge has absolute jurisdiction under section 553, the justice
shall, after the information has been read to the accused, put the accused to
his election in the following words:

 

You
have the option to elect to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury
and without having had a preliminary inquiry; or you may elect to have a
preliminary inquiry and to be tried by a judge without a jury; or you may elect
to have a preliminary inquiry and to be tried by a court composed of a judge
and jury.  If you do not elect now, you shall be deemed to have elected to have
a preliminary inquiry and to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. 
How do you elect to be tried?

 

 

 

                   11.  Any person charged with an offence
has the right

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(f)
except in the case of an offence under military law tried before a military
tribunal, to the benefit of trial by jury where the maximum punishment for the
offence is imprisonment for five years or a more severe punishment.

 

                   It might be argued
that the proposed procedural modification undercuts the accused's election to
be tried by a judge and jury under s. 536  of the Criminal Code  and the
accused's right to trial by jury under s. 11 (f) of the Charter . 
I should note that I find this argument unpersuasive.  The guarantee set out in
s. 11 (f) of the Charter  is to guarantee anyone accused of certain
more serious offences not to have their liberty, guaranteed under s. 7 ,
restricted as a result of a conviction unless by a court composed of a judge
and jury.  The power in issue here being limited to directing a verdict to the
advantage of the accused does not give rise to any such restriction.

 

 

IV.              Conclusion

 

                   I conclude that the
common law procedure with respect to directed verdicts should be modified -- in
instances where in the past the trial judge would have directed the jury to
return a particular verdict, the trial judge should now say ""as a matter
of law, I am withdrawing the case from you and I am entering the verdict I
would otherwise direct you to give as a matter of law"".

                   Sopinka
J. ‑‑ We
agree with the Chief Justice of Manitoba that in the circumstances the slip in
the charge to the jury amounted to a serious misdirection.  We are satisfied
with the requisite degree of certainty that, absent the error, the verdict
would not inevitably have been the same.

 

                   With respect to the
failure of the respondent to make timely disclosure, in R. v. Stinchcombe,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at p. 348, we stated:  "". . . when a
court of appeal is called upon to review a failure to disclose, it must
consider whether such failure impaired the right to make full answer and
defence"".  In our opinion, full disclosure had been made before the second
trial.  No application for a stay was made to the trial court on the
second trial.  The Court of Appeal therefore had no jurisdiction to order a
stay on this ground and we are in the same position.  This is a matter that
should be dealt with at trial and, if the failure to disclose impaired the
appellant's ability to make full answer and defence, this matter can be raised
in the new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal.

 

                   We agree with the
Court of Appeal that ordering a new trial in the circumstances of this case is
not one of those ""clearest of cases"" which would amount to an abuse
of process.

Charter of Rights and Freedoms , s. 10 (b).

 

                   The accused was
convicted of rape, gross indecency and attempted rape of three girls in 1982
and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment.  In 1986, while on parole, he
was charged with three counts of sexual assault with a weapon and three counts
of unlawful confinement.  His counsel obtained an order under s. 537(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code  remanding the accused into custody for observation
to assess his mental state.  The accused was examined by two psychiatrists and
one psychologist.  He was warned that whatever he told the psychiatrists could
be used against him and might be included in a report to the court.  He was not
specifically told, however, that what he said on the examination could be used
to assist in determining whether he was a dangerous offender.  One psychiatrist
told the accused that he had the right to refuse to answer questions and had
the right to consult counsel prior to answering any questions.  The accused
pleaded guilty to one count each of sexual assault and sexual assault with a
weapon.  During the dangerous offender proceedings that followed, the trial
judge held a voir dire to determine the admissibility of evidence from
the two psychiatrists and the psychologist.  He rejected defence counsel's
argument that admitting the evidence would violate the accused's rights under
s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  He declared the
accused to be a dangerous offender and gave him an indeterminate sentence.  The
Court of Appeal upheld the decision.

 

                   Held (Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory
and Major JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.:  Where there is psychiatric
evidence legally obtained pursuant to an order under s. 537(1)(b)
of the Code relevant to assessing the extent of an offender's
dangerousness, it should be admitted at the sentencing stage.  The results of
the psychiatric observation are not used to ""incriminate"" the accused
at his dangerous offender proceedings, since he has already been found guilty
of the offence with which he was charged.  Once guilt has been established, the
court places greater emphasis on the interests of society in developing a
sentence that is appropriate to the guilty party.  As with all sentencing, both
the public interest in safety and the general sentencing interest of developing
the most appropriate penalty for the particular offender dictate the greatest
possible range of information on which to make an accurate evaluation of the
danger posed by the offender.  Dangerous offender sentencing allows the justice
system to tailor more precisely the actual time served by the offender to the
threat that he poses to society.  The overriding aim is not the punishment of
the offender but the prevention of future violence through the imposition of an
indeterminate sentence.  An indeterminate sentence is not an unlimited
sentence:  the offender faces incarceration only for the period of time that he
poses a serious risk to the safety of society.  To deny the court access to the
earlier findings of the psychiatrists may hinder the effective determination of
the true risk posed by the offender.  While it is true that under s. 756
the court may remand the offender for observation for the purposes of gathering
evidence on his dangerous offender status, the offender may attempt to hide elements
of his character or refuse to answer the psychiatrists' questions.  As a
result, there is a real danger that evidence from the pre‑trial
psychiatric evaluation which is excluded may not surface in the post‑trial
phase.  While such an exclusion may be acceptable while the guilt of the
accused is in question, it cannot be justified after his guilt has been
established.

 

                   The accused's
rights under s. 10 (b) of the Charter  were not violated
during the psychiatric examinations.  Dangerous offender proceedings are part
of the sentencing process, and it is the duty of counsel to make an accused
aware of the possible sentence he will be facing as a result of being found
guilty of a particular crime.  Given the accused's past record, counsel should
have been aware that dangerous offender proceedings would likely be pursued by
the Crown.  The accused requested the tests and was made aware that his
statements could be used against him.  This general warning was sufficient. 
Further, the accused was not entitled to a second opportunity to exercise his
right to counsel.

 

                   Given that the
examinations of the accused were designed to provide an assessment of his
mental health, they fell within the parameters of the s. 537(1) (b)
order made by the trial judge.  The evidence so obtained is covered by
s. 755  and must be heard by the court on the dangerous offender
application if, in the opinion of the court, it is relevant.  It is admissible
under the Charter  and there is no basis for reading down s. 755 .

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory and
Major JJ. (dissenting):  Section 7  of the Charter  is engaged in
this case because of the serious limitation of liberty inherent in dangerous
offender proceedings.  This Court has recognized implicitly that the principle
against self‑incrimination is a principle of fundamental justice.  The
word ""incriminate"" in this context need not be equated with
""tending to prove guilt of a criminal offence"".  Even if dangerous
offender proceedings are characterized as part of the sentencing process rather
than as a separate proceeding with new penal consequences, the operation of the
principle against self‑incrimination is by no means excluded.

 

                   Under s. 755
of the Code, in dangerous offender proceedings ""the court shall
hear the evidence of at least two psychiatrists and all other evidence that, in
its opinion, is relevant"".  A broad interpretation of this section allows
evidence gathered from the accused during psychiatric observation ordered to
determine if the accused is or was mentally ill to be used for the purposes of
dangerous offender proceedings.  This allows for self‑incrimination and
is thus not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  It is
irrelevant that the accused in this case requested the order remanding him into
custody for observation.  The accused requested the order for purposes other
than a dangerous offender proceeding.  Furthermore, s. 537 does not
require the consent of the accused and therefore an order can be made under
this section for observation against the wishes of the accused.  This is
sufficient to constitute a limit on the s. 7  right to liberty.

 

                   The limitation on
the right to liberty arising on a broad interpretation of s. 755  is not
justified under s. 1  of the Charter .  While the objective of s. 755 ,
which is to protect society from dangerous offenders, is a pressing and
substantial concern in our society and is of sufficient importance to warrant
limiting a constitutionally protected right or freedom, the means chosen to
achieve this objective are unfair in the present case.  In order to benefit
from the protection afforded by the principles of fundamental justice to the
mentally ill against committal or an unfair trial, the accused should not be
forced into incriminating him or herself for dangerous offender proceedings. 
There is also more than minimal impairment of s. 7  here, since observation
may be ordered under s. 756 of the Code, which has safeguards for
the offender and therefore impairs the s. 7  rights less than
s. 537(1) (b).  A remand order under s. 756  can only be made once
the offender has been convicted, whereas a remand order under s. 537(1) (b)
can be made before conviction.  The presumption of constitutionality approach
to statutory interpretation dictates that s. 755  not be read as rendering
evidence gathered during psychiatric observation ordered under s. 537(1) (b)
admissible at dangerous offender proceedings.

I. Factual
Background

 

                        On
May 28, 1982, the appellant was convicted of rape, gross indecency and
attempted rape of three girls aged 10, 12 and 13.  He was sentenced to five
years' imprisonment.  He spent two years in a sex offender program at the
Regional Psychiatric Centre and was released on mandatory supervision in 1985. 


 

                        On
November 7, 1986, while on parole, the appellant was charged with three counts
of sexual assault with a weapon and three counts of unlawful confinement.  His
victims were 9, 14 and 26 years old.  The assaults on the nine-year-old girl
took place just one day after the appellant was asked for a photograph to be
used for the investigation of one of the other offences.

 

                        Prior
to election, the appellant's counsel requested and obtained an order from the
court pursuant to s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34 (which became s. 537(1) (b), R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and then was
repealed by S.C. 1991, c. 43, s. 9 (it will be referred to as s. 537(1) (b)
throughout these reasons)).  Under this section, the court is empowered to
remand an accused to such custody as the court directs for observation where
there is evidence and/or reason to believe that the accused may be mentally
ill.  The appellant's counsel requested the order for the following purposes:
to determine whether the accused was fit to stand trial; to determine whether
the accused was sane at the time of the offence; and to gain some insight into
the accused for the purpose of sentencing.  The order itself did not specify a
purpose.  It simply remanded the accused into custody for observation on the
grounds that there was, in the judge's opinion, reason to believe that the
accused may have been mentally ill.  

 

                        On
November 18, 1986, the appellant was remanded into custody for psychiatric observation. 
The appellant was examined by two psychiatrists and one psychologist at the
Forensic Psychiatric Institute.  The trial judge found, as a matter of fact,
that the accused was warned that whatever he told the psychiatrists could be
used against him and might be included in a report to the court.  However, he
was not specifically told that the examination during the 30-day remand at some
stage shifted its focus to include an opinion as to whether or not he was a
dangerous offender.  Nor was he told that what he said on the examination could
also be used for the purpose of a determination of whether he was a dangerous
offender.  One psychiatrist told the appellant that he had the right to refuse
to answer questions and had the right to consult counsel prior to answering any
questions.  The appellant indicated that he understood the warnings, cooperated
willingly, and indicated that it was not necessary to consult counsel.   

 

                        During
the first interview, the psychiatrist became concerned about the appellant's
potential for future violence.  The focus of the observation was therefore
broadened to include an inquiry as to whether the appellant was a dangerous
offender.  As a matter of fact, the trial judge found that there was no
deliberate deception of the accused.  Rather, this was a case in which the
defence counsel asked for a limited examination of the accused and the
psychiatrist, seeing cause for concern about the accused as a danger to
re-offend, pursued that inquiry without telling Jones about it specifically and
without referring it back to Jones' counsel.

 

                        The
appellant pleaded guilty to one count each of sexual assault and sexual assault
with a weapon.  Following his conviction, an inquiry was held to determine
whether he should be sentenced as a dangerous offender.  The trial judge held a
voir dire to determine the admissibility of evidence from the two
psychiatrists and the psychologist from the Forensic Psychiatric Institute. 
Counsel for the appellant challenged the admissibility of the evidence on the
grounds that, to admit the results of the pre-trial psychiatric examinations in
the dangerous offender proceedings without the consent of the accused and
without warning the accused at the time of the interviews that anything he said
might be used in dangerous offender proceedings was a violation of the
accused's rights under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .

 

II. Decisions
Below

 

                        On
April 29, 1988, the Supreme Court of British Columbia (Spencer J.) found the
appellant to be a dangerous offender: (1988), 6 W.C.B. (2d) 208.  On July 29,
1992, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Toy, Legg and Hinds JJ.A.)
dismissed the appeal: (1992), 16 B.C.A.C. 161, 28 W.A.C. 161, 75 C.C.C. (3d)
327, 11 C.R.R. (2d) 65.  On December 10, 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada (La
Forest, Sopinka and Cory JJ.) granted leave to appeal, [1992] 3 S.C.R., vi, and
on October 12, 1993, the appeal was heard by the Supreme Court of Canada.

 

A. Supreme
Court of British Columbia

 

                        First,
the trial judge found as a matter of fact that there was no deliberate
deception of the appellant:

 

... this is simply a case where the Defence asked for a
limited examination of the accused and where Dr. Lohrasbe seeing cause for
concern about the accused as a danger to re-offend, pursued that inquiry
without telling Jones about it specifically and without referring it back to
Jones' counsel.

 

                        The indicia of danger which has
been put before me on the voir dire in the psychiatrist's opinions, emerges in
the ordinary course of a consensual examination pursuant to s. 465, subsection
(c).

 

                        Second,
the trial judge rejected the defence argument that s. 7  of the Charter 
requires that no accused person who undergoes a pre-trial psychiatric
examination to determine his fitness to stand trial or his sanity at the time
of an alleged offence should have the contents of his interviews granted during
the examination tendered against him in dangerous offender proceedings without
his consent or unless he was warned at the time of the possibility of those
interviews being used in dangerous offender proceedings.

 

... it is my view that the Charter of Rights  and
Freedoms does not permit me as a trial judge to legislate restrictions on the
use to which evidence properly obtained under s. 456 (c) [sic] of the
Criminal Code  on a pre‑trial psychiatric examination, may be put in the
guise of protecting a constitutional right under s. 7 .  My function is to
determine what right exists under s. 7  and not to create one as if by
legislation.  The only right that I can find is one which is exemplified in s.
11 , subsection (c), that is, the right against self-incrimination.  In that
section, it is limited to those who are charged with an offence.  It might have
been a broader right under s. 7  extending to those who are no longer
technically charged with an offence but for the fact that the criminal law of
this country, at the highest level, in R. v. Wilband, has denied the
existence of any such right. 

 

... I have also found a case decided last year in the
Ontario Court of Appeal, Thomson Newspapers v. The Director of Investigation
and Research (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 145 decided in 1986, not 1987.  That
case stands for the proposition that the only rights against self-incrimination
now known to the law of Canada are those which are found in s. 11 , subsection
(c) and s. 13  of the Charter .  S. 13 , of course, has no application to the case
before me.  But that reinforces my view that there is no separate right
contained in s. 7 .  I note also the imprimatur of the Supreme Court of Canada
in the Big M Drug Mart case (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 385, that the Charter 
itself was not enacted in vacuum.  And I apply that in this case to tell me
that the Charter , ss. 7  and 11 , subsection (c) were enacted in the context of R.
v. Wilband which had already denied the existence of any right against
self-incrimination except with respect to persons charged with offences who
were speaking to people in authority.

 

The
trial judge concluded:

 

                        I make this final point; my
powers under the Charter  are limited.  I may declare legislation to be
unconstitutional -- and I am not asked to do that here -- or I may exclude
evidence under the provisions of s. 24 , subsection (2)  where it was obtained in
a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by the
Charter  and then only if the applicant proves, on the balance of probabilities,
that its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
In my opinion, as I have said, there is no right of the accused that has been
infringed here.  Rather, what is happening, is that evidence not unlawfully
obtained and highly relevant to an issue of great importance, both to the
accused and to the public interest, is being tendered in accordance with the
law.  To exclude it, I am invited to declare a limitation on s. 465 , subsection
(c) of the Criminal Code  and then to rule out the evidence as a breach of that
limitation.  I must decline to do that.  If it is thought necessary so to limit
the reach of s. 465, subsection (c) of the Code, that is a matter which ought
to be dealt with by legislation and not by a trial judge.

 

                        On
the basis of all of the evidence before him (including the evidence gathered
during the observation conducted under the s. 537(1) (b) remand order),
the trial judge concluded that there was a danger the appellant would commit
similar offences against girls or physically small women.  He concluded that
the appellant lacked the ability to prevent himself from committing assaults. 
He therefore declared the appellant to be a dangerous offender within the
meaning of s. 688(a)(i) and (ii) (now s. 753(a)(i) and (ii)) and
s. 688(b) (now s. 753(b)) of the Criminal Code  and gave
him an indeterminate sentence.

 

B.
British Columbia Court of Appeal (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 327 

 

                        Legg
J.A. considered whether there was a limitation of the appellant's right to
silence under s. 7  of the Charter  given the following circumstances of
the case: (1) the order made under s. 537(1) (b) was not restricted to an
assessment of whether the appellant was mentally ill at the time of the
offences for which he was charged or whether he was fit to stand trial but
rather encompassed an assessment of whether the appellant was mentally ill; (2)
the appellant had counsel; (3) with counsel's advice, the appellant agreed to
the psychiatric examinations; (4) the appellant was aware that what he said was
not protected by confidentiality and might be incorporated into a report to the
court; (5) the appellant spoke freely and openly to the doctors and did not
assert his right to silence; and (6) the doctors did not engage in any sort of
tricks to induce the appellant to speak to them.

 

                        Legg
J.A. concluded, at pp. 338-39, that the appellant's right to silence under s. 7 
was not limited. He quoted the following passage from the reasons of McLachlin
J. in R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at p. 180:

 

                        The Charter  through s. 7 
seeks to impose limits on the power of the state over the detained person.  It
thus seeks to effect a balance between the interests of the detained individual
and those of the state.  On the one hand s. 7  seeks to provide to a person
involved in the judicial process protection against the unfair use by the state
of its superior resources.  On the other, it maintains to the state the power
to deprive a person of life, liberty or security of person provided that it
respects fundamental principles of justice.  The balance is critical....

 

                        The right to silence conferred
by s. 7  reflects these values.  The suspect, although placed in the superior
power of the state upon detention, retains the right to choose whether or not
he will make a statement to the police.  To this end, the Charter 
requires that the suspect be informed of his or her right to counsel and be
permitted to consult counsel without delay.  If the suspect chooses to make a
statement, the suspect may do so.  But if the suspect chooses not to, the state
is not entitled to use its superior power to override the suspect's will and
negate his or her choice.

 

In the
case at bar, the state had the power to limit the appellant's liberty by
detaining him for the purpose of determining whether he was mentally ill.  This
intrusion was made with his consent.  Furthermore, although the doctors were
""agents of the state"", they were not undercover and they did not
resort to trickery to persuade the appellant to speak.  Rather, they warned him
that what he said could be used against him and he chose to speak with them. 
The ""critical balance"" referred to in Hebert was maintained
between the appellant's right to protection against the unfair use by the state
of its superior resources and the state's obligation to respect fundamental
principles of justice. 

 

                        The
Court of Appeal held that there was no breach of the appellant's s. 7  rights
and dismissed the appeal.

IV. Analysis

 

A. Introduction

 

                        The
appellant does not attack any particular section of the Code.  He
complains that his s. 7  Charter  rights were infringed when he was not
told that the examinations might be used for the purposes of dangerous offender
proceedings and that his s. 10 (b) rights were infringed when he was not
offered the right to counsel once the focus of the examination had been
expanded to include his future dangerousness.  In view of my conclusion in this
case, I find it necessary to discuss only the s. 7  issue.  

 

                        In
essence, the appellant's s. 7  argument is that the evidence obtained from the
s. 537 observation should not have been used, at least not without an explicit
warning, for the purposes of the dangerous offender proceedings.  As will
become apparent, I believe that the warning is irrelevant to the case at bar
and the issue is the admissibility of the evidence obtained from the s. 537(1) (b)
observation.

 

                        Section
755  (previously s. 690) relates to the admissibility of evidence at dangerous
offender proceedings and provides, as set out above, that ""the court shall
hear the evidence of at least two psychiatrists and all other evidence that, in
its opinion, is relevant..."".  In my opinion, while s. 755  was not
directly challenged, we must ask whether it was, in this case, interpreted and
applied in a way that offends s. 7  of the Charter  (specifically, the s.
7  right to no self-incrimination).

 

                        Slaight
Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, stands for the
proposition that this Court should not interpret legislation that is open to
more than one interpretation so as to make it inconsistent with the Charter 
and hence of no force or effect.  Legislation conferring an imprecise
discretion must therefore be interpreted as not allowing the Charter 
rights to be infringed. 

 

                        There
are two competing possible interpretations of s. 755 .   The first is that the
section renders evidence gathered during psychiatric observation ordered under
s. 537(1) (b) admissible for the purposes of dangerous offender
proceedings (hereinafter ""broad interpretation"").  The second is that
the section renders evidence gathered during psychiatric observation ordered
under s. 537(1) (b) inadmissible for the purposes of dangerous offender
proceedings (hereinafter ""narrow interpretation"").

 

                        If
one of these interpretations would result in a Charter  violation and the
other would not, then, of course, the latter should be adopted.  I therefore
move now to the Charter  analysis.

 

B. Section
7 of the Charter

 

    (1) Life,
liberty and security of the person

 

                        Section
7  of the Charter  establishes that everyone has the right to life,
liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  

 

                        Imprisonment
and the imminent threat of imprisonment are both clearly deprivations of
liberty (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, and R. v.
Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636).  Therefore, an individual may be
imprisoned or imminently threatened with imprisonment only in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice (unless the imprisonment or threat of
imprisonment is justified under s. 1  of the Charter ).

   

    (2) Principles
of fundamental justice

 

                        As
I said in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, at pp. 512-13:

 

                        The term ""principles of
fundamental justice"" is not a right, but a qualifier of the right not to
be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person; its function is to set
the parameters of that right.

 

                        Sections 8 to 14 address
specific deprivations of the ""right"" to life, liberty and security of
the person in breach of the principles of fundamental justice, and as such,
violations of s. 7 .  They are therefore illustrative of the meaning, in
criminal or penal law, of ""principles of fundamental justice""; they
represent principles which have been recognized by the common law, the
international conventions and by the very fact of entrenchment in the Charter ,
as essential elements of a system for the administration of justice which is
founded upon the belief in the dignity and worth of the human person and the
rule of law.

 

                        Consequently, the principles of
fundamental justice are to be found in the basic tenets and principles, not
only of our judicial process, but also of the other components of our legal
system.

 

                                                                        ...

 

                        Whether any given principle may
be said to be a principle of fundamental justice within the meaning of s. 7 
will rest upon an analysis of the nature, sources, rationale and
essential role of that principle within the judicial process and in our legal
system, as it evolves.

 

                        There
are two principles of fundamental justice involved in this analysis.  The first
is the principle against convicting a person who was insane at the time of the
offence and against proceeding against an accused who, on account of insanity,
is unfit to conduct her or his defence.  The second is the principle against
self-incrimination.  In this case, the accused, in order to take advantage of
the protection afforded by the first principle, was compelled to undergo a
period of psychiatric observation.  The results of this observation were then
used to incriminate him at the dangerous offender proceedings.

 

                        The
status of the first principle as a principle of fundamental justice I take to
be readily apparent.  As I said in R. v. Swain, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933, at
p. 977, ""it is a basic tenet of our legal system that a person who was
insane at the time of the offence ought not to be convicted"".  It is also
a basic tenet of our legal system that an individual who is mentally incapable
of understanding the action being taken against him or her should not be required
to stand trial.  

 

                        The
status of the principle against self-incrimination as a principle of
fundamental justice may not be so readily apparent.  Therefore, before
proceeding with the application of these principles to the case at bar, I will
first review the definition, rationale, and current status of the principle
against self-incrimination (I will not review the history of this principle
because that was thoroughly done by Wilson J. in Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v.
Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices
Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425). 

 

                        At
the outset, however, I emphasize two points. The first is that s. 7  is engaged
in this case because of the serious limitation of liberty inherent in the
dangerous offender legislation. What is at stake, from the point of view of the
offender, is a sentence of indeterminate detention in a penitentiary. Whether
one characterizes the dangerous offender proceedings as part of the sentencing
process or a separate proceeding with new penal consequences, the liberty
interest protected under s. 7  is engaged in such proceedings. The question is
what the principles of fundamental justice require in this context, not whether
they are implicated.

 

                        Secondly,
the question here is not whether any of the specifically enumerated protections
in the Charter  which derive from the broader principle against
self-incrimination are limited by the use of the evidence in cases like the
present one. Rather, the question is whether the use of the evidence, in these
circumstances, is contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                        (i)
Definition

 

                        The
principle against self-incrimination, in its broadest form, can be expressed in
the following manner:

 

...the individual is sovereign and ... proper rules of
battle between government and individual require that the individual ... not be
conscripted by his opponent to defeat himself.... 

 

(Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 8 (McNaughton rev.
1961), § 2251, at p. 318.)

 

Or, put
another way, nemo tenetur seipsum accusare and nemo tenetur seipsum
prodere and nemo tenetur armare adversarum contra se -- no one shall
be required to accuse or betray or arm his enemy against himself.

 

                        Any
state action that coerces an individual to furnish evidence against him- or
herself in a proceeding in which the individual and the state are adversaries
violates the principle against self-incrimination.  Coercion, it should be
noted, means the denial of free and informed consent.

 

                        As
noted by David Paciocco in Charter Principles and Proof in Criminal Cases
(1987), at p. 539, ""[t]here is a great deal of confusion over the
terminology relating to problems of self-incrimination.  One therefore bears a
heavy responsibility to be as precise as possible in defining what one
means..."".  Similarly, as noted by Alan Mewett in ""Law Enforcement
and the Conflict of Values"" (1970), 12 Crim. L.Q. 179, at p. 186,
""[p]erhaps no phrase is bandied about with more imprecision and with more
unawareness of its legal and social significance than the privilege against
self-incrimination..."".  

 

                        It
should therefore be made clear here that I distinguish between the principle
against self-incrimination and the privilege against
self-incrimination.  The principle is as defined above.  The privilege
is the narrow traditional common law rule relating only to testimonial evidence
at trial.  Much of the confusion around such issues as silence,
non-compellability and self-incrimination has, I believe, arisen as a result of
the failure to distinguish between these two levels of protection against
self-incrimination.  The principle is a general organizing principle of
criminal law from which particular rules can be derived (for example, rules
about non-compellability of the accused and admissibility of confessions).  The
privilege is merely one rule that has been derived from the principle. 
When the protection against self-incrimination is limited to the privilege
against self-incrimination, then the underlying rationale for the various
common law rules protecting against self-incrimination is lost and principled
decisions about particular cases as they arise become impossible.  It is
therefore important to bear in mind throughout this judgment that it is the principle
against self-incrimination and not the privilege for which I am claiming
status as a principle of fundamental justice.

 

                        In
this context, the word ""incriminate"" need not be equated with
""tending to prove guilt of a criminal offence"". The history of the
various aspects of the principle against self-incrimination shows that the word
""incriminate"" was not thus limited in this context. It extended, for
example, to evidence having the tendency to expose the individual to a penalty
or a forfeiture: see R. Cross and C. Tapper, Cross or Evidence (7th ed.
1990), at pp. 418 et seq. Particularly relevant to this case is
Wigmore's assertion that the principle operates in a proceeding to increase a
sentence after conviction: see Wigmore on Evidence, supra, §
2257(d), at p. 342. Even if the dangerous offender proceeding is characterized
as an aspect of sentencing, the operation of the principles against
self-incrimination is by no means excluded.

 

                        (ii)
Rationale

 

                        The
modern-day rationale for the principle against self-incrimination is found in
the two fundamental purposes for the principle that have been recognized by
this Court: (1) protection against unreliable confessions; and (2) protection
against the abuse of power by the state.  Wilson J., dissenting, elaborated on the
latter purpose in Thomson Newspapers, supra, at p. 480:

 

                        Having reviewed the historical
origins of the rights against compellability and self-incrimination and the
policy justifications advanced in favour of their retention in more modern
times, I conclude that their preservation is prompted by a concern that the
privacy and personal autonomy and dignity of the individual be respected by the
state.  The state must have some justification for interfering with the
individual and cannot rely on the individual to produce the justification out
of his own mouth.  Were it otherwise, our justice system would be on a slippery
slope towards the creation of a police state. 

 

Concern
about the abuse of state power is at the heart of the principle against
self-incrimination.

 

                        (iii)
Current status

 

                        This
Court has recognized implicitly that the principle against self-incrimination
is a principle of fundamental justice.  I draw the implication from the many
rules, rights and privileges that can be traced to the principle against
self-incrimination as well as from the ss. 7 , 10 (b), 11 (c), 13 
and 24(2)  Charter  jurisprudence.

 

                        As
Michael Hor noted in ""The Privilege against Self-Incrimination and
Fairness to the Accused"", [1993] Singapore J. Legal Stud. 35, at p.
35:

 

Conceptually, it would seem that if there is any single
organizing principle in the criminal process, it is the right of the accused to
resist any effort to force him to assist in his own prosecution.  It provides
substance to the common law ideal of a fair trial through an adversarial or
accusatorial process.  The parties to a criminal prosecution are seen as
competitors and the trial the competition.  The prosecution is to use its own
resources to gather and marshal the evidence without the unwilling assistance
of the accused, and the accused is left to defend himself if the prosecution
succeeds in making out a case against him.  It is thought to be behind key
principles of criminal justice like the voluntariness rule for confessions, the
discretion to exclude improperly obtained evidence and the presumption of
innocence.  

 

                        Consider
the following rules, rights, and privileges that can be traced to the principle
against self-incrimination as well as the following ss. 7 , 10 (b), 11 (c),
13  and 24(2)  Charter  jurisprudence.

 

                        (a)
The confessions rule

 

                        According
to the confessions rule, a confession which the authorities improperly obtain
from a detained person is inadmissible in evidence.  The history and content of
this rule were thoroughly canvassed in the reasons of McLachlin J. in R. v.
Hebert, supra, at pp. 165-73, and need not be reviewed here. 
Suffice it to repeat McLachlin J.'s conclusion from p. 173 that:

 

... one of the themes running through the jurisprudence
on confessions is the idea that a person in the power of the state's criminal
process has the right to freely choose whether or not to make a statement to
the police.  This idea is accompanied by a correlative concern with the repute
and integrity of the judicial process.  This theme has not always been
ascendant.  Yet, its importance cannot be denied.  It persists, both in
Canadian jurisprudence and in the rules governing the rights of suspects in other
countries.

 

The
confessions rule was (and remains) clearly grounded in the principle against
self-incrimination.

 

                        (b)
The privilege against self-incrimination

 

                        The
privilege against self-incrimination protected any witness from being compelled
to testify against him- or herself at trial.  Again, the history and content of
this privilege were thoroughly canvassed in the reasons of McLachlin J. in Hebert,
at pp. 173-75, and need not be reviewed here.  Suffice it to note that the
privilege was (and remains) clearly grounded in the principle against
self-incrimination.

 

                        (c)
The right to silence 

 

                        Traditionally,
the privilege against self-incrimination was limited to testimonial compulsion
and the trial context (Marcoux v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 763). 
However, in Hebert, McLachlin J. noted, at p. 174, that some of the
rules, rights and privileges derived from the principle should not be limited
to the trial context: ""[t]he protection conferred by a legal system which
grants the accused immunity from incriminating himself at trial but offers no
protection with respect to pre-trial statements would be illusory"".  

 

                        In
Hebert, this Court expanded the rules, rights and privileges derived
from the principle against self-incrimination by finding the right to silence
within s. 7  of the Charter .  The connection of the right to silence to
the principle against self-incrimination is clear in McLachlin J.'s reasons at
p. 175:  ""the measure of the right to silence may be postulated to reside
in the notion that a person whose liberty is placed in jeopardy by the criminal
process cannot be required to give evidence against himself or herself [i.e.,
the principle against self-incrimination], but rather has the right to choose
whether to speak or to remain silent"".

 

                        Two
examples of the right to silence should illustrate its content.  First, this
Court has held that it is a violation of the right to silence to solicit
admissions by placing an undercover police officer in the cell with a suspect
who has expressly stated that he does not wish to speak to the police (Hebert). 
Second, this Court has also held that it is a violation of the right to silence
to solicit admissions by placing in the accused's cell a friend of the accused
who was asked by the police to visit the accused and whose visit was
facilitated by them (R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595).

 

                        A
general rule can be seen in the approach this Court has taken to the right to
silence:  if the state interferes with either element of free and informed
consent, then the individual's right to silence is limited.  This is a rule
that is clearly grounded in the principle against self-incrimination.

 

                        (d)
Sections 10 (b), 11 (c) and 13  of the Charter  jurisprudence

 

                        Sections
11 (c) and 13  of the Charter  explicitly provide protection against
self-incrimination:

 

                        11. Any person
charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                        ...

 

                        (c) not to be compelled
to be a witness in proceedings against that       person in respect of the
offence;

 

 

                        13. A witness who
testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have any incriminating
evidence so given used to incriminate that witness in any other proceedings,
except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of contradictory
evidence.

 

Section 10 (b)
implicitly provides protection against self-incrimination:

 

                        10.  Everyone has the
right on arrest or detention

 

                                                                        ...

 

                        (b) to retain and
instruct counsel without delay and to be informed       of that right;

 

This
Court's purposive analysis of these sections reveals yet again the implicit
recognition of the principle against self-incrimination as a principle of
fundamental justice.

 

                        In
R. v. Amway Corp., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 21, at p. 40, Sopinka J. wrote that
the purpose of s. 11 (c) is ""to protect the individual against the
affront to dignity and privacy inherent in a practice which enables the
prosecution to force the person charged to supply the evidence out of his or
her own mouth"".  In Dubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, at p.
358, I wrote that:

 

Section 13 , like s. 11 (c), is a recognition of
the principle that,

 

...the individual is sovereign and that proper rules of
battle between government and individual require that the individual not be
bothered for less than good reason and not be conscripted by his opponent to
defeat himself.

 

                        (Wigmore on Evidence,
vol. 8 (McNaughton rev. 1961), para. 2251, at p. 318.) 

 

                        Wilson
J. wrote in Clarkson v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, at p. 394, that
the ""right [to counsel], as entrenched in s. 10 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is clearly aimed at fostering the
principles of adjudicative fairness"".  I then wrote in R. v. Collins,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 284, that ""one of the fundamental tenets of a
fair trial [is] the right against self-incrimination"".  The purpose of s.
10 (b), it can be concluded, is the fostering of the right against
self-incrimination.  Or, as L'Heureux-Dubé J. said more directly in R. v.
Simmons, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 495, at p. 539: 

 

The right to counsel is primarily aimed at preventing
the accused or detained person from incriminating herself.  Thus the main
concern would be with coerced or uninformed confessions.  In such
circumstances, the accused would be manufacturing the evidence against
herself.  This is something which, in the interests of fairness, the right to
counsel would seek to protect.

 

The
underlying purpose for ss. 10 (b), 11 (c) and 13 , set out by this
Court, is protection against self-incrimination.

 

                        (e)
Section 24(2)  of the Charter  jurisprudence

 

                        This
Court has developed a method of determining whether evidence illegally obtained
following a Charter  violation may be admitted under s. 24(2)  of the Charter 
(Collins, supra; R. v. Ross, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3; and R. v.
Black, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 138).  Evidence is generally inadmissible under s.
24(2)  if it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Evidence
will tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute if it renders
the trial process unfair.  Evidence renders the trial process unfair if it is
obtained, after a violation of the Charter , by conscripting the accused
against himself (that is, by using evidence that could not have been obtained
but for the participation of the accused in the construction of the evidence);
""[t]he use of such evidence would render the trial unfair, for it did not
exist prior to the violation and it strikes at one of the fundamental tenets of
a fair trial, the right against self-incrimination"" (Collins, at p.
284).

 

                        This
Court has excluded evidence of line-up identification (Ross) and
inculpatory statements (for example, Black, supra, Broyles,
supra, and R. v. Brydges, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 190) on self-incrimination
grounds under s. 24(2) .

 

                        The
s. 24(2)  method appears to be driven, at least in part, by the principle
against self-incrimination.  Given that a fair trial is a principle of
fundamental justice and the right against self-incrimination is a fundamental
tenet of a fair trial, it can be concluded that this Court has recognized (at
least implicitly) that the right against self-incrimination is a principle of
fundamental justice.

 

                        (f)
Section 7  of the Charter  jurisprudence

 

                        Before
Thomson Newspapers, it was widely thought that ss. 11 (c) and 13 
of the Charter  were exhaustive of the protections against
self-incrimination.  However, in Thomson Newspapers, I noted, at p. 442,
that ""I ... agree with all of my colleagues that the specific enumerations
in ss. 11 (c) and 13  of the Charter  are not necessarily exhaustive
of the protection afforded by s. 7 , and do not prevent residual content being
given to s. 7 "". This Court, however, did not reach agreement about the
nature and scope of the residual content for s. 7  nor about the means appropriate
for determining the nature and scope of the residual content.

 

                        Nevertheless,
some guidance can be found in Hebert.  In Hebert, McLachlin J.
noted at p. 174 that ""[t]he protection conferred by a legal system which
grants the accused immunity from incriminating himself at trial but offers no
protection with respect to pre-trial statements would be illusory"".  It
seems reasonable to conclude that this extension of protection is grounded in
the principle against self-incrimination.

 

                        Thus,
while this Court did not specify the residual self-incrimination content for s.
7 , it seems reasonable to conclude that the Court intended that it should be
determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the principle against
self-incrimination.

 

                        In
the end, therefore, I conclude that the principle against self-incrimination is
a principle of fundamental justice and this Court has, at least implicitly,
recognized its status as such.  

 

                        Before
moving on to the application of this Charter  analysis to the case at
bar, I must address the issue of limits on the principle against
self-incrimination.  Considerable confusion and disagreement surrounds this
issue (see, for example, the conflict within Thomson Newspapers). 
Important questions abound.  Does the principle protect against
self-incriminatory evidence that is given voluntarily?  Does it protect against
self-incriminatory evidence given by an individual who is not under detention
by the state?  Does it protect against self-incriminatory derivative evidence? 
Does it cover evidence being used to prove a prior inconsistent statement?  

 

                        I
believe that these questions should be answered by reference to the underlying
rationale for the principle and should be answered within the s. 7  analysis. 
However, these questions need not be answered here because the case at bar
involves testimonial evidence gathered under compulsion from an individual
under detention by the state for the purposes of self-incrimination (and these
characteristics place it squarely within the rationale and hence the
principle).  

 

    (3) Application
to the case at bar

 

                        (i)
Life, liberty and security of the person

 

                        On
both the broad and narrow interpretations, s. 755  of the Criminal Code 
limits the accused's s. 7  right to liberty.  If the accused is found to be a
dangerous offender, on the basis of evidence introduced through s. 755 , he or
she may be given a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indefinite
period.  The question remains, however, whether these limits on the right to
liberty are in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                        (ii)
Principles of fundamental justice

 

                        The
limits on the right to liberty on the broad interpretation of s. 755  of the Criminal
Code  are not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  The
broad interpretation of s. 755  allows evidence gathered from the accused during
psychiatric observation compelled for the purposes of preventing the conviction
or unfair trial of a mentally insane or unfit accused to be used against him or
her for the purposes of sentencing the accused as a dangerous offender.  This
allows for self-incrimination.       

 

                        (iii)
Conclusion

 

                        If
the state compels an accused to submit to psychiatric observation for the
purpose of determining whether he or she was insane at the time of the offence
or is, on account of insanity, unfit to conduct his defence, and then uses
those observations for the purposes of dangerous offender proceedings, then it
requires a person in detention to give evidence against him- or herself.  There
is, thus, a limitation on s. 7 , which, unless justified under s. 1 , would
result in the broad interpretation of s. 755  violating the Charter .  I
turn then to examine whether the limitation arising on this interpretation is
justified under s. 1 .

 

                        It
is irrelevant for this exercise of statutory interpretation that the accused in
this case requested the order be made to remand him into custody for
observation.  The accused requested the order for purposes other than a
dangerous offender proceeding.  Furthermore, the section does not require
the consent of the accused and therefore an order can be made under this
section for observation against the wishes of the accused.  This is sufficient to
constitute a limit on the s. 7  right to liberty.

 

                        I
reject the proposition that the pre-Charter decision of this Court in Wilband
v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 14, compels the conclusion that the principle
against self-incrimination can have no operation in the context of dangerous
offender proceedings. Wilband stands for the propositions that the
confession rule does not apply to dangerous offender proceedings and that, in
any event, psychiatrists examining the offender are not persons in authority.
The reason given by the Court for the former holding is that ""[t]he
confession rule ... is a rule which has been designed for proceedings where,
broadly speaking, the guilt or innocence of a person charged with an offence is
the matter in issue. The rule has not been established for proceedings related
to the determination of a sentence"" (per Fauteux J., at p. 20). In
making this distinction between determination of guilt and imposition of a
sentence, the Court relied, among other authorities, on its earlier decision in
Brusch v. The Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 373.

 

                        Wilband
considered examinations by psychiatrists for the purpose of the dangerous
offender proceedings, a fact which is more clearly apparent in the reasons of
the Court of Appeal than it is in the brief decision of this Court: see (1965),
51 W.W.R. 251 (B.C.C.A.). It was, therefore, a different situation than the one
now before us in which evidence obtained from the accused before trial and for
a different purpose was then turned against him at the dangerous offender
proceeding. Wilband is, therefore, readily distinguishable from the
present case.

 

                        To
the extent that Wilband is urged in support of a broader proposition
that, upon conviction, procedural and evidentiary protections vanish for the
purposes of sentencing proceedings, such broader implications must be rejected
by virtue of this Court's decision in R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R.
368. Gardiner held that disputed facts relied on by the Crown with
respect to the penalty must be established according to the normal criminal
standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. As Dickson J. (as he then was), said at
pp. 413-15:

 

                        Sentencing is part of a fact
finding, decision-making process of the criminal law. Sir James Fitzjames
Stephen, writing in 1863 said that ""the sentence is the gist of the
proceeding. It is to the trial what the bullet is to the powder"" (quoted
in Olah, ""Sentencing: The Last Frontier of the Criminal Law"" (1980),
16 C.R. (3d) 97, at p. 98). The statement is equally true today. 

                                                                        ...

 

                        It should also be recalled that
a plea of guilty, in itself, carries with it an admission of the essential
legal ingredients of the offence admitted by the plea, and no more. Beyond that
any facts relied upon by the Crown in aggravation must be established by the
Crown. If undisputed, the procedure can be very informal. If the facts are
contested the issue should be resolved by ordinary legal principles governing
criminal proceedings including resolving relevant doubt in favour of the
offender.

 

                        To my mind, the facts which
justify the sanction are no less important than the facts which justify the
conviction; both should be subject to the same burden of proof. Crime and
punishment are inextricably linked. ""It would appear well established that
the sentencing process is merely a phase of the trial process"" (Olah, supra,
at p. 107). Upon conviction the accused is not abruptly deprived of all
procedural rights existing at trial: he has a right to counsel, a right to call
evidence and cross-examine prosecution witnesses, a right to give evidence
himself and to address the court.

 

                        Quite
apart from any re-evaluation of Wilband that may be required by the Charter ,
it is readily distinguishable from this case and its broader implications have
been circumscribed by Gardiner. More specifically, Wilband cannot
assist the Crown as support for the notion that the principle against
self-incrimination can have no application to the present case because the
dangerous offender proceeding is a matter of sentencing.

 

                        Nor
do I think that the majority judgment of this Court in R. v. Lyons,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 309 is in any way dispositive of this case. I note that the
view of the majority of this Court in Lyons, that a person facing
dangerous proceedings is not ""charged with an offence"" within the
meaning of s. 11  of the Charter , may require re-evaluation in light of
this Court's subsequent decision in R. v. Wigglesworth, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
541. In Wigglesworth, the majority of the Court held that s. 11 
protections apply to those proceedings giving rise to ""true penal
consequences"": see, e.g., Wilson J.'s reasons at p. 561. The imposition of
an indeterminate period of imprisonment in a penitentiary would seem to qualify
as such consequences. However, it is not necessary to reconsider this aspect of
Lyons for the purposes of this case because the result I reach is
perfectly consistent with the majority view in Lyons.

 

                        The
majority in Lyons clearly recognized the role that s. 7  could play in
these sorts of proceedings and the serious limitations of the offender's
liberty at stake in them. For example, La Forest J. said, at p. 354:

                        The conclusion that the
appellant is not entilted to the benefit of trial by jury under s. 11 (f)
does not, however, conclusively decide the question whether he is entitled to a
determination by a jury of the question of his dangerousness, or, more
generally, whether the procedural incidents of the proceeding are
constitutionally adequate to safeguard his liberty. Such questions would appear
to fall within the scope of a s. 7  inquiry, for s. 11  does not limit s. 7  but
merely serves to illustrate and, perhaps, amplify its potential
applications....

 

                        In the context of s. 7 , it seems
to me that the nature and quality of the procedural protections to be accorded
the individual cannot depend on sterile logic or formalistic classifications of
the type of proceeding in issue. Rather, the focus must be on the functional
nature of the proceeding and on its potential impact on the liberty of the
individual. 

 

                        Moreover, the majority in Lyons
specifically resisted resting its conclusion that s. 7  did not require a jury
determination of issues in dangerous offender proceedings upon the distinction
relied on in Wilband and Brusch between proceedings determining
guilt and proceedings determining the sentence. As La Forest J. said at p. 362:

 

 

                        In other respects, however, the
case law following Brusch has given a judicial gloss to Part XXI that
might, at some point, merit reappraisal by this Court. In light of the
foregoing discussion it might well be that the logic that justified holding
Part XXI applications to be part of the sentencing process cannot now serve to
justify the whittling down of procedural rights that appears to have flowed
therefrom. 

 

                        In
short, Lyons as well as Gardiner substantially limit any
far-reaching implication drawn solely on the basis of a distinction between
whether the proceeding is to determine guilt or impose a penalty. To do so
would be, to use La Forest J.'s language, to justify the ""whittling
down"" of rights on the basis of ""sterile logic"" and
""formalistic classifications"". 

 

C. Section
1 of the Charter

 

                        Section
1  of the Charter  provides for some limits on the rights and freedoms set
out in the Charter : 

 

                        1. The Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out
in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

The test
for demonstrably justified limits was set out by this Court in R. v. Oakes,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, and summarized in Swain, supra, at pp. 980-81:

 

1. The objective of the impugned provision must be of
sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right
or freedom; it must relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a
free and democratic society before it can be characterized as sufficiently
important.  

 

2. Assuming that a sufficiently important objective has
been established, the means chosen to achieve the objective must pass a
proportionality test; that is to say they must:

 

(a) be ""rationally connected"" to the objective
and not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations;

 

(b) impair the right or freedom in question as
""little as possible""; and 

 

(c) be such that their effects on the limitation of
rights and freedoms are proportional to the objective.

 

                        The
objective of s. 755  is to protect society from dangerous offenders.  While the
protection of society from dangerous offenders is a pressing and substantial
concern in our society and is of sufficient importance to warrant limiting a
constitutionally protected right or freedom, the broad interpretation of s. 755 
fails the rational connection and minimal impairment branches of the Oakes
test.  

 

                        The
rational connection branch of the Oakes test requires that the means
must be ""rationally connected"" to the objective and not be arbitrary,
unfair or based on irrational considerations.  The admission of the
results of a compulsory psychiatric assessment ordered under s. 537(1) (b)
at a hearing to determine whether a person is a dangerous offender is, at first
blush, to me rationally connected to the objective of protecting society from
dangerous offenders; it will assist in the detection and confinement of
dangerous offenders.  However, it is unfair when it need not be.  Specifically,
the means chosen to achieve the objective are unfair in the case at bar.  In
order to benefit from the protection afforded by the principles of fundamental
justice to the mentally ill against committal or an unfair trial, the accused
should not be forced into incriminating him- or herself for dangerous offender
proceedings.  Yet on the broad interpretation of s. 755 , the accused is
required to expose him- or herself to self-incrimination that could result in
an indeterminate sentence as a dangerous offender in order to get this
protection.  This is unfair.  Of course, different considerations might well
arise if the compulsory psychiatric observation for the purposes of dangerous
offender proceedings is ordered after conviction.   

 

                        It
should be noted here that the analysis applied to the admissibility of evidence
gathered under s. 537(1) (b) in dangerous offender proceedings can also
be applied to the admissibility of such evidence in other proceedings (e.g.,
subsequent prosecutions).  The general proposition is that in order to benefit
from the protection afforded by the principles of fundamental justice to the
mentally ill against conviction or an unfair trial, the accused should not be
forced into incriminating him- or herself at other proceedings.

 

                        In
the case at bar, there is also more than minimal impairment of s. 7 .  The
objective of protecting society from dangerous offenders can be met by ordering
observation under s. 756  of the Criminal Code rather than s. 537(1) (b). 
Section 756  has safeguards for the offender and therefore impairs the s. 7 
rights less than s. 537(1) (b).  For example, under s. 537(1) (b),
a justice may remand an accused into custody where there is evidence that the
accused may be mentally ill.  Under s. 756, a justice may remand an offender
into custody only (except in special circumstances) where there is reason to
believe that evidence might be obtained as a result of the observation that
would be relevant to the dangerous offender proceedings.  Most importantly, a
remand order under s. 756  can only be made once the offender has been
convicted, whereas a remand order under s. 537(1) (b) can be made before
conviction.  

 

                        Accordingly,
s. 755 on the broad interpretation fails the Oakes test and this
interpretation must be rejected.  

 

                        The
presumption of constitutionality approach to statutory interpretation dictates
that s. 755 not be read as rendering evidence gathered during psychiatric
observation ordered under s. 537(1) (b) admissible at dangerous offender
proceedings.

 

                        It
should be noted here that I am comforted in this interpretation of s. 755 by
the new Criminal Code  provisions (ss. 672.11  and 672.21 ) introduced to
replace s. 537(1) (b).  In this new legislation, Parliament clearly made
evidence gathered during compelled psychiatric observations of the sort ordered
under the old s. 537(1) (b) inadmissible in dangerous offender
proceedings.  

 

                        I
conclude that, in the case at bar, the evidence of the psychiatrists and the
psychologist gathered during the s. 537(1) (b) observation was not
admissible during the dangerous offender proceedings.  

 

D. Section
686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code

 

                        Now
I must consider whether the curative proviso of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the
Criminal Code  should be applied.  

 

                        Section
759  of the Criminal Code  states that: 

 

                        759. (1) A person who
is sentenced to detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period under
this Part may appeal to the court of appeal against that sentence on any ground
of law or fact or mixed law and fact.

 

                                                                        ...

 

 

                        (7) The provisions of Part XXI
with respect to procedure on appeals apply, with such modifications as the
circumstances require, to appeals under this section.

 

Section
686 is not part of the provisions of Part XXI with respect to procedure
on appeals.  Section 686(1) (b)(iii) does not apply to appeals under Part
XXIV of the Criminal Code .  Therefore, this is not a case in which it is
even possible to apply the curative proviso.

 

                        Under
s. 759(3)(a), I will order a new sentencing hearing.  I hope that the parties
will agree not to compel the appellant's victims to testify at the new
hearing.  Their testimony was not challenged during these proceedings and it
would likely be a significant hardship for them to be forced to relive the
sexual assault experiences yet again.

 

E. The
Scope of this Decision

 

                        The
final issue in this case is the scope of this decision.  First, it is important
to note that the preceding analysis is directed only at psychiatric and
psychological evidence gathered through observation ordered by a court.

 

                        Second,
it is important to note that this decision should not be taken to be
inferentially ruling on any of the new provisions of the Criminal Code 
(specifically, s. 672.21(3) (c)).  At first glance, s. 672.21(3) (c)
appears to make statements made by the accused during the course of an
assessment or treatment directed by a disposition admissible for the purpose of
determining whether the accused is a dangerous offender.  However, this section
does not make statements made during compelled psychiatric observation
admissible for the purposes of dangerous offender proceedings.  Rather, it
makes them admissible for the purpose of determining whether the accused is a
dangerous mentally disordered accused.  Dangerous mentally disordered accused persons
are then dealt with under s. 672.65  (as yet unproclaimed).  Dangerous offenders
continue to be dealt with under s. 753  onwards.  Statements made during
compelled psychiatric observation are in fact inadmissible under s. 672.21(2) 
for the purposes of dangerous offender proceedings because dangerous offender
proceedings are not included in the notwithstanding section of s. 672.21 .  The
failure of the broad interpretation of s. 755  of the Criminal Code  to
clear the hurdle of s. 1  of the Charter  should not be taken as any
reflection on the constitutional validity of s. 672.21(3) (c) of the Criminal
Code .  The s. 1  arguments in support of s. 672.21(3) (c) will be
different from those in support of s. 755  and they were not before this Court
in this case.

 

V. Disposition

 

                        For
these reasons, I would allow the appeal and order a new sentencing hearing.

 

                        The
judgment of La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.
was delivered by

 

                        GONTHIER J. -- At
issue in this case is the admissibility on dangerous offender proceedings of
psychiatric evidence obtained during a pre-trial psychiatric examination
pursuant to an order under s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (later s. 537(1) (b), R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
then repealed by S.C. 1991, c. 43, s. 9).  While I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons of Chief Justice Lamer, I respectfully
disagree with them and would dismiss the appeal.

 

I. Facts

 

                        Scott
Jones had a history of sexual assault.  On May 28, 1982 he was convicted of
rape, attempted rape and gross indecency for incidents involving young girls
aged 10, 12 and 13.  When the police sought to arrest Jones for these
incidents, he confronted them with a loaded shotgun for which he was convicted
of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.  Jones
was sentenced to five years in prison for these incidents.

 

                        On
November 25, 1985, Jones was released under parole.  On
October 24, 1986, Jones sexually assaulted a 26-year-old woman,
having forced her into his car and confined her there.  Jones was alleged to
have committed a sexual assault against a 14-year-old girl on
October 26, 1986.  On November 5, one day after being questioned
for the earlier sexual assaults, Jones sexually assaulted a nine-year-old girl
at knife point.  On November 7, Jones was charged with three counts of
sexual assault with a weapon (contrary to s. 246.2  of the Criminal Code )
and three counts of unlawful confinement (contrary to s. 247(2) of the Code).

 

                        On
November 18, 1986, the appellant's lawyer requested that he be remanded
for observation to determine if he was mentally ill.  In particular, the
appellant's counsel requested the order to determine whether the appellant was
fit to stand trial, was sane at the time of the alleged offences and to gain
some insight into the appellant for the purpose of sentencing.  He was so
remanded pursuant to s. 465(1)(c)(iii) of the Code.  A
30-day remand order was issued ""for purposes of medical and/or psychiatric
observation"".

 

                        Two
psychiatrists and one psychologist examined the appellant at the Forensic
Psychiatric Institute.  Prior to the first examination, Dr. Lohrasbe
warned the appellant that none of the discussions would be confidential and
that all information that was provided could be used against the appellant in
the course of the proceedings.  A second psychiatrist, Dr. Semrau, also
examined the appellant and warned him that the interview was not confidential
and could be used against him in court.  He also advised the appellant of his
right to talk to counsel.  The psychologist, Dr. La Torre, warned the
appellant prior to his interview with him that anything he said could be used
in a court of law.

 

                        Although
the trial judge found that the appellant was adequately warned that his
discussions with the psychiatrists could be used against him, he was not
specifically warned that the evidence of the psychiatrists could be used to
assist in determining whether or not he was a dangerous offender.

 

                        In
the course of assessing the appellant's mental health, Dr. Lohrasbe became
concerned about the appellant's potential for future violence.  These concerns
emerged from Mr. Jones himself who stated during the examination that he
was a danger to potential victims.  Although Dr. Lohrasbe considered the
implications of the use of this evidence at the dangerous offender stage, he
did not fundamentally alter his method of interviewing.  While he administered
a slightly different intelligence test (using a more widely accepted version), the
focus of the testing was identical to the one to determine the state of Jones'
mental health.

 

                        The
appellant pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault and one count of sexual
assault with a weapon.  During the dangerous offender proceedings that followed,
the trial judge conducted a voir dire in which the appellant challenged
the admissibility of the evidence from the three doctors at the Forensic
Psychiatric Institute on the grounds that to admit this evidence would breach
his s. 7  Charter  rights.  The trial judge found that the evidence
was admissible in spite of the fact that additional warnings had not been given
to the appellant about the possible use of this psychiatric testimony in
dangerous offender proceedings.

 

                        Dr. Lohrasbe
found that the appellant was extremely dangerous and he could see no basis for
a change in this psychological make-up in the foreseeable future.  He concluded
that placing the appellant in the community would put other young women at
risk.  Dr. La Torre found that the appellant had considerable
hostility toward women and that his lack of insight into his problem created a
strong risk that he would re-offend.  Dr. Semrau found that the
appellant's sexual assault tendency followed a very dangerous pattern that was
highly likely to repeat itself in the future.

 

                        The
two doctors testifying on behalf of the appellant accepted the deep-seated
nature of the appellant's problems.  However, they were of the view that
treatment over the normal period of detention could prevent the appellant from
re-offending.  The trial judge concluded that the appellant was dangerous
within the meaning of the Code.

 

II. Judgments Below

 

A.  Supreme Court of British Columbia

 

                        In
his ruling on the admissibility of the psychiatrists' evidence for the purpose
of dangerous offender proceedings, Spencer J. made three critical findings. 
First, he found that the scope of the examination conducted did not differ
materially as a consequence of the doctors' suspicions regarding the
appellant's ""dangerous"" tendencies and that there was no attempt to
deceive the appellant about the scope of the inquiry:

 

                        Dr. La Torre testified
that the psychological tests he administered would have been the same, in any
event, except that a different intelligence test would have been given, had it
not been for the direction that he examine the question of the accused as a
danger.  The psychological test or rather the intelligence test, in fact
administered was something called the WAS Revised Test and revealed an
intelligence quotient of 86, putting the accused in the low average range of
intelligence.

 

                        Dr. Semrau came to see the
accused because Dr. Lohrasbe asked him to give a second opinion.  That
apparently was not because Dr. Lohrasbe had begun to suspect that the
accused represented a danger to re-offend, but because of the serious nature of
the charges facing the accused __ they then were three counts of
sexual assault and perhaps some other counts connected with those assaults.

 

                                                                        ...

 

                        The indicia of danger which has
been put before me on the voir dire in the psychiatrist's opinions, emerges in
the ordinary course of a consensual examination pursuant to s. 465 ,
subsection (c).

 

                        Second,
the trial judge examined the appellant's argument that his rights under
s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  had been
violated by the failure of the doctors to warn him of the possible use of his
psychiatric testimony against him in dangerous offender proceedings. 
Spencer J. accepted the distinction between the use of such evidence to
determine guilt and its use in sentencing as found in R. v. Langevin
(1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 336 (Ont. C.A.), and Wilband v. The Queen,
[1967] S.C.R. 14:

 

The only right that I can find is one which is
exemplified in s. 11 , subsection (c), that is, the right against
self-incrimination.  In that section, it is limited to those who are charged
with an offence.  It might have been a broader right under s. 7  extending
to those who are no longer technically charged with an offence but for the fact
that the criminal law of this country, at the highest level, in R. vs.
Wilband, has denied the existence of any such right.

 

                        In
his judgment on the case, the trial judge concluded that the appellant was a
dangerous offender within the meaning of s. 688(a)(i) and (ii) and
imposed an indeterminate sentence.  This verdict was reached on the basis of a
review of all the evidence before him, including the testimony of the
psychiatrists that had been obtained pursuant to the pre-trial assessment of
the appellant's mental health.

 

B.  British Columbia Court of Appeal (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 327

 

                        Legg J.A.
begins his judgment by confirming the evidentiary basis for Spencer J.'s
finding that the psychiatric investigation was simply part of the determination
of whether the appellant was mentally ill and was not a separate undertaking
hidden from the accused (at p. 336):

 

                        My reading of the whole of
Dr. Lohrasbe's evidence leads me to conclude that his investigation of the
appellant's potential dangerousness was part of the assessment he had been
directed to make on whether the appellant was mentally ill.  As he said in the
passage of his evidence which I have quoted, that assessment was focused on why
these assaults were occurring.

 

                        The
Court of Appeal then proceeded to assess this Court's jurisprudence in R. v.
Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, and R. v. Broyles, [1991]
3 S.C.R. 595, in assessing whether there had been a breach of the
appellant's s. 7  Charter  rights.  It  stated that the case at
hand differs significantly from those two cases in two important respects. 
First, the appellant consented to the examinations and understood that the
findings could be used in court against him.  Second, the psychiatrists did not
resort to trickery in an attempt to persuade the accused to speak.  The court
found (at p. 337) that:

 

                        The order which was made under
s. 537  of the Criminal Code  required the doctors to assess whether
the appellant was mentally ill.  The order by its terms did not restrict the
doctors to assessing the appellant's mental illness at the time of the offences
for which he was charged or to assessing his fitness to stand trial.  The order
permitted, and indeed sought, an assessment of whether the appellant was
mentally ill.

 

                        The appellant had counsel and
with counsel's advice agreed to a psychiatric examination to determine whether
he was mentally ill and whether he was fit to stand trial.  The appellant was
aware that what he might say was not protected by confidentiality and might be
incorporated in a report to the court.  He spoke freely and openly to the
doctors at the forensic institute.  He did not assert his right to silence. 
There were no tricks of any sort engaged in by the doctors which induced him to
speak to them.  

 

Based on
these distinctions, the Court of Appeal concluded that there was no breach of
the appellant's rights under s. 7  of the Charter  and that the trial
judge was correct in admitting the evidence.

 

                        Legg J.A.
then proceeded to analyze the argument (raised by the appellant for the first
time before the Court of Appeal) that the appellant's s. 10 (b) Charter 
rights were violated by the doctors' failure to offer the appellant access to
counsel after the examinations had shifted to include an assessment of his
potential dangerousness.  Legg J.A. differentiated the decision of this
Court in R. v. Black, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 138, on the basis that the
appellant knew of the offences for which he was detained.  The court found that
the Crown was under no obligation to give notice of the potential sentencing
options that he faced citing R. v. Vandale, B.C.C.A., Victoria CA18/84,
October 31, 1984 (unreported), and R. v. Lyons, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 309, in support of this proposition.

 

                        The
Court of Appeal rejected the application of the United States Supreme Court
decision in Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454 (1981), noting that it
differed in an important respect from the case at hand.  In that case, defence
counsel were not notified of the psychiatrist's examination.  Here, the
appellant's counsel actually requested the examination and was aware that the
psychiatrist's report could be used against him.  As a consequence,
Legg J.A. concluded that there was no breach of the appellant's
s. 10 (b) rights.

 

III. Relevant Legislation

 

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms

right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be
deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

justice acting under this Part may 

 

                                                                        ...

 

(b) by order in writing,

 

(i)  direct an accused to attend, at a place or before a
person specified in the order and within a time specified therein, for
observation, or 

 

(ii)  remand an accused to such custody as the justice
directs for observation for a period not exceeding thirty days, 

 

where, in his opinion, supported by the evidence, or
where the prosecutor and the accused consent, by the report in writing, of at
least one duly qualified medical practitioner, there is reason to believe that

 

(iii)  the accused may be mentally ill,

 

                                                                        ...

 

                        (3)  Where, as a result of
observations made pursuant to an order issued under paragraph (1)(b), it
appears to a justice that there is sufficient reason to doubt that the accused
is, on account of insanity, capable of conducting his defence, the justice
shall direct that an issue be tried whether the accused is then, on account of
insanity, unfit to conduct his defence at the preliminary inquiry.

 

                        (4)  Where the justice directs
the trial of an issue under subsection (3), he shall proceed in accordance
with section 615 in so far as that section may be applied.

 

 

 

                        753.  Where, on an
application made under this Part following the conviction of a person for an
offence but before the offender is sentenced therefor, it is established to the
satisfaction of the court

 

(a) that the offence for which the offender has
been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (a)
of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender
constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well‑being
of other persons on the basis of evidence establishing

 

(i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender,
of which the offence for which he has been convicted forms a part, showing a
failure to restrain his behaviour and a likelihood of his causing death or
injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage on other
persons, through failure in the future to restrain his behaviour,

 

(ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the
offender, of which the offence for which he has been convicted forms a part,
showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender
respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his
behaviour, or

 

(iii) any behaviour by the offender, associated with the
offence for which he has been convicted, that is of such a brutal nature as to
compel the conclusion that his behaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited
by normal standards of behavioural restraint, or

 

(b) that the offence for which the offender has
been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (b)
of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender, by his
conduct in any sexual matter including that involved in the commission of the
offence for which he has been convicted, has shown a failure to control his
sexual impulses and a likelihood of his causing injury, pain or other evil to
other persons through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses,

 

the court may find the offender to be a dangerous
offender and may thereupon impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for
an indeterminate period, in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed
for the offence for which the offender has been convicted.

 

                        755. (1)  On the
hearing of an application under this Part, the court shall hear the evidence of
at least two psychiatrists and all other evidence that, in its opinion, is
relevant, including the evidence of any psychologist or criminologist called as
a witness by the prosecution or the offender.

 

                        756. (1)  A court to
which an application is made under this Part may, by order in writing,

 

(a) direct the offender in relation to whom the
application is made to attend, at a place or before a person specified in the
order and within a time specified therein, for observation, or

 

(b) remand the offender in such custody as the
court directs, for a period not exceeding thirty days, for observation,

 

where in its opinion, supported by the evidence of, or
where the prosecutor and the offender consent, supported by the report in
writing of, at least one duly qualified medical practitioner, there is reason
to believe that evidence might be obtained as a result of the observation that
would be relevant to the application.

 

IV. Analysis

 

                        The
appellant argues that his Charter  rights were violated in two ways. 
First, the failure to specifically advise the accused that the psychiatric
examinations might be used during the dangerous offender proceedings violated
his s. 7  rights.  Second, his s. 10 (b) right to counsel was
violated when he was not advised of the expansion of the psychiatric
investigation to include observations with respect to his future
dangerousness.  

 

                        Section
755  of the Criminal Code  deals with the evidence that may be tendered
during the dangerous offender proceedings.  It states that: ""On the
hearing of an application under this Part, the court shall hear the evidence of
at least two psychiatrists and all other evidence that, in its opinion, is
relevant, including the evidence of any psychologist or criminologist called as
a witness by the prosecution or the offender"".  Lamer C.J. would read
down this section to exclude any evidence obtained during pre-trial psychiatric
evaluations to which the accused has consented.  With respect, I cannot agree
with that view.

 

A.  Section 7

 

                        This
Court has not addressed the issue of admissibility of pre-trial psychiatric
observations in dangerous offender proceedings since the advent of the Charter . 
However, the Court did address the use of non-voluntary admissions made in the
course of psychiatric observations for dangerous offender proceedings in Wilband
v. The Queen, supra.  In that case, counsel had argued that such
evidence should be  inadmissible both for reasons of hearsay and because it
would violate the confessions rule.

 

                        The
facts in Wilband bear a striking similarity to the facts at hand. 
Frank Wilband committed a number of sexual assaults against young girls. 
The trial judge found Wilband to be a dangerous sexual offender, in part, on
the basis of the testimony of two psychiatrists who had examined him. 
Wilband's counsel claimed that the examinations were not proven to have been
voluntary and that both the rules of hearsay and confession evidence were
violated, making the psychiatrists' evidence inadmissible at the dangerous
offender hearing.

 

                        In
Wilband, this Court drew the following distinction that I believe to be
as valid in the post-Charter  world as it was then.  Fauteux J., as
he then was, speaking for a unanimous Court, stated at pp. 19-20:

 

The issue, in these [dangerous sexual offender]
proceedings which can only be resorted to if the accused has been convicted of
a sexual offence, is not whether he should be convicted of another offence, but
solely whether he is afflicted by a state or condition that makes him a
dangerous sexual offender within the meaning of s. 659 (b) of the Criminal
Code .  To be so afflicted is not an offence....  Indeed, a reference
to subs. 3 of s. 661  of the Criminal Code  makes it clear that
the object sought by Parliament, in enacting these special provisions, is not
to create an offence but to enable the Court, in cases where a sexual offender
is found to be a dangerous sexual offender, to pass upon him a further sentence
in lieu of or in addition to the sentence passed or which could have been
passed for the sexual offence of which he was convicted.  These proceedings
do not involve the conviction of an offence, but the determination of the
sentence which may be pronounced after conviction.  The confession rule,
which excludes incriminatory statements not affirmatively proved to have been
made voluntarily, is a rule which has been designed for proceedings where,
broadly speaking, the guilt or innocence of a person charged with an offence is
the matter in issue.  The rule has not been established for proceedings related
to the determination of a sentence.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The
Court concluded that neither the hearsay nor the confession rules were violated
given that the guilt of the accused had been established.  Dangerous sexual
offender proceedings were characterized as a form of sentencing for which such
protection was not generally available.

 

                        The
same approach has been followed by the courts since the advent of the Charter . 
For example, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled in R. v. Langevin, supra,
at pp. 355-56, that:

 

The procedure under Part XXI of the Code is to
determine whether the convicted offender has the status of a ""dangerous
offender"" and to determine the appropriate sentence.  Upon conviction (or
acquittal), the offender is no longer a ""person charged with an
offence"".  The dangerous offender proceedings against the offender are not
""in respect of the offence"" but in respect of his future
dangerousness.

 

The
Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that neither s. 7 nor s. 11 (c)
guaranteed a right to be warned against the possible use during dangerous
offender proceedings of statements made during an initial psychiatric
examination.  The Langevin decision was followed by the trial judge in
the case at hand.

 

                        The
resolution of the s. 7 issue in this case hinges on whether the Wilband
distinction between proceedings involving the risk of conviction for an offence
and proceedings for sentencing remains valid.  Lamer C.J. would eliminate
this distinction.  He states (at p. 247):

 

                        There are two principles of
fundamental justice involved in this analysis.  The first is the principle
against convicting a person who was insane at the time of the offence and
against proceeding against an accused who, on account of insanity, is unfit to
conduct her or his defence.  The second is the principle against
self-incrimination.  In this case, the accused, in order to take advantage of
the protection afforded by the first principle, was compelled to undergo a
period of psychiatric observation.  The results of this observation were then
used to incriminate him at the dangerous offender proceedings.

 

                        With
the greatest of respect, I cannot agree with the characterization of
Lamer C.J. that the results of the psychiatric observation are used to
""incriminate"" the accused at his dangerous offender proceedings. 
They are not.  By the time the accused reaches the dangerous offender
proceeding state, he has already been found culpable of the offence for which
he was charged.  He has, in effect, already been ""criminated"",
transformed from ""accused"" to ""offender"".  Section 753
proceedings are sentencing provisions and do not constitute a separate charge
against the offender.  A conclusion that the individual is a dangerous offender
does not constitute a separate finding of culpability any more than any
particular sentence generates a distinct culpability.

 

                        The
distinction between sentencing and culpability proceedings was reinforced by
this Court in R. v. Lyons, supra.  In that case,
La Forest J., speaking for the majority, held that the dangerous
offender provisions contained in ss. 687  to 695  of the Criminal Code 
did not violate ss. 7 , 9 , 11  or 12  of the Charter .

 

                        When
dealing with the question of whether s. 11 (f) of the Charter 
required a jury hearing for a dangerous offender application,
La Forest J. made the following remarks at p. 353:

 

                        There would seem to be no
warrant for reconsidering the conclusion of this Court [in Wilband v. The
Queen] that the ""labelling"" procedure does not constitute the
charge of an offence.  Nor do I think that a different conclusion can be
justified for the purposes of s. 11  of the Charter .  As I observed
in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, the phrase ""Any
person charged with an offence"" in the opening words of the section must
be given a constant meaning that harmonizes with the various paragraphs of the
section.  It seems clear to me that for the purposes of s. 11  it would be quite
inappropriate to conclude that a convicted person is charged with an offence
when confronted with a Part XXI application.  How can it be said that the right
to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty (s. 11 (d))
and the right to bail (s. 11 (e)), for example, could have any
application in the context of the unique post-conviction proceeding mandated by
Part XXI?  [Emphasis in original.] 

 

These
remarks were most recently cited with approval by Sopinka J. writing for a
majority of the Court in R. v. Potvin, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880, at
p. 908.  This view was not supported by Lamer J., as he then was, in
his dissent in Lyons.  He stated at pp. 373-74:

 

Under Part XXI, if the court finds that the offender is
a dangerous offender then, rather than imposing a determinate sentence within
the limits provided for the offence for which the offender was convicted, the
court may impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate
period.  The conclusion that the offender is a dangerous offender gives the
court jurisdiction to impose a greater sentence.  The status of being a
dangerous offender is thus in my view an offence for the purposes of s. 11 
and the offender is charged with an offence when an application is brought
under Part XXI.

 

By a
clear majority, this Court rejected this characterization of dangerous offender
proceedings as a separate offence for the purposes of s. 11 .  While this
Court recognized in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, that
Charter  rights contained in ss. 8  to 14  are illustrative and not
limitative of s. 7  rights, Lyons rejected the proposition that
dangerous offender proceedings could be characterized as a new trial during
which the accused was to be accorded the same procedural protection as is
accorded in the initial hearing.  I see no reason to reverse our reasoning in Lyons
in the case at hand.

 

                        Nor
do I believe, as Lamer C.J. suggests, that Lyons ""may require
re-evaluation in light of this Court's subsequent decision in R. v.
Wigglesworth, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 541"" (p. 261).  That case
involved the question of whether a charge of a ""major service
offence"" under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. R-9, constituted an ""offence"" within the meaning of
s. 11  of the Charter .  In deciding whether a private disciplinary
matter would invoke s. 11  protection, Wilson J. asked whether the
discipline imposed true penal consequences.  She concluded that the penalty of
one year imprisonment constituted true penal consequences.  Thus, a service
officer facing a major service offence charge would be afforded s. 11 
protection during his hearing to determine his guilt due to the true penal
consequences he was ultimately facing.

 

                        At
no point does Wilson J. suggest that since true penal consequences are faced at
the sentencing stage, the sentencing proceedings themselves attract full
s. 11  protection.  All sentencing proceedings involve true penal consequences. 
Whether the convicted party is faced with a sentence of ten years or an
indeterminate sentence, as in the case of dangerous offender proceedings, his
sentencing hearing involves true penal consequences for him.  These penal
consequences are the result of his having been found guilty of committing a
serious crime during a proceeding at which full s. 11  protection was
available to him.  Lamer C.J.'s logic would have us hold that the existence of
true penal consequences at the sentencing stage is enough to invoke full
Charter  protection during those proceedings in spite of the fact that the
party has already been found guilty of an offence.  With the greatest of
respect, I do not believe that this position can be supported by the existing
jurisprudence.  Lyons remains unchallenged in its contention that a
person facing dangerous offender proceedings is not charged with a separate
offence any more than any sentencing proceeding constitutes a separate offence.

 

                        La Forest
J. proceeded to analyze the right to a jury trial in the context of s. 7 
rights, focusing on the functional nature of the proceeding and on its
potential impact on the liberty of the individual.  He concluded, at
p. 361, that s. 7  did not mandate a jury trial for dangerous offender
proceedings:

 

Suffice it to say, however, that a jury determination is
not mandated in the present context.  The offender has already been found
guilty of an offence in a trial at which he had the option of invoking his
right to a jury.  Moreover, the procedure to which he was subjected subsequent
to the finding of guilt does not impact on his liberty to the same extent as
that initial determination.  Indeed, this is made clear by the same
considerations that led this Court, in Brusch, supra, to classify
the proceedings as part of the sentencing process.

 

Again,
the approach of the majority was in contrast to the opinion of Lamer J.,
who concluded, at p. 375, that ""Part XXI cannot be characterized as
simply part of the sentencing process with respect to the serious personal
injury offence"".

 

                        La Forest J.
also dealt with the issue of whether the accused's s. 7  rights were
violated by virtue of the fact that he was not advised of the Crown's intention
to make a Part XXI application before entry of a guilty plea.  Again, the Court
held, at pp. 371-72, that there was no violation of s. 7  rights:

 

It is nowhere alleged, here or in the courts below
(where this issue was not even addressed), that the appellant did not
appreciate the potential consequences of his plea; indeed, Part XXI
itself can be seen to provide notification that the dangerous offender
provisions are invocable if ""serious personal injury offences"" are
committed by an accused.  Nor is it alleged, for example, that the accused was
unfairly taken by surprise by the application, that he was not represented by
competent counsel, or that counsel pressured him to plead guilty against his
will, etc....  [Emphasis in original.]

 

The
question then becomes one of whether the Lyons holdings with respect to
a right to a jury trial or advanced notice of charges should be maintained for
the use of pre-trial psychiatric evaluations during dangerous offender
proceedings.  I believe that this extension is consistent not only with this Court's
jurisprudence in Brusch v. The Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 373, and Wilband
and Lyons, supra, but is supported by the approach taken by this
Court more recently in R. v. Hebert, supra, and R. v. Broyles,
supra.

 

                        R.
v. Hebert affirmed the accused's s. 7  protection during the
pre-trial period.  In that case, the accused made a clear statement that he did
not wish to speak with the police.  An undercover officer was then placed in
the cell with the accused and tricked him into making incriminatory statements. 
I agreed with McLachlin J.  (speaking for the majority) that s. 7 
protection extended to pre-trial investigations and that the police conduct
effectively deprived the accused of his right to silence.

 

                        I
draw three levels of analysis from McLachlin J.'s decision in Hebert. 
The narrow finding was that the police could not use trickery to obtain
confessions from an accused.  The wider finding was that s. 7  protection
of pre-trial statements was necessary to ensure that the ensuing trial was
fair.  The widest finding was that s. 7  rights involve a contextual
balancing between individual and state interests.

 

                        The
narrow finding of Hebert was that the police could not use trickery to
obtain statements that the accused would not otherwise have made.  McLachlin J.
states, at p. 180:

 

                        The scope of the right to
silence must be defined broadly enough to preserve for the detained person the
right to choose whether to speak to the authorities or to remain silent,
notwithstanding the fact that he or she is in the superior power of the state. 
On this view, the scope of the right must extend to exclude tricks which would
effectively deprive the suspect of this choice.

 

Clearly
the state is not entitled to trick the accused into making statements against
his will.  Consent must be freely given after the accused has been given the
opportunity to consult counsel.  However, both Hebert and Broyles
accepted that statements volunteered by an accused to an agent of the state
will not infringe an accused's s. 7  right to silence.

 

                        In
the case at hand, three important findings were made in this regard.  First,
the appellant not only consented to the evaluation of his mental health, he
requested it.  The request for a psychiatric evaluation was made not only to provide
evidence with respect to fitness to stand trial and mental health at the time
of the offence but also to provide some insight into sentencing.  Counsel for
the appellant conceded this point when he stated:  ""I want to make that
clear and I was __ I was concerned at that point to gain some
insight into this young man for the purpose of sentencing"". 

 

                        Second,
the doctors did not deceive the accused about the nature of the tests they were
conducting.  They did not begin with an analysis of his mental health then
secretly alter their evaluative approach to conduct an assessment of his
dangerousness.  The trial judge found that they undertook the same analysis of
his mental health as they would have undertaken even if they had not suspected
him to be dangerous:  ""The indicia of danger which has been put before me
on the voir dire in the psychiatrist's opinions, emerges in the ordinary course
of a consensual examination pursuant to s. 465 ,
subsection (c)"".  

 

                        Third,
the appellant freely consented to the tests with the advice of counsel.  He was
fully warned that his statements might be used against him in court.  In spite
of these warnings, and on the advice of his lawyer, he freely participated in
the testing.  He was not ""tricked"" into making statements as in Hebert. 
As the Court of Appeal found (at p. 337):

 

                        The appellant had counsel and
with counsel's advice agreed to a psychiatric examination to determine whether
he was mentally ill and whether he was fit to stand trial.  The appellant was
aware that what he might say was not protected by confidentiality and might be
incorporated in a report to the court.  He spoke freely and openly to the
doctors at the forensic institute.  He did not assert his right to silence. 
There were no tricks of any sort engaged in by the doctors which induced him to
speak to them.  

 

Clearly
the facts of this case do not bring us within the realm of Hebert.

 

                        The
slightly wider point to be drawn from Hebert is that s. 7 
protection must extend to the pre-trial period in order to ensure that the
ensuing trial is fair.  On this point, McLachlin J. held, at p. 174:

 

                        From a practical point of view,
the relationship between the privilege against self-incrimination and the right
to silence at the investigatorial phase is equally clear.  The protection
conferred by a legal system which grants the accused immunity from
incriminating himself at trial but offers no protection with respect to
pre-trial statements would be illusory.

 

Full
s. 7 protection in the pre-trial phase is essential to ensuring that an
accused is not found culpable as a result of non-voluntary statements made
against himself.  That logic cannot easily be transferred to the post-trial
phase.  Given that guilt has conclusively been determined by that time, I do
not believe that the logic of Hebert applies.  As this Court held in Lyons,
ss. 7 to 14 protection has a more limited scope when applied to the
sentencing process.  Once guilt has been established, our fundamental
principles of justice dictate a focus on the most appropriate sentence for the
guilty party.  To assume that s. 7 post-trial protection should be
identical to pre-trial and trial protection ignores a rather critical
intervening fact:  the accused has been found guilty of a crime.  Having so
found, the court places greater emphasis on the interests of society in
developing a sentence that is appropriate to the guilty party.  Evidence
introduced at trial may be used in this assessment.  I would argue that
evidence emerging from the psychiatric evaluation should be similarly treated.

 

                        As
I understand the approach of Lamer C.J., he focuses on the potential
trade-off that the accused must make in deciding whether to seek a psychiatric
examination to determine mental health at the time of the offence and fitness
to stand trial.  Lamer C.J. argues that the accused should be able to seek
a psychiatric examination without fear of its being used against him at the
later stage of dangerous offender proceedings.  However, this logic would
equally apply to testimony of the accused with respect to his mental state at
the time of the offence.

 

                        Assume
a court was faced with a fact situation similar to that found in R. v.
Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303.  In support of the defence of insanity
at the time of the offence, the accused takes the stand.  He testifies that he
had to kill the victim (and others like him) because they pose a threat to the
world and to the personal safety of the accused.  However, if it is found that
the accused knew his actions to be morally wrong, his defence would fail. 
Under the reasoning of Lamer C.J., this testimony would have to be
excluded from consideration during the dangerous offender proceedings because
it was in furtherance of his seeking a benefit of being declared insane at the
time of the offence.  I would argue that it would offend our principles of
fundamental justice if the accused were able to testify about how he has a
compulsive need to kill others at one stage in the proceedings but this
testimony could not be considered when sentencing the accused.  I see no
difference between this and other evidence which the accused may give in the
hope of avoiding conviction but which may serve in assessing an appropriate
sentence.  Similarly, I would hold that to ignore psychiatric evidence legally
obtained pursuant to s. 537(1)(b) of the Code and relevant
to assessing his dangerousness at the sentencing stage would be an affront to
our principles of fundamental justice.

 

                        The
final point to be drawn from Hebert is that s. 7 establishes a
contextual balance between individual and state interests.  McLachlin J.
states, at pp. 179-80:

 

                        Section 7 and the more specific
procedural guarantees which follow it are generally concerned with the proper
balance between the respective rights of the individual and the state in
judicial proceedings where the accused's life, liberty or security of person is
at stake.  It guarantees the individual's life, liberty and security of
person.  But it recognizes that these rights are not absolute.  In certain
circumstances, the state may properly deprive a person of these interests.  But
it must do so in conformity with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                                                                        ...

 

                        The Charter  through
s. 7  seeks to impose limits on the power of the state over the detained
person.  It thus seeks to effect a balance between the interests of the
detained individual and those of the state.  On the one hand s. 7  seeks to
provide to a person involved in the judicial process protection against the
unfair use by the state of its superior resources.  On the other, it maintains
to the state the power to deprive a person of life, liberty or security of
person provided that it respects fundamental principles of justice.  The
balance is critical.

 

This
contextual approach is in conformity with our general approach to Charter 
interpretation.  As Cory J. stated in R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, at p. 226:

 

                        It is now clear that the Charter 
is to be interpreted in light of the context in which the claim arises. 
Context is relevant both with respect to the delineation of the meaning and
scope of Charter  rights, as well as to the determination of the balance
to be struck between individual rights and the interests of society.

 

The
fulcrum in the state-individual balancing is different in the context of
sentencing proceedings such as those under the dangerous offender provisions
than in pre-trial or trial contexts.

 

                        I
repeat that once the party reaches the dangerous offender proceeding, he has
already been found guilty of the offence.  Where there is a serious risk that
the offender will re-offend, Parliament has seen fit to provide for an
indeterminate sentence for offenders who pose a danger to the public. 
Section 753 seeks to protect society against offenders who constitute
""a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other
persons"".  As La Forest J. noted at pp. 328-29 of Lyons:

 

It must be remembered that the appellant was not picked
up off the street because of his past criminality (for which he has already
been punished), or because of fears or suspicions about his criminal
proclivities, and then subjected to a procedure in order to determine whether
society would be better off if he were incarcerated indefinitely.  Rather he
was arrested and prosecuted for a very serious violent crime and subjected to a
procedure aimed at determining the appropriate penalty that should be inflicted
upon him in the circumstances.

 

                                                                        ...

 

                        It is thus important to
recognize the precise nature of the penological objectives embodied in Part
XXI.  It is clear that the indeterminate detention is intended to serve both
punitive and preventive purposes.  Both are legitimate aims of the criminal sanction. 
Indeed, when society incarcerates a robber for, say, ten years, it is clear
that its goal is both to punish the person and prevent the recurrence of such
conduct during that period.  Preventive detention in the context of Part XXI,
however, simply represents a judgment that the relative importance of the
objectives of rehabilitation, deterrence and retribution are greatly attenuated
in the circumstances of the individual case, and that of prevention,
correspondingly increased.

 

As with
all sentencing, both the public interest in safety and the general sentencing
interest of developing the most appropriate penalty for the particular offender
dictate the greatest possible range of information on which to make an accurate
evaluation of the danger posed by the offender.

 

                        In
the case of dangerous offender proceedings, it is all the more important that
the court be given access to the widest possible range of information in order
to determine whether there is a serious risk to public safety.  If there is, the
dangerous offender sentencing allows the justice system to more precisely
tailor the actual time served by the offender to the threat that he poses to
society.  The overriding aim is not the punishment of the offender but the
prevention of future violence through the imposition of an indeterminate
sentence.  An indeterminate sentence is not an unlimited sentence.  If, in the
case at hand, the psychiatrists testifying on behalf of the accused are correct
in their assessment that Mr. Jones will be fit to be released in ten
years, then he will be liberated at that time.  The offender faces
incarceration only for the period of time that he poses a serious risk to the
safety of society.  In the interim, it is hoped that he will receive treatment
that will assist him in controlling his conduct.  To release a dangerous
offender while he remains unable to control his actions serves neither the
interests of the offender nor those of society.

 

                        The
concern for societal interests is neither new nor is it limited to the
dangerous offender proceedings.  It has always been present in our general
sentencing system.  The 1969 Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections, Toward
Unity:  Criminal Justice and Corrections, offered, at p. 15, three
means by which the criminal justice process protects society:

 

The criminal justice process can operate to protect
society only by way of: 

 

(a)the deterrent effect, both general and
particular, of criminal prohibitions and sanctions; 

 

(b)correctional measures designed to achieve the
social          rehabilitation of the individual; 

 

(c)control over the offender in varying
degrees, including the segregation of the dangerous offender until such time
when he can be safely released or, where safe release is impossible, for life. 
[Emphasis added.]          

 

The need
to consider societal interests at the sentencing stage was highlighted by the
Law Reform Commission of Canada at p. 3 of Working Paper 3, The
Principles of Sentencing and Dispositions (1974), as follows:

 

                        Thus, there are two bases upon
which to justify an initial intervention by criminal law and sentencing:  the
common good and the sense of justice which demands that a specific wrong be
righted.  In other words, state intervention to deprive offenders of their
property or freedom may be justified on a theory of justice according to which
the wrong done ought to be righted.  It would seem, however, that as a
preliminary justification, it should be shown that state intervention would
serve the common good; otherwise it could be said that men should be subject to
sanctions, even though such sanctions appear useless.

 

In its
Report entitled Sentencing Reform:  A Canadian Approach (1987), the
Canadian Sentencing Commission described, at p. 151, the fundamental
purpose of sentencing in this way:

 

It is recognized and declared that in a free and
democratic society peace and security can only be enjoyed through the due
application of the principles of fundamental justice.  In furtherance of the
overall purpose of the criminal law of maintaining a just, peaceful and safe
society, the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to preserve the authority of
and promote respect for the law through the imposition of just sanctions.

 

The
sentencing stage places a stronger emphasis on societal interests and more narrowly
defines the procedural protection accorded to the offender.  If the sentencing
judge is to obtain the accurate assessment of the offender that is necessary to
develop an appropriate sentence, he will have to have at his disposal the
broadest possible range of information.

 

                        To
deny the court access to the earlier findings of the psychiatrists may hinder
the effective determination of the true risk posed by the offender.  While it
is true that under s. 756 the court may remand the offender for observation
for the purposes of gathering evidence on his dangerous offender status, the
offender may attempt to hide elements of his character or, indeed, refuse to
answer the psychiatrists' questions.  As a result, there is a real danger that
evidence from the pre-trial psychiatric evaluation which is excluded may not
surface in the post-trial phase.  This creates the considerable risk that a
dangerous offender will not be so labelled in spite of the fact that there was
clear psychiatric evidence at the pre-trial stage that the offender was a
serious danger to society.  While such an exclusion may be acceptable while the
guilt of the accused is in question, it cannot be justified after his guilt has
been established.  To exclude clear psychiatric evidence of the dangerousness
of the accused would be to ask other young girls in society to bear the risk
that this information might not emerge in the post-trial psychiatric
evaluation.  The release of Scott Jones while he continues to pose a clear
threat to their security is not a risk that they should be forced to bear.

 

                        That
is not to say that no protection is afforded to the offender at the sentencing
stage.  As Lamer C.J. points out, this Court held in R. v. Gardiner,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, that the Crown must prove disputed facts beyond a
reasonable doubt during the sentencing hearing.  However, in determining what
facts are admissible at the sentencing stage, Gardiner reaffirmed the
widely accepted principle that judges should have access to the fullest
possible information concerning the background of the accused.  As Dickson J.
stated, at p. 414:

 

                        It is a commonplace that the
strict rules which govern at trial do not apply at a sentencing hearing and it
would be undesirable to have the formalities and technicalities characteristic
of the normal adversary proceeding prevail.  The hearsay rule does not govern
the sentencing hearing.  Hearsay evidence may be accepted where found to be
credible and trustworthy.  The judge traditionally has had wide latitude as
to the sources and types of evidence upon which to base his sentence.  He must
have the fullest possible information concerning the background of the accused
if he is to fit the sentence to the offender rather than to the crime. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

Where
there is psychiatric evidence legally obtained pursuant to an order under
s. 537(1) (b) relevant to assessing the extent of his dangerousness,
this evidence should be admitted at the sentencing stage.  Section 7
protection does not disappear on sentencing.  Nonetheless, it does not extend
to a denial of critical evaluative evidence from psychiatrists legally gained
at the pre-trial evaluation that may show whether the offender could qualify as
a dangerous offender.  Once in the sentencing realm, the needs of society must
be given greater weight.  This may not appear ideal from the perspective of the
offender.  However, as Lamer C.J. noted in R. v. Lippé, [1991]
2 S.C.R. 114, at p. 142: ""... the Constitution does not always
guarantee the `ideal'"".  Nor, as La Forest J. pointed out in Lyons,
at p. 362, does s. 7 entitle the accused to ""the most favourable
procedures that could possibly be imagined"".

 

B.  Section 10 (b)

 

                        Before
the Court of Appeal, counsel for the appellant raised the additional argument
that the appellant's s. 10 (b) rights were violated in two ways
during the psychiatric examinations.  First, the warning given to the accused
by the doctors failed to outline the true extent of his jeopardy given the
possibility that his statements might be used in dangerous offender proceedings
brought against him.  Second, he argues that the accused should have been given
a second opportunity to exercise his right to counsel once it appeared that the
focus of the examination was shifting to determining whether or not he was
dangerous.

 

                        On
the first point, the appellant relies on this Court's decision in Clarkson
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383.  In Clarkson, an
accused made an incriminating statement while she was in a highly intoxicated
and emotional state and before having consulted with counsel.  The principle in
that case is simply not applicable to the facts of the case at hand. 
Mr. Jones was warned that anything said during the psychiatric examination
could be used against him in court.  On the advice of counsel, he freely
consented to the questioning.  As Dr. Lohrasbe noted in his report:
""Mr. Jones has an accurate knowledge of the charges against him, of
the pleas available and of their possible consequences.  He is aware of various
aspects of the legal process, including the roles of the people in court.  He
is fully able to communicate with his Counsel"". 

 

                        The
dangerous offender proceedings are sentencing provisions.  It is the duty of
counsel to make an accused aware of the possible sentence he will be facing as
a result of being found guilty of a particular crime.  Given the past record of
the appellant, counsel should have been aware that dangerous offender
proceedings would likely be pursued by the Crown.  Given our characterization
of dangerous offender proceedings as part of the sentencing process in Lyons,
the Crown is not under an obligation to notify the accused of the intention to
bring such proceedings prior to their plea being entered.  If the Crown is not
required to give notice of such proceedings in advance of the trial, I have
difficulty seeing why the doctors should have been expected to warn the accused
about possible dangerous offender proceedings.  It was sufficient that they
made him aware of the general availability of his statements to the court.  As
the Court of Appeal stated, at p. 342:

 

                        Here, the appellant knew that he
was faced with serious charges.  He was represented by counsel who had agreed
to his being interviewed by the doctors.  In my opinion, there was no
obligation on the doctors to inform him of a sentencing option which had yet to
be made, not by them, but by the Attorney-General.  

 

This is
not a case like Estelle v. Smith, supra, where counsel for the
accused was unaware that tests were being conducted.  Here, the accused
requested the tests and was made aware that his statements could be used
against him.  Given that the dangerous offender proceedings are part of the
post-guilt sentencing process, this general warning was sufficient.

 

                        The
appellant further argues that he was entitled to a separate consultation with
counsel after ""Dr. Lohrasbe's decision to assess the Appellant's
future dangerousness changed the Appellant's jeopardy from being exposed to a
maximum 14 year sentence to being exposed to an indeterminate sentence""
(appellant's factum, at p. 24).  He cites R. v. Black, supra, in
support of the proposition that the accused must be advised of a right to
counsel a second time when circumstances give rise to a different and unrelated
offence or a significantly more serious offence.

 

                        Two
difficulties emerge with this position.  First, the trial judge made a factual
finding that the focus of the testing did not shift as a result of
Dr. Lohrasbe's fears about the dangerousness of the accused.  One must not
lose sight of the fact that it is not the role of psychiatrists to determine
whether an accused is a dangerous offender, is fit to stand trial or was
mentally ill at the time of the offence.  This is the role of our court
system.  As Ewaschuk J. noted in Re Moore and The Queen (1984), 10
C.C.C. (3d) 306, at pp. 310-11:

 

                        I accept the submission that the
evidence of a psychiatrist, psychologist or criminologist is at times highly
speculative and in certain instances a lay person is in as good a position to
make a prediction as to future dangerousness.  In the final say, the court,
however, must be so satisfied and not the expert witnesses.  That is not to say
that experts may not assist the court, especially as to whether the offender
currently suffers from a psychological disorder, e.g., psychopathy,
which may be relevant to the likelihood of future dangerous conduct.

 

The
psychiatrist's role is limited to making observations on the mental health of
the accused.  Such observations may be useful at a number of stages in the
legal process. The fact that the observations made under the initial order to
determine the accused's mental health were also useful in assessing his dangerousness
should hardly be surprising.  However, no separate or different analysis was
conducted by the psychiatrists in an attempt to get greater insight into the
dangerousness of the accused.

 

                        The
second difficulty with the position of the appellant is his use of the Black
decision.  In that case, Wilson J. held that an accused must be given a
right to consult counsel a second time when charged with a significantly
different or more serious offence.  There is quite simply no analogy to be
drawn with the case at hand.  The accused was not charged with a different
offence nor was he charged with a more serious offence.  As we held in Lyons,
the dangerous offender proceedings do not constitute a new offence.  Since
there was no additional duty to warn of the possibility of dangerous offender
proceedings being instituted or of the possible use of evidence obtained during
the examination, I would find that the appellant's s. 10 (b) rights
were not violated.

 

                        Given
that I have found no breach of s. 7  or 10 (b) of the Charter ,
it is not necessary for me to deal with either s. 1  or s. 24(2) . 
Nonetheless, I would like to take this opportunity to speak briefly to the
question of s. 24(2) .

 

                        Lamer
C.J. argues that the pre-trial psychiatric evidence is not saved by
s. 24(2)  given that the admission of this evidence would render the trial
process unfair.  As I indicated earlier, I respectfully disagree with
Lamer C.J.'s characterization of the dangerous offender proceedings as
akin to a new trial to establish guilt with respect to a second offence.  Were
this the case, our jurisprudence in Black, supra, might be
useful.  However, the sentencing process begins only after the trial has been
completed and guilt has been proven.  To exclude psychiatric evidence
obtained in the pre-trial evaluation tending to show dangerousness would deny
the court access to important evidence it can use to most accurately tailor the
sentence while its admission can assist the court in reaching the most
appropriate sentence having regard to the interests both of the offender and of
society.

 

C.  Section
537(1)(b) of the Code

 

                        The
final question to be answered is whether the pre-trial investigation conducted
by the psychiatrists fell within the parameters of the one permitted by
s. 537(1) (b) of the Criminal Code .  Section 537(1) (b)
authorizes the remanding of the accused into custody for observation where
there is reason to believe he may be mentally ill.  As I have indicated, the
doctors at the Forensic Psychiatric Institute conducted tests in order to
determine whether Scott Jones was mentally ill.  The observations emerging from
these tests may be useful in assessing his mental state at the time of the
offence, fitness at the time of trial and proclivity to commit offences in the
future.  It is not possible to theoretically limit observations to one
particular purpose.   Given that the examinations of Scott Jones were designed
to provide an assessment of his mental health, they fell within the parameters
of the s. 537(1) (b) order made by the trial judge.  The evidence so
obtained is covered by s. 755  and must be heard by the court on the
dangerous offender application if, in the opinion of the court, it is
relevant.  For the reasons I have given, it is admissible under the Charter 
and there is no basis for reading down s. 755  as Lamer C.J. would do.

 

V. Disposition

 

                        For
these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

Respondent, a practising pediatrician, was charged
with four counts of sexual assault on four female patients, aged 13 to 16 at
the relevant time, during medical examinations conducted in his office.  His
counsel indicated that he intended to call a psychiatrist who would testify
that the perpetrator of the alleged offences would be part of a limited and
unusual group of individuals and that respondent did not fall within that
narrow class because he did not possess the characteristics belonging to that
group.  The psychiatrist testified in a voir dire that the psychological
profile of the perpetrator of the first three complaints was likely that of a
pedophile, while the profile of the perpetrator of the fourth complaint that of
a sexual psychopath.  The psychiatrist intended to testify that the respondent
did not fit the profiles but the evidence was ruled inadmissible at the
conclusion of the voir dire.

 

Respondent was found guilty by the jury and appealed. 
The Court of Appeal allowed respondent's appeal, quashed the convictions and
ordered a new trial.  The Court of Appeal therefore found it unnecessary to
deal with the Crown's sentence appeal.  At issue here was the determination of
the circumstances in which expert evidence is admissible to show that character
traits of an accused person do not fit the psychological profile of the
putative perpetrator of the offences charged.  Resolution of this issue
involved an examination of the rules relating to (i) expert evidence, and (ii)
character evidence.

 








Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

The evidence should be
excluded.

 

Expert Evidence

 

 

Admission of expert evidence depends on the
application of the following criteria:  (a) relevance; (b) necessity
in assisting the trier of fact; (c) the absence of any exclusionary rule;
and (d) a properly qualified expert.  Relevance is a threshold requirement
to be decided by the judge as a question of law.  Logically relevant evidence
may be excluded if its probative value is overborne by its prejudicial effect,
if the time required is not commensurate with its value or if it can influence
the trier of fact out of proportion to its reliability.  The reliability versus
effect factor has special significance in assessing the admissibility of expert
evidence.  Expert evidence should not be admitted where there is a danger that
it will be misused or will distort the fact‑finding process, or will
confuse the jury.

 

Expert evidence, to be necessary, must likely be
outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury and must be assessed in
light of its potential to distort the fact‑finding process.  Necessity
should not be judged by too strict a standard.  The possibility that evidence
will overwhelm the jury and distract them from their task can often be offset
by proper instructions.   Experts, however, must not be permitted to usurp the
functions of the trier of fact causing a trial to degenerate to a contest of
experts.

 








Expert evidence can be excluded if it falls afoul of
an exclusionary rule of evidence separate and apart from the opinion rule
itself.  The evidence must be given by a witness who is shown to have acquired
special or peculiar knowledge through study or experience in respect of the
matters on which he or she undertakes to testify.

 

In summary, expert evidence which advances a novel
scientific theory or technique is subjected to special scrutiny to determine
whether it meets a basic threshold of reliability and whether it is essential
in the sense that the trier of fact will be unable to come to a satisfactory
conclusion without the assistance of the expert.  The closer the evidence
approaches an opinion on an ultimate issue, the stricter the application of
this principle.

 

Expert Evidence as to Disposition

 








The Crown cannot lead expert evidence as to
disposition in the first instance unless it is relevant to an issue and is not
being used merely as evidence of disposition.  The accused, however, can adduce
evidence as to disposition, but this evidence is generally limited to evidence
of the accused's reputation in the community with respect to the relevant trait
or traits.  The accused in his or her own testimony may also rely on specific
acts of good conduct.  Evidence of an expert witness that the accused, by
reason of his or her mental make‑up or condition of the mind, would be
incapable of committing or disposed to commit the crime does not fit either of
these categories.  A further exception, however, has developed that is limited
in scope.  Although the exception has been applied to abnormal behaviour
usually connoting sexual deviance, its underlying rationale is based on
distinctiveness.

 

Before an expert's opinion as to disposition is
admitted as evidence, the trial judge must be satisfied, as a matter of law,
that either the perpetrator of the crime or the accused has distinctive
behavioural characteristics such that a comparison of one with the other will
be of material assistance in determining innocence or guilt.  Although this
decision is made on the basis of common sense and experience, it is not made in
a vacuum.  The trial judge should consider the opinion of the expert and
whether the expert is merely expressing a personal opinion or whether the
behavioural profile which the expert is putting forward is in common use as a
reliable indicator of membership in a distinctive group.  A finding that the
scientific community has developed a standard profile for the offender who
commits this type of crime will satisfy the criteria of relevance and
necessity.  The evidence will qualify as an exception to the exclusionary rule
relating to character evidence provided the trial judge is satisfied that the
proposed opinion is within the field of expertise of the expert witness.

 

Application to This Case

 








Nothing in the record supported a finding that the
profile of a paedophile or psychopath has been standardized to the extent that
it could be said that it matched the supposed profile of the offender depicted
in the charges.  The expert's group profiles were not seen as sufficiently
reliable to be considered helpful.  In the absence of these indicia of
reliability, it could not be said that the evidence would be necessary in the
sense of usefully clarifying a matter otherwise unaccessible, or that any value
it may have had would not be outweighed by its potential for misleading or
diverting the jury.

 

The similarities detailed by the judge dealt with the
perpetrator's modus operandi of the acts subject to the individual
counts.  These were not matters to which the expert evidence related. 
Moreover, whether a crime is committed in a manner that identifies the
perpetrator by reason of striking similarities in the method employed in the
commission of other acts is something that a jury can, generally, assess
without the aid of expert evidence.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

Sopinka J. -- In this appeal we are required to determine under what
circumstances expert evidence is admissible to show that character traits of an
accused person do not fit the psychological profile of the putative perpetrator
of the offences charged.  Resolution of this issue involves an examination of
the rules relating to expert and character evidence.

 

I.  Facts

 

A.  The Events

 

The respondent, a practising pediatrician in North
Bay, was charged with four counts of sexual assault on four of his female
patients, aged 13 to 16 at the relevant time.  The alleged sexual assaults were
perpetrated during the course of medical examinations of the patients conducted
in the respondent's office.  The complainants had been referred to the
respondent for conditions which were, in part, psychosomatic in nature.

 








Evidence relating to each complaint was admitted as
similar fact evidence with respect to the others.  The complainants did not
know one another.  Three of them came forth independently.  Following a
mistrial, which was publicized, the fourth victim came forward, having heard
about the other charges.  Three of the four complainants had been victims of
prior sexual abuse.  With respect to two of them, the respondent knew about
their sexual abuse at the hands of others.  The alleged assaults consisted of
fondling of the girls' breasts and digital penetration and stimulation of their
vaginal areas, accompanied by intrusive questioning of them as to their sexual
activities.  All of the complainants testified that the respondent did not wear
gloves while examining them internally.  The respondent, who testified in his
own defence, denied the complainants' evidence.

 

At the conclusion of the respondent's examination in
chief, counsel for the respondent indicated that he intended to call a
psychiatrist who would testify that the perpetrator of the offences alleged to
have been committed would be part of a limited and unusual group of individuals
and that the respondent did not fall within that narrow class because he did
not possess the characteristics belonging to that group.  The Crown sought a
ruling on the admissibility of that evidence.  The trial judge held a voir
dire and ruled that the evidence tendered on the voir dire would not
be admitted.

 

The jury found the respondent guilty as charged on
November 16, 1990.  He was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment on each of
the four counts, to be served concurrently, and to two years' probation.  The
respondent appealed his convictions and the Crown appealed the sentence.  The
Court of Appeal allowed the respondent's appeal, quashed the convictions and
ordered a new trial.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal found it was not
necessary to deal with the Crown's sentence appeal and refused the Crown leave
to appeal.

 

The appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court
against the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 693  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  On December 10, 1992 leave to appeal was
granted by this Court, [1992] 3 S.C.R. viii.








B.  The Excluded Evidence

 

In the voir dire, Dr. Hill, the expert, began
his testimony by explaining that there are three general personality groups
that have unusual personality traits in terms of their psychosexual profile
perspective.  The first group encompasses the psychosexual who suffers from
major mental illnesses (e.g., schizophrenia) and engages in
inappropriate sexual behaviour occasionally.  The second and largest group
contains the sexual deviation types.  This group of individuals shows distinct
abnormalities in terms of the choice of individuals with whom they report
sexual excitement and with whom they would like to engage in some type of
sexual activity.  The third group is that of the sexual psychopaths.  These
individuals have a callous disregard for people around them, including a
disregard for the consequences of their sexual behaviour towards other
individuals.  Another group would include pedophiles who gain sexual excitement
from young adolescents, probably pubertal or post-pubertal.

 








Dr. Hill identified pedophiles and sexual psychopaths
as examples of members of unusual and limited classes of persons.  In response
to questions hypothetically encompassing the allegations of the four
complainants, the expert stated that the psychological profile of the
perpetrator of the first three complaints would likely be that of a pedophile,
while the profile of the perpetrator of the fourth complaint would likely be
that of a sexual psychopath.  Dr. Hill also testified that, if but one perpetrator
was involved in all four complaints described in the hypothetical questions, he
would uniquely categorize that perpetrator as a sexual psychopath.  He added
that such a person would belong to a very small, behaviourally distinct
category of persons.  Dr. Hill was asked whether a physician who acted in the
manner described in the hypothetical questions would be a member of a distinct
group of aberrant persons.  His answer was that such behaviours could only flow
from a significant abnormality of character and would be part of an unusual and
limited class.  In cross-examination, Dr. Hill said:  ""You bring an extra
abnormal, extra component for the abnormality when you talk about a physician
in his or her office.""  According to Dr. Hill, physicians who were also
sexual offenders would be a small group because not only would they be breaking
the usual norms of society, but they would also be breaking out against the
norms of the medical profession which are very strict given the intimate
contact necessary to treat patients.  It was contemplated that Dr. Hill would
go on to testify ""to the effect that Doctor Mohan does not have the
characteristics attributable to any of the three groups in which most sex
offenders fall.""

 

II.  Judgments Below

 

A.  High Court of Justice (Ruling on Voir Dire)
(Bernstein J.)

 

In ruling on the admissibility of Dr. Hill's evidence,
the trial judge stated the issues as follows:

 

One:  Did the offences alleged to
have been committed by the accused have unusual features which would indicate
that anyone who committed them was a member of a limited and distinguishable
group?

 

Two:  Did the psychiatrist have
the necessary qualifications and expertise to venture an opinion on the first
issue so as to be helpful to the jury?

 








The trial judge noted that Dr. Hill had personally
interviewed and treated three doctors who engaged in criminal sexual misconduct
with their patients.  He also noted that Dr. Hill admitted that he was not
aware of any scientific study or literature related to the psychiatric make-up
of doctors who sexually abuse their patients and that his experience with three
admitted offenders who were doctors was not a sufficient basis to allow him to
make any generalizations on the subject.  Dr. Hill acknowledged that he, as a
psychiatrist, is unable to diagnose individuals as having the distinct
characteristics of a pedophile or of a homosexual until the patient has
performed an overt act which suggests the existence of the characteristic.

 

The trial judge reviewed the case law in which the use
of such psychiatric evidence had been discussed (i.e., R. v. Lupien,
[1970] S.C.R. 263; R. v. Robertson (1975), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 385 (Ont.
C.A.); R. v. McMillan (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 160 (Ont. C.A.); R. v.
Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852; R. v. French (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d)
201 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Taylor (1986), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.)). 
From these cases, the trial judge concluded that the use of psychiatric
evidence has been greatly expanded since R. v. Lupien.  He cited the
following words of Martin J.A. in R. v. Robertson (at p. 423):

 

Evidence that the offence has
distinctive features which identified the perpetrator as a person possessing
unusual personality traits constituting him a member of an unusual and limited
class of persons would render admissible evidence that the accused did not
possess the personality characteristics of the class of persons to which the
perpetrator of the crime belonged.

 

The trial judge also relied on the following passage of R. v.McMillan
(at p. 175):

 








I leave open, until the question
is required to be decided, whether when the crime is one assumed to be
committed by normal persons, e.g., rape, psychiatric evidence is
admissible to show that the accused is a member of an abnormal group,
possessing characteristics which make it improbable that he committed the
offence, e.g., that he is a homosexual with an aversion to heterosexual
relations.  I am disposed, however, to think that such evidence is admissible.

 

After relying on R. v. McMillan, the trial judge held:

 

Doctor Hill is of the opinion that
sexual assault is a crime committed by a distinguishable group.  As I read the
cases, I came to the conclusion that it is the size and the degree of
distinctiveness of the ""unusual and limited class of persons"" which
determines whether expert opinion will be helpful in defining the class and
categorizing accused persons within or without the group.  These days it is
trite to say that a large number of men from all walks of life commit sexual
offences on young women.  While all may have some type of character disorder, I
doubt that expert evidence regarding the normality of any given accused would
be of assistance to a trier of fact absent some more distinguishing within the
wide spectrum of sexual assault.

 

The evidence of Doctor Hill is not
sufficient, I believe, to establish that doctors who commit sexual assaults on
patients are in a significantly more limited group in psychiatric terms than
are other members of society.  There is no scientific data available to warrant
that conclusion.  A sample of three offenders is not a sufficient basis for
such a conclusion.  Even the allegations of the fourth complainant ... are not
so unusual, as sex offenders go, to warrant a conclusion that the perpetrator
must have belonged to a sufficiently narrow class.

 

I conclude that if the evidence
was received as proposed, it would merely be character evidence of a type that
is inadmissible as going beyond evidence of general reputation, and does not
fall within the proper sphere of expert evidence.

 

B.  Ontario Court of Appeal (1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 173

 








It was apparent for Finlayson J.A., who wrote the
court's judgment, that the trial judge's conclusions were based on a
misapprehension of the evidence of Dr. Hill.  Finlayson J.A. stated that Dr.
Hill did not base his opinion on case studies of the three physicians he had as
patients who were accused of sexual crimes.  Rather, Finlayson J.A. was of the
view at p. 177 that, in concluding that the perpetrators in the hypothetical
examples would fall into an unusual and limited class of persons, and that, if
the perpetrator were a physician, the class into which he would fall would be
even narrower, Dr. Hill based his opinion on all of his experience:

 

With respect, I think the learned
trial judge was in error, in that he ruled on the sufficiency of the evidence
of Dr. Hill, not its admissibility.  It was up to the jury to consider what
weight should be given to the expert opinion.  Crown counsel suggested on
appeal that the trial judge was ruling on the qualifications of the expert
witness to give the opinion that he did.  I do not think that is a correct
interpretation of the trial judge's reasons.  Dr. Hill's qualifications are
outstanding and no attempt was made at trial to challenge them. I think the
trial judge was saying that Dr. Hill's personal experience in dealing with
sex-offending physicians and the lack of scientific literature specific to such
physicians did not justify Dr. Hill giving the opinion that he did.  In my
opinion, in restricting his interpretation of Dr. Hill's testimony to
""doctors who commit sexual assaults on patients"", the trial judge
misapprehended the opinion of Dr. Hill and the broad psychiatric experience
upon which it was based.

 

Finlayson J.A. went on to say that the evidence of Dr.
Hill was admissible on two bases.  On the first basis, given that similar fact
evidence was admitted showing that the acts compared are so unusual and
strikingly similar that their similarities cannot be attributed to coincidence,
Dr. Hill's testimony was admissible to show that the offences alleged were
unlikely to have been committed by the same person (R. v. C. (M.H.),
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 763).

 








On the second basis, it was admissible to show that
the respondent was not a member of either of the unusual groups of aberrant
personalities which could have committed the offenses alleged.  Referring to R.
v. Lupien, supra, at pp. 275-78, R. v. Robertson, supra,
at p. 425, and R. v. McMillan, supra, Finlayson J.A. held
that it is settled law that opinion evidence showing that the accused did or
did not possess the distinguishing characteristics of an abnormal group is
admissible in a criminal case, where it would appear that the perpetrator of
the crime alleged is a person with an abnormal propensity or disposition which
stamps him or her as being a member of that special and extraordinary class (or
group).  In this case, the psychiatrist showed that pedophiles and sexual
psychopaths are members of special and extraordinary classes.  Considering also
the issues put to the jury in the case at bar (complex psychological issues,
testimonial trustworthiness), Finlayson J.A. held that evidence of persons with
professional psychiatric experience in dealing with sexual offences would be of
assistance (based on:  R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309; R. v. Abbey,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 24; R. v. Lavallee, supra; R. v. B.(G.),
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 30).

 

The court allowed the respondent's appeal, quashed the
convictions and ordered a new trial.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal refused
leave to the Crown's sentence appeal.

 

III.  Analysis

 

The admissibility of the rejected evidence was
analyzed in argument under two exclusionary rules of evidence: (1) expert
opinion evidence, and (2) character evidence.  I have concluded that, on the
basis of the principles relating to exceptions to the character evidence rule
and under the principles governing the admissibility of expert evidence, the
limitations on the use of this type of evidence require that the evidence in
this case be excluded.








(1)  Expert Opinion Evidence

 

Admission of expert evidence depends on the
application of the following criteria:

(a) relevance;

(b) necessity in assisting the trier of fact;

(c) the absence of any exclusionary rule;

(d) a properly qualified expert.

 

(a)  Relevance

 








Relevance is a threshold requirement for the admission
of expert evidence as with all other evidence.  Relevance is a matter to be
decided by a judge as question of law.  Although prima facie admissible
if so related to a fact in issue that it tends to establish it, that does not
end the inquiry.  This merely determines the logical relevance of the
evidence.  Other considerations enter into the decision as to admissibility. 
This further inquiry may be described as a cost benefit analysis, that is
""whether its value is worth what it costs.""  See McCormick on
Evidence (3rd ed. 1984), at p. 544.  Cost in this context is not used
in its traditional economic sense but rather in terms of its impact on the
trial process.  Evidence that is otherwise logically relevant may be excluded
on this basis, if its probative value is overborne by its prejudicial effect,
if it involves an inordinate amount of time which is not commensurate with its
value or if it is misleading in the sense that its effect on the trier of fact,
particularly a jury, is out of proportion to its reliability.  While frequently
considered as an aspect of legal relevance, the exclusion of logically relevant
evidence on these grounds is more properly regarded as a general exclusionary
rule (see Morris v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190).  Whether it is
treated as an aspect of relevance or an exclusionary rule, the effect is the
same.  The reliability versus effect factor has special significance in 
assessing the admissibility of expert evidence.

 

There is a danger that expert evidence will be misused
and will distort the fact-finding process.  Dressed up in scientific language
which the jury does not easily understand and submitted through a witness of
impressive antecedents, this evidence is apt to be accepted by the jury as
being virtually infallible and as having more weight than it deserves.  As
La Forest J. stated in R. v. Béland, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 398, at
p. 434, with respect to the evidence of the results of a polygraph tendered by
the accused, such evidence should not be admitted by reason of ""human
fallibility in assessing the proper weight to be given to evidence cloaked
under the mystique of science"".  The application of this principle can be
seen in cases such as R. v. Melaragni (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 348, in
which Moldaver J. applied a threshold test of reliability to what he described,
at p. 353, as ""a new scientific technique or body of scientific
knowledge"".  Moldaver J. also mentioned two other factors, inter
alia, which should be considered in such circumstances (at p. 353):

 

(1)   Is the evidence likely to
assist the jury in its fact-finding mission, or is it likely to confuse and
confound the jury?

 

(2)   Is the jury likely to be
overwhelmed by the ""mystic infallibility"" of the evidence, or will
the jury be able to keep an open mind and objectively assess the worth of the
evidence?

 








A similar approach was adopted in  R. v.
Bourguignon, [1991] O.J. No. 2670 (Q.L.), where, in ruling upon a voir
dire concerning the admissibility of D.N.A. evidence, Flanigan J. admitted
most of the evidence but excluded statistical evidence about the probability of
a match between the DNA contained in samples taken from the accused and those
taken from the scene of a crime.  The learned judge explained:

 

This Court does not think that the
criminal jurisdiction of Canada is yet ready to put such an additional pressure
on a jury, by making them overcome such fantastic odds and asking them to weigh
it as just one piece of evidence to be considered in the overall picture of all
the evidence presented.  There is a real danger that the jury will use the
evidence as a measure of the probability of the accused's guilt or innocence
and thereby undermine the presumption of innocence and erode the value served by
the reasonable doubt standard.  As said in the Schwartz case: ""dehumanize
our justice system"".

 

I would therefore, rule admissible
the D.N.A. testing evidence but not the statistic probabilities.  This
restriction can be easily overcome by evidence that ""such matches are
rare"" or ""extremely rare"" or words to the same effect, which
will put the jury in a better position to assess such evidence and protect the
right of the accused to a fair trial.

 

It should be noted that, subsequently, other courts have rejected
the distinction drawn by Flanigan J. and have admitted both DNA evidence and
the evidence regarding statistical probabilities of a match.  (See, e.g.,
R. v. Lafferty, [1993] N.W.T.J. No. 17 (Q.L.)).  I rely on R. v.
Bourguignon, supra, simply to illustrate the mode of approach
adopted there and leave the specific issue decided by Flanigan J. to be
considered when it arises.

 

(b)  Necessity in Assisting the Trier of Fact

 

In R. v. Abbey, supra, Dickson J., as he
then was, stated, at p. 42:

 








With respect to matters calling
for special knowledge, an expert in the field may draw inferences and state his
opinion.  An expert's function is precisely this:  to provide the judge and
jury with a ready-made inference which the judge and jury, due to the technical
nature of the facts, are unable to formulate.  ""An expert's opinion is
admissible to furnish the Court with scientific information which is likely to
be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury.  If on the proven
facts a judge or jury can form their own conclusions without help, then the
opinion of the expert is unnecessary"" (Turner (1974), 60 Crim. App.
R. 80, at p. 83, per Lawton L.J.)

 

This pre-condition is often expressed in terms as to
whether the evidence would be helpful to the trier of fact.  The word
""helpful"" is not quite appropriate and sets too low a standard. 
However, I would not judge necessity by too strict a standard.  What is
required is that the opinion be necessary in the sense that it provide
information ""which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of
a judge or jury"":  as quoted by Dickson J. in R. v. Abbey, supra. 
As stated by Dickson J., the evidence must be necessary to enable the trier of
fact to appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical nature.  In Kelliher
(Village of) v. Smith, [1931] S.C.R. 672, at p. 684, this Court, quoting
from Beven on Negligence (4th ed. 1928), at p. 141, stated that in order
for expert evidence to be admissible, ""[t]he subject-matter of the inquiry
must be such that ordinary people are unlikely to form a correct judgment about
it, if unassisted by persons with special knowledge"".  More recently, in R.
v. Lavallee, supra, the above passages from Kelliher and Abbey
were applied to admit expert evidence as to the state of mind of a
""battered"" woman.  The judgment stressed that this was an area that
is not understood by the average person.

 








As in the case of relevance, discussed above, the need
for the evidence is assessed in light of its potential to distort the fact-finding
process.  As stated by Lawton L.J. in R. v. Turner, [1975] Q.B. 834, at
p. 841, and approved by Lord Wilberforce in Director of Public Prosecutions
v. Jordan, [1977] A.C. 699, at p. 718:

 

""An expert's opinion is admissible to furnish the
court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience
and knowledge of a judge or jury.  If on the proven facts a judge or jury can
form their own conclusions without help, then the opinion of an expert is
unnecessary.  In such a case if it is given dressed up in scientific jargon it
may make judgment more difficult.  The fact that an expert witness has
impressive scientific qualifications does not by that fact alone make his
opinion on matters of human nature and behaviour within the limits of normality
any more helpful than that of the jurors themselves; but there is a danger that
they may think it does.""

 

The possibility that evidence will overwhelm the jury and distract
them from their task can often be offset by proper instructions.

 

There is also a concern inherent in the application of
this criterion that experts not be permitted to usurp the functions of the
trier of fact.  Too liberal an approach could result in a trial's becoming
nothing more than a contest of experts with the trier of fact acting as referee
in deciding which expert to accept.

 

These concerns were the basis of the rule which
excluded expert evidence in respect of the ultimate issue.  Although the rule
is no longer of general application, the concerns underlying it remain.  In
light of these concerns, the criteria of relevance and necessity are applied
strictly, on occasion, to exclude expert evidence as to an ultimate issue. 
Expert evidence as to credibility or oath-helping has been excluded on this
basis.  See R. v. Marquard, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 223, per
McLachlin J.

 

(c)  The Absence of any Exclusionary Rule                                     








 Compliance with criteria (a), (b) and (d) will not
ensure the admissibility of expert evidence if it falls afoul of an
exclusionary rule of evidence separate and apart from the opinion rule itself. 
For example, in R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, evidence elicited by
the Crown in cross-examination of the psychiatrist called by the accused was
inadmissible because it was not shown to be relevant other than as to the
disposition to commit the crime charged.  Notwithstanding, therefore, that the
evidence otherwise complied with the criteria for the admission of expert
evidence it was excluded by reason of the rule that prevents the Crown from
adducing evidence of the accused's disposition unless the latter has placed his
or her character in issue.  The extent of the restriction when such evidence is
tendered by the accused lies at the heart of this case and will be discussed
hereunder.

 

(d)  A Properly Qualified Expert

 

Finally the evidence must be given by a witness who is
shown to have acquired special or peculiar knowledge through study or
experience in respect of the matters on which he or she undertakes to testify.

 

In summary, therefore, it appears from the foregoing
that expert evidence which advances a novel scientific theory or technique is
subjected to special scrutiny to determine whether it meets a basic threshold
of reliability and whether it is essential in the sense that the trier of fact
will be unable to come to a satisfactory conclusion without the assistance of
the expert.  The closer the evidence approaches an opinion on an ultimate
issue, the stricter the application of this principle.








(2)  Expert Evidence as to Disposition

 

In order to decide what principles should govern the
admissibility of this kind of evidence, it is necessary to consider the
limitations imposed by the rules relating to character evidence, having regard
to the restrictions imposed by the criteria in respect of expert evidence.

 

I have already referred to R. v. Morin, wherein
an unanimous court decided that the Crown cannot lead such evidence in the
first instance unless it is relevant to an issue and is not being used merely
as evidence of disposition.  As I stated, at p. 371:

 

In my opinion, in order to be
relevant on the issue of identity the evidence must tend to show that the
accused shared a distinctive unusual behavioural trait with the perpetrator of
the crime.  The trait must be sufficiently distinctive that it operates
virtually as a badge or mark identifying the perpetrator.  The judgment of Lord
Hailsham in Boardman, quoted above, provides one illustration of the
kind of evidence that would be relevant.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Conversely, the fact that the
accused is a member of an abnormal group some of the members of which have the
unusual behavioural characteristics shown to have been possessed by the
perpetrator is not sufficient.  In some cases it may, however, be shown that
all members of the group have the distinctive unusual characteristics.  If a
reasonable inference can be drawn that the accused has those traits then the
evidence is relevant subject to the trial judge's obligation to exclude it if
its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.  The greater the number
of persons in society having these tendencies, the less relevant the evidence
on the issue of identity and the more likely that its prejudicial effect
predominates over its probative value.

 








When, however, the evidence is tendered by the
accused, other considerations apply.  The accused is permitted to adduce
evidence as to disposition both in his or her own evidence or by calling
witnesses.  The  general rule is that evidence as to character is limited to
evidence of the accused's reputation in the community with respect to the
relevant trait or traits.  The accused in his or her own testimony, however, 
may rely on specific acts of good conduct.  See R. v. McNamara (No. 1)
(1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193, at p. 348; leave to appeal refused, [1981] 1 S.C.R.
xi.  Evidence of an expert witness that the accused, by reason of his or her
mental make-up or condition of the mind, would be incapable of committing or
disposed to commit the crime does not fit either of these categories.  A
further exception, however, has developed that is limited in scope.  I propose
to examine the extent of this exception.

 

In England, with the exception of non-insane
automatism, expert psychiatric and psychological evidence is not admissible to
show the accused's state of mind unless it is contended that the accused is
abnormal in the sense of suffering from insanity or diminished responsibility. 
In R. v. Chard (1971), 56 Cr. App. R. 268, the trial judge refused to
allow medical evidence that the accused who was not alleged to be suffering
from a disease of the mind lacked the necessary mens rea.  In the Court
of Appeal, Roskill L.J. stated at p. 271 that it was ""not permissible to
call a witness, whatever his personal experience, merely to tell the jury how
he thinks an accused man's mind -- assumedly a normal mind -- operated at the
time of the alleged crime....""

 








In Lowery v. The Queen, [1974] A.C. 85 (P.C.),
such evidence was admitted when tendered by one co-accused against another.  It
was a case involving the sadistic murder of a young girl.  Lowery and King were
both charged, and it was obvious that one, the other, or both of them were
guilty.  In this context, King sought to prove that he feared Lowery and that
Lowery dominated him.  The Privy Council held that the trial judge acted
properly in allowing King to call a psychiatrist to swear that he was less
likely to have committed the crime than Lowery.  That is, character evidence
tendered by a psychiatrist was held to be admissible.  Lord Morris of
Borth-y-Gest of the Privy Council stated, at p. 103:

 

Lowery and King were each asserting that the other was
the completely dominating person at the time Rosalyn Nolte was killed:  each
claimed to have been in fear of the other.  In these circumstances it was most
relevant for King to be able to show, if he could, that Lowery had a
personality marked by aggressiveness whereas he, King, had a personality which
suggested that he would be led and dominated by someone who was dominant and
aggressive.... Not only however was the evidence which King called relevant to
this case:  its admissibility was placed beyond doubt by the whole substance of
Lowery's case.

 

Moreover, in R. v. Turner, supra, the accused
unsuccessfully pleaded provocation in answer to a charge of murder of his
girlfriend whom he alleged that he had killed in a fit of rage caused by her
sudden confession of infidelity.  He appealed on the grounds that the trial
judge had wrongly refused to admit the evidence of a psychiatrist.  That
psychiatrist was to testify to the effect that the accused was not mentally
ill, that he had a great affection toward the victim and that he deeply
regretted his act of murder.  The evidence was rejected on the basis that it
was not the proper subject of expert evidence.  As for Lowery v. The Queen,
it was confined to its own facts.

 

C. Tapper in Cross on Evidence (7th ed. 1990),
at p. 492, reconciled Lowery v. The Queen and R. v. Turner using
a principled approach:

 








Juries do not need to be told that normal men are
liable to lose control of themselves when their women admit to infidelity, but
they require all the expert assistance they can get to help them determine
which of two accused has the more aggressive personality.

 

Tapper then proceeded to reconcile the two cases using a more
technical approach:

 

Another way of reconciling the cases would be to treat
the fact that Lowery had put his character in issue as crucial to the decision
of the Privy Council, the psychiatric evidence then being admissible to impugn
the credibility of his testimony.  Unfortunately we are left without any
guidance on the subject from the Court of Appeal who contented themselves with
saying that Lowery's case was decided on its special facts.

 

With respect to the development of the exception in
Canada, R. v. Lupien, supra, is a good starting point.  It
involved a respondent who was convicted of attempting to commit an act of gross
indecency, and whose defence was that he lacked the requisite intent to commit
the act because he thought his companion was a woman.  He sought to prove his
""lack of intent"" by tendering psychiatric evidence which showed that
he reacted violently against any type of homosexual activity and, therefore,
could not have knowingly engaged in an act of gross indecency.  Ritchie J.
concluded, at pp. 277-78, that the evidence was admissible for the following
reasons:

 








I am far from saying that as a
general rule psychiatric evidence of a man's disinclination to commit the kind
of crime with which he is charged should be admitted, but the present case is
concerned with gross indecency between two men and I think that crimes
involving homosexuality stand in a class by themselves in the sense that the
participants frequently have characteristics which make them more readily
identifiable as a class than ordinary criminals.  See Reg. v. Thompson
[(1917), 13 Cr. App. R. 61 at 81].  In any event, it appears to me that the
question of whether or not a man is homosexually inclined or otherwise sexually
perverted is one upon which an experienced psychiatrist is qualified to express
an opinion and that if such opinion is relevant it should be admitted at a
trial such as this even if it involves the psychiatrist in expressing his
conclusion that the accused does not have the capacity to commit the crime with
which he is charged.

 

It is this passage that created the abnormal group exception which
is often sought to be applied to various contexts other than the homosexual
context.

 

The Ontario Court of Appeal, and specifically Martin
J.A., further looked into this exception of proving the disposition of the
accused through psychiatric evidence in the following two cases:  R. v.
McMillan, supra, aff'd [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824, and R. v. Robertson,
supra.

 

R. v. McMillan involved
an accused who was charged with the murder of his infant child and whose
defence was that it was in fact his wife and not he who killed the child.  The
trial judge allowed the accused to call a psychiatrist who testified that the
accused's wife had a psychopathic personality disturbance with brain damage. 
This psychiatric evidence showed that a third party, the accused's wife, was
more likely to have committed the crime because of her abnormal
personality/disposition.  Martin J.A., speaking for the Court, found that
disposition to commit a crime is generally relevant since it goes to the
probability/propensity of the person doing or not doing the act charged.  He
then referred to R. v. Lupien, at p. 169, as creating the following
exception:

 

One of the exceptions to the
general rule that the character of the accused, in the sense of disposition,
when admissible, can only be evidenced by general reputation, relates to the
admissibility of psychiatric evidence where the particular disposition or
tendency in issue is characteristic of an abnormal group, the characteristics
of which fall within the expertise of the psychiatrist.

 








After having noted the applicability of R. v. Lupien, Martin
J.A. engaged in a lengthy discussion of the exception and in fact extended R.
v. Lupien.  This extension, at pp. 173-75 of R. v. McMillan, was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada:

 

I do not consider that, because
the crime under consideration was not one that could only be committed by a
person with a special or abnormal propensity, psychiatric evidence with respect
to Mrs. McMillan's disposition, was, therefore, inadmissible, in the
circumstances of this case.

 

All evidence to be admissible
must, of course, be relevant to some issue in the case.  Psychiatric evidence
with respect to the personality traits or disposition of a person, whether of
the accused or another, may be admissible for different purposes.  While those
purposes are not mutually exclusive, evidence which is relevant for one purpose
may not be for another.

 

Psychiatric evidence with respect
to the personality traits or disposition of an accused, or another, is
admissible provided:

 

(a)       the evidence is
relevant to some issue in the case;

 

(b)       the evidence is not
excluded by a policy rule;

 

(c)       the evidence falls
within the proper sphere of expert evidence.

 

One of the purposes for which
psychiatric evidence may be admitted is to prove identity when that is an issue
in the case, since psychical as well as physical characteristics may be
relevant to identify the perpetrator of the crime.

 

Where the offence is of a kind
that is committed only by members of an abnormal group, for example, offences
involving homosexuality, psychiatric evidence that the accused did or did not
possess the distinguishing characteristics of that abnormal group is relevant
either to bring him within, or to exclude him from, the special class of which
the perpetrator of the crime is a member.  In order for psychiatric evidence to
be relevant for that purpose, the offence must be one which indicates that it
was committed by a person with an abnormal propensity or disposition which
stamps him as a member of a special and extraordinary class.

 








Psychiatric evidence with respect
to the personality traits or disposition of the accused, or another, if it
meets the three conditions of admissibility above set out, is also admissible,
however, as bearing on the probability of the accused, or another,
having committed the offence.

 

It would appear that it was upon
this latter ground that the psychologist's evidence was held to be admissible
in Lowery v. The Queen, supra, although the features of the offence in
that case were sufficiently indicative of the possession of an abnormal
propensity by the perpetrator, that the expert evidence might have been
relevant to the issue of identity as well.  Since in that case the evidence was
offered by the accused King, it was not excluded by the policy rule which
prevents the prosecution from introducing evidence to prove that the accused by
reason of his criminal propensities is likely to have committed the crime
charged.  Both accused in Lowery v. The Queen had psychopathic
personalities (although the features of King's psychopathic personality were
less severe than Lowery's) and hence their personality traits fell within the
proper sphere of expert evidence.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Where the crime under
consideration does not have features which indicate that the perpetrator was a
member of an abnormal group, psychiatric evidence that the accused has a normal
mental make-up but does not have a disposition for violence or dishonesty or
other relevant character traits frequently found in ordinary people is
inadmissible.  The psychiatric evidence in the circumstances postulated is not
relevant on the issue of identity to exclude the accused as the perpetrator any
more than the possession of violent or dishonest tendencies by the accused or a
third person would be admissible to identify the accused or the third person as
the perpetrator of the crime.

 

""So common a characteristic
is not a recognisable mark of the individual.""  (Per Lord Sumner in
Thompson v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1918), 26 Cox C.C. 189 at
p. 199.)

 

While such evidence is relevant as
bearing on the probability of the accused having committed the crime, the
psychiatric evidence proffered in such circumstances really amounts to an
attempt to introduce evidence of the accused's good character, as a normal
person, through a psychiatrist.  Such evidence does not fall within the proper
sphere of expert evidence and is subject to the ordinary rule applicable to
character evidence which, in general, requires the character of the accused to
be evidenced by proof of general reputation.

 

I leave open, until the question
is required to be decided, whether when the crime is one assumed to be
committed by normal persons, e.g., rape, psychiatric evidence is
admissible to show that the accused is a member of an abnormal group,
possessing characteristics which make it improbable that he committed the
offence, e.g., that he is a homosexual with an aversion to heterosexual
relations.  I am disposed, however, to think that such evidence is admissible. 
[Emphasis in original.]








The evidence of the psychiatrist was held to be admissible.

 

Martin J.A. elaborated on the reasoning set out above
in R. v. Robertson, supra.  That case involved a 16-year-old
accused charged with brutally murdering a nine-year-old girl by kicking her. 
The defence sought to introduce expert psychiatric evidence to show that a
propensity for violence or aggression was not a part of the accused's psychological
make-up.  This tended to rebut evidence led by the Crown as to the accused's
violent character.  Martin J.A. summed up, at p. 426:

 

While the judgment of Ritchie, J.,
deals only with the admissibility of psychiatric evidence with respect to
disposition in offences involving homosexuality, there would appear to be no
logical reason why such evidence should not be admitted on the same principle
in other cases where there is evidence tending to show that, by reason of the
nature of the offence, or its distinctive features, its perpetrator was a
person who, in the language of Lord Sumner, was a member of ""a specialized
and extraordinary class"", and whose psychological characteristics fall
within the expertise of the psychiatrist, for the purpose of showing that the
accused did not possess the psychological characteristics of persons of that
class.  Obviously, where such evidence is adduced by the accused, the
prosecution is entitled to call psychiatric evidence in order to rebut the
evidence introduced by the defence.

 

In my view, however, the judgment
of Ritchie, J., in R. v. Lupien, supra, provides no support for a
conclusion that, in the case of ordinary crimes of violence, psychiatric
evidence is admissible to prove that the accused's psychological make-up does
not include a tendency or disposition for violence.

 

Martin J.A. further stated, at pp. 429-30:

 








In my view, psychiatric evidence
with respect to disposition or its absence is admissible on behalf of the
defence, if relevant to an issue in the case, where the disposition in question
constitutes a characteristic feature of an abnormal group falling within the
range of study of the psychiatrist, and from whom the jury can, therefore,
receive appreciable assistance with respect to a matter outside the knowledge
of persons who have not made a special study of the subject.  A mere
disposition for violence, however, is not so uncommon as to constitute a
feature characteristic of an abnormal group falling within the special field of
study of the psychiatrist and permitting psychiatric evidence to be given of
the absence of such disposition in the accused.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

Given this reasoning, Martin J.A. concluded that the crime was not
specially marked and so the conditions for the admissibility of psychiatric
evidence were not met.

 

A useful summary of the principles that emerge from
the cases is made by Alan W. Mewett, ""Character as a Fact in Issue in
Criminal Cases"" (1984-85), 27 Crim. L.Q. 29, at pp. 35-36, of his
article where he points out the various contexts in which an accused can tender
character evidence by way of an expert:

 

There are thus three basic
requirements that must be met before such psychiatric evidence can even be
considered as potentially admissible.  First, it must be relevant to an issue. 
Second, it must be of appreciable assistance to the trier of fact and third, it
must be evidence that would otherwise be unavailable to the ordinary layman
without specialized training, but these requirements only set forth the general
requirements for the admissibility of expert testimony.

 

Once these hurdles have been
passed, a number of different scenarios may be postulated.  The crime may be an
""ordinary"" one (which I take to mean a crime for which no special
mental characteristics on the part of the perpetrator would be required) and
the accused is an ""ordinary"" person; the crime may be an
""ordinary"" one, but the accused an ""extraordinary"" person (i.e.,
having some peculiar mental make-up that would tend to show that he would not
commit that ""ordinary"" crime); the crime may be
""extraordinary"", but the accused ""ordinary""; or the crime
may be ""extraordinary"" and the accused ""extraordinary"", in
a different direction.

 








In the first scenario, the
evidence is irrelevant because it is simply not probative of anything.  In the
second it is probative and admissible but only if the extraordinary
characteristic of the accused tends to show that he would not commit an
ordinary crime of that nature (such as a homosexual being charged with a
heterosexual offence).  In the third, if it is shown that the crime is such
that it could only, or in all probability would only, be committed by a person
having identifiable  peculiarities that the accused does not possess, it would
be  admissible.  In the last scenario, the situation is the same provided that
the difference in the abnormalities tends to exclude the accused from the
probable group of perpetrators.

 

I question whether use of the terms
""abnormal"" and ""normal"" is the best way to describe the
concept that underlies their use.  The term ""abnormal"" is derived
from the English cases in which it usually connotes the mental state of
insanity or diminished responsibility.  See R. v. Chard, supra,
at p. 270.  The basic rationale of these cases is that ""normal""
human behaviour is a matter which a judge or jury can assess without the assistance
of expert evidence.  Canadian cases have extended the exception to include what
has been described as sexually deviant behaviour.  See Rosemary Pattenden,
""Conflicting Approaches to Psychiatric Evidence in Criminal Trials: 
England, Canada and Australia"", [1986] Crim. L.R. 92, at
p. 100.  The rationale underlying this extension is the relevance of the
evidence based on the distinctiveness of the behavioural traits of either the
putative perpetrator of the crime or the accused. This distinctiveness tends to
exclude the accused from the category of persons that could or would likely
commit the crime.

 

There are other reasons why the use of the term
""abnormal"" is no longer satisfactory.  Even in medical circles there
are differing views as to what constitutes abnormality.  See Pattenden, supra,
at p. 100, and David C. Rimm and John W. Sommervill, Abnormal Psychology
(1977), at pp. 31 and 32.  Moreover, it imports a value judgment on the
lifestyle of some groups in society.  This is aptly illustrated by considering
the statement of Lord Sumner in Thompson v. The King, [1918] A.C. 221,
at p. 235:

 








The evidence tends to attach to the accused a
peculiarity which, though not purely physical, I think may be recognized as
properly bearing that name.  Experience tends to show that these offences
against nature connote an inversion of normal characteristics which, while
demanding punishment as offending against social morality, also partake of the
nature of an abnormal physical property.  A thief, a cheat, a coiner, or a
house-breaker is only a particular specimen of the genus rogue, and, though no
doubt each tends to keep to his own line of business, they all alike possess
the by no means extraordinary mental characteristic that they propose somehow
to get their livings dishonestly.  So common a characteristic is not a
recognizable mark of the individual.  Persons, however, who commit the offences
now under consideration seek the habitual gratification of a particular
perverted lust, which not only takes them out of the class of ordinary men gone
wrong, but stamps them with the hall-mark of a specialized and extraordinary
class as much as if they carried on their bodies some physical peculiarity.

 

The difficulty in defining what is abnormal was
recently referred to by McCarthy J.A. in R. v. Garfinkle (1992), 15 C.R.
(4th) 254.  At pages 256-57, speaking for the court, he stated:

 

What dispositions are to be
classified as abnormal, as outside ordinary human experience, for the purpose
of admitting psychiatric evidence may be a difficult question.  A disposition
for sadism is clearly abnormal.  Dispositions for violence (short of sadism or
something akin thereto), or for dishonesty, are clearly too common to be
classified as abnormal.  In sexual offences, classification is less easy. 
However, it seems to me that, whether it be called pedophilia or something
else, a disposition in an adult to use boys of 10 and 11 for sexual
gratification must be classified as abnormal.  Accordingly, in the present
case, psychiatric evidence is admissible to show that Garfinkle does not have
such a disposition.

 

In my opinion, the term ""distinctive"" more
aptly defines the behavioural characteristics which are a pre-condition to the
admission of this kind of evidence.

 








How should the criteria for the admission of this type
of evidence be applied?  I find the following statement of Professor Mewett, supra,
at p. 36, to be an apt characterization of the nature of the decision which the
trial judge must make:

 

The categorization of crimes into the
""ordinary"" and the ""extraordinary"" is therefore a legal
question to be determined by the judge, as is the ""normality"" or
""abnormality"" of the accused __ to the despair, no doubt,
of psychiatrists.  But admissibility of evidence is a legal question and
depends primarily upon relevance, that is, upon its assistance to the trier of
fact in his inference-drawing process, and this is governed, not by expertise,
but by common sense and experience; words like ""ordinary"",
""extraordinary"" or ""abnormal"" are not meant to be
scientific expressions but assessments of relevance and are thus clearly within
the domain of the judge.

 








Before an expert's opinion is admitted as evidence,
the trial judge must be satisfied, as a matter of law, that either the
perpetrator of the crime or the accused has distinctive behavioural
characteristics such that a comparison of one with the other will be of
material assistance in determining innocence or guilt.  Although this decision
is made on the basis of common sense and experience, as Professor Mewett
suggests, it is not made in a vacuum.  The trial judge should consider the
opinion of the expert and whether the expert is merely expressing a personal
opinion or whether the behavioural profile which the expert is putting forward
is in common use as a reliable indicator of membership in a distinctive group. 
Put another way:  Has the scientific community developed a standard profile for
the offender who commits this type of crime?  An affirmative finding on this
basis will satisfy the criteria of relevance and necessity.  Not only will the
expert evidence tend to prove a fact in issue but it will also provide the
trier of fact with assistance that is needed.  Such evidence will have passed
the threshold test of reliability which will generally ensure that the trier of
fact does not give it more weight than it deserves.  The evidence will qualify
as an exception to the exclusionary rule relating to character evidence
provided, of course, that the trial judge is satisfied that the proposed
opinion is within the field of expertise of the expert witness.

 

(3)  Application to This Case

 








I take the findings of the trial judge to be that a
person who committed sexual assaults on young women could not be said to belong
to a group possessing behavioural characteristics that are sufficiently
distinctive to be of assistance in identifying the perpetrator of the offences
charged.  Moreover, the fact that the alleged perpetrator was a physician did
not advance the matter because there is no acceptable body of evidence that
doctors who commit sexual assaults fall into a distinctive class with identifiable
characteristics.  Notwithstanding the opinion of Dr. Hill, the trial judge was
also not satisfied that the characteristics associated with the fourth
complaint identified the perpetrator as a member of a distinctive group.  He
was not prepared to accept that the characteristics of that complaint were such
that only a psychopath could have committed the act.  There was nothing to
indicate any general acceptance of this theory.  Moreover, there was no
material in the record to support a finding that the profile of a pedophile or
psychopath has been standardized to the extent that it could be said that it
matched the supposed profile of the offender depicted in the charges.  The
expert's group profiles were not seen as sufficiently reliable to be considered
helpful.  In the absence of these indicia of reliability, it cannot be
said that the evidence would be necessary in the sense of usefully clarifying a
matter otherwise unaccessible, or that any value it may have had would not be
outweighed by its potential for misleading or diverting the jury.  Given these
findings and applying the principles referred to above, I must conclude that
the trial judge was right in deciding as a matter of law that the evidence was
inadmissible.

 

The Court of Appeal also supported the admissibility
of the evidence on the basis that Dr. Hill's evidence tended to rebut alleged
similarities between the evidence on the respective counts.  On this point,
Finlayson J.A. stated at p. 178:

 

Where, as here, the Crown alleges that the probative
value of the similar fact evidence arises from the circumstance that the acts
compared are so unusual and strikingly similar that their similarities cannot
be attributed to coincidence, the defence is equally entitled to lead evidence
as to features of the alleged acts which demonstrate dissimilarities....

 

The judgment of the Court of Appeal was not supported on this ground
either in the respondent's factum or in the oral argument.

 

The use to which the jury could put the evidence was
explained by the trial judge in his charge to the jury.  The key passage in the
charge in this respect was the following:

 

If you conclude when considering
any of the specific counts that evidence relating to any or all of the other
counts is so similar that common sense dictates the relevancy of such
evidence to one or more of the issues I mentioned earlier, then you may not
must, draw the inferences to which I have referred.  [Emphasis added.]

 








The similarities, which were detailed by the judge, were with
respect to the modus operandi of the perpetrator of the acts which were
the subject of the individual counts.  No objection was taken to this aspect of
the charge.  This use of the similar fact evidence relates to a different issue
from the subject matter of the proposed evidence of Dr. Hill.  As discussed
above, the dissimilarities addressed in Dr. Hill's proposed evidence are not as
to modus operandi but rather with respect to the comparative
psychological make-up of the respondent on the one hand and the alleged
perpetrator of the acts charged, on the other.  Furthermore, whether a crime is
committed in a manner that identifies the perpetrator by reason of striking
similarities in the method employed in the commission of other acts is something
that a jury can, generally, assess without the aid of expert evidence.  As
stated by the trial judge, it is a matter of common sense.

 

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of
the Court of Appeal, restore the convictions and remit the matter to the Court
of Appeal for disposition of the sentence appeal.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered orally by

 

                   Major J. ‑‑ The appellant raised
two principal grounds of appeal:

 

(1)               
Initially the appellant submitted that the Alberta Court of Appeal erred in
holding that the Crown's appeal involved a question of law.

 

                   We do not agree
that there was an error of law.  The substance of this ground of appeal is
whether as a matter of law there can be a recantation of perjury within the
same hearing, the effect of which would be to nullify the prior finding of the
completed offence.  This in our opinion is a question of law.

 

(2)
The second ground is that recantation of perjury can provide a defence.

 

                   In our opinion the
finding of fact by the trial judge, with which we cannot interfere, that the
accused intended initially to mislead the Court, coupled with the other
findings of falsehood under oath, results in a conclusion that at that point
the offence was complete.  A later recantation under the circumstances of this
case would not, as a matter of logic, negate an earlier intention to mislead.

 

                   Compelling evidence
dealing with the good but misguided motive of the accused should, as stated by
the Court of Appeal, undoubtedly count positively in his favour towards
sentence.

 

                   We therefore agree
with the conclusion of the Alberta Court of Appeal and the appeal is dismissed.

                   Sopinka J. ‑‑ The Court of Appeal
allowed the appeal from conviction on the ground that the decision of the trial
judge was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence.  In our
opinion, taking into account all of the circumstances including the evidence of
the complainant which was accepted by the trial judge, we are of the view that
there was evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting
judicially, could reasonably convict.  The trial judge was in the same
position.  The majority of the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that a
victim is required to offer some minimal word or gesture of objection and that
lack of resistance must be equated with consent.
