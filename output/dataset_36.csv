GROUNDS OF DECISION
The plaintiff is an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore practising at the material time and presently under the name and style of Ronnie Chong & Co.
The defendant is also an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore but has ceased practising as an advocate and solicitor and is now an Insurance Adviser residing at No 1 Anembo Court, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia.
Pursuant to a partnership agreement subsequently reduced to writing dated 27 July 1988 ('the partner- ship agreement') the defendant was admitted as an equal partner of the plaintiff in the firm of Ronnie Chong & Company with effect from 22 February 1988.
By clause 3 of the partnership agreement the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff the sum of $9,500 as 'premium' on joining the partnership.
By clause 2 of the partnership agreement certain existing office equipment belonging to the plaintiff were valued and sold to the partnership at $4,900. By clause 4 thereof, the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff $2,450 being his 50% contribution therefor.
Therefore the total amount payable by the defendant to the plaintiff on the defendant's admission to partnership was $11,950. The defendant paid the sum of $7,000. The balance of $4,950 by clause 5(ii) was to be paid on 15 June 1989.
From 23 April 1988 the name of the partnership became 'Ronny Chong & Arul'.
Under clause 6 of the partnership agreement all losses including loss of capital were to be borne by the plaintiff and defendant equally.
Pursuant to the partnership agreement the plaintiff and defendant as partners entered into a Lease dated 15 April 1988 for three years commencing 1 April 1988 with Singapore Airlines Ltd in respect of a portion of the 14th storey of the building known as SIA Building, Robinson Road, Singapore measuring 1190 sq ft at the monthly rental of $2.50 per sq ft.
For the purpose of the partnership the plaintiff and defendant entered into the following:
(i) a hire purchase agreement with Showa Leasing (Singapore) Pte Ltd whereby certain fittings and installations were let on hire with option to purchase to the partnership for $35,319.00 plus term charges of $3,033.00. After a down payment of $9,000 the balance of $29,352.00 was to be paid by 24 monthly instalments of $1,223.00 per month commencing on 19 May 1988;
(ii) an agreement with the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd and as guarantors relating thereto for overdraft facilities to the firm of Ronny Chong and Arul to a limit of $20,000; (iii) A Hire Purchase Agreement dated 18 May 1988 with Sing Investments & Finance Ltd whereby a 'Friday PC' word processor with Logitec 31 CPS Daisy Wheel Printer were let on hire with option to purchase to the partnership for $5,271.05 by 35 instalments of $134.00 per month and a final instalment of $111.05 commencing 18 May 1988; (iv) A Hire Purchase Agreement dated 13 May 1988 with Sing Investments & Finance Ltd whereby certain office furniture were let on hire with option to purchase to the partnership for a sum of $8,835.55 to be paid by 35 monthly instalments of $224.00 and a final instalment of $207.15 commencing 13 May 1988.
The partnership was dissolved with effect from 19 October 1988. The plaintiff and defendant then jointly instructed a certified public accountant one Subramaniam Sankaran to draw up the profit and loss account and balance sheet of their partnership up to the date of dissolution.
From 19 October 1988 each carried on his own practice with both agreeing to employ all the existing staff and using facilities of the former partnership until 30 November 1988 and paying therefor equally.
On 19 January 1989 the defendant removed his belongings from the office premises without surrendering the keys thereto to the plaintiff. It transpired that he emigrated to Australia thereafter.
As the Lease, overdraft facilities and the various Hire Purchase Agreements were entered into by the plaintiff and defendant as partners, the plaintiff remained jointly liable and he therefore had to and made payment thereunder.
Consequently the plaintiff claimed the sum of $79,677.49 made up of the following items: (i) $4,950 being balance of the amount payable on admission into the partnership by the defendant; (ii) $25,152.31 being amount found due according to the accounts of the partnership drawn up to the date of dissolution of the partner- ship by the said Subramaniam Sankaran; (iii) the sum of $3,462.68 being 50% contribution for the expenses of the firm from 19 October 1988 to 30 November 1988 when the plaintiff and defendant carried on their respective individual practice sharing expenses equally; (iv) the sum of $11,900 being 50% contribution for the rent of the office premises from 16 November 1988 to 15 June 1989; (v) the sum of $34,212.50 being 50% contribution for the office rent from 16 June 1989 to 15 May 1991. The total amount claimed for items (i) to (v) is $79,677.49.
On 25 January 1990 the plaintiff applied by Summons in Chambers Entered No 450/90 for final judgment in the sum of $55,877.49. On 24 July 1991 the assistant registrar entered judgment for the plaintiff for $42,002.31 arrived at as follows: (i) $4,950.00 being item (i) above; (ii) $25,152.31 being item (ii) above; and (iii) $11,900.00 being item (iv) above. The balance of the plaintiff's claim is to go for trial.
The defendant appealed. The appeal came before me. I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
Item (i) for $4,950.00 By clause 2 of the partnership agreement, 4 items of existing office equipment belonging to the plaintiff were valued at and sold to the partnership for $4,900.00. By clause 4 of the partnership agreement, the defendant agreed to pay half the value thereof at $2,450.00. By clause 3 of the partnership agreement the defendant agreed to pay by way of 'premium' the sum of $9,500.00 making a total of $11,950.00. The defendant paid $7,000.00 leaving a balance of $4,950.00. By clause 5 of the partnership agreement, payment of the balance of $4,950.00 was deferred to 15 June 1989. The defendant is therefore clearly liable for this item. Item (ii) for $25,152.31 This is the amount found due from the defendant to the plaintiff on the profit and loss account and balance sheet of the partnership prepared by the said Subramaniam Sankaran up to the date of dissolution of the partnership on 19 October 1988. In para 10 of his defence the defendant made bare allegation of error in the accounts and under valuation of the assets in the accounts. By para 11 of the defence, the defendant also contended that the accounts prepared by the said Subramaniam Sankaran, were not binding on him as he had not signed the same. The defendant relied on clause 9 of the partnership agreement which read:
""As soon as possible after the last day of March in each year the Partners shall make out or cause to be made out an account up to the said last day of March of all the assets and liabilities and profits or losses of the partnership and the same shall be signed by both parties and be binding on them unless some manifest error shall be found by them within three (3) months in which case the same shall be rectified.""
The affidavits of the said Subramaniam Sankaran filed on 14 November 1989 and 13 January 1990 confirmed that he was instructed jointly by the plaintiff and defendant to prepare the statement of account for the period of the partnership from 22 February 1988 to 19 October 1988. It also confirmed that the statement incorporating the valuation of Taha Rushton and Bailey Consultants Pte Ltd was given to the defendant with a copy of the said valuation report on 18 May 1989. The said Subramaniam Sankaran also went through them and explained the same to the defendant. The defendant never raised any objection thereto then or thereafter with the said Subramaniam Sankaran. In my view the defence filed on the accounts is a sham. Accordingly the plaintiff is entitled to judgment for this item. Item (iv) for $11,900.00 This is for half of the rent for the premises payable to the landlord, Singapore Airlines Ltd and paid by the plaintiff under the Lease for the period 16 November 1988 to 15 June 1989. The defendant's defence principally was that since he had ceased practice on 20 November 1988, and the plaintiff had been in sole occupation of the premises the defendant was not liable for the rent payable to the landlord. It was not alleged by the defendant that he was denied use or access to the premises of which he was a joint tenant. The premises had an area of 1190 sq ft. This was more than was required by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought unsuccessfully to sublet part of the premises. The plaintiff also requested the defendant to sublet part of the premises occupied by him previously. The defendant failed to do so and failed to return the key to the main door, vide plaintiff's letter of the 20 January 1989 addressed to the defendant care of Lee Jaswant & Partners as the defendant refused to divulge his address in Australia. Para 2 of the same read:
""As you have taken the brief case and the travelling bag, we presume that you are ceasing occupation of your said room with immediate effect. Please therefore make arrangement to let out your room with the consent of the landlord ... ... and return the door key to us for safe keeping.""
As the plaintiff being a joint lessee had to and continued to pay the rent for the premises he is entitled to be reimbursed half of the rents paid by him. The sum of $11,900.00 is calculated up to 15 June 1989. The proceedings herein were commenced on 28 June 1989. In my view the plaintiff is entitled to be so reimbursed.
Accordingly I dismissed the defendant's appeal with costs.",1992-04-09 00:00:00,SG High Court
