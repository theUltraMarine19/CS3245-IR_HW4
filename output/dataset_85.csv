Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiff is a widow who contends that her home has been wrongly mortgaged, her signature to the mortgage having been obtained by fraud. She now claims: 
 
 
(a) as against the mortgagee (the second defendant), an order that (i) the mortgage be declared fraudulent and void, (ii) it be set aside and (iii) the title deeds to her home be returned to her; 
 
(b) as against the company whose liabilities the mortgage was intended to secure (the first defendant), an order for damages; 
 
(c) as against the firm of solicitors (the third defendants) whose employed solicitor is alleged to have falsely witnessed her signature in the mortgage and attested her acknowledgment of execution, an order for damages.
  
 
 
There are also third and fourth party proceedings between the various defendants. The second defendant claims an indemnity or damages (or both) from the other two defendants as well as from the solicitor personally. The third defendants, in their capacity as second third party, likewise claim an indemnity or damages (or both) from the solicitor (now no longer employed by them) as fourth party.
The first defendant has not entered appearance, and a default interlocutory judgment in favour of the plaintiff for damages to be assessed has been entered against it. The trial has therefore proceeded with only the second and third defendants and the fourth party present.
I begin with an examination of the facts.
 The evidence of the plaintiff
The plaintiff`s evidence (given in Cantonese) was this. She was born in 1919. She came to Singapore from China when she was about 11 years old, not having learnt any English there. She had received ten years of education in the Chinese stream in Singapore. At school, she learnt English two or three times a week, but she claimed that her English was poor. After completing her secondary education at the age of 19, she became a primary school teacher and carried on teaching until her retirement in about 1974.
She had a husband, Hoh Sou Yen, and three children: 
 
 
(a) Hoh May Yin (born around 1952), 
 
(b) Hoh Weng Cheong (born around 1953), and 
 
(c) Hoh Weng Yip (born around 1964).
  
 
 
The property in question, No 64 Lorong 24A, Geylang (which I will call `the property`), is their family home, and was purchased in 1957 in the name of the plaintiff. In 1973, the plaintiff conveyed the property to Hoh Weng Cheong and Hoh Weng Yip by way of gift. Later, Hoh Weng Cheong married and wished to purchase an HDB apartment. It was therefore necessary for him to divest himself of his interest in the property, and Hoh Weng Cheong and Hoh Weng Yip then conveyed the property to the plaintiff and her husband in 1978, again by way of gift.
In early 1984, the plaintiff`s husband became very ill, and in February he was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he remained until he died on the night of 27 June 1984. Prior to his death, the title deeds to the property were kept in a safe deposit box in the joint names of the plaintiff and her husband. Around June 1984, the plaintiff took out everything in the safe deposit box, as she knew of a friend who had encountered difficulties in removing her belongings from her safe deposit box after her husband`s death. A few days after she brought the items home, the plaintiff handed the title deeds to Hoh Weng Cheong and asked him to photocopy them as a precaution. Thereafter, she forgot about the deeds until the events of November 1986, which I will describe later.
On 28 June 1984, the day after his father`s death, Ho Weng Cheong approached the plaintiff in her kitchen with two sheets of paper written in English, which he asked her to sign. Ho Weng Cheong told her that he was in business and that he wanted others to know that he was a man of good character. She was therefore under the impression that what she was signing was a form of testimonial as to her son`s character to help him in his business. She did not understand the documents as they were in English, and she signed her name in Chinese on the two sheets of paper. (The two pages signed by her are reproduced at the end of this judgment.) No one else was present at this meeting.
Contrary to her belief, the two sheets were in fact the last two pages of a mortgage of the property. The mortgage was purportedly made between the plaintiff and her husband of the first part, the first defendant (which I will call `Sourgrapes`) of the second part and the second defendant (which I will call `OCBC`) of the third part. Under the mortgage (which the plaintiff did not see until much later), the plaintiff and her husband jointly and severally guaranteed the credit facilities to be granted by OCBC to Sourgrapes, and the property was mortgaged to OCBC as security for the guarantors` obligations. Sourgrapes was controlled by Lee Boon Seng, the brother-in-law of Hoh Weng Cheong. (Hoh Weng Cheong was apparently working in Sourgrapes at this time and became a director shortly after the execution of the mortgage, although the plaintiff claimed that she did not know this at the time, or even that her son was involved in Sourgrapes.) Unknown to the plaintiff, Lee Boon Seng had negotiated with OCBC for a line of credit to be granted to Sourgrapes on the security (among other things) of a mortgage of the property, and Hoh Weng Cheong had been asked to secure the signatures of his parents to the engrossed mortgage. The two places where the plaintiff was asked to sign were in fact (i) the execution clause of the mortgage and (ii) the attestation certificate prescribed for mortgages requiring registration in the Registry of Deeds.
Also unknown to the plaintiff at the time, Hoh Weng Cheong, after obtaining her signature to the mortgage, forged his father`s signature. His parents` purported signatures were then witnessed by the fourth party (whom I will call `the legal assistant`), who also signed the attestation certificate. The legal assistant, who had been retained by Hoh Weng Cheong to act for Sourgrapes in the transaction, then forwarded the mortgage to Messrs Wee Swee Teow & Co, solicitors for OCBC, who advised their clients to release the banking facilities to Sourgrapes. The facilities were also guaranteed by Hoh Weng Cheong and Lee Boon Seng. The plaintiff remained ignorant of all these matters until the events next described.
Sometime around 12 November 1986, the Registrar of Titles wrote to Messrs Wee Swee Teow & Co to advise them that the property was being brought under the provisions of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157). A copy of this letter was extended to the plaintiff and her husband as owners of the property. When the letter arrived, Hoh May Yin was at home and opened the letter. When she read its contents, she realized that the property had been mortgaged to OCBC, and informed the plaintiff of this. The plaintiff then summoned Hoh Weng Cheong, who was not staying with them. He admitted that he had mortgaged the property to OCBC, and said that they had lost the house because his business (presumably referring to the business of Sourgrapes) had failed.
A few days later, the plaintiff went to the Jurong branch of OCBC (which was the branch in charge of Sourgrapes` account) and met the branch manager, Pang Tee Hiak. After obtaining his confirmation that the property had been mortgaged to OCBC, the plaintiff queried how her husband`s name could have appeared in the mortgage as he had already passed away. She also told him that she had not knowingly signed the mortgage. Pang Tee Hiak advised her that, since the mortgage had been signed by both mortgagors, OCBC had advanced the credit facilities to Sourgrapes. He also informed her that the amount owing on this account was about $224,000.
She then returned home, and summoned Hoh Weng Cheong again to ask him who had signed her husband`s name. He admitted that he had forged his father`s signature. He also told her that the legal assistant had `effected` the mortgage for him (which presumably meant that the legal assistant had acted in the mortgage transaction for Sourgrapes).
Some days later, the plaintiff returned to the Jurong branch of OCBC, and told Pang Tee Hiak that she wanted to sell her house to settle the amount owing from Sourgrapes. He said that he would have to check on this with his superiors. Later, he called her to say that this could be done. Since she had been told that the amount owing on the account was about $224,000, she wanted to sell the house for about $320,000 so as to have enough left over to buy an HDB flat. However, the highest offer she received was only $240,000, and so she did not carry out her plan to sell the property.
In December 1986, she summoned Hoh Weng Cheong, the legal assistant and Lee Boon Seng for a meeting to try and resolve the matter by getting these three persons to pay her compensation of $60,000 each. The meeting was held at the coffee house of the Hotel Grand Central, but nothing could be discussed because Lee Boon Seng failed to attend the meeting. Another attempt was made at a meeting a few days later at her house, but again Lee Boon Seng did not attend.
As no progress was being made towards a settlement of the problem, the plaintiff then decided to take legal advice. She went to see a lady lawyer, who obtained a copy of the mortgage, and for the first time the plaintiff saw her own signature and the forged signature of her husband. She then changed lawyers, and briefed her present counsel. On 21 January 1987, she lodged a police report against Hoh Weng Cheong at the Commercial Crimes Division. This led to charges being preferred against Hoh Weng Cheong and Lee Boon Seng for cheating OCBC. Hoh Weng Cheong eventually pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to a term of 18 months` imprisonment on 13 July 1987. Lee Boon Seng claimed trial and, at his trial on 2 May 1989, Hoh Weng Cheong gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution. However, his credit was impeached and, as a result, Lee Boon Seng was acquitted and discharged.
On 8 April 1987, the plaintiff`s solicitors wrote for the first time to OCBC to dispute the validity of the mortgage on the grounds that she had not knowingly signed the mortgage and the writ in this action was eventually issued in November 1987.
In the course of her cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted that she had made a loan of $30,000 in 1985. At the request of counsel for OCBC, the loan documents were produced by the plaintiff. They showed that she had made a loan of $30,000 to Sourgrapes at 4% interest per annum, the loan being guaranteed by Lee Boon Seng. The plaintiff, however, claimed that she had always believed that the loan was a personal loan to Hoh Weng Cheong to help him in his business, and that the guarantor was the legal assistant.
 The evidence of Hoh May Yin
Hoh May Yin gave evidence in support of those parts of the plaintiff`s evidence to which she had been a witness. She was English-speaking, and worked as a secretary. She had stayed in the family home until her marriage in March 1987. She confirmed the plaintiff`s account of how she had discovered in November 1986 that the property was mortgaged. She also accompanied the plaintiff on her second visit to OCBC, and corroborated her mother`s offer to sell the house. She was also present at the two meetings between her mother and Hoh Weng Cheong in 1986. She had assisted in trying to sell the house, and confirmed that the highest offer received was $240,000. She was also present at the two meetings with the legal assistant and Hoh Weng Cheong which Lee Boon Seng failed to attend.
In her cross-examination, Hoh May Yin became confused when she was asked about the $30,000 loan. She appeared familiar with the matter when it was first raised, but later claimed that she had no knowledge of it until it was mentioned in court. The next day, she said that she had heard about the loan when the plaintiff`s present lawyers were being briefed.
There was a slight conflict between her evidence and that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had given evidence that Hoh Weng Cheong hardly ever came home after he got married in 1978. Hoh May Yin, however, said that he came home fairly regularly (about once a month) and, when their father was ill, he came home very frequently, and continued to visit the home fairly often even after their father`s death.
One question that arose in the course of cross-examination of both the plaintiff and Hoh May Yin was how the property came to be valued on two occasions by valuers of OCBC, who had obviously gained access to the property for the purpose of such valuations. Both the plaintiff and Hoh May Yin denied any knowledge of these valuations, but said that Hoh Weng Cheong had his own keys to the house, and sometimes brought his friends back to the house when neither of them was at home.
 The evidence of Hoh Weng Yip
Hoh Weng Yip was called by the plaintiff only to explain why he had signed a joint statutory declaration with Hoh Weng Cheong, declaring that they were solvent in 1978, when the property was conveyed by them by way of gift to their parents. The statutory declaration was required by Messrs Wee Swee Teow & Co as part of the mortgage documentation (presumably to satisfy themselves that the provisions of s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20) were not applicable). It was declared before a Commissioner for Oaths on 29 June 1984, two days after their father`s death, and one day after the plaintiff had signed the mortgage.
Hoh Weng Yip claimed to know nothing about the mortgage, and his explanation for signing the statutory declaration was that Hoh Weng Cheong had asked him to sign it, which he had done without understanding what it had meant. According to him, Hoh Weng Cheong had told him that the effect of the document was that it would transfer the ownership of the property back to the plaintiff.
Hoh Weng Yip had completed his secondary three education in a technical school, and then studied in VITB for two years before commencing work. He was trained as a machinist, but had never worked as such; his last job was as a packer, but he was currently unemployed. He had received his education in English, and could read and write English. However, he gave his evidence in Cantonese.
This witness`s evidence was quite hopeless, as he was either unable or unwilling to answer most of the questions put to him in cross-examination. I will comment on the effect of this later.
 The defence of OCBC
OCBC only called one witness, Pang Tee Hiak. Although his account of the conversations he had with the plaintiff differed slightly from hers, I did not find any significance in the discrepancies. A contemporaneous minute he made on the day of their first meeting supports the plaintiff`s version in most material respects. The defence of OCBC was that the plaintiff knew what she was signing on 28 May 1984. This was supported by the fact that she had agreed to loan Sourgrapes $30,000 in 1985, which showed that she was willing to help Hoh Weng Cheong in his business. This defence was taken to its logical conclusion by counsel for the third defendants, who (without adducing any evidence) suggested that the plaintiff had willingly executed the mortgage to assist Hoh Weng Cheong`s business and (by implication) had stood by while he forged his late father`s signature. Counsel went on to suggest that subsequently, when Hoh Weng Cheong`s business failed, the whole Hoh family had conspired to make up the story that the plaintiff had been tricked into signing the mortgage so as to save the property from foreclosure or a mortgagee sale. I will deal later with the third defendants` defence on the issue of the negligence of the legal assistant.
 Analysis of the evidence
The plaintiff`s evidence was highly unsatisfactory in many respects. The following are but a few examples. 
 
 
(a) She said that she thought the loan of $30,000 was to her son personally, and that the loan would be guaranteed by a lawyer. Upon further cross-examination, she said that she thought the lawyer who would give the guarantee was the legal assistant, even though, on her own evidence, she did not know the legal assistant until after November 1986. Furthermore, she never satisfactorily explained why she wanted a guarantor for a loan to her son (whom she claims she trusted). 
 
(b) She also denied that she ever considered charging her son interest for the loan, yet the loan documents clearly showed that interest was chargeable at 4%pa. 
 
(c) Although she said that she had agreed to make the loan to her son instead of to Sourgrapes, no explanation was proffered as to why the loan documents were in the name of Sourgrapes. 
 
(d) She did not satisfactorily explain why she had made no claim against any party for the recovery of the $30,000 loan, when (on her own evidence) she could have sued Hoh Weng Cheong or the legal assistant. On her own admission, she never even mentioned the loan to the legal assistant on the two occasions she met him, apparently because she did not wish to raise the loan issue until the mortgage issue was settled. 
 
(e) One would have thought that, when the loan was not repaid, even if she had believed that Hoh Weng Cheong had no money to pay her, she would have looked at the guarantee in her possession. If she had done so, she would immediately have discovered that the loan was in fact to Sourgrapes and the guarantor was in fact Lee Boon Seng. 
 
(f) She also gave no satisfactory explanation for the fact that she had not sued Hoh Weng Cheong or Lee Boon Seng for fraudulently inducing her to sign this mortgage when, on her own evidence, these two were the principal culprits for her predicament. (I was informed from the Bar, however, that Lee Boon Seng had been made bankrupt.) 
 
(g) She said that Hoh Weng Cheong had moved out of the house in 1978, and hardly ever came back to visit. However, when asked how it was possible for valuers from OCBC to visit and inspect the house for purposes of producing valuation reports (of which she claimed she had no knowledge), she said that Hoh Weng Cheong had keys to the house, and sometimes used to bring his friends back to the house when she was not in. She did not explain how this was likely at a time when Hoh Weng Cheong had stopped visiting the family, and presumably would have had no opportunity to tell her of any visits made when she was not in. 
 
(h) Hoh Weng Cheong`s lack of visits would also imply a lack of closeness to his mother during the period preceding his father`s death, and yet she was prepared to sign a testimonial for him unquestioningly even though, on her own evidence, she had no real idea of what he had been doing recently. 
 
(i) Although she discovered the fraud in November 1986, she took no steps to write to OCBC to disclaim liability under the mortgage until April 1987, even though she had taken legal advice in January. 
 
(j) It was a strange coincidence that she should have handed the title deeds to Hoh Weng Cheong at about the time he needed to give them to OCBC`s solicitors. Furthermore, there was no clear explanation as to how he was able to obtain the insurance policy and property tax receipts as well. (All these documents had been requested by Messrs Wee Swee Teow & Co and furnished by Hoh Weng Cheong.) Nonetheless, I was inclined to accept her explanation that she had handed the deeds to him for photocopying, and had forgotten to get them back from him.
  
 
 
The evidence of Hoh May Yin was also unsatisfactory with regard to the loan, and Hoh Weng Yip`s evidence could effectively be discounted completely in view of his performance in the witness box. Indeed, it was suggested that he knew of the mortgage when he signed the statutory declaration, and, if he knew, he would not have done anything to facilitate it unless he had first obtained the plaintiff`s approval; hence, the plaintiff must have known of the mortgage. However, I am more inclined to believe that he was duped by Hoh Weng Cheong into signing the statutory declaration, and was now too ashamed of his part in this disaster to assist the court. At the end of the day, there was no other evidence in support of the conspiracy theory, and I cannot find that the defendants have discharged the heavy onus of proof required to sustain an allegation of fraud, which was not even pleaded.
Nevertheless, despite the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff, I find in favour of the plaintiff on the essential question of fact, namely, whether she signed the mortgage knowing the legal nature of the document. In my judgment, she did not know that what she signed was a mortgage or any document relating to the property. I make this finding for the following reasons. 
 
 
(1) I give allowance for the fact that she is not a person conversant in business affairs, and was unused to giving evidence in court, particularly undergoing cross-examination by several counsel in an unfamiliar language. 
 
(2) While she was often incoherent and illogical in her answers, she is now 73, and often had difficulty in understanding some of the questions and expressing herself clearly. I do not think that she gave her evidence with the intention of misleading the court. For example, she said, in answer to a question from me, that she had put on her glasses before signing the documents, although she could easily have said that she did not do so in order to strengthen her case. 
 
(3) Although the hypothesis of conspiracy suggested by the defence is plausible, it remains purely speculative, without any tangible evidence to support it so as to destroy the credibility of the plaintiff`s case. The only weapon in the armoury of the defence was to try and find inconsistencies in the evidence of the plaintiff or her witnesses. Although there were certainly such inconsistencies, I am afraid they are not enough for me to reject the plaintiff`s case outright in favour of the conspiracy theory, which I must adopt if I am to reject the plaintiff`s account of the facts. 
 
(4) Cross-examination of the plaintiff disclosed that she had previously signed conveyancing documents in English. The mortgage, however, was signed in Chinese. If the plaintiff had intended voluntarily to execute the mortgage, I think it more likely that she would have signed in English (as in the previous two documents) than in Chinese. I recognize, however, that this is a marginal point. 
 
(5) Although she was vigorously attacked in cross-examination on the $30,000 loan, she made no attempt to conceal the loan, and in fact volunteered the information (albeit in cross-examination). She also produced the loan documents when she could well have said that they had been lost. Again, I do not find her attitude in relation to the loan (however confused) consistent with that of a conspirator. 
 
(6) There was no suggestion that, at the time of signing the documents, she was attempting to cheat OCBC, or that she knew that Hoh Weng Cheong had forged her husband`s signature. If she had knowingly signed the mortgage to help Hoh Weng Cheong, she must have queried him whether her signature alone would have been valid, since her husband had just died, and I cannot believe that she would have been familiar with the niceties of land law (which I will explain later) that made her sole signature sufficient for the validity of the mortgage. 
 
(7) The factor, however, that weighs most heavily with me is this. To adopt the conspiracy theory is to postulate that the plaintiff, in order to buttress her fraud argument so as to set aside the mortgage, deliberately made a police report against her own son. Since she did this after having taken legal advice, she must have known full well that this was likely to lead to her son serving a term of imprisonment, which he in fact did. Her unchallenged evidence was that during his incarceration she did not visit him, and that she did not see him after his release from prison except to bring him to her counsel`s office to accept service of a subpoena. Although Hoh Weng Cheong was subpoenaed, he did not appear and, despite OCBC`s counsel`s submission that I should draw an adverse inference from his non-appearance, I decline to do so. It would require a mother to possess qualities worthy of Medea or Tz`u Hsi deliberately and cold-bloodedly to send her own son to jail in order to save her home. I do not think that the plaintiff is such a person. Indeed, the undisputed evidence is that, when she first knew of the mortgage and raised the question of the signatures to the mortgage with Pang Tee Hiak, she actually offered to sell the property to OCBC to settle Hoh Weng Cheong`s debt. In other words, she was initially prepared to accept the fraud perpetrated on her and to rescue her son even at the expense of losing her home, provided something could be salvaged. It was only when she could not carry out her rescue plan on acceptable terms that she decided to exercise her full legal rights and remedies.
  
 
 
In the circumstances, I am prepared to accept her account that she was tricked by Hoh Weng Cheong into signing the mortgage and that, when she signed the two sheets of paper forming the last two pages of the mortgage document, she did not know the nature of the document.
 Non est factum
This, however, is not the end of the matter. I now have to consider whether, in the circumstances of this case, the plea of non est factum can be applied. It is therefore necessary to consider the legal requirements for the application of this doctrine.
As a preliminary point, the parties accept that, apart from non est factum, the mortgage is an effective legal document, notwithstanding the forged signature of the plaintiff`s husband. Since the property was held by the parties as joint tenants, upon the death of the plaintiff`s husband on 27 June 1984, his undivided half share automatically vested in the plaintiff by virtue of her jus accrescendi. Accordingly, on 28 June 1984, his signature was no longer necessary to make the legal mortgage effective (although it is highly unlikely that the plaintiff or Hoh Weng Cheong would have known this). The plaintiff`s signature was all that is required for its validity and, if I find that the defence of non est factum does not apply, then the mortgage will be effective as such.
The modern law on this subject has been restated by the House of Lords in 
 Saunders v Anglia Building Society 
 1 (often referred to under its alternative name, 
 Gallie v Lee 
). Although each of the Law Lords chose to formulate the doctrine in his own words, three of the judges indicated that they were in general agreement with the speech of Lord Pearson and, as this is a well-known case, it is sufficient for me to quote a short passage from his judgment (at p 1034): 
 
In my opinion, the plea of non est factum ought to be available in a proper case for the relief of a person who for permanent or temporary reasons (not limited to blindness or illiteracy) is not capable of both reading and sufficiently understanding the deed or other document to be signed. By `sufficiently understanding` I mean understanding at least to the point of detecting a fundamental difference between the actual document and the document as the signer had believed it to be. There must be a proper case for such relief. There would not be a proper case if (a) the signature of the document was brought about by negligence of the signer in failing to take precautions which he ought to have taken, or (b) the actual document was not fundamentally different from the document as the signer believed it to be.
 
 
 
My earlier finding of fact enables the plaintiff to fulfil requirement (b) stated above (which I will call `the first requirement`). The documents signed by the plaintiff on 28 June 1984 were clearly fundamentally different from the documents which the plaintiff believed them to be. The plaintiff, however, still has to satisfy the other requirement (which I will call `the second requirement`) by showing that she was not negligent in signing the documents. In this regard Lord Pearson went on to say (at p 1037) : 
 
The word `negligence` in this connection [has] no special, technical meaning. It [means] carelessness, and in each case it [is] a question of fact for the jury to decide whether the person relying on the plea [has] been negligent or not.
 
 
 
Lord Pearson also said (at p 1035) : 
 
If a person forbears to read the document, he nearly always should be reckoned as negligent or otherwise debarred from succeeding on the plea of non est factum.
 
 
 
The concept of carelessness has also been explained by the High Court of Australia in 
 Petelin v Cullen 
 2 at p 360 : 
 
It is now settled beyond any shadow of doubt that when we speak of negligence or carelessness in connexion with non est factum we are not referring to the tort of negligence but to a mere failure to take reasonable precautions in ascertaining the character of a document before signing it. The insistence that such precautions should be taken as a condition of making out the defence is of fundamental importance when the defence is asserted against an innocent person, whether a third party to the transaction or not, who relies on the document and the signature which it bears and who is unaware of the circumstances in which it came to be executed.
 
 
 
There are many cases where the plea of non est factum has been raised, but relatively few where the plea has succeeded. Usually the plea has failed because the court has found that the signer knew the general nature of what he or she was signing, and therefore the first requirement has not been satisfied. However, there are cases where, regardless of the finding in relation to the first requirement, the court has examined the second requirement, the issue of carelessness. I will now discuss these cases.
In 
Gallie v Lee
 
[1971] AC 1004
[1970] 3 All ER 961
[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 itself, Mrs Gallie was asked by her nephew to sign a document which she could not read because she had broken her spectacles. She asked what it was, and her nephew`s companion (Lee) told her that it was a deed of gift of the house to her nephew. She executed it on that basis when in fact it was an assignment of her house by her to Lee. Mrs Gallie`s appeal failed because the court held that what she had signed was not fundamentally different from what she thought she had signed. However, Lord Pearson said (at p 1034) : 
 
In the present case the plaintiff was not at the material time a person who could read, because on the facts found she had broken her spectacles and could not effectively read without them. In any case her evidence (unless it was deliberately false, which has not been argued) shows that she had very little capacity for understanding legal documents and property transactions, and I do not think a reasonable jury would have found that she was negligent.
 
 
 
The modern doctrine of non est factum really commences with the decision in 
Foster v MacKinnon
 
[1868-69] LR 4 CP 704
 The defendant was induced to put his name on the back of a bill of exchange by the fraudulent representation that he was signing a guarantee. The jury was directed that, if his signature had been obtained by fraud and he signed it thinking it was a guarantee and not a bill, and if he was not guilty of any negligence in so signing, he was entitled to the verdict. The Court of Common Pleas approved the direction and made no finding on the facts.
In 
 National Provincial Bank of England v Jackson 
 ,4 Jackson, a solicitor, obtained from his sisters their signatures to two deeds. By each deed, in alleged consideration of the release of a debt of o400 and payment to them of o300, they conveyed their shares of mortgaged freehold property to Jackson. No money was at the time due from the sisters to Jackson, nor was any payment whatsoever made to them. The deeds were not read over or explained to the sisters, who had no idea that they were thereby conveying their property, and they signed in full reliance on Jackson`s statement that he was going to clear off the mortgage and wanted to send the deeds to the mortgagee. The issue of non est factum was one of the matters raised, as the sisters claimed that the conveyance they had signed was void on this ground. The English Court of Appeal rejected this contention. The court held that the sisters knew that what they were signing related in some way to the property, and this appears to be the main ground for its decision. However, Cotton LJ specifically said (at p 10) that the sisters had trusted Jackson `both as their brother and solicitor, and cannot be said to have been guilty of negligence in so doing`.
In 
 Bank of Australasia v Reynell 
,5 the defendant signed a guarantee to the plaintiff bank, thinking that his liability was limited to o500 when in fact the limit was o5,000. The New Zealand Court of Appeal denied the defendant`s plea of non est factum on the ground (among others) of his carelessness, since the amount secured was on the same page as his signature, and only a few lines above it. A single glance at the document would have shown the limit of o5,000.
In 
 Lewis v Clay 
 ,6 the plaintiff sued the defendant as one of two makers of two joint and several promissory notes. The other maker was Lord William Nevill, and the defendant admitted that he had signed the two notes, but contended that he did not know at the time of signing that they were promissory notes. The defendant had just turned 21, and had known Nevill intimately for some years. Nevill had asked him to witness some documents, producing a roll of papers covered up by blotting paper in which there were four openings. The defendant asked Nevill what the document was, but Nevill said that it was a private matter concerning his sister`s marriage settlement and certain pending divorce proceedings. The defendant, trusting Neville, did not insist on seeing the whole document, and accordingly signed in two of the openings (the other two being signed by Nevill himself). The defendant said that he had signed with the intention of doing so as witness to the signatures of Nevill, whose honour he had no reason to doubt. The jury found on these facts that the defendant had not been careless in signing the document, and Lord Russell of Killowen CJ accepted the finding of the jury on this point.
In 
 Awang bin Omar v Haji Omar bin Ismail & Anor 
 ,7 a Malay, who did not understand English, was induced by his brother to sign a contract in English on the representation that he was merely witnessing his brother`s signature. Laville J relied on 
Lewis v Clay
 
[1897] 67 LJQB 224
[1895] All ER Rep Ext 1738
 as authority for the proposition that `misplaced confidence in the person who obtains the signature by false pretences does not amount to such negligence as would negative the defence of non est factum` (at p 30). He therefore held that the `misplaced but natural confidence` placed by the Malay defendant in his brother was sufficient to establish the defence.
In 
 Credit Lyonnais v PT Barnard & Associates 
 ,8 a businessman who had attained seven `O` levels (but not French which he had ceased to study when he was 13 or 14) was persuaded to sign two documents which had been folded over and represented to him as receipts. He signed them on that basis when in fact they were bills of exchange in French. Mocatta J held that the defence of non est factum could not be established because the defendant had not discharged the burden of proving that the signer had acted carefully, but had in fact acted with `a remarkable lack of normal business prudence`. Mocatta J found the following factors relevant: 
 
 
(a) the defendant could have observed the dates on the document which were considerably earlier than the date that he was asked to sign; 
 
(b) certain tell-tale words could have been seen by him which would have at least put him on inquiry; 
 
(c) no explanation was given to him why the documents were folded and why he did not ask for them to be unfolded before signing; 
 
(d) there was no valid reason for the receipts to be required or to have any use; and 
 
(e) in any event, there was no reason for him to sign a receipt for goods without checking whether the goods had arrived.
  
 
 
In 
United Dominions Trust Ltd v Western
 
[1976] QB 513
[1975] 3 All ER 1017
[1976] 2 WLR 64
 the defendant agreed to buy a car from dealers on hire purchase. After paying the deposit, he signed the plaintiff finance company`s standard form in blank, leaving the dealers to fill in the figures. The figures were inserted incorrectly by the dealers. The defendant, when sued on this document, sought to raise the defence of non est factum. The English Court of Appeal refused to allow this plea, holding that there was no distinction between careless signing of a completed document and a document in blank, and that, in permitting the dealers to complete the contractual document, the onus was on the defendant to show that he had acted carefully, and that onus had not been discharged.
In 
 Bank of China v Chia Sook Lan Maria 
,10 the Singapore Court of Appeal had to deal with a plea of non est factum by a businesswoman who had signed a confirmation of deposit of title deeds under an alleged misrepresentation as to their nature, the businesswoman being Chinese-educated and the document being in English. Her contention was that she was told that her liability on the guarantee was limited to $100,000, when in fact it was unlimited. The Court of Appeal found that, while her English was poor and she could not communicate or understand properly in English, she had not established that she could not read simple English with understanding, particularly that she could not read the guarantee with understanding and not realize that her liability was unlimited. Accordingly, the court held that her carelessness precluded her reliance on the doctrine of non est factum. She appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, but the ground of non est factum was not relied on before the Judicial Committee, which dismissed her appeal.
In 
 Avon Finance Co Ltd v Bridger 
 ,11 the defendants, an elderly couple, unknowingly signed a legal charge of their property on their son`s representation that it was in connection with a mortgage which they themselves were taking out on the property, when in fact the charge was to secure a loan from another lender to the son. The papers were folded and they did not read them. The English Court of Appeal held that the doctrine of non est factum did not apply. Brandon LJ specifically found that the defendants did not exercise such reasonable care as was appropriate in the circumstances in entering into the transaction.

 Zainal Abidin bin Jawi v Mat Hassan Abdul & Anor 
 ,12 Lim Beng Choon J dismissed a defence of non est factum by a defendant, who alleged that he had signed a power of attorney empowering another party to sell his land under a misrepresentation, without stating the nature of the misrepresentation. Lim Beng Choon J quoted the speech of Lord Reid in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 ,1 highlighting those passages dealing with the necessity for a signer of a document to try and find out the general effect of that document. No further analysis, however, was made of the element of carelessness.
In 
 Goh Jong Cheng v MB Melwani Pte Ltd 
 ,13 the plaintiff, the owner of a property, was taken by her son to his lawyer`s office, where she signed a mortgage of the property in favour of the defendant. The plaintiff was an illiterate hotel cleaner aged 54 years. Her evidence was that, some time prior to the visit to the lawyer`s office, she had handed the title deeds to her son at his request to enable him to verify whether the title deeds were correct. When she went to the lawyer`s office, she was told that she had to sign a document to get back the title deeds. No one explained to her the contents of the documents that she was required to sign. Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was) held that the plaintiff was able to set aside the mortgage on the ground of non est factum. He accepted her evidence that she did not know that the title deeds were to be used for a mortgage to secure credit facilities to her son`s company. He said (at p 487): 
 
The son had deceived his mother who had remained unsuspecting. Having regard to her background, I think she could not really be expected to be worldly-wise. It is not unreasonable for a mother not to suspect that her son would harm or cheat her.
 
 
 
Although Chao Hick Tin JC did not specifically state the reason why the plea of non est factum applied, he had, earlier in his judgment, set out a summary of the decision in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 ,1 quoting the passage from Lord Pearson`s judgment that I have earlier quoted. Against that background, the passage that I have just quoted from Chao Hick Tin JC`s judgment must indicate that he had considered the issue of carelessness, and had found that the plaintiff had not been careless in signing the document which ultimately proved to be a mortgage.
In 
 Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Tay Keow Neo & Anor 
 ,14 the defendants had executed a guarantee in favour of the plaintiff. Their main defence was that the guarantee was obtained under the undue influence of their former employer but they also relied on the plea of non est factum. However, their evidence was that they were at all times loyal and dedicated to their employer, and did whatever that was required of them by him without question. They signed documents whenever and wherever they were asked to sign. They never read those documents they signed, nor were they told of the nature of the documents or their contents by anyone. They were not provided with copies of those documents they had signed, and were under the overpowering influence of their employer. On this basis, it was not surprising that Rubin JC found (at p 223) that the defendants had executed the guarantee `perhaps without reasonable care`. He then cited the principle that non est factum could only be relied on if reasonable care had been exercised in the circumstances in connection with the transaction.
In 
 Lloyds Bank v Waterhouse 
 ,15 an illiterate farmer signed a guarantee of a loan to his son by the plaintiff bank. He believed that the loan and guarantee were related to the purchase of a farm land by his son, and was given information by the bank`s officers to that effect. In fact, the guarantee also covered an overdraft facility for the son`s business and, when the son`s business collapsed, the farmer was sued on his guarantee. The English Court of Appeal upheld his plea of non est factum, holding that there had been no carelessness on his part.
No clear pattern emerges from these cases; no attempt has been made to develop the concept of carelessness through the cases, and for that reason they are not of direct assistance to me in deciding whether or not the plaintiff had been careless. It has been emphasized in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 1 that the issue of carelessness is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of each case. Each of the cases above turns on its own peculiar facts, although it may help me to know how other judges have approached this question.
The cases where the courts have held that the signers have been careless are self-explanatory. However, I need to make some comment on those cases where the courts have considered (without necessarily deciding) that the signer signed without carelessness. 
 
 
(a) 
Gallie v Lee
 
[1971] AC 1004
[1970] 3 All ER 961
[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 Mrs Gallie was effectively unable to read at the time because she had broken her glasses and, even if she had been able to read, she would not have understood anything relating to legal documents and property transactions. However, Lord Pearson, alone among all the judges in the three courts, thought that she had not been careless. Clearly this was obiter, since her claim failed on the ground that the document she signed was not radically or fundamentally different from what she thought it to be. However, it should be appreciated that the finding by Lord Pearson that Mrs Gallie had not been careless was on the basis that she was in effect blind, since she could not read without her spectacles, which were broken. She therefore had to rely completely on the explanation of the document given by Lee. 
 
(b) 
National Provincial Bank v Jackson
 
[1886] 33 Ch D 1
 The main ground of decision was in effect the first requirement of non est factum, namely, that the document signed was not fundamentally different from what the sisters thought them to be. However, Cotton LJ thought that they had not been careless in signing. I could play sophist, and distinguish that case from ours on the grounds that 
 
Mr Jackson was not only the brother of the signers, but also their solicitor. However, it seems to me that the remarks of Cotton LJ were unjustified on the facts of the case as reported, since there was no evidence that the sisters were illiterate or unable to read, and simply chose blindly to rely on their brother. Whatever the relationship between the signer and the person asking for the signature, it cannot be right that a person who deliberately chooses not to read a document, particularly one to be signed in a solicitor`s office, can claim not to be careless. However, Cotton LJ`s finding was approved by Viscount Dilhorne in 
Gallie v Lee

[1897] 67 LJQB 224

 This is a case from Victorian England where the issue of carelessness was decided by a jury, although the Lord Chief Justice appeared to agree with the verdict. I believe that the unspoken premise of the jury`s verdict was that the trust placed by the defendant on the word of an English nobleman was entirely reasonable, particularly where a matter of his sister`s private affairs was concerned. I venture to suggest that a modern English jury would not make the same finding, and a judge in Singapore would certainly view this decision with some caution. I have to point out, however, that this case was approved by Lord Pearson in 
Gallie v Lee
 
[1971] AC 1004
[1970] 3 All ER 961
[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 (at p 1034). In any event, this case is distinguishable from our case, since the defendant had been discouraged by Nevill from looking at the documents, while there is no evidence here of any such admonition.

Goh Jong Cheng v MB Melwani
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 482
  The representations made by the plaintiff`s son in this case were that the plaintiff had to sign a document to obtain the return of title deeds from a solicitor. Since she had voluntarily surrendered the title deeds for verification that they were correct, the representations were plausible enough in the circumstances for her to believe that it was necessary to sign a document for their return. I do not think that Chao Hick Tin JC was laying down a universal truth that it is always reasonable for mothers not to suspect their sons of cheating them. 
 
(f) 
Lloyds Bank v Waterhouse
 
[1992] 3 CL para 234
 The brief report I have seen does not indicate why the court thought there was no carelessness. Possibly it was due to the circumstances of the misrepresentations made by the bank: this would be consistent with the ruling of the High Court of Australia in 
Petelin v Cullen
 
[1975] 132 CLR 355
 that, where the defence of non est factum is asserted against the other party to the transaction, who knows or has reason to suspect that the document was executed under misapprehension as to its character, the lack of care of a signer will not of itself defeat the plea of non est factum.
  
 
 
There are other cases dealing with the negligence of a signer of a document in the context of the defence of non est factum, but they are either based on the tortious concept of negligence, or employ the language of estoppel by negligence, both of which concepts were expressly disapproved by the House of Lords in 
Gallie v Lee
 
[1971] AC 1004
[1970] 3 All ER 961
[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 I therefore omit any analysis of the reasoning in those cases. (Care has to be taken in analysing any case on carelessness decided between 
Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Co v Bragg
 
[1911] 1 KB 489
 which introduced these heterodox concepts, and 
Gallie v Lee
 
[1971] AC 1004
[1970] 3 All ER 961
[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 in 1971.)
At the end of this analysis, I find that the most helpful statement of the law on the element of carelessness in non est factum is the following extract from the speech of Lord Wilberforce in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 ,1 which was described by Scott LJ in 
 Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v Steed 
 17 at p 678 as: `[expressing] the approach and the principles that must be applied to a non est factum plea`. Lord Wilberforce said (at p 1027): 
 
In my opinion, the correct rule, ... is that, leaving aside negotiable instruments to which special rules may apply, a person who signs a document, and parts with it so that it may come into other hands, has a responsibility, that of the normal man of prudence, to take care what he signs, which, if neglected, prevents him from denying his liability under the document according to its tenor. I would add that the onus of proof in this matter rests upon him, ie to prove that he acted carefully, and not upon the third party to prove the contrary. ...
 
 
 
The preceding paragraphs contemplate persons who are adult and literate: the conclusion as to such persons is that, while there are cases in which they may successfully plead non est factum these cases will, in modern times, be rare.
As to persons who are illiterate, or blind, or lacking in understanding, the law is in a dilemma. On the one hand, the law is traditionally, and rightly, ready to relieve them against hardship and imposition. On the other hand, regard has to be paid to the position of innocent third parties who cannot be expected, and often would have no means, to know the condition or status of the signer. I do not think that a defined solution can be provided for all cases. The law ought, in my opinion, to give relief if satisfied that consent was truly lacking but will require of signers even in this class that they act responsibly and carefully according to their circumstances in putting their signature to legal documents.
The problem in our case, however, is that the plaintiff is neither literate nor illiterate in English, but somewhere in between.
Let me now turn to an analysis of the facts in our case. I find that the relevant factors are as follows. 
 
 
(a) The plaintiff was relatively old at the time of the signing (about 65). 
 
(b) Hoh Weng Cheong was her son, and a person whom she trusted. 
 
(c) The critical factor is the plaintiff`s understanding of English at the material time. She had been taught to read and write and speak in English at school, although she claimed that she could not read an English newspaper or write an English sentence. She admitted, however, that she could: 
 
(i) write the English alphabet, 
 
(ii) sign her name in English (which in fact meant writing her name in full), 
 
(iii) recognize her son`s name in English, 
 
(iv) recognize the address of her property, and 
 
(v) recognize Arabic numerals. 
 
My conclusion is that, while she was probably at best functionally semi-literate in English, she had some degree of familiarity with the language. I will return to the significance of this later. 
 
(d) She was a little equivocal about whether she had actually read the documents she was asked to sign. At first, she said that she did not pay attention to various aspects of the documents but, when asked directly whether she had read the documents, she said that she had not, because she did not understand English and therefore there was no point in reading them. However, she admitted that she had put on her spectacles when Hoh Weng Cheong showed her the documents, but I took her answer to mean that this was only for the purpose of signing. My conclusion is therefore that she deliberately chose not to read the documents, relying instead on Hoh Weng Cheong`s explanation as sufficient without querying or checking. 
 
(e) As a teacher, she must have been familiar with testimonials, although she denied actually having seen many testimonials in the course of her work. She admitted, however, that she had occasionally seen a form of testimonial. She also admitted that Hoh Weng Cheong had told her that the testimonial would be shown to other businessmen. The sheets of paper which she signed contained several features which a person with a basic knowledge of English and a reasonable amount of common sense would have noticed were inconsistent with the explanation that they were testimonials. 
 
(i) The two sheets were conveyancing sized paper, and were significantly larger than paper normally used for correspondence. 
 
(ii) The two documents were headed `10` and `11` respectively, indicating that they were part of a much longer document. 
 
(iii) Hoh Weng Cheong`s name did not appear on either document, even though they were supposed to be a testimonial about him. 
 
(iv) Page 10 contained peculiar figures such as `150.1 (square metres)`, `(Lot) 162-75`, `(Mukim) 25`, `(Grant No) 80`, which could not possibly have had any bearing on the personal qualities of Hoh Weng Cheong. 
 
(v) The address of the property, No 64 Lorong 24A, Geylang, Singapore, was also stated on p 10, thus suggesting that the document had something to do with the property. 
 
(vi) On p 11 there were two lines clearly indicating spaces for signatures (in fact for the director and secretary of Sourgrapes). This should have led to a query why someone else would be signing this page apart from the plaintiff. 
 
(vii) The plaintiff was required to sign in the middle of the attestation certificate on p 11 in the heart of a cluster of words with other blanks yet to be filled in, yet the plaintiff did not feel it strange to sign there, nor did she ask what the other blanks were for. 
 
(viii) Since pp 10 and 11 were clearly different, the plaintiff must (or should) have wondered why she had to sign twice. When I asked her whether she thought she was signing two separate letters, she said that she signed thinking it was a testimonial. When I pressed her on this, she simply said she did not think about it. 
 
My conclusion is therefore that, even with her limited command of English, if she had taken the trouble to look at the pages she was signing with any degree of care, some or all of these peculiarities should have struck her. 
 
(f) On the plaintiff`s own evidence, Hoh Weng Cheong had told her that this letter would be shown to other businessmen. The general format of the documents would have indicated that these were documents of some degree of formality, unlike a letter to a friend or relative. She should therefore have questioned him as to what exactly she was supposed to be saying about him to outsiders. Her failure to query him suggests that she was prepared to put her name to anything he wanted her to say about him. 
 
(g) Were I less charitable in my view of the plaintiff`s command of English, I would have said that the pages she was asked to sign were clearly conveyancing documents to anyone with a working knowledge of English. 
 
(h) It is difficult to imagine that a reasonable person, even one with a limited knowledge of English, would not have realized that the way in which the words were laid out on the pages (which possibly included the signatures of other persons, as well as the red seals) were not appropriate for a testimonial. 
 
(i) Above all, she should have realized that the excuse of the testimonial must have been a flagrant untruth, since no businessman would be likely to rely on a testimonial on Hoh Weng Cheong`s behalf given by his mother. 
 
(j) I have not forgotten that the papers were placed before the plaintiff to sign on the day after her husband`s death. However, it is impossible for me to factor this element into my assessment of the plaintiff`s degree of carelessness because nothing was made of this point in her evidence. She did not say that she was flustered or confused at the time when Hoh Weng Cheong asked her to sign the documents, or that her grief had clouded her judgment, and I cannot presume that she was so emotionally distraught that she should, viewed objectively, have been excused from looking at the documents more carefully, or from asking Hoh Weng Cheong more questions about them. Indeed, although it is extremely difficult to generalize about what a reasonable widow should have done on the day after her husband`s death when faced with such a situation, it might be said that the plaintiff should have told Hoh Weng Cheong not to bother her at a time when she was in deep mourning, especially when the matter was obviously not urgent.
  
 
 
Ultimately the question I have to ask myself is this. What should a reasonable person, possessing the qualities that the plaintiff did, have done when faced with the request from her son to sign the two pages? My conclusion is that, even if I treat her as functionally semi-literate in English, if she had read (or tried to read) the two pages, she would have realized, or at least suspected, that the pages she was asked to sign were not what they were made out to be by Hoh Weng Cheong. This in turn would have led to queries being made of him, possibly with Hoh May Ying being asked to assist, and I cannot presume that Hoh Weng Cheong would have been able to survive the plaintiff`s queries, particularly if she had asked him to translate the contents of the two pages and to explain the various matters set out in sub-para (e) above. Since she did not read the pages, she deprived herself of the opportunity to be put on notice, and I consider this carelessness.
At the end of the day, the onus of proving that she had not been careless (and Lord Reid in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 1 (at p 1016) described the onus as `a heavy burden`) lies on the plaintiff, and I find that she has not discharged this onus. This is not the same as saying that she has been fraudulent (a point made by Russell LJ in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 in the Court of Appeal [1969] 2 Ch 17 at p 40).
I have to bear in mind that non est factum is a dangerous doctrine for commercial, industrial, financial and even government institutions who routinely receive documents signed by parties outside the presence of the institutions receiving them. If non est factum were to become an easy doctrine to invoke, no institution could feel secure that such parties would not one day disclaim their signatures and invoke the doctrine by saying they had been tricked into signing the document, and had relied on someone close to them, a defence relatively easy to raise and difficult to rebut (even though the onus of proof would be on the signer). The attitude of the courts in modern times has been to restrict this plea as much as possible. In 
 Gallie v Lee 
 ,1 Lord Reid said (at p 1015) that the doctrine: 
 
must be kept within narrow limits if it is not to shake the confidence of those who habitually and rightly rely on signatures when there is no obvious reason to doubt their validity.
 
 
 
The current judicial attitude is stated by Scott LJ in Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v Steed (at p 676) : 
 
It is easy to understand why the plea is likely to be unsuccessful. A person who signs a document at the request of another puts into circulation a document on which, depending on its contents, others may rely. Where a fraudster has tricked, first, the signer of the document, in order to induce the signature, and then some third party, who is induced to rely on the signed document, which of the two victims is the law to prefer? The authorities indicate that the answer is almost invariably, the latter. The signer of the document has, by signing, enabled the fraud to be carried out, enabled the false document to go into circulation.
 
 
 
In the present case OCBC is clearly an innocent party, and, for the plaintiff to succeed, she would have to show exceptional circumstances over and above a simple plea that she was deceived by her son. Relatives sign guarantees for each other all the time, and fraud and deception between relatives is not a rarity. Although the plaintiff is an aggrieved party, she has not made out a case for relief at the expense of OCBC, but will have to seek her remedies elsewhere.
Accordingly, although I find that the first requirement of the non est factum defence has been established, the plaintiff fails on the second requirement. It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider the possible difficulties of giving effect to the doctrine in respect of a Torrens title mortgage (see 
 PT Ltd v Maradona Pty Ltd 
 18 at pp 675-683).
The plaintiff`s claim against OCBC is therefore dismissed, and OCBC is entitled to judgment against the plaintiff on its counterclaim.
 Joint and several guarantee
Another point that was not raised in the pleadings, but troubled me initially, was whether the guarantee given by the plaintiff (which the mortgage was expressed to secure) was still valid notwithstanding the death of the plaintiff`s husband, since the guarantee was expressed to be joint and several with her husband. However, on further reflection, I consider that this is not an impediment to the validity of either the guarantee or the mortgage. It is true that a joint and several guarantor normally has a right to expect his co-guarantors to be equally bound, and a clause in the guarantee providing that the liability of the guarantors will be `joint and several` normally carries with it the implication that the guarantee will not be binding unless all those named in the guarantee execute it (see 
 Rowlett on Principal and Surety 
 (4th Ed, 1982) at p 182, 
 The Modern Contract of Guarantee 
 by James O`Donovan and John Phillips (1st Ed, 1985) at pp 69-71 and 
Indian Bank v Ramachandran & Ors
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 241
  ). However, this implication need not necessarily be drawn, and, if the evidence shows that, notwithstanding the phrase `joint and several`, one guarantor signed without any expectation that the other named guarantor would sign, he can be bound despite the absence of the co-guarantor`s signature.
Although in practice it is assumed that a co-guarantor would not intend to be bound if the other co-guarantor would not be similarly bound, it is generally accepted that this presumption can be rebutted if it can clearly be shown that the first co-guarantor would have signed regardless of the other guarantor`s signature (see 
 The Modern Contract of Guarantee 
 at p 71). In 
 Walter and Morris Ltd v Lymberis 
 ,20 the Supreme Court of South Australia held that a guarantee signed by an individual guarantor was binding even though it was in a form appropriate to a joint and several guarantee. The court accepted the finding of the trial judge that the guarantor, when he signed the guarantee, contemplated that no other person was intended to be a guarantor jointly with him.
In the present case, the plaintiff is deemed to be bound by her signature because she has not been able successfully to invoke the plea of non est factum. However, her evidence clearly shows that she did not intend that her husband should sign as co-guarantor for the simple reason that she never knew that she was signing a guarantee. Indeed, once it is found that she is bound by her signature, she cannot be heard to say that her liability as guarantor was dependent on her husband`s signature since she knew, at the time of signing, that he was dead.
In the circumstances, I do not think it would be open to her, even if she had raised the defence, to say that she would not have signed the guarantee unless her husband had also signed it. I mention this point simply for the sake of completeness as it was not raised by the plaintiff as a ground for setting aside the mortgage or in answer to OCBC`s claim against her as guarantor.
 Claim in negligence
I now turn to the plaintiff`s claim against the third defendants, which only falls to be considered in the event that her claim against OCBC fails.
The plaintiff`s claim against the third defendants is based on the alleged negligence of the legal assistant, who was employed by them at the material time in: 
 
 
(i) witnessing what purported to be the two signatures of the mortgagors, and 
 
(ii) signing the attestation certificate at the end of the mortgage when in fact neither the plaintiff nor her husband had appeared before him to sign the mortgage or to acknowledge that they had signed the document.
  
 
 
There was an alternative claim for conspiracy, but no evidence was led in furtherance of this claim, and counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged that it had been abandoned.
The defence of the third defendants to the claim of negligence is three-fold. 
 
 
(1) The legal assistant acted in this transaction in his personal capacity. 
 
(2) The legal assistant acted outside the scope of his authority and outside the course of his employment. 
 
(3) The third defendants cannot be liable to the plaintiff in negligence because: 
 
(a) no duty of care was owed to the plaintiff, not being a client of the third defendants; 
 
(b) the plaintiff is not entitled to make a claim based on financial loss; and 
 
(c) the effective cause of the plaintiff`s loss is the failure of Sourgrapes or its directors to repay the sums advanced by OCBC, which were secured by the mortgage.
  
 
 
The third defendants have led no primary evidence to rebut the evidence of the plaintiff. The first defence was not seriously pursued, and I therefore treat the legal assistant as having acted in the name of the third defendants. The legal assistant gave evidence on his own behalf. It is clear from his evidence that he had allowed Hoh Weng Cheong to take the mortgage away for his parents to sign, and the legal assistant then signed as a witness to the two signatures (which he had not in fact witnessed) and also signed the attestation certificate in the form prescribed by s 12(6)(b) of the Registration of Deeds Act (Cap 269).
I therefore have to consider, whether under these circumstances, there is any liability on the part of (a) the legal assistant and (b) the third defendants to the plaintiff.
The first question to consider is whether a duty of care was owed by the legal assistant to the plaintiff. The curious situation arises in this case that, while the plaintiff never engaged the legal assistant or the third defendants to act for her in the mortgage (because she was not aware that there was a mortgage transaction involving her house) she now brings her claim against the legal assistant and the third defendants effectively on the basis that she was their client.
I consider that a duty of care can exist in these circumstances. Although a solicitor`s duty to his client arises primarily from contract, a person can be a client of a solicitor even if there is no contract between them. 
 Donaldson v Haldane 
 ,21 is commonly cited by various textbooks as authority for this proposition. A more recent authority is 
 Mouat v Clark Boyce 
 .22 In this case, the plaintiff was an elderly widow whose son wanted her to grant a mortgage over her home as security for a loan to be made to him. He took her to the solicitor who was acting for both the mortgagee and himself. At this interview the solicitor told the plaintiff that she should take independent advice, but she declined on the grounds that she trusted her son. The solicitor had made no inquiry about the financial circumstances of either the son nor the mother, nor did he discuss the proposed transaction with the mother outside the presence of the son. At the end of the interview, she signed the mortgage. Later, the son defaulted on his obligations and became bankrupt. The widow was called on to pay the moneys secured by the mortgage. She sued the solicitor`s firm, alleging negligence in both tort and contract. The case proceeded on the basis that this interview occurred before the solicitor had been formally retained by the mother, and therefore his duty to her at this stage was purely in tort. The New Zealand Court of Appeal found that he was negligent in: 
 
 
(a) failing to ensure that the plaintiff had her own independent advice in respect of the transaction; and 
 
(b) failing to refuse to act for her when he was already acting for the son.
  
 
 
The Court of Appeal saw no difficulty about holding the solicitor liable in tort even in respect of pre-contractual advice, namely, advice given before the contractual relationship of solicitor and client came into being.
In our case, the solicitors for OCBC had written to the third defendants treating them as solicitors for the plaintiff and her husband as mortgagors (see, for example, their letter of 26 June 1984). Requisitions on title had also been sent to the third defendants to be answered on behalf of the mortgagors, and the mortgage itself was sent to them for the mortgagors` signatures to be obtained and their address to be inserted. The legal assistant, on behalf of the third defendants, attended to all necessary matters on behalf of the plaintiff and her husband as purported mortgagors (including signing the requisitions on title as their solicitors). Clearly, the legal assistant had assumed the responsibility of acting as solicitor for the plaintiff and her husband, even though he had not met them and had not raised any bill against them (his firm`s legal fees presumably being paid by Sourgrapes). It therefore follows that the legal assistant owed the plaintiff the same duty and standard of care that he owed to a paying client (see 44 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed, 1983) at para 131).
Given the existence of a duty of care, has the legal assistant breached the required standard of care? The legal assistant`s actions in signing the mortgage as a witness and issuing his attestation certificate were clearly acts of negligence, falling short of the standard of reasonable care and skill expected from a reasonably competent solicitor, however inexperienced. No attempt was made to defend his conduct on this score, and a partner of the third defendants, who gave evidence on their behalf, in fact stated unequivocally that the proper course of action for the legal assistant in this case would have been to visit the plaintiff and her husband to witness their signatures if he was told that they were unavailable to appear before him.
In the circumstances, the issue of financial loss is a red herring. There is no universal rule that a claim based on the tort of negligence cannot be made in respect of financial loss; indeed, once it is accepted that a client can sue his solicitor in tort as well as in contract (and I accept the line of authorities establishing that there are concurrent duties in contract and tort for professional negligence) it follows that the damages arising from a solicitor`s negligence must, in most cases, be financial. If authority is needed for this proposition, I would only refer to 
 Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett, Stubbs & Kemp 
 23 and 
 Ross v Caunters 
 24 as examples.
I appreciate that this is a slightly unusual case of solicitor`s negligence where the primary negligence alleged is not anything said or done to the client but the statements made by the legal assistant to a third party resulting in loss to the plaintiff. However: 
 
 
(a) there are precedents for liability being imposed in negligence in such a situation (see, for example, 
Ministry of Housing and Local Government v Sharp
 
[1970] 2 QB 223
[1970] 1 All ER 1009
[1970] 2 WLR 802
 and 
Pisano v Fairfield City Council
 
[1991] Aus Torts Reports 81
 ); 
 
(b) the negligent misstatements ought not to be analysed in the context discussed in 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners
 
[1964] AC 465
[1963] 2 All ER 575
[1963] 3 WLR 101
 but simply viewed as negligence in carrying out a solicitor`s professional duty (albeit set in a tortious rather than a contractual context) because, unlike 
Hedley Byrne
 
[1964] AC 465
[1963] 2 All ER 575
[1963] 3 WLR 101
 the misstatements made in this case resulted in loss to the solicitor`s own client, not a third party; and 
 
(c) in any event, the legal assistant was negligent in not seeing the plaintiff before witnessing her signature and attesting her acknowledgment, and this would not be a negligent misstatement, but a negligent act or omission.
  
 
 
In passing, I would mention that, if the plaintiff had been completely successful in establishing her case of non est factum, OCBC would then have had to press its case against the third defendants for negligence, and I would have seen no conceptual difficulty in upholding such a claim (see 
Allied Finance and Investments Ltd v Haddow & Co
 
[1983] NZLR 22
 which I prefer to the more recent English case, 
Gran Gelato Ltd v Richcliff (Group) Ltd
 
[1992] 2 WLR 867
[1992] 1 All ER 865
 ). In short, whichever way one looks at the facts, there is no difficulty in concluding that the legal assistant is liable for negligence.
The defence of causation (or the lack of it) raised by the third defendants can be disposed of quickly. Pang Tee Hiak testified that OCBC would rely on its solicitors` confirmation that the mortgage documents were in order before releasing the facilities. Chan Weng Kee, the solicitor acting for OCBC, testified that he relied on the legal assistant`s signature as witness to the mortgagors` signatures as well as his attestation certificate in arriving at his (Chan Weng Kee`s) conclusion that the mortgage had been duly signed, after which he reported to OCBC that Sourgrapes could utilize the banking facilities. I appreciate that the witness to the mortgagors` signatures did not have to be a lawyer, and that the purpose of the attestation certificate is to fulfil registration requirements rather than to satisfy the mortgagees` solicitors. Nonetheless, the causative link between the legal assistant`s conduct and the release of the facilities is clear. It is another red herring to argue that what has caused the plaintiff`s loss is the failure of Sourgrapes and its directors to repay the advances. The plaintiff should never have been put in a position where she was at risk as guarantor and mortgagor to OCBC: it is this risk which was the foreseeable result of the legal assistant`s negligence, and the only argument can be about the extent of responsibility to attribute to the legal assistant.
 Vicarious liability
I must now deal with the issue of vicarious liability. The plaintiff is not suing the legal assistant directly, but the third defendants as his employers at the material time. The question is therefore whether the legal assistant`s negligence can be said to be outside the course of his employment, that being the only criterion on which to determine the issue of vicarious liability in tort. Several cases were cited, but it is only necessary to refer to the following passage from Salmond and Heuston on 
 The Law of Torts 
 (20th Ed, 1992) at pp 456-457: 
 
A master is not responsible for a wrongful act done by his servant unless it is done in the course of his employment. It is deemed to be so done if it is either (1) a wrongful act authorized by the master, or (2) a wrongful and unauthorized mode of doing some act authorized by the master. ... But a master, as opposed to the employer of an independent contractor, is liable even for acts which he has not authorized, provided they are so connected with acts which he has authorized that they may rightly be regarded as modes - although improper modes - of doing them. In other words, a master is responsible not merely for what he authorizes his servant to do, but also for the way in which he does it. If a servant does negligently that which he was authorized to do carefully, or if he does fraudulently that which he was authorized to do honestly, or if he does mistakenly that which he was authorized to do correctly, his master will answer for that negligence, fraud or mistake. On the other hand, if the unauthorized and wrongful act of the servant is not so connected with the authorized act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an independent act, the master is not responsible: for in such a case the servant is not acting in the course of his employment, but has gone outside of it. [Citation of authorities omitted.]
 
 
 
This paragraph has been approved by different courts on many occasions (see fn 35 on p 457), and covers the point better than the various cases cited to me by counsel.
Clearly, the legal assistant was doing negligently what he was employed to do carefully, and the third defendants must therefore accept vicarious liability for his negligence. On any criterion it cannot be said that what he was doing was wholly outside his job. In 
 Clerk and Lindsell on Torts 
 (16th Ed, 1989), it is stated (at para 3-22): 
 
An employee acting on his own initiative (rather than his employer`s) may be acting within the course of his employment. This will be the case where the employer either expressly or by implication has given the employee a discretion which he must exercise in the course of his employment. The employer will be liable for a wrongful exercise of such a discretion.
 
 
 
The evidence of the third defendants` partner in this case was that there were no restrictions on the scope of work done by the legal assistant, and that any other firm was entitled to assume that he was authorized to deal with mortgage transactions. Nothing else was said on this point, and I therefore assume that the legal assistant was free to do whatever work that was within the scope of normal legal practice in his own way (although no instructions were specifically given to him on how to sign attestation certificates). Accordingly, the third defendants would be vicariously liable for the legal assistant`s negligence in this transaction.
 Contributory negligence
It follows from my earlier remarks that the question of the plaintiff`s own responsibility for the loss ought to be considered. The only difficulty was that the defence of contributory negligence had not been pleaded by the third defendants. It is clear that such a defence needs to be pleaded (see `Contributory Negligence - Who Should Plead?` by KS Dass 
 
 [1992] 2 MLJ 
 lxxxi). At my invitation, after closing submissions had been made, counsel for the third defendants made an application to amend his defence to plead contributory negligence. This application was opposed by junior counsel for the plaintiff, who cited the following passage from the speech of Lord Griffiths in 
Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd
 
[1987] AC 189
[1988] 1 All ER 38
[1987] 2 WLR 312
 at p 220: 
 
Furthermore, whatever may have been the rule of conduct a hundred years ago, today it is not the practice invariably to allow a defence which is wholly different from that pleaded to be raised by amendment at the end of the trial even on terms that an adjournment is granted and that the defendant pays all the costs thrown away. There is a clear difference between allowing amendments to clarify the issues in dispute and those that permit a distinct defence to be raised for the first time.
 
 
 
Whether an amendment should be granted is a matter for the discretion of the trial judge and he should be guided in the exercise of the discretion by his assessment of where justice lies. Many and diverse factors will bear on the exercise of this discretion. I do not think it possible to enumerate them all or wise to attempt to do so. But justice cannot always be measured in terms of money and in my view a judge is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the litigation imposes on litigants, particularly if they are personal litigants rather than business corporations, the anxieties occasioned by facing new issues, the raising of false hopes, and the legitimate expectation that the trial will determine the issues one way or the other. Furthermore to allow an amendment before a trial begins is quite different from allowing it at the end of the trial to give an apparently unsuccessful defendant an opportunity to renew the fight on an entirely different defence.
Another factor that a judge must weigh in the balance is the pressure on the courts caused by the great increase in litigation and the consequent necessity that, in the interests of the whole community, legal business should be conducted efficiently. We can no longer afford to show the same indulgence towards the negligent conduct of litigation as was perhaps possible in a more leisured age. There will be cases in which justice will be better served by allowing the consequences of the negligence of the lawyers to fall on their own heads rather than by allowing an amendment at a very late stage of the proceedings.
The plaintiff`s counsel`s main ground of objection was that an offer of settlement had been made earlier, which had been declined by the plaintiff on the state of the pleadings as they then stood. The issue of contributory negligence had never previously been raised, and the application was now made at such a late stage that costs would not be adequate compensation. She agreed, however, that, if the amendment were allowed, no further amendment to her own pleadings was required, nor would it be necessary for witnesses to be recalled. There was no objection from the other parties, nor did they seek any consequential orders apart from costs.
I allowed the amendment for the following reasons. The plaintiff`s counsel conceded that the matter was one for my discretion, as reaffirmed by the speech of Lord Griffiths himself. In exercising my discretion, I considered carefully the words of Lord Griffiths, but found that the balance of justice demanded that the amendment be allowed. While the plaintiff was a personal litigant and the third defendants might (to stretch a point) be described as a business corporation, the true defendant was the legal assistant, a personal litigant who would bear the primary responsibility for satisfying any judgment. The fact situation in this case was quite different from that in 
 Ketteman 
 .30 There was no defence of limitation (which was an important consideration in 
 Ketteman 
 30), and it could not be said that contributory negligence was an entirely different defence or an entirely new issue.
On the pleadings, the plaintiff`s own claim against the third defendants was based mainly on conspiracy, with an alternative (but somewhat muted) claim for negligence. The defence of the third defendants, as it stood at the beginning of the trial, raised two defences to the allegation of negligence: 
 
 
(a) a denial that the plaintiff was entitled in law to sue for negligence because she was not their client, and because the loss suffered was purely financial; 
 
(b) a denial that the acts of the legal assistant were the cause of the damage suffered.
  
 
 
In this sense, the defence of contributory negligence was a fresh defence. However, unlike 
Ketteman
 
[1987] AC 189
[1988] 1 All ER 38
[1987] 2 WLR 312
 the issue of the plaintiff`s negligence was always a live issue, both on the pleadings and on the evidence in the course of the trial. By basing her claim on non est factum, the plaintiff took upon herself the burden of satisfying the two-fold test in 
Gallie v Lee
 
[1971] AC 1004
[1970] 3 All ER 961
[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 so the issue of her own carelessness was in the forefront at all stages of this case. It was precisely because of the evidence of the plaintiff that the question of contributory negligence emerged as one that had to be considered.
In any event, the third defendants had, in their original defence, specifically contended that the plaintiff had acted recklessly or negligently (or both) and without due regard or concern over the consequences of her act (although this pleading was made in the context of the non est factum issue). In the circumstances, it seemed to me a gross injustice if contributory negligence were not to be taken into account in determining the third defendants` liability to the plaintiff. I could see no injustice to the plaintiff apart from the anxiety and false hope factors (to which undue importance should not be attached), particularly since no new evidence or pleadings would be required. The plaintiff`s counsel was granted leave to make a further written submission, but no other party (including counsel for the third defendants) felt it necessary to make any further submissions. There was therefore no additional pressure on the courts by allowing the amendment.
I now have to determine the extent of the legal assistant`s negligence. From the findings I have earlier made on the question of non est factum, it is inevitable that there must be some apportionment of liability between the plaintiff and the third defendants. The plaintiff has failed in her claim of non est factum because I have found that she was careless. I appreciate that 
 Gallie v Lee 
 1 specifically disavowed any link between carelessness in non est factum and negligence in tort. Nonetheless, it is easy to view the plaintiff`s conduct as fulfilling the requirements of contributory negligence in this case. 
 Clerk & Lindsell 
 states (at para 10-166): 
 
... damages are to be apportioned according to the proportions in which the parties are responsible for the damage taking into account both causation and blameworthiness, and the amount recoverable must be reduced `to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant`s share in the responsibility for the damage`. [These words also appear in s 3(1) of our Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54).] Before any apportionment can be made it must first be ascertained whether the plaintiff`s fault has been one of the causes of the damage and, once this condition has been satisfied, the damages must then be apportioned according to the parties` share of the responsibility.
 
 
 
On the one hand, the legal assistant, in signing pp 10 and 11 of the mortgage without having seen the plaintiff and her husband, ought to have appreciated the risk of fraud, notwithstanding the closeness of his relationship with Hoh Weng Cheong, because the main reason for having solicitors witness and attest executants` signatures is to guard against fraud. Since he had voluntarily accepted the responsibility of acting as solicitor for the plaintiff and her husband, it was incumbent on him to ensure that they understood the nature and contents of the document they were to sign. If he failed to discharge that duty, it must have been foreseeable that one or both of their signatures could have been forged or obtained without due appreciation of the contents, particularly when they were obtaining no benefit from the transaction. And if forgery or uninformed signing occurred, then clearly his clients would be in exactly the same position as the plaintiff now stands, making exactly the claim which she now makes.
On the other hand, the plaintiff is clearly the part author of her own misfortune. I have already set out the reasons why she was careless in executing the mortgage, albeit unknowingly. The question is to what extent her own carelessness should reduce her own entitlement to damages from the third defendants.
Although the issue of contributory negligence as between clients and their professional advisers is not frequently raised, there are precedents for such apportionment. (See 
 Jackson and Powell on Professional Negligence 
 (3rd Ed, 1992) para 4-73 and cases there cited. In 
 Mouat v Clark Boyce 
 ,22 the New Zealand Court of Appeal held that the widow, who failed to take her solicitor`s recommendation to seek independent advice and to make her own inquiries into her son`s financial position, was guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of 50%.) I have not been able to discover any precedent for apportionment of responsibility in non est factum cases. Indeed, there does not appear to be a precedent for an action brought by a signatory who has unsuccessfully pleaded non est factum against a solicitor claiming damages for negligence. Nonetheless, applying the basic principles which I have set out above, it is clear that there must be an apportionment of liability.
As Richardson J said in 
 Mouat v Clark Boyce 
 22 (at p 572): 
 
Whether or not a plaintiff has been contributorily negligent is a practical question to be decided on common sense principles. In essence, contributory negligence connotes failure on the part of the person suffering damage to take reasonable care of himself (or herself) in his (or her) own interests.
 
 
 
This point is underlined by 
 Salmond and Heuston 
 (at p 507) who point out that the question of contributory negligence does not depend on any breach of duty as between the plaintiff and the defendant. In 
 Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) Ltd 
 ,31 Denning LJ said (at p 326): 
 
Whilst causation is the decisive factor in determining whether there should be a reduced amount payable to the plaintiff, nevertheless, the amount of the reduction does not depend solely on the degree of causation. The amount of the reduction is such an amount as may be found by the court to be `just and equitable`, having regard to the claimant`s `share in the responsibility` for the damage. This involves a consideration, not only of the causative potency of a particular factor, but also of its blameworthiness.
 
 
 
Both the plaintiff and the legal assistant have clearly acted carelessly, and their joint carelessness has resulted in the loss which is the subject of this claim. I can only echo the words of Richardson J in 
 Mouat v Clark Boyce 
 22 (at p 573): 
 
Weighing as best I can their respective shares in the responsibility for the loss which ensued I cannot with confidence attribute a greater share to one than to the other, ...
 
 
 
I therefore apportion liability in equal shares between the plaintiff and the third defendants as the employers of the negligent legal assistant.
As the property has not yet been foreclosed or sold by OCBC, the exact loss suffered by the plaintiff has yet to be determined. On the assumption that Sourgrapes and its directors are unable to pay the outstanding amount owed by Sourgrapes to OCBC, the plaintiff will be liable to pay OCBC the outstanding amount due. If she is able to pay off OCBC without losing her house then her loss will be the amount she has paid to OCBC. If, however, she is unable to pay OCBC, which then exercises its rights as mortgagee to sell the property (that being the more likely course of action than foreclosure), then the measure of her loss should theoretically be the difference between: (a) the open market value of the house at the time of the mortgagee sale, that being the date when she suffered the damage arising from the tort (and for this purpose the value must be taken on a willing-buyer willing-seller basis, and not the forced sale value likely to be realized on a mortgagee sale); and (b) the balance of the proceeds of sale paid to her by OCBC after discharging the indebtedness of Sourgrapes and the expenses of sale. However, regard may also have to be given to the need for her to mitigate her loss by exercising her claims for damages or indemnity against the first defendant, and for contribution against her co-guarantors, assuming that they were worth suing at the material time. There is also the question whether she should have allowed OCBC to sell the property earlier, either to realize a higher price than can now be obtained, or to stop interest accruing on Sourgrapes` account. All of this will have to be determined by the registrar on an assessment of damages.
 Fourth party claim
The third defendants of course have a claim for indemnity or damages against the legal assistant based on his breach of an implied term of his contract of employment that he would exercise reasonable skill and knowledge, care and diligence; alternatively, for the tort of negligence. The legal assistant merely filed what was effectively an extended general traverse, denying all allegations of negligence and breach of contract, but advancing no positive defence. This defence can be disposed of quickly. I have already found that the legal assistant`s conduct was negligent vis-a-vis the plaintiff. It follows that it was also negligent vis-a-vis the third defendants, and in breach of his implied obligations under his contract of employment. The third defendants are entitled to damages against him arising from his breach of contract and duty (see 
Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd
 
[1957] AC 555
[1957] 1 All ER 125
[1957] 2 WLR 158
 ). The third defendants will therefore be entitled to full indemnity from the legal assistant.
This has been a sorry tale to hear, with all parties to a greater or lesser extent being victims of the fraud of the true culprits, who have not been sued. It is distressing that the parties who are guilty of only negligence, and who can ill afford the loss, have had to bear it in this case. For the parties in this case, a bitter lesson will have been learnt. It is perhaps futile to hope that doting mothers will in future take more care in signing documents presented to them by their children, but I certainly hope that members of the legal profession will read, mark and digest this judgment so that they may understand the perils of witnessing or attesting the signature of someone who has not signed or appeared before them.
