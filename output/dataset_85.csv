     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Justice R A Hulme. 
     
      
    2 PRICE J: I agree. 
     
      
    3 R A HULME J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the asserted severity of the sentence imposed upon the applicant for an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm. For such an offence there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years (s 33 Crimes Act 1900) and a standard non-parole period of 7 years (Part 4 Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1900).4 Her Honour Judge English sentenced the applicant in the Newcastle District Court on 19 December 2008 to imprisonment for 5 years 11 months 12 days with a non-parole period of 3 years 5 months 16 days. The sentence was specified to commence on 8 December 2007, the date of the applicant’s arrest.5 The offender asked, pursuant to s 33 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that his guilt in respect of an assault upon the same victim be taken into account and he pleaded guilty, pursuant to s 166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, to related summary offences of assaulting and intimidating the victim’s partner. For those two offences the judge imposed concurrent fixed term sentences of imprisonment for 12 months and 6 months.6 The sole ground of appeal is that the judge erred by failing to take into account that the applicant was provoked by the victim. It relates solely to the primary offence.Facts 7 There was no dispute about the facts. Late in the afternoon of Saturday 8 December 2007 the victim, Mr Raymond Harrison, and his partner, Ms Melissa Gould were walking home. Their 11 month old son was being pushed in a pram. They happened to pass by the applicant’s home. Mr Harrison and Ms Gould entered the front yard from where Mr Harrison called out to the applicant. He was at home at the time with his partner, Ms Stacey Gaynor, her 6 year old daughter and her parents. The applicant came to the front verandah and there was a discussion which involved Mr Harrison asking for the repayment of a debt. The amount involved was less than $40.8 The applicant said that he was not going to repay the money and indicated that Mr Harrison and Ms Gould should leave. He then walked down the front steps and approached the pair, saying “I’ll take you ... and you out”. He then pushed Mr Harrison in the upper part of his body which caused Mr Harrison to fall backwards over the pram. That act constituted the assault that the applicant asked the judge to take into account. The pram tipped over and the baby became distressed.9 Mr Harrison picked up an empty stubby bottle which had fallen from the pram and chased the applicant down the side driveway. He threw the bottle in the direction of the applicant and it shattered, either by hitting the side of the house or the applicant. The applicant continued to run away. He came across Ms Gaynor and her daughter at the back of the house and urged them to quickly go inside. They all went inside and closed the back door.10 Mr Harrison called out, “What do you think you’re doing tipping my baby’s pram over”. Both Ms Gaynor and her father went to the front of the house and told Mr Harrison to leave. He and Ms Gould then left with their child and continued their walk home.11 About five minutes later they were approached by the applicant in his car. The car skidded to a stop. Mr Harrison approached in order to prevent the applicant getting to Ms Gould and the baby. The applicant alighted from the car with an object in his hand. Various witnesses gave varying descriptions of the object, including that it was like a short baseball bat. Ms Gould called out, “Put the bat down. That’s not fair. Ray hasn’t got a weapon”. The applicant responded, “You’re gone”. He then started to swing the object in front of and at the height of Mr Harrison’s head. Mr Harrison took a few steps back to avoid being struck and then turned to see where Ms Gould and the baby were. At that moment the applicant swung the object with both hands on the handle and struck Mr Harrison to the left side of his head. He immediately fell to his hands and knees, screaming, “I can’t see”. He then ran away out of fear of being further struck. 12 The applicant called out, “Run or you’ll get more of this”. He then approached Ms Gould who was holding the pram and said, “You’re next cunt, and that thing in the pram”. He then pushed her, causing her to fall backwards into a brick fence. The pram toppled over. Those facts constituted the related summary offence of assault. 13 When the pram tipped over the baby bumped his head on the pavement and started to cry. The applicant then said to Ms Gould, “I’ve got something for you. Don’t sleep a fucking wink tonight. I’m going to burn your house down with you and the kid in it”. Those facts constituted the related summary offence of intimidation. 14 Having observed this, Mr Harrison armed himself with a fence post and ran back towards the applicant. When they were each standing on either side of the applicant’s car, Mr Harrison threw the fence post at the driver’s side door, smashing the window and damaging the door. He then ran away. The applicant chased him but then returned to his car and drove off.15 Mr Harrison was taken by ambulance to Cessnock District Hospital and from there he was transferred to John Hunter Hospital where he remained for four days. He suffered a ruptured cornea, facial lacerations and multiple orbital and facial fractures. He lost the eye. A few days after he was released he was readmitted for surgery to repair the fractures. He underwent a left orbital floor reconstruction and repair of the left zygomaxillary orbital complex with multiple plates and screws inserted. He remained in hospital for a further two days.16 Mr Harrison made a victim impact statement in which he related how he had been unable to resume his employment in his trade as a boilermaker. He now wears a glass eye. His face where the plates and screws were inserted is numb. He has experienced multiple psychological problems. He is required to take medication. He has become socially withdrawn. The judge concluded that he suffers substantial ongoing physical and emotional harm.Subjective features17 The applicant is 38 years of age. As a child he suffered a significant head injury following an accident whilst riding a bicycle. His father is in poor health. His mother died some years ago. The applicant developed an addiction to “speed” and “ice” following his mother’s death. 18 The judge had before her a report of neuropsychological testing by Dr Susan Pulman. The applicant was found to have a verbal IQ and full scale IQ in the extremely low range. His non-verbal IQ was assessed as being in the borderline range. He has a marked impairment of memory and capacity to learn. He exhibits behavioural difficulties consistent with cognitive impairment. Comparison with earlier test results revealed that he has suffered deterioration in his overall level of intellectual functioning. He satisfies the criteria of having a mild intellectual disability. 19 Reports by Dr Adam Martin, a forensic psychiatrist, were also before the judge. It was Dr Martin’s opinion that the applicant had features of low intelligence and difficulties with cognitive tasks such as concentration, memory and language skills, probably as a result of his acquired brain injury. He also has frontal executive dysfunction with problems such as impulsivity, poor planning and judgment. Dr Martin thought that the applicant also displayed symptoms of amphetamine dependence. He was also of the opinion that the applicant is impulsive, has difficulty forming judgment, and is liable to extreme outbursts of anger with impaired memory for what has done. His inability to control his temper and his sudden rages are, in the opinion of the doctor, secondary to the brain damage. 20 The judge specifically took into account that the applicant suffers from a significant brain injury resulting in mild intellectual impairment. She said that she regarded his offending behaviour as being clearly linked to his mental illness which was exacerbated by his continuing abuse of prohibited drugs. She found that the causal connection between the applicant’s mental health and the offence reduced the importance of general deterrence although she also found that specific deterrence and protection of the community “does loom somewhat larger”. 21 The judge noted that it was “surprising” that with those two features the applicant had only minor criminal antecedents. The applicant’s criminal history comprised convictions for offences of drink driving, goods in custody, larceny, assault, possession of prohibited drugs and driving offences. These matters had been the subject of fines and bonds. The judge took into account that at the time of the instant offence the applicant was subject to two s 9 bonds for offences of goods in custody. When he was arrested for the instant offence he was also charged with driving whilst disqualified and driving an unregistered and uninsured vehicle. He was fined for the latter two offences but imprisoned for two months for the offence of disqualified driving. That sentence was specified to commence on 5 March 2008. The sentence imposed by the judge totally subsumed that sentence.22 The applicant pleaded guilty on the date his matter was listed for trial, although the Crown Prosecutor informed the judge that his representatives had put the Crown on notice of the plea four days earlier. The judge allowed a discount of 15 percent and there is no complaint by the applicant about that.23 The judge found that the applicant was “truly remorseful and contrite”. She regarded his prospects of rehabilitation as “guarded”. She referred to the recommendation of Dr Pulman that the applicant would benefit from psychological support, anger management training and drug and alcohol counselling specifically designed for clients with a history of traumatic brain injury. She also noted that the applicant retained the support of his father and his partner who both gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. 24 Special circumstances were found that warranted a reduction of the proportion of the overall sentence represented by the non-parole period. These were said to be the fact that the applicant had not previously been in custody and that the effects of his brain injury would make incarceration more onerous. The judge also referred to the need for a lengthy period of specialised supervised parole in accordance with the recommendations of Dr Pulman. Assessment of objective seriousness25 The judge stated that were it not for the applicant’s brain injury the offence would have fallen within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. In coming to that conclusion she took into account that at the time Mr Harrison was struck he had offered no violence towards the offender. She found that the level of force used by the applicant with the weapon was substantial. The injury was serious and Mr Harrison had suffered substantial ongoing permanent physical and emotional harm. She specifically referred to the offence involving the use of a weapon and being committed in the presence of a child, albeit a baby. 26 An issue before the judge was whether she should find in the applicant’s favour that he had been provoked by Mr Harrison and this constitutes the sole ground of appeal.Ground: That the learned sentencing judge failed to take into account as a mitigating factor that the applicant was provoked by the victim pursuant to s 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.27 This ground is concerned with the following passage from the judge’s remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        I am asked to find that the applicant was provoked by the perceived attack upon him and his partner. Had this offence been committed at that moment, that would have been a finding open to make. However, the victim had left and the offender made a conscious decision to get into his motor vehicle and drive to find the victim. At the time he assaulted the victim, the victim was not acting in an aggressive way towards him or provoking him in any way. There was a break in the causal nexus in the circumstances. 
        
       
      
    28 The first “complaint” that was made was that “it does not appear that her Honour was concerned that the victim’s conduct was not capable of supporting a conclusion that the applicant was provoked”. So much may be accepted. It was possible that the act of Mr Harrison chasing the applicant down the side of the house and throwing a beer bottle at him which broke and shattered around him could be regarded as provocation. The issue, however, was whether the act of the appellant attacking Mr Harrison with a bat some 5 minutes later and 500 metres away was the product of any such provocation.29 The second “complaint” concerns the gravity of the provocation. Reference was made to the evidence given by the applicant that he was angry because he had just had a bottle thrown at him and, he claimed, at his fiancée and daughter. There was evidence that the applicant was liable to outbursts of anger because of his cognitive deficits. It was submitted that it was “not clear whether the applicant’s cognitive deficits were taken into account in assessing the gravity of the provocation”. The first point to make is that the judge did not find that there was provocation and so there was no occasion for her to consider its gravity. Further, it must be noted that the judge did find that there was a link between the applicant’s offending behaviour and his mental illness and she made this finding after considerable reference to the evidence as to the applicant’s impaired intellectual functioning. Specific reference was made to the opinion of Dr Martin that the applicant was liable to extreme outbursts of anger and had an inability to control his temper and his sudden rages. 30 It was then submitted that the applicant did experience a loss of self-control. He did not give evidence to that effect because he claimed to have no memory of what occurred after the bottle was thrown. However, on behalf of the applicant it was submitted that there was other evidence to support a finding that there was a loss of self-control. Dr Martin was asked to report on whether the applicant had the capacity to form the specific intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. He responded in the affirmative but said that it was “in the context of sudden explosive rage secondary to a dispute and physical altercation with the alleged victim”. In a further report in relation the applicant’s capacity to form the intent, he stated that the applicant “reports essentially being provoked in an escalating argument over money, especially after allegedly being hit by glass and seeing a bottle being thrown near his family”. 31 The fourth “complaint” is that the judge was in error in finding that provocation was a finding that was open if the applicant had acted immediately upon Mr Harrison throwing the bottle at him. It was submitted that there is no requirement for contemporaneity for provocation to apply as a mitigating factor. Reference was made to the judgment of Gleeson CJ in R v Chhay (1994) 72 A Crim R 1 in support of this proposition which is uncontroversial.32 I do not interpret the judge’s remarks as amounting to a statement that provocation cannot be established if the response to the provocative act is not immediate. She found that there was not a causal nexus, not only because of the time that elapsed but because of what occurred in that period – Mr Harrison left and the applicant made a conscious decision to get into his car to go and find him. She also took into account that when the applicant found Mr Harrison, Mr Harrison was not acting aggressively or provocatively. What this involved was the judge making findings of fact. They were findings that were open on the evidence. Her conclusion that provocation was not established was an available one.33 There is something of an air of unreality about the applicant’s contentions. Sight should not be lost of the fact that it was the applicant who initiated the violence that occurred. He was physically and verbally aggressive in response to Mr Harrison’s request for the repayment of a debt. Mr Harrison responded by throwing a bottle at or near him. The applicant became enraged at this. He said in his evidence, “I was angry, not, like I was angry mate. I got a bottle thrown at me, at me, and not just me, me fiancée and me daughter”. He then said that he did not remember what occurred after that. The other evidence established that some five minutes later he attacked Mr Harrison with an implement like a bat and was also physically and verbally aggressive towards Ms Gould.34 Spigelman CJ stated in Regina v White, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 June 1998, unreported: 
     
      
       
        
        It is not the case that every explanation of conduct constitutes a matter of mitigation. The circumstances in which motive, whether characterised as provocation or not, may be a mitigating factor must be confined to cases in which motive impinges upon the moral culpability of the prisoner. These can include mental, emotional or medical problems or impulsive conduct. 
        
       
      
    35 In the present case, whether or not the conduct of the victim was characterised as provocation, there is no doubt that the judge was alive to the circumstances in which the offence occurred and took into account the applicant’s impaired intellectual functioning as reducing his moral culpability. That impaired intellectual functioning included an inability to control temper and liability to extreme outbursts of anger. The judge was fully cognisant of this. It was relevant to explain the applicant’s offending conduct and the judge took it into account in finding that the offence was less objectively serious that it otherwise would have been, absent the applicant’s mental condition.36 I am not persuaded that there was any error in the exercise of the judge’s fact finding task or in the manner in which she exercised her sentencing discretion. The assault upon Mr Harrison was a serious one and he suffered substantial adverse physical and psychological consequences. In all of the circumstances I regard the sentence imposed as quite moderate. Even if error had been established I am of the view that no lesser sentence would be warranted: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.37 I proposed that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    38 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The orders will be as proposed by Justice R A Hulme.

      eX TEMPORE Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIDDEN J: On 3 May 2005 the appellant, Allen George Warren, was involved in a violent incident with police at his home at Cooks Hill. He was arrested and charged with several indictable offences. After his committal for trial he was found unfit to be tried. In due course, a special hearing under the relevant provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act (as it was then known) was conducted at Newcastle District Court before Coolahan DCJ, sitting without a jury. 
     
      
    2 His Honour found, on the limited evidence available, that the appellant had committed the following offences: 
     
      
       
        assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty; 
       
       
        malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm;  
       
       
        using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension. 
       
       
      Subsequently, his Honour imposed a limiting term of 18 months for the offence of malicious wounding with intent and placed the appellant on good behaviour bonds for the other two offences. 
       
      
    3 By s 2 of the Criminal Appeal Act, for the purposes of that Act a finding at a special hearing that the accused committed an offence is classified as a conviction, and a limiting term as a sentence. The appellant appeals against conviction, although it appears only in relation to the conviction on the charge of malicious wounding with intent. He has prepared and argued his case without legal representation. 
     
      
    4 The facts as his Honour found them are conveniently summarised in the Crown’s written submissions in this way. At the time of the events the appellant was floridly delusional, one of his delusions being a belief that he had sustained a fractured jaw. To distract himself from the severe pain he perceived he was suffering, he played loud music. It was in response to a noise complaint that police officers Folwell and Nixon attended his property at Unit 8/65-67 Dawson Street, Cooks Hill, at about 4.30am on 3 May 2005. 
     
      
    5 The officers knocked on the door several times, identified themselves and stated their purpose was to speak to him about the music. When the music was turned up the appellant was warned by Officer Nixon, “Turn the music down on we’ll get a warrant and come back and turn it off.” Further attempts to get the attention of the appellant were unsuccessful. 
     
      
    6 The police officers returned to the appellant’s unit in possession of an entry warrant at 6.30am. The appellant refused to open the door and entry to the unit was forced by Officer Folwell. The appellant, who wore only a shirt, rushed forward, swinging his arms around wildly towards Folwell. Folwell took a hold of the appellant’s right arm, and the appellant resisted violently, twisting and trying to push into him. 
     
      
    7 Constable Nixon administered capsicum spray to the appellant and thereafter efforts to decontaminate the appellant were resisted. The appellant spat at Officer Gallucci, and it was this which gave rise to the charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. 
     
      
    8 When Constable Folwell attempted to effect arrest, the appellant struck him to the top of the head with a weapon several times, causing wounds. It was this which led to the major charge of malicious wounding with intent. The weapon had a long wooden handle with the metal head of a wood splitter attached to the end of the handle with glue and copper wire. 
     
      
    9 During the ensuing struggle the appellant continued to swing the weapon, striking another officer in the left arm with the handle of the weapon. This conduct gave rise to the charge of using a weapon with intent to avoid lawful apprehension. The appellant was disarmed and handcuffed. 
     
      
    10 Constable Folwell was taken by ambulance to the John Hunter Hospital. The two lacerations to the top of his head were sutured, with four stitches being placed in each. He also had bruises to the top of his head and forehead, and a bleeding nose and strained neck. 
     
      
    11 The appellant was interviewed, and stated that he had the music up loud as his jaw was in pain from an injury and the music provided him with some relief. He conceded that he had heard the police request that he turn the music down and warn that they would force their way in if necessary. He stated he could recall being sprayed with the OC spray, struck with a baton and handcuffed, but he could not remember the incident itself. He admitted that he owned the weapon, which he said was a geological hammer. 
     
      
    12 It is unnecessary to examine the evidence of each of the Crown witnesses. The appellant did not give evidence at the trial, but psychiatric reports were tendered in his case. Again, for the purposes of the appeal it is not necessary to examine that material. 
     
      
    13 The appellant filed a notice of appeal and application for leave to appeal, in which two grounds are expressed. The first relates to sentence, to which I shall return. The second asserts that the malicious wounding with intent offence “is not grievous bodily harm and neither is it intent to inflict such, because police evidence states the weapon was used with the left hand by a right handed person, thus eliminating intent”.  
     
      
    14 In a separate document headed “Submissions” the appellant asserts that the injuries incurred by Constable Folwell did not amount to grievous bodily harm and repeats the argument about the weapon being held in the left hand, noting that he is not ambidextrous. In oral submissions this morning the appellant added that, on the evidence, he is alleged to have wielded the weapon while he was in a lying position. He also notes that “Constable Folwell says that he was hit five times with the hammer, yet he only incurred two cuts, inclusive of hitting his head on the wall …” 
     
      
    15 The relevant charge, of course, was malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. That charge does not involve proof that grievous bodily harm was in fact caused. The evidence was that Constable Folwell suffered lacerations to the head, constituting a wounding. The inference that the appellant intended to cause grievous bodily harm was readily available from the nature of the weapon he used, which his Honour described as “formidable”, the way in which it was wielded and the fact that it was directed to the officer’s head. Evidence that he used his left hand, rather than his dominant right hand, is not to the point. Nor was evidence that he was in a prone position at the time. His Honour had regard to that evidence in arriving at his conclusion. 
     
      
    16 Nor is it to the point that Constable Folwell gave evidence of being struck some five times and also striking his forehead and nose against the wall. The fact remains that, in the course of the incident, he suffered two lacerations or wounds fairly attributable to blows from the weapon. Clearly, those wounds could have been the result of more than two blows.  
     
      
    17 The points raised by the appellant are really no more than criticisms of findings which were clearly open to his Honour, and neither individually nor in their combination do they provide any basis for disturbing his Honour’s verdict.  
     
      
       
      I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
       
      
    18 On sentence, the notice of appeal asserts that the sentence for the malicious wounding with intent offence is too severe. The submissions note, correctly, that the appellant had not committed an offence of any kind for some years prior to the incident, and that he had not previously been convicted of an offence of this kind. It is also said that his Honour intended to give the appellant “an 18 month suspended sentence but at the last moment changed his mind and made it an 18 month limiting term”.  
     
      
    19 It is clear from the remarks on sentence that his Honour had regard to the appellant’s limited criminal history and the fact that it contained no entry for an offence of violence. As to the possibility of a suspended sentence, far from indicating that he intended to do so, his Honour concluded that it was not an option available to him. Although not the subject of full argument today, this appears to be correct.  
     
      
    20 Provision for suspended sentences is to be found in s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but, by the terms of that section, the question of suspension arises only if the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment. In setting a limiting term in the present case, his Honour was exercising the power under s 23 (1) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. By that subsection, if the court determines that it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment if the accused had been found guilty after a trial, its only option is to nominate a limiting term. There appears to be no power to suspend a limiting term and, indeed, one can see as a matter of policy why that should be so. By subs (2), other sentencing options, such as a good behaviour bond, are available only if the court determines that it would not have imposed a sentence of imprisonment.  
     
      
    21 Generally, I can detect no error in his Honour’s approach to sentence. He assessed the gravity of the offence carefully, giving full weight to the extent to which the appellant’s mental condition contributed to it. He gave appropriate weight to the appellant’s subjective case, including the psychiatric evidence. The offence of malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The sentence (or limiting term) of 18 months imposed upon the appellant, far from being too severe, was lenient.  
     
      
    22 I would refuse leave to appeal against sentence.

    2 BUDDIN J: I agree with Rothman J.  
     
      
    3 ROTHMAN J: Michael Anthony Farrell seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by his Honour Acting Judge Boulton on 7 December 2007. His Honour sentenced Mr Farrell for two armed robberies (one occurring on 8 July 2006 and one occurring on 9 July 2006) to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months for each offence and ordered that the sentences apply partly concurrently by commencing the second sentence 6 months later than the first.  
     
      
    4 Mr Farrell raises, essentially, one ground of appeal being that the sentencing judge did not have regard (or proper regard) to the principle of totality. That complaint concerns the relationship between the “compendious non-parole periods and the non-parole period that had been imposed in January 2007.” 
     
      
    5 The detailed circumstances of the commission of each offence are not particularly relevant. No complaint is made about the appropriateness of the individual sentences imposed for each offence. It is sufficient to note that on Saturday 8 July 2006 Mr Farrell robbed a service station in Coffs Harbour armed with a knife. He threatened a console operator at the station and stole $500-$600 in notes from the till which the operator had been forced to open.  
     
      
    6 On Sunday 9 July 2006, Mr Farrell robbed another service station in almost identical circumstances. At this armed robbery, he took approximately $140 in notes from the till.  
     
      
    7 Mr Farrell pleaded not guilty to the two charges, the issue at trial being one of identification and alibi. The jury convicted Mr Farrell on both counts.  
     
      
    8 As earlier stated, there is no complaint about each of the individual sentences imposed by his Honour. Nor, it seems, is there a complaint about the combined effect of each of the two sentences imposed. Rather, the complaint is that the two sentences imposed were imposed consecutively with the non-parole period of an earlier sentence, which, it is said, leads to an unfairness or lack of appreciation of the totality of the offences in question.  
     
      
    9 The two sentences imposed by Boulton ADCJ had an overall effect of imposing a 5-year non-parole period and a balance of term of 18 months. This is a ratio that is not more than one-third of the non-parole period, even in the overall sentence, and therefore conforms with the provisions of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was unnecessary, pursuant to the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for his Honour to have found special circumstances. It is not suggested that his Honour “overlooked” the ratio of 3:1.  
     
      
    10 As has been made clear, on a number of occasions, s 44(2) of the Act does not prohibit a court from setting a period for the balance of the term which is less than one-third of the non-parole period. The discretion reposed in the court allows the sentencing judge to determine the ratio, within the constraints imposed by s 44(2), as the sentencing judge considers appropriate and bearing in mind the facts of a particular offender: see R v Ibrahim [2005] NSWCCA 43; Robertson v R [2009] NSWCCA 38. 
     
      
    11 As was the case in Robertson, the departure from the 3:1 ratio in the sentence imposed by his Honour is extremely minor. As was made clear in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610: 
     
      
       
        
        “A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.” ( 
        Pearce 
        , supra, per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ at [45].) 
        
       
      
    12 The difficulty in the present proceedings, as counsel for Mr Farrell submits, is that the sentences imposed were imposed consecutively with the sentence imposed by the Local Court for a break enter and steal, which had occurred on an earlier occasion. Concurrent sentences are appropriate where the offences, though separate, are substantially contemporaneous and connected. Thus, even though the two offences for which Acting Judge Boulton sentenced Mr Farrell were one day apart, they occurred over a short time, involved similar criminality and a particular episode of criminality. Therefore it was appropriate to adjust the commencement date of the sentences to account for the similarities but also reflect the differences in the two crimes committed.  
     
      
    13 In the case of the sentence imposed by the Local Court, relevantly a 10-month sentence for break enter and steal, the criminal conduct occurred one month before the armed robberies, namely at a time unrelated to the offences for which Boulton ADCJ sentenced, they were not either a single episode or over a short time, nor were they events of a similar kind. In the circumstances, it was not inappropriate for his Honour to make the sentences that he imposed consecutive with the sentence imposed by the Local Court.  
     
      
    14 There is no absence of a proper regard for totality, nor is there a failure by his Honour to take into account the subjective features of Mr Farrell in imposing the sentences that he did and in rendering them consecutive with the sentence imposed by the Local Court.  
     
      
    15 The overall effect of the three sentences imposed (i.e. by the Local Court for break enter and steal and by the District Court for the two counts of armed robbery) do not reflect any identifiable error relating to totality or otherwise and are not, even in an overall sense, excessive or manifestly excessive. For these reasons, the ground of appeal should be rejected.  
     
      
    16 I propose that the Court makes the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted; 
       
       
      (ii) Appeal be dismissed.

     REGINA v GSH 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: Listed before the Court today is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentence imposed by Coorey DCJ in the District Court. 
     
      
    2 The respondent to the Crown appeal was convicted on three counts in an indictment following trial at Campbelltown District Court as long ago as 22 February last year. At that trial he was found guilty of three counts and acquitted of another. He was not sentenced until 19 September last year and thus, as the Crown points out, there has already been some delay in this matter being heard.  
     
      
    3 The respondent applies for the matter to be taken out of today’s list on the basis that he wishes to give consideration to an appeal against conviction. We were informed, and I accept for present purposes, that the situation is that he has instituted an appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee in relation to funding such an appeal. The court was informed that a merit advice had been given in relation to the proposed appeal. 
     
      
    4 It appears that the notice of appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee was only signed today and that situation came about by reason of some practical problems about accessing the respondent himself, who is in custody. He had given instructions in relation to the matter some time ago. 
     
      
    5 Incidentally, the Crown’s concern is that there has already been some delay and an adjournment would create even further delay. It is frequently the case that this court takes into account the period which the respondent to a Crown appeal is uncertain as to his fate as a matter which, amongst other things, can give weight to the possible exercise of residual discretion of this court to dismiss a Crown appeal.  
     
      
    6 In an exchange with counsel, it has been pointed out that if this application were to succeed it would have to be clearly understood that any delay from today until the hearing could not be relied upon by the respondent to support any submission along the lines I have sketched.  
     
      
    7 The alternatives are, to proceed with this appeal relating to sentence only and possibly have a differently constituted bench deal with the question of conviction. For myself, I would regard that procedure as undesirable if, in a practical sense, it can be avoided and there is no prejudice either to the Crown or to the respondent. 
     
      
    8 In those circumstances I am of the view that the application should succeed and I would adjourn the hearing today 
     
      
    9 BUDDIN J: I agree 
     
      
    10 PRICE J: I agree. 
     
      
    11 GROVE J: The order of the court, therefore, is that the hearing today is vacated and the matter is directed to be placed in the Registrar’s next call-over list for further directions.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentence imposed on the respondent at Parramatta District Court. The respondent had been committed for trial from Burwood Local Court but on 25 July 2008 at a callover he pleaded guilty to a count of aggravated car jacking (count 1), a count of attempted aggravated car jacking (count 2), each of these being charged contrary to s 154C (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and a count of maliciously discharging a loaded firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (count 4 which was charged in the alternative to a count numbered 3) an offence contrary to s 33A (1) (as then applicable) of that Act. The maximum prescribed penalty for offence against either of these provisions is 14 years imprisonment. The circumstances of aggravation specified in count 1 were that the respondent was armed with an offensive weapon and was in company. The circumstance of aggravation in count 2 was that he was armed with an offensive weapon.  
     
      
    2 The learned sentencing judge was asked to take into account on a Form 1 a further offence of attempted aggravated car jacking; again the circumstances of aggravation were that he was armed with an offensive weapon and in company. Ellis DCJ sentenced the respondent, on count 1 and taking into account the offence on Form 1, to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 1 May 2007 and expiring on 30 April 2011 with a balance term of 2 years; on count 2 to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months commencing on 1 February 2010 and expiring on 31 October 2011 with a balance term of 1 year 6 months and on count 4 to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 1 May 2011 and expiring on 30 April 2012 with a balance term of 3 years commencing on 1 May 2012.  
     
      
    3 The effective total sentence amounted to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. 
     
      
    4 The respondent has been in continuous custody since his arrest on 1 May 2007. The offence charged in count 1 took place on 23 April 2006 as did the offence taken into account on the Form 1. The offences charged in counts 2 and 4 occurred on 26 August 2006. 
     
      
    5 Subsequent to those dates, on 30 September 2006 the respondent was arrested at Belmore and charged with possessing an unauthorized firearm and discharging a firearm in or near a public place. He was convicted of those offences at Burwood Local Court on 26 April 2007 and, for the first offence he was fined $500 and ordered to enter into a recognizance with conditions to be of good behaviour for 18 months and, for the second offence, to perform 75 hours community service. 
     
      
    6 Shortly after those proceedings the respondent was taken into custody in respect of the current matters when he attended Bankstown Police Station on 1 May 2007. 
     
      
    7 On 20 August 2007 the respondent again appeared at Burwood Local Court where, upon conviction for driving in a manner dangerous, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 months to commence on 1 May 2007 and expire on 30 June 2007. On 13 March 2008 he was called up for breach of the recognizance entered on 26 April 2007 and for the offence involved he was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 months commencing on 8 January 2008. It follows that these impositions of 2 months and 3 months imprisonment respectively were served wholly concurrently with the sentence on count 1 later imposed in the District Court.  
     
      
    8 An agreed statement of facts signed by the respondent and by the solicitor representing the Director of Public Prosecutions, was tendered. A brief summary can be extracted therefrom. Chronologically the first offence was that taken into account on the Form 1. 
     
      
    9 At about 10 am on Wednesday 23 August 2006 Zena Vasiliou went to place some shopping in the boot of her car which was parked at the Roselands Centre. Her vehicle was a Subaru WRX. She saw the respondent and another male approaching her vehicle and entered the passenger’s seat. As she tried to close the door the respondent took hold of it in order to prevent it being closed but Ms Vasiliou pulled hard and managed to close the door and she then applied the car locks. The respondent went to the driver’s side window and was tapping on it with a pistol. The other male was standing next to him. Ms Vasiliou got into the driver’s seat, started the car and quickly drove away. She saw the respondent waving his pistol.  
     
      
    10 Count 1 arose out of events at about 10.30 am on the same morning. Mr Majarres took his Ford Territory Ghia to a car wash in Belmore where he left it for attention. The car was washed and it was being dried by a staff member Mr Sayed. The respondent and another male approached the vehicle and the latter said to Mr Sayed, “If you don’t get out of the car I’ll blow your head off.” The manager approached to see what was happening and the respondent produced a handgun and pointed it at him with his finger on the trigger. He said to the manager, “Get the fuck out of here.” The manager and Mr Sayed moved away. The respondent entered the passenger’s seat and his accomplice got into the driver’s seat and drove away. As they were leaving the respondent pointed the firearm out of the passenger window and waved it at a staff member. 
     
      
    11 Counts 2 and 4 arose out of events three days later on 26 August 2006. At about 8.10 pm Mr Eter was driving his Subaru WRX along the Hume Highway at Bankstown. This vehicle incidentally was similar to that of Ms Vasiliou who had been accosted at Roselands. Mr Eter stopped at a red traffic control light. While he was there the Ford Territory which had been taken from the car wash three days previously, pulled up next to him. The respondent got out of that vehicle and walked around and opened Mr Eter’s driver’s door. The respondent was holding a firearm and told Mr Eter to get out of the car. Mr Eter accelerated away and the respondent discharged the firearm up to ten times in the direction of Mr Eter’s vehicle. One of the projectiles fired by the respondent struck Mr Eter in the back in about the shoulder area. 
     
      
    12 The respondent returned to the Ford vehicle and entered the passenger’s seat and it was driven away by a second male who was, at the time, wearing a facial disguise. Mr Eter contacted police and was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital where he was treated. A bullet was extracted and he was found to have sustained a superficial gunshot wound near his right shoulder. 
     
      
    13 Later that night police sighted the Ford Territory and a pursuit took place but police lost sight of it. A short time later police found the vehicle abandoned and gutted by fire.  
     
      
    14 The Crown submissions can be summarized as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentence on count 1 failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and to recognize that factor in the taking into account the offence on Form 1. 
       
       
      2. That, although totality is relevant, the service of the entire sentences of 2 and 3 months abovementioned for unrelated offences concurrently with the sentence on count 1 represented a miscarriage of discretion. 
       
       
      3. The effect of the commencement date on count 2 which added only 6 months to the overall non-parole period resulted in an inadequate reflection of the seriousness of that offence. 
       
       
      4. The sentence and non-parole period on count 4 were manifestly inadequate in assessment and by adding only a further 6 months to the overall non-parole period were inadequate to reflect the seriousness of that offence, and 
       
       
      5. The inadequacy of cumulation led to a failure to reflect the respondent’s total criminality. 
       
      
    15 Count 1, being a completed offence in distinction from an attempt, had a standard non-parole period of 5 years attached to it. His Honour assessed the count 1 offence as being in the mid range of criminality for such an offence. That assessment was not challenged and must be accepted for present purposes. His finding that there should be a discount of 20 percent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty entered before the setting of a trial date was likewise, not challenged. 
     
      
    16 In the course of his remarks on sentence his Honour explicitly recognized, at least by recitation of statutory expression of the purposes of sentencing, the aims which sentence had to achieve. A submission that he failed to refer to general deterrence must be rejected as it overlooked an explicit reference by his Honour. Save that submission it was not contended that his Honour failed to heed any significant element of assessment. A sentence, after discount for the plea of guilty, which is required to use a standard non-parole period of 5 years as a guidepost and which imposes a non-parole period of 4 years is not suggestive of error. It is less obvious that the assessment reflects the seriousness of a Form 1 offence as it should have: Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1) of 2002 (2002) 50 NSWLR 146. Count 1 with the Form 1 offence looked at in isolation, although markedly lenient in the result would not attract the intervention of this Court to increase the sentence. However the criminality involved remains relevant to an examination of the issue of total criminality (ameliorated by factors favourable to the respondent) and the adequacy of the total term to reflect it. The same comment is applicable to the concurrent service of the short sentences for unrelated offences between arrest and the current impositions. 
     
      
    17 As the summary of facts demonstrates, counts 2 and 4 are related. The objective facts in relation to the former include the brandishing of a loaded pistol at the motorist. The latter offence involved the discharge of up to ten rounds from that pistol, one of which struck the victim. It is true that his Honour found that the injury sustained was minor but the seriousness of firing a pistol at a person fleeing from a recognized threat posed by an offender who is discharging multiple shots in his direction is scarcely a minor matter. The fact that the medical assessment of the bullet wound was minor is hardly a yardstick for the measurement of the criminality which has been exhibited. The discharge of shots took place upon a public highway and that would have caused obvious risks to others. Risks would also have been inherent in the unsuccessful police pursuit. 
     
      
    18 His Honour made favourable findings concerning the respondent. He noted that he was nineteen years of age when the offences occurred. He had been in Australia for about ten years, having come from Iraq where his Honour found that he had been raised in “a culture where guns were everyday occurrences.” He had not responded to education and had a long history starting from the age of thirteen involving drug abuse. His Honour accepted a psychological opinion which showed the respondent had very low cognitive ability. He had not had a stable upbringing and his parents had separated following violence perpetrated upon his mother by his father. His mother had remained supportive and his Honour noted her attendance with him at Court. Since his incarceration the respondent had shown good response to drug and alcohol counselling and his Honour accepted that he now recognized the shame which he had brought upon his family and he regarded the pleas of guilty as showing some remorse. His conduct in custody has been at least promising. 
     
      
    19 No specific complaint is made by the Crown about the assessment of the length of sentence on count 2. It is complained that the sentence on count 4 is manifestly inadequate. It can be deduced that his Honour’s starting point, before discount for the plea of guilty was 5 years imprisonment. Against a maximum 14 years and given the favourable matters which he found and which have been briefly sketched above a sentence on count 4 of 4 years, viewed in isolation, although again markedly lenient can be regarded as lying within the range of discretion. 
     
      
    20 It was stated in written submissions on behalf of the respondent that the ultimate question is whether a total effective sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years is manifestly inadequate. In my view the answer to that inquiry should be in the affirmative.  
     
      
    21 Recognizing, as above stated, the considerable leniency in the assessments on counts 1 and 4 for the reasons above set out, I would conclude that the practical effect of extending the non-parole period for a total of 12 months for offences of the level of seriousness of the charges in counts 2 and 4 represents a manifest failure to impose adequate sentence. 
     
      
    22 The Crown appeal should be allowed and the Court should proceed to resentence. Such resentence must be approached with the restraint applicable after a successful Crown appeal and give account to what is commonly referred to as double jeopardy. 
     
      
    23 For the reasons above stated I would not intervene to vary the individual sentences assessed by his Honour, but I would vary the orders as to cumulation so as to create an adequate reflection of totality of criminality. In so doing I would exercise the restraint above noted. Full effect should be given to matters favourable to the respondent found by his Honour including his finding as to special circumstances. The orders which I propose will result in a proportion between non-parole period and balance term which is different from that reached by his Honour but by maintaining a potential parole period during a balance term of 3 years it remains the case that the balance term exceeds one-third of the non-parole period. Three years is an appropriate period of potential supervision to achieve the hoped-for progress to rehabilitation. 
     
      
    24 In order to achieve clarity, although the terms are not to be varied, it would be convenient to reimpose the sentences and ancillary orders in their entirety. 
     
      
    25 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
      2. Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu thereof the respondent sentenced as follows: 
       
        
        (a) On count 1, taking into account the matter on Form 1, to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 1 May 2007 and expiring on 30 April 2011 with a balance term of 2 years commencing on 1 May 2011, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) On count 2, to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months to commence on 1 July 2010 and expire on 30 April 2012 with a balance term of 1 year 6 months commencing on 1 May 2012. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) On count 4, to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 1 May 2012 and expiring on 30 April 2013 with a balance term of 3 years commencing on 1 May 2013. 
        
       
       
      4. The earliest date of eligibility for parole specified is 30 April 2013. 
       
      
    26 BUDDIN J: I agree. 
     
      
    27 PRICE J: I agree. 
     
      
    28 GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore, will be as I have proposed. The effect of it, as you would appreciate, is to extend the non-parole period by twelve months.29 Since publication of the foregoing, attention has been drawn to the error in the calculation of dates in relation to count 2 in par 3 (b) within par 25 above. This will have a consequential effect on the commencement date of the sentence on count 4 and the earliest date of eligibility for parole.Pars 3 (b) and (c) and 4 within par 25 are amended to order as follows  (b) On count 2, to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of 1 year and 9 months to commence on 1 July 2010 and expire on 31 March 2012, with a balance of term of 1 year 6 months, commencing on 1 April 2012. (c) On count 4, to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of 12 months commencing on 1 April 2012 and expiring on 31 March 2013 with a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 1 April 2013. 4. The earliest date of eligibility for parole specified as 31 March 2013.

   DECISION: 
   (1) Leave to appeal be granted;(2) In relation to the first count under s178BA that the sentence of a non-parole period of 2 years to commence 8 April, 2009 and to expire on 7 April, 2011 with an additional term of 1 year to expire 7 April, 2012 be confirmed;(3) The sentence in respect of the second charge under s178BA of imprisonment of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 8 April, 2011 and expiring on 7 April, 2013 with an additional term of 1 year to expire on 7 April, 2014 be confirmed;(4) The sentence imposed on the count under s193B(2) of the Crimes Act be quashed and instead and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 14 months from 8 February, 2012 and a balance of term of 2 years. The total sentence would be a non-parole period of 4 years from 8 April, 2009 with a balance of term of 2 years and she would be eligible for release to parole on 7 April, 2013. Since that last sentence is under 3 years I direct she be released to parole on 7 April, 2013.

     JUDGMENT  
    1 SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders of Blanch J.2 BLANCH J: The applicant appeared before the District Court and on 10 December, 2009 she was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
      1. On a charge of obtaining a financial advantage by deception on 24 May, 2007 to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years to commence 8 April, 2009 and expire on 7 April, 2011 with an additional term of one year. 
      
     
     
      
      2. On a charge of obtaining financial advantage by deception between 6 and 7 April, 2009 to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 8 April, 2011 and expiring on 7 April, 2013 with an additional term of one year. 
      
     
     
      
      3. On a charge of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime between 14 May and 10 July, 2007 to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 14 months to commence on 8 August, 2012 and expiring on 7 October, 2013 with an additional term of 27 months to expire on 7 January, 2016. 
      
    3 The charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception were contrary to s178BA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years. The charge of knowingly deals with the proceeds of crime is contrary to s193B(2) Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years. The total effective sentence was one of a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 8 April, 2009 with an additional term of 2 years and 3 months.4 In addition to the above matters, the applicant asked for 2 matters of obtaining financial advantage by deception to be taken into account. It does not appear from the remarks on sentence that his Honour said those matters were taken into account but he did say during the course of his remarks that he knew he was to take those matters into account when dealing with the charge under s193B(2) Crimes Act and his Honour did in fact sign the Form 1 to that effect. The facts5 The facts were set out in a statement which noted that between February, 2007 and June, 2007 the applicant was employed by Australian Pharmaceuticals Industrial Limited Company (API) as a senior accounts clerk. She devised a scheme where moneys were transferred to her own St George bank account. To achieve that end she prevailed on various fellow employees and the scheme involved the use of a false invoice number which could only be done by a person such as the applicant who had a valid password.6 On 7 March, 2007 the sum of $21,930.22 was sent to her St George account and on 15 May, 2007 the sum of $53,740 was sent. These are the transactions on the Form 1. Over the next few days she withdrew from her account almost the whole of that amount, which transaction is part of the charge under s193B(2).7 On 24 May, 2007 $406,725.16 was credited to her account, this being the first count under s178BA and most of that money was drawn out including the transfer of $360,000 from her St George account into her ING account. 8 The applicant left Australia for the Philippines on 11 June, 2007 and in the ensuing days $206,000 was transferred overseas by internet transfers from her St George account. Other transfers followed in July from both her ING account and her St George account.9 On 15 December, 2008 the applicant commenced employment as an accounts clerk at the Norfolk Group, a company involved in the building industry. On 6 April, 2009 she arranged for a sum of $35,459.22 to be paid into her Bank West account. This is the second charge under s178BA. She was arrested at Sydney airport on 7 April and an amount of $30,558.06 was frozen in her bank account and subsequently forfeited. Of the funds, the subject of the API frauds, $478,395 has not been recovered.THE GROUNDS OF APPEALThe first ground of appeal10 This ground asserts that his Honour erred in commencing with the sentencing outcome he wished to achieve and then determining the individual sentences. In the course of delivering his remarks on sentence, the judge said: 
     
      
      “the overall sentence of non-parole imprisonment to which the offender should be sentenced would be one of four years and six months imprisonment backdated to commence on 8 April 2009 with an additional term of two years and three months imprisonment. That would mean a total effective head sentence of six years and nine months imprisonment with a total period of non-parole being four years and six months, reflecting a finding of special circumstances of two thirds.” 
      
    11 That statement occurred after his Honour had set out the facts and relevant submissions and authorities. There was then a luncheon adjournment and after lunch his Honour engaged in a discussion with the lawyers appearing for the prosecution and the defence. The remarks quoted were made during the course of that discussion but it is apparent from the further statements by the sentencing judge that he had worked out individual sentences. Indeed he said: 
     
      
      “But it seems to be transparent in the sentencing process that that would be reflected by a sentence on each of the 178B(a) counts whereby the notional head sentence would be one of four years imprisonment to which I would apply the discount for 25% for the plea of guilty. … That would then normally leave a head sentence of three years. Applying the finding of special circumstances, that would mean a non-parole period of two years.” 
      
    12 It is apparent his Honour had determined the relevant appropriate sentence for each offence but he was concerned with the question of accumulation. He was in fact being careful to ensure he did follow the dictum in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at paragraph 40. Those requirements in Pearce have made the task of sentencing for multiple offences complicated and onerous. Legislation presently before Parliament to remove some of those requirements may simplify the process. Nevertheless, in this particular case I do not believe any error has been demonstrated.The second ground of appeal13 This ground asserts his Honour erred in assessing the criminality of the charge of “knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime”. It will be seen from the facts in this case that the applicant fraudulently obtained sums of money by transferring them to her bank account and then she withdrew the money from the bank account. No question is raised that the prosecution of this activity as a separate crime is oppressive. The issue raised is whether or not there should have been any accumulation of the sentence for the offence. 14 There have been a number of cases in this Court addressing this issue. In Thorn v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 294 the Court was dealing with a case where the accused had been charged with fraud offences under the Commonwealth Criminal Code and also with a count of dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s400.4(1) of the Code. In the judgment of Howie J at paragraph 27 it was said: 
     
      
      “This was an unusual use of a money laundering offence. To the extent that there was an overlap with the fraud offences the charge represented the use of the funds that had been dishonestly obtained under those offences. The criminality was very much in the obtaining of the funds not in their use.” 
      
    15 He went on to say at paragraph 31: 
     
      
      “But here the applicant was merely transferring the money obtained by the fraudulent claims from the company accounts to his personal account or drawing it from an ATM so that he could use it to gamble. He was doing nothing to hide the source or to change the nature of the funds. He was simply gaining access to them. The activity came within the scope of the offence under s400.4, because the offence is so widely drawn. But it was a highly technical version of the offence.” 
      
    16 His Honour noted that money laundering in its true sense involved dealing with money that was the result of some other person’s criminal activity so as to hide its source.17 In Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58 this Court was dealing with an accused who had pleaded guilty to an offence of selling unauthorised decoders and also with dealing with the proceeds of crime. The accused sold unauthorised equipment to obtain pay television services and had obtained $15,000 which was recovered. It was his possession of that $15,000 which gave rise to the charge of dealing with proceeds of crime. In that case it was held by the Court at paragraph 17: 
     
      
      “We appreciate that a person can by the one act commit two offences and, where the two offences address different aspects of the criminal conduct, there is nothing wrong with prosecuting the two offences or, subject to the principle of totality, with imposing separate sentences for the two offences. But in our view the receipt of the money as a result of the sale did not result in a separate act of criminality that warranted a separate charge and a separate penalty.” 
      
    18 In Schembri v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 149 the Court was dealing with an accused who was sentenced on a number of counts of obtaining a financial advantage by deception and on one count of dealing with the proceeds of crime. The fraud offence related to misstatements to the Australian Taxation Office and the charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime related to his possession of the money so obtained. The Court amended the sentence to make the sentence for dealing with the proceeds of crime totally concurrent with the other sentence and cited Nahlous (supra) and Thorn (supra) with approval.19 In my view the criminality involved in these charges is significantly the fraudulently obtaining of significant amounts of money and the fact that a large part of that money has not been recovered. The sentencing judge noted there was considerable planning and sophistication in the obtaining of the money. He also noted it was of particular concern that most of the money had been dissipated. Those are indeed significant factors when assessing the criminality involved in the offence of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. I do not believe an additional penalty is appropriate in respect of the charge of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime in this case. The applicant simply gained access to the funds the subject of the fraud.The third ground of appeal20 This ground argues the trial judge made no allowance for the applicant’s expressed remorse. He said: 
     
      
      “However, I am concerned about the statements of remorse and contrition that are said to found prospects of rehabilitation. I do not think those statements are based on any sense of realism and unfortunately I think that it is also confirmed by the psychologist’s report”. 
      
    21 His Honour was no doubt referring to the statement in the psychologist’s report: 
     
      
      “Amie’s lack of insight into the implications of her offending is also consistent with her entrenched narcissistic disorder. These individuals are very quick to rationalise their misdemeanours and justify their shortcomings with apparently plausible reasons for their self centeredness.” 
      
    22 I also note the applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge and he was in a good position to make an assessment of the existence and level of contrition. I do not believe any greater discount should have been given or lesser sentence imposed because of contrition.The fourth ground of appeal23 This ground argues that the sentence is manifestly excessive. To the extent that the sentence for the offence under s193B(2) was made cumulative, I agree. Otherwise I do not believe the sentence was excessive. The sentencing judge was referred to a number of authorities including R v George NSWCCA (unreported) 23 September 1994, R v Itaoui [2006] NSWCCA 273, R v Prasad 2 A Crim R 45, R v Tripodina 35 A Crim R 183, R v Trim [2002] NSWCCA 82 and R v Strano [2002] NSWCCA 531. His Honour was not referred to the decision of this Court in R v Hare [2007] NSWCCA 303 where McClellan CJ at CL annexed to the judgment a series of cases and sentences relating to s178BA. A review of those authorities reveals that the non-parole periods of two years were, in fact, well within the range of sentencing discretion of the sentencing judge particularly when a second fraud of the same nature was perpetrated almost two years after the first.24 I have noted the affidavit of the applicant who appears to have settled into the prison environment. She has been doing courses and she believes she has addressed her gambling issues. On the other hand the criminality involved in these offences was significant and in accordance with s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 I do not believe that a less severe sentence is warranted in law in respect of the two charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception.25 Accordingly, I propose that: 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal be granted; 
       
      2. That in relation to the first count under s178BA that the sentence of a non-parole period of 2 years to commence 8 April, 2009 and to expire on 7 April, 2011 with an additional term of 1 year to expire 7 April, 2012 be confirmed; 
       
      3. That the sentence in respect of the second charge under s178BA of imprisonment of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 8 April, 2011 and expiring on 7 April, 2013 with an additional term of 1 year to expire on 7 April, 2014 be confirmed; 
       
      4. That the sentence imposed on the count under s193B(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       be quashed and instead and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I would sentence her to imprisonment for a period of 14 months from 8 February, 2012 and a balance of term of 2 years. The total sentence accordingly, would be a non-parole period of 4 years from 8 April, 2009 with a balance of term of 2 years and she would be eligible for release to parole on 7 April, 2013. Since that last sentence is under 3 years, I direct that she be released to parole on 7 April, 2013. 
      
    26 HULME J: I also concur and the orders of the Court will be as indicated by Blanch J.

      JUDGMENT 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application for relief pursuant to a summons filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions against Maliota Nouata, and against a Magistrate sitting in the local court. In accordance with the practice, the Magistrate has filed a submitting appearance. The relief sought arises out of a decision by the Magistrate not to take any action in relation to a bond pursuant to section 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, to which Mr Nouatta was subject at the time he was convicted of an offence before the Magistrate. 
     
      
    2 The history of the matter is that on 27 September 2006 at the Local Court in Griffith, Mr Nouata was convicted of offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a second offence of resisting police. In respect of those matters a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was suspended pursuant to section 12 of the act, upon recognizance being entered into. A copy of the recognizance is exhibited to the affidavit of Helen Langley sworn 27 November 2008. 
     
      
    3 On 16 September 2007 Mr Nouata was again charged with an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was charged pursuant to court attendance notice and required to attend Cowra Local Court where, on 4 September 2008, he was convicted of that offence. Obviously by the time of that conviction the bond entered into at Griffith had expired, but it was current at the time of the commission of the offence, for which he was convicted at Cowra Local Court. The Magistrate was asked to deal with the alleged breach of the recognizance which had been entered into, and exhibited to the affidavit of Ms Langley is a transcript of the proceedings of 4 September 2008 at Cowra Magistrates court. The only relevant reference is to be found at page 75 of the transcript where the Magistrate said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I do have regard to the fact that this section 12 bond was very close to its finality and I find that there are special circumstances and I will take no action in relation to that bond, the bond having very nearly expired at the time of the commission of this offence and has currently expired"". 
        
       
      
    4 The obligation of a court dealing with what is commonly referred to as “call up for breach of bond” is governed, at least in part, by section 98 of the statute which I have mentioned. Subsection 3 thereof provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In the case of good behaviour bond referred to in section 12 a court must revoke the bond unless it is satisfied (a) that the defendant's failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature or (b) that there are good reasons for excusing the defendant's failure to comply with the conditions of the bond"". 
        
       
      
    5 As I have indicated, the only observation made by the Magistrate was that the bond was nearly expired. The evidence would seem to suggest that the matter in respect of which he was dealt with at Cowra was unable to be classified as trivial, bearing in mind the penalty there imposed was a further sentence of imprisonment for 18 months again suspended pursuant to section 12 of the act. 
     
      
    6 It is the submission of the Director of Public Prosecutions that it is revealed by the evidence that the second defendant did not direct his mind to the requirements of section 98 (3). As is obvious, there was no finding or indeed no reference, to the requirements of that subsection. In those circumstances, bearing in mind the authority concerning the application of that provision (which is usefully set out in the judgment of Howie J in DPP v Cooke [2007] l68 A Crim R 379), I am persuaded that the relief sought by the Director of Public Prosecutions should be granted. 
     
      
    7 Accordingly, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the summons filed herein. I order the first defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs. The first defendant is to have a Suitors Fund Certificate in respect of those costs, if he otherwise qualifies.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: The court is now in a position to deliver judgment in this matter. I ask Justice Howie to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: This is a Crown appeal in respect of a sentence imposed upon the respondent in the District Court by Johnstone DCJ (the Judge) on a charge of aggravated robbery. That was an offence contrary to s 95(1) of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. On 17 February 2009 the respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 12 months. The sentence dated from 1 May 2008 and the respondent is to be released to parole on 31 October 2009.  
     
      
    3 The Crown appeal was filed on 27 February 2009 and served on the respondent on 2 March 2009. 
     
      
    4 The facts can be stated briefly. At about 11.30pm on Saturday 29 December 2007, the respondent ordered pizzas to be delivered to a house in Granville. About 20 minutes later the pizzas were delivered by the victim, a 19 year old male. The respondent led the victim into a room of the house where he immediately attacked him by striking him in the face a number of times causing pain and bleeding from the nose. The victim fled from the house into the backyard. The respondent followed him demanding money. The victim handed over a bag containing about $400 in cash. As the respondent searched the bag, the victim ran to his vehicle. The respondent followed and as the vehicle drove away punched the side window. 
     
      
    5 The respondent was arrested the next day. He was interviewed but denied the offence claiming he was at a hotel at the relevant time. He was released but arrested again on 21 January 2008 after police were unable to identify the respondent on CCTV footage at the hotel. Again he was interviewed, but once more denied the offence. 
     
      
    6 The respondent was aged 24 years at the date of the offence. He has a criminal history that commenced in 1998 when he was sentenced in the Children’s Court for supplying drugs. In 2000 he was sentenced to a control order for 9 months for an offence of assault with intent to rob. In 2000 he was again sentenced to a control order for 2 counts of armed robbery. In 2003 he received a suspended sentence for child sexual assault offences. In 2004 he was placed on a bond for an offence of take and drive a conveyance. In 2005 he received a community service order for larceny as a servant. 
     
      
    7 Of particular significance is that on 27 November 2006 he was sentenced in the Parramatta District Court to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months for robbery in company. He was released to parole on 22 December 2007, just 8 days before the present offence was committed. His parole was revoked on 7 February 2008 and he was to serve the balance of the term of about 17 months. That sentence expires on 14 July 2009. 
     
      
    8 There was a psychological report in evidence dated 8 October 2006. This report had been prepared for the respondent’s court appearance in November 2006. It discloses his background as follows. His parents separated when the respondent was aged 9 months. He stayed in the care of his mother who had a number of relationships of varying lengths of time. He remained in contact with his father even living with him for a period. Although the respondent sought an independent existence at the age of 18, this failed when he lost his job and thereafter he lived with one parent or the other. He has generally been employed in storeman positions. He was at the time of the report in a relationship with a young woman who was expecting his baby. They had been living with the respondent’s father. 
     
      
    9 The respondent reported having commenced consuming alcohol at the age of 13 years and engaged in regular binge drinking. He acknowledged a difficulty with alcohol. He commenced using drugs at 14 and quickly developed an addiction to heroin. However, he later replaced this addiction with a dependence on alcohol. He admitted that he enjoyed “escaping” through the use of drugs or alcohol with the support of his peer network. 
     
      
    10 That report contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The respondent] is a young man of below average intellectual resources and, although he has reportedly maintained some employment stability, he has little experience of independent community living and, until recently, has maintained antisocial peer connections. This has contributed to his offending behaviour. Perusal of his criminal history suggests that, in recent years, the respondent has been able to achieve greater stability and the current offence seems best accounted for by the impulsive behaviour associated with problematic and regular alcohol use and negative peer influence. It is, thereby, possible that [the respondent] is demonstrating some evidence of late maturation. 
        
       
      
    11 There was a report from the same psychologist dated 14 October 2008. The report states that during the period of the respondent’s custody he had participated in the Young Adult Offender Program during which he underwent a drug and alcohol program, a lifestyle skills course and a relapse prevention program. The respondent entered a works release program for six to seven months prior to his release and thereby secured employment in a shipping container yard. The respondent while in works release met and developed a relationship with his current fiancée, his previous relationship having broken down while he was in custody. 
     
      
    12 The respondent reported that he was released in December 2007 to his father's home and continued working in the shipping container yard. He also attended church regularly with his fiancée and her family. He claimed that he had not used drugs and had only consumed alcohol with his father. On the day of the offence he had been drinking with a group of long-standing friends. He said he was unable to recall the circumstances of the offence by reason of the state of intoxication. He was at a loss to explain his behaviour and expressed disappointment at what he had done and its impact on himself and others. He was suffering from depression. 
     
      
    13 The report contains the following paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
         
        At the time of my last assessment with [the respondent], I suggested that he may have been transitioning through a late stage of maturation and I still believe this to be the case. He appears to have matured considerably in the last two years and, thus, [the respondent] is more reflective and insightful and he has also developed more realistic plans for the future. Further to this, he is likely to have gained through participating in previous programmes in gaol. Where [the respondent] falls down is that he does not yet understand the psychosocial ramifications of his earlier life and, in particular, how these are connected to his substance abuse and antisocial behaviour and, therefore, he has not yet been able to stop his offending successfully. 
        
       
      
    14 The respondent had written a three-page document entitled "" My Apology"" that was placed before the court. The document contains expressions of sorrow in relation to the victim. He stated he had no recollection of committing the offence and did not understand why he would commit the robbery in light of the fact that he had over $6,000 in an account. He indicated that he wished to change his life so much that he had even given up smoking. He stated that he wanted to cut his ties with his former associates. He asked for a sentence consisting of a ""lower custodial sentence and a higher parole period"". 
     
      
    15 The respondent gave evidence at the sentencing proceedings. He said that on release he was living with his father and reporting to the Probation and Parole Service. He could not recall the circumstances surrounding the offence as he had been drinking most of the day. Since his return to custody he had completed further courses and enrolled in others. He stated that he had not used drugs or alcohol since his release and was undertaking a Bible Study course by correspondence. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing remarks are brief. The Judge noted that the offence was “objectively serious” and that the respondent was on parole having been released 8 days earlier. His Honour noted that the offence had to be considered in accordance with the guideline in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. He then stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Crown submits that the objective seriousness is mid range, it being an unprovoked violent attack on a young man just doing his job. Having regard to the fact that the offence already involved the element of aggravation, no further weight is to be given to that factor. In my view, this offence falls in the low range for this type of offence. There was no weapon involved and there is no evidence of serious or permanent injury to the victim. Apart from the absence of a weapon there are other elements as set out in R v Henry that were present, and in this case the offender has a significant criminal history. 
         
         
        There are, however, some mitigating factors. Firstly there was the plea of guilty at arraignment such that the offender is entitled to the utilitarian discount on his sentence. It is to be noted, however, that the R v Henry guideline already contains an allowance of some ten percent. His record, which I mention involves violence and that cannot be used by way of mitigation. 
        
       
      
    17 The Judge found that there were good prospects of rehabilitation but that it was difficult to determine whether he was likely to re-offend. He backdated the sentence to 1 May 2008, about a month after the date from which his parole was revoked. The Judge found that there were special circumstances being “the need for an extended period of supervision whilst on parole in respect of, in particular, drug and alcohol treatment and other considerations such as anger management”. 
     
      
    18 The Crown submits that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. It notes three specific errors that it attributes to the Judge as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) Incorporating significant common currency with the parole revocation period for the robbery in company offence. 
         
         
        (b) Taking into account the absence of a weapon in finding that the offence was in the low range. 
         
         
        (c) Imposing a sentence well below the 4 – 5 years set out in the Henry guideline in circumstances where the offender was not so young and had a criminal history. 
        
       
      
    19 It is convenient to deal with the second and of third of those points before the first. The offence for which the respondent was being sentenced was an aggravated robbery. The circumstance of aggravation alleged was the use of corporal violence. It could also have been the infliction of actual bodily harm. The prosecution is required only to prove one circumstance of aggravation in the charge but the sentencing court is entitled to take into account whatever circumstance of aggravation appears from the facts: R v Li (NSWCCA, 9 July 1997, unreported). Here the offence was aggravated by the fact that the respondent used corporal violence and inflicted actual bodily harm. The Judge was in error in rejecting the prosecutor’s submission as to the significance of the nature of the attack upon the victim. It was a relevant fact that the corporal violence was unprovoked and that the victim was clearly lured in to a private place where he could be attacked. 
     
      
    20 But this is not the Crown’s complaint on appeal. The Judge took into account that the respondent was unarmed. But had he been armed it would have been a different offence albeit one that carried the same maximum penalty, see s 97(1) of the Crimes Act. It is obviously not a matter of mitigation that the offender did not commit a different offence. Further, had there been a more serious or permanent injury inflicted upon the victim, another matter the Judge found to be mitigating, it is likely that the respondent would have faced a separate charge to deal with such an injury. This is an example of the not uncommon error of a sentencing judge finding an offence mitigated because some other offence was not committed. 
     
      
    21 The Judge was in error in determining that the offence was in the low range of an offence of this kind. It was significantly more serious than that. The victim was vulnerable: persons delivering pizzas are not infrequently the subject of robberies because they are alone, carry cash and are usually attacked when out of public sight by going to private homes to make the delivery. The offence was obviously planned and, as the prosecutor submitted to the Judge, the victim was not even given the chance of handing over his money without being physically assaulted. 
     
      
    22 The Crown complains under (c) above that, although the Judge purported to apply the Henry guideline, the sentence imposed does not accord with a proper application of the guideline. It has been held that the guideline has general applicability, with appropriate adaptation, to offences of robbery with a maximum penalty the same as for armed robbery: Azzi v R [2008] NSWCCA 169. However, some caution is necessary because the guideline was concerned with an offence involving a weapon: R v Tortell and Tsegay [2007] NSWCCA 313. The Judge recognised that the Henry guideline did have some application and noted two differences between it and the circumstances of the offending before him: that the respondent did not have a weapon and the respondent “had a significant criminal record”. 
     
      
    23 However to the extent that Henry could be applied it did not significantly advantage the offender: he was not a young offender with no or little criminal history, but to the contrary he had a record of robbery offences and was on parole for such an offence. The absence of a weapon is balanced to some extent by the fact that actual physical violence was used here to inflict an injury, albeit minor. 
     
      
    24 The Crown complains that the Judge underestimated the significance of the respondent’s record. That complaint has merit. The Judge noted that the respondent had a record of violence and “that cannot be used by way of mitigation”. Quite frankly, and with respect, I simply do not understand that comment. The fact that the respondent had a record for offences, not only of violence, but also for robberies, obviously could not be a matter of mitigation. Rather it was a matter of aggravation. This was clearly a case, especially as the respondent had been released from prison on parole for robbery just days before the offence, where specific deterrence was of substantial significance despite what had been said by the psychologist and the respondent about his endeavours to reform. 
     
      
    25 On behalf of the respondent it was submitted that it was within the exercise of the Judge’s discretion to try to promote the respondent’s rehabilitation notwithstanding his reoffending so shortly after release to parole. There is no doubt that his Honour could have taken that view provided that the non-parole period also reflected the seriousness of the offence and the importance of deterrence. In any event it is difficult to see from the Judge’s remarks that he appreciated he was imposing a very lenient sentence and was doing so for the purpose of assisting in the reform of the respondent. To the contrary the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I have no tolerance for people who breach bonds or parole. Courts give offenders a chance. They must be made to understand that such leniency is not likely (lightly?) extended and if that trust is breached, there will be consequences. 
        
       
       
      Those sentiments find no reflection in the actual sentence imposed. 
       
      
    26 The sentence itself was manifestly inadequate and, in particular, the non-parole period failed almost every aspect of sentencing that his Honour had set out in his remarks when referring to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Clearly the Judge underestimated to a very significant degree the seriousness of the offending. He must have given far too much weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances even though they were of little assistance to him. 
     
      
    27 This was not a case for a low non-parole period as the respondent and the psychologist sought, but for a minimum period of custody to teach the respondent a lesson that he should have learned during the course of his last sentence. He had made promises for reform when he was last before the court for a similar offence and had been given the chance of a non-parole period of 50 per cent on the last sentence. All the courses and education programmes cannot avail an offender who repeatedly breaches the law by serious violent offences. 
     
      
    28 With all respect to the psychologist it was not a case of the respondent understanding “the psychosocial ramifications of his earlier life”. It was a case of him understanding a much simpler concept: if he drinks alcohol to excess he is likely to commit a serious offence of violence. He was no longer a young man whose rehabilitation was paramount. He was an adult with a propensity to violence when drunk and who was a fitting case for a sentence with a marked degree of both specific and general deterrence. There were in my opinion no special circumstances but the Crown has not raised that matter as a ground of appeal. 
     
      
    29 The complaint under (a) above is that the respondent will serve only 3½ months referrable to the offence for which he was sentenced. The Crown concedes that it was within the discretion of a sentencing judge to determine whether and to what degree to backdate a sentence where parole had been revoked by reason of the offence for which the offender is then being sentenced: see Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145. 
     
      
    30 The Judge does not explain why he backdated the sentence to the date he did other than that he did not want to double count the fact that the respondent had been on parole. That might be the case, but I cannot see how the sentence imposed sufficiently took into account as an aggravating factor that the respondent was on parole for similar offending. However, the inadequacy of the punishment for the present offence will be to a significant degree overcome if this Court were to resentence the respondent. 
     
      
    31 I am mindful of the limitations on this Court in a Crown appeal, to which reference was made in the written submissions filed on the respondent’s behalf, and the respect that ought to be shown to the sentence imposed at first instance: see Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357. However, the sentence in the present case was unreasonable and cannot be allowed to stand. I appreciate the double jeopardy involved in a Crown appeal and the disappointment occasioned to a respondent to such an appeal. However, the present sentence is so inadequate that in my opinion this Court should intervene. I have taken into account an affidavit by the respondent as to his conduct in custody but, in my opinion, that material does not justify the Court staying its hand. 
     
      
    32 The sentence will date from that fixed by the Judge by way of leniency due to the fact this is a Crown appeal and that the respondent was looking to release next October. The sentence is less than ought to have been imposed. The sentence should have been at least 6 years less a discount of about 15 per cent. In light of the fact this is a Crown appeal I would impose a sentence of 5 years less 15 per cent. In my opinion the non-parole period I propose is the very least period of custody the respondent should have to serve before again being eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    33 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The appeal is allowed and the sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed. 
         
         
        2. The respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years 3 months. There is to be a non-parole period of 3 years. The sentence is to date from 1 May 2008. The respondent is eligible to be released to parole on 30 April 2011. There is a balance of term of 15 months.

     Judgment 
     
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I invite Grove J to deliver the first judgment.2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Goldring DCJ at Wagga Wagga District Court on 5 December 2008. The applicant pleaded guilty to a count in an indictment charging that on 9 December 2007 he had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting. 
     
      
    3 The offence carries a prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for fourteen years and a standard non-parole period of seven years. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of two years and six months, comprised of a non-parole period of one year and three years and a balance term of the same length. 
     
      
    4 An agreed statement of facts had been put before the court. The complainant and a female friend were partaking of drinks in a hotel in Echuca, a town located on the southern side of the Murray River in Victoria. She was introduced to the applicant by her friend at the hotel. Later in the evening, the complainant and her friend went to another hotel and then to a nightclub and at about 3am they went to a pizza restaurant. There she again encountered the applicant who, after the complainant’s friend left, invited her to come to “his place” for a few drinks. The complainant agreed, but told the applicant that she was not going to sleep with him. 
     
      
    5 They got into a hire car and were taken to the driveway of the applicant’s parents’ home which was some kilometres out of town near Moama on the New South Wales side of the river. At this point they left the hire car and got into the applicant’s utility vehicle and he drove to his parents’ home. The complainant expressed concern that she did not know where she was or how she would get home. The applicant told her that they were at his parents’ home and he would drive her. 
     
      
    6 They entered the applicant’s bedroom and the complainant sat on the end of the bed and took her shoes off. The applicant sat beside her and began to touch her. She again told the applicant that she would not sleep with him. He appeared to accept this and told her they would go to sleep. The complainant by this time was reconciled to the idea of staying the night at the applicant’s parents’ residence with a view to the applicant driving her home in the morning. 
     
      
    7 She took off her dress, but not her underwear and lay on the side of the bed close to the wall. Thereafter the applicant climbed on top of her saying, “We will try this” and he pulled her underwear off. The complainant again told the applicant that she could not sleep with him, but the applicant put his penis inside her vagina and started moving it in and out. The complainant started to cry and the applicant desisted, saying to her that it was all okay and he hugged her. The applicant then fell asleep. The complainant put her dress back on, took her handbag and shoes and walked out. She walked back to the township of Moama. She informed friends of what had happened by text message.  
     
      
    8 The applicant was then 22, now 24 years of age, and had no prior convictions. His Honour noted the character references which had been given by people who had known his family for a long time, however, he observed that even people of the best character sometimes “make mistakes and commit offences”. He found that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, although he expressed a provision that the applicant should get some help with an alcohol problem which he perceived. 
     
      
    9 His Honour said that he had no doubt that on the occasion, both the applicant and the complainant were affected by alcohol. He observed that, subsequently, the applicant had consulted an alcohol counsellor at a regional health centre. The applicant had completed an apprenticeship as a carpenter and was in steady employment, now occupying a supervisory position in which he was highly regarded by his employer. 
     
      
    10 The applicant relies upon four grounds of appeal: Ground one asserted that the full-time custodial sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the offence. It is complained that the sentencing judge did not state where, in the range of sentence seriousness, the offence fell. In the course of proceedings he had stated in an exchange with counsel that he had no doubt that it was below the mid-range of seriousness for the offence. 
     
      
    11 It requires only an observation of the contrast between the sentence imposed by his Honour and the prescription of the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period to observe that his Honour obviously assessed the applicant’s criminality to lie in the very low range of seriousness of this offence.  
     
      
    12 It was submitted that his Honour rejected defence and Crown submissions that a suspended sentence was suitable. At the sentence hearing, counsel for the applicant expressly stated that he would ask the judge, “to consider that a sentence of imprisonment is appropriate, but that the sentence ought to be suspended”.  
     
      
    13 The Crown’s submission was not that a suspended sentence was suitable, but the Crown Prosecutor said, “If your Honour were minded to impose a custodial sentence and suspend it, the Crown would submit that you would not be falling into appealable error”.  
     
      
    14 In oral submissions, the applicant submitted that there was in his Honour’s remarks on sentence no explicit statement that the applicant was remorseful. As I have observed, his Honour had found expressly that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and it is difficult to consider that his Honour was finding that such a person was not affected by remorse or contrition for what he had done.  
     
      
    15 His Honour had expressed a starting point for sentence assessment of three years, but he had reduced this in order to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty which had not been entered at the earliest opportunity. No complaint is made about the extent of discount which was given to reflect the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    16 Ground two complained that his Honour erred in failing to take into account the level of intoxication as a factor affecting the applicant’s judgment. As earlier stated, his Honour expressly found that both the applicant and the complainant were affected by alcohol. There was no evidence before his Honour about the level of the applicant’s intoxication, although I would not conclude that his Honour overlooked the circumstance that after arrival at the driveway of the house in Moama the applicant was able to drive his utility truck to the homestead. His Honour’s comment reflected as much as the evidence would have enabled any conclusion about the effect of prior ingestion of intoxicating liquor by the applicant upon his commission of this offence. 
     
      
    17 It is true that in a pre-sentence report the applicant had told the probation officer that he accepted that his judgment was affected by his level of intoxication and that he would have acted differently had he not been affected in the way he was but that, to my mind, was only to state the obvious. That he behaved in the fashion described after imbibing intoxicating liquor does not, in this case, amount to a matter of mitigation. His Honour did not err in the fashion alleged by the ground. 
     
      
    18 Ground three asserted that his Honour erred in placing excessive weight upon the victim’s impact statement in refusing to suspend the sentence on the basis of its contents. In written submissions, counsel for the applicant pointed out that the victim impact statement did not comply with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 10.2. The document was inaccurately entitled ‘Witness Impact Statement’ and although it appears to be signed by the complainant, it is not dated in accordance with the requirement of the regulation, if it were intended to be a victim impact statement. 
     
      
    19 The transcript does not identify a separate tender of the statement and it was included in a bundle scheduled as consisting of a statement of facts, criminal history, victim impact statement and pre-sentence report. It is well established that an adverse finding against an accused person cannot be made unless the Tribunal is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt; Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270. The victim impact statement was not sworn and not tested by cross-examination and, self-evidently, would therefore have been an unlikely source of satisfaction to that standard of a matter adverse to an offender: R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128. Also Basten JA, with whom Latham J agreed, recently in Regina v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269 stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It will often be appropriate to give weight to a victim impact statement where the conduct of the offender is otherwise established beyond reasonable doubt and the statement is restricted to subsequent effects on the victim”. 
         
        
       
      
    20 In rejecting the submission that the sentence be suspended, his Honour has said: 
     
      
       
        
        “That would not be appropriate given the impact that this offence has had on the victim. I have in evidence a statement from her. It is not surprising that her life and her studies have been totally disrupted by this event and she has suffered considerable distress. It is important to take that into account”. 
        
       
      
    21 The deficiency in evidential quality of victim impact statements arising from the absence of compliance with general rules of admissibility and the absence of test by cross-examination requires sentencing judgments to exercise great care in making use of the content of such statements. However, in this instance, noting the heading on the document which is an amalgam of witness statement and victim impact statement, his Honour was entitled to have regard to it as he did as part of the evidential material which was received without objection. That he could properly do so is impliedly recognised by the ground which is expressed to complain of weight and not of admissibility. I would reject ground three. 
     
      
    22 Ground four asserted that his Honour erred in imposing a sentence which placed significant weight upon general deterrence over and above all other considerations. The ground misstates what his Honour said. He said that general deterrence was a very strong consideration, but he did not say that he reflected it over and above all other considerations. His Honour’s remarks were: 
     
      
       
        
        “But with an offence of this type, the court’s most important responsibility in my view is to send a message to the community generally that, no matter what the circumstances, that sexual intercourse with a woman when she does not consent and when the offender knows that she is not consenting is something that will result in a serious penalty and that this is a very strong consideration in the sentence that I intend to impose”. 
        
       
      
    23 In oral submissions, counsel submitted that his Honour should have taken into account in this regard the youth of the applicant and the circumstance that he had, to his Honour’s knowledge, passed through a serious illness in recent times. As I have earlier observed, when considering the maturity of the applicant, it can be seen as his Honour found that the applicant not only had trade qualifications but was in a supervisory position. I am unpersuaded that ground four is sustained. 
     
      
    24 In a final submission, in the event that this court were minded to re-sentence, the written submissions on behalf of the applicant stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not the submission of the appellant that a suspended sentence is an appropriate sentence in all the circumstances, but that a full-time custodial sentence is required to adequately reflect the objective criminality of the offence of sexual assault without consent. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        The discount allocated for the plea of guilty, approximately 16.6%, was appropriate. It was also appropriate for the court to vary the statutory ratio to the extent that it did for the reasons stated.  
        
       
       
        
        The appellant submits that if the court were to re-sentence him that a full-time custodial sentence, something less than that imposed at first instance, would be appropriate.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    25 In my view, the sentence imposed by his Honour must be categorised as lying within the lowest echelon of the range of available sentence for this serious offence and I would not consider that any lesser sentence should have been passed. In so saying, I have regard to the explicit terms of s 63 of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    26 In relation to the whole application, I would observe that it is difficult to conceive how a lesser sentence than that assessed by his Honour could be imposed for this offence, allowing the very greatest mitigation for the undoubtedly substantial matters available to the applicant. 
     
      
    27 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence, but dismiss the appeal

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentence imposed by Williams DCJ in Sydney District Court. Following a plea of guilty in the Local Court the respondent was committed for sentence on a charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. The prescribed maximum penalty for that offence is 25 years imprisonment and attached is a standard non-parole period of 7 years. His Honour sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 2 years which was suspended upon the respondent entering a recognizance with conditions to be of good behaviour for 2 years. Although not the subject of the Crown notice of appeal it can be mentioned that the respondent was called up by his Honour for breach of a recognizance granted at Manly Local Court on 23 January 2008. The breach was admitted and for an offence of common assault upon which the respondent had been found guilty at the Local Court his Honour sentenced the respondent to perform 200 hours community service. The offence which is the subject of this appeal occurred on 26 April 2008.  
     
      
    2 An agreed statement of facts was tendered and his Honour stated that he would not read out the content as he did not think that it was necessary. As an abbreviated summary he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The situation is that on 26 April in the very early hours of the morning the victim was attempting to leave the New Brighton Hotel at Manly. In opening the door to go outside he bumped into the shoulder of another person with whom there was some sort of confrontation. That other person was taken outside by security guards and then at that time Mr Miria stepped towards the victim from the victim’s left side. 
        
       
       
        
        He had a clear schooner glass in his right hand. He lifted his right hand above his head and began to swing it towards the victim, who was about half a metre away. The victim put his head down and turned towards the left to try and protect himself. He felt an immediate sharp pain in the middle of the back of his head and neck and there was a smashing sound. Mr Miria was apprehended by security guards and shortly afterwards by the police.” 
        
       
      
    3 The respondent’s prior record consists of three matters of common assault. The detail of two of these was in documentation tendered to the Court, although his Honour did not make express reference to it, other than to observe that previous offences had occurred in hotels in somewhat similar circumstances. He said that the offences appear to have arisen out of spontaneous reaction to relatively minor irritations.  
     
      
    4 Some brief reference to the prior record should be made. On 13 October 2003 at Mareeba Magistrates Court, Queensland, the respondent was ordered to pay a penalty of $300 but no conviction was recorded. On 24 November 2005 he was convicted at Manly Local Court and fined $1,000. Police were walking through a hotel at about 11.30 pm on 29 October 2005 and they saw the respondent delivering a number of punches upon a Mr Brown. Previously Mr Brown had bumped into another man while he was making his way through a large crowd in a beer garden. This person began to abuse Mr Brown and “head butted” him. The respondent rushed in and commenced to beat Mr Brown causing him to fall to the ground and he was continuing so to do when police saw what was happening and the respondent was restrained by them and by hotel security staff.  
     
      
    5 On 23 January 2008 again at Manly Local Court he was fined $1,500 and ordered to enter the recognizance which has been mentioned. At about 10.50 pm on 23 December 2006 the respondent was drinking in a hotel. A bar attendant asked a friend of his to leave the premises. The respondent spoke to the bartender about this, in the course of which he reached over the bar and punched him with his fist, as a result of which the bartender’s spectacles were broken but he sustained no personal injury.  
     
      
    6 The Crown submissions in support of the ground contend that two specific errors were revealed in his Honour’s remarks on sentence and it is convenient to deal with these.  
     
      
    7 First, his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The general deterrent effect of any sentence is debatable, given that it will at best be published as a statistic and thus unlikely to cause anyone else to act differently.” 
        
       
      
    8 The implication of that statement is that his Honour did not incorporate any reflection of general deterrence among the elements constituting his sentence assessment. Such omission was erroneous. The position at common law was described as well stated and often cited by Street CJ in R v Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594 referring to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in New Zealand in R v Radich (1954) NZLR 86 from which the Chief Justice extracted these observations: 
     
      
       
        
        “….one of the main purposes of punishment …is to protect the public from the commission of such crimes by making it clear to the offender  
        and to other persons with similar impulses 
         that, if they yield to them, they will meet with severe punishment” ( 
        Rushby 
         at p 597). 
        
       
      
    9 This concept was similarly affirmed by the High Court of Australia in the joint judgment (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1987-8) 164 CLR 465 at 476: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender  
        and of others who might be tempted to offend 
        , retribution and reform”. 
        
       
      
    10 The emphases are added. 
     
      
    11 It is true that the remark by Williams DCJ concerning debatability has precedent but there is no authority permitting a judge to dismiss general deterrence as a factor for sentence assessment. Of course, in circumstances which are found to be appropriate a particular offender may not be a suitable vehicle for manifesting general deterrence, for example if a mental condition disables the offender from appreciating the level of his wrongdoing: cf R v Scognamiglio [1991] 56 A Crim R 81. Nothing attracting that kind of consideration was suggested to be the case in this instance.  
     
      
    12 The respondent relied upon the opening words of Spigelman CJ in an extract from R v Wong & Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 where his Honour said (at 363): 
     
      
       
        
        “There are significant differences of opinion as to the deterrent effect of sentences, particularly, the deterrent effect of marginal changes in sentence. Nevertheless, the fact that penalties operate as a deterrent is a structural assumption of our criminal justice system. Legislation would be required to change the traditional approach of the courts to this matter.” 
        
       
      
    13 Although the remarks of Williams DCJ echoed the initial observation of the Chief Justice, he did not heed the important qualification which recognized the legal imperative to include general deterrence in sentence assessment.  
     
      
    14 In fact, as the Crown submissions observe, legislation has been passed subsequent to that statement and by its mandate it has resolved the debate so far as this State is concerned by declaring that a purpose for which sentence may be imposed is specifically “to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences” : Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 3A (b). 
     
      
    15 The Crown’s submission that his Honour erred in this regard should be sustained. 
     
      
    16 The facts of the offence by the respondent reveal that his actions are in a category which has already attracted comment in this Court and it is apparent that this is a case in which the need to include an element of general deterrence looms large. 
     
      
    17 In Sayin v R [2008] NSWCCA 307 Howie J stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence, popularly known as ‘glassing’, is becoming so prevalent in licensed premises that there are moves on foot to stem the opportunity for the offence to be committed by earlier closing times and the use of plastic containers. The courts clearly must impose very severe penalties for such offenders, but of course within the limits afforded by the prescribed maximum penalty.” 
        
       
      
    18 The second contention by the Crown focussed upon the remarks on sentence of Williams DCJ when his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view he is entitled to the maximum discount for his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity, particularly having regard to the fact that there was no attempt to plea bargain this matter down to perhaps a s 35 offence and thus incur a lesser penalty. He is to be given credit for that.” 
        
       
      
    19 As earlier observed the respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court and that early plea entitled him to a significant reduction of term for what has come to be expressed as the “utilitarian” value of the plea. It is possible that his Honour’s reference to the absence of attempt to bargain for a plea to a lesser offence was an abbreviated expression of a finding of remorse by reason of a perceived weakness in the Crown case and the plea of guilty in the light of such weakness and it was from those circumstances that there should be a grant of credit. A discount for a plea of guilty for utilitarian value should not take into account remorse and like subjective matters: R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 398.  
     
      
    20 It may be difficult for a prosecution to prove intent where the injuries are towards the lower end of a scale of seriousness, however there is no issue about the circumstance that the victim in fact suffered grievous bodily harm and by his plea of guilty the respondent acknowledged his intention to inflict it.  
     
      
    21 Although it may be possible to interpret his Honour’s remarks as abovementioned, in a literal sense it is not a matter of mitigation that an offender does not seek to have a prosecution accept a plea of guilty to a lesser offence than the offence charged when the offender acknowledges all the elements of it. In that light the Crown contention should be sustained. 
     
      
    22 Those errors attract the power of this Court to intervene. In short summary, the respondent appeared for sentence for an offence by which he caused the victim grievous bodily harm and he intended to cause injury at that level. His offending was aggravated by the currency of a recognizance entered into in respect of an offence involving violence. The statutory guideposts were a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years as abovementioned. In any event, allowing for all the aspects of the strong subjective matters found by his Honour, a sentence of 2 years imprisonment suspended from operation is so far below an appropriate range for offending in these circumstances that the ground that the sentence is manifestly inadequate should be upheld.  
     
      
    23 The evidence indicates that the respondent may now have a motivation to address the problems which are obviously sourced in his abuse of alcohol. The content of the report by Dr Matthew Jones can be noted in this regard without pausing to recite its content. However, the Probation and Parole Report was, it must be recognized, less promising. His Honour quoted the expressed concern therein that “he has continued to commit offences of a serious nature, again whilst intoxicated”. He commented that in fact there was one offence and not a number of offences but it seems clear that the officer was referring to the series of assaults including the present offence which constitutes the respondent’s record.  
     
      
    24 A parenthetical observation was made by his Honour “whatever that means” to the officer’s report where it was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been identified that cultural and family dynamics are factors which contribute to his abuse of alcohol. Whilst the methods of attending counselling appear to be constructive, Mr Miria’s response to such intervention and ability to develop his strategies towards positive change remain contentious.” 
        
       
      
    25 In the context of the report which concluded in the paragraph from which the above extract is taken with the statement “if Mr Miria is to be a law abiding member of the community, he will need to realistically address and resolve his personal issues and alcohol abuse”, the queried statement, whilst the jargon may be unfortunate, must surely simply seek to convey that whether the respondent can restrain himself from further alcohol fuelled offences is unpredictable. 
     
      
    26 The respondent should have an opportunity to pursue rehabilitation and to that end I would extend the balance of term of sentence beyond the statutory proportion so that this can be done, preferably under supervision whilst the respondent is on parole. I would formally find special circumstances. 
     
      
    27 The offence was spontaneous and, fortunately, the level of grievous bodily harm was not high and I would categorize the offence at lower than mid-range for such offences. Nevertheless the statutory maximum and the standard non-parole period above noted remain significant. The commission of the offence whilst on recognizance is an aggravating factor and the respondent’s prior record of offences, particularly as they involve assaults, although of lesser seriousness than the present offending, acts as a counter to the grant of special lenience.  
     
      
    28 As is well established, the allowing of a Crown appeal against sentence is a circumstance giving rise to restraint on resentence and the new imposition is likely to be less than would have been appropriately imposed at first instance. Resentence will, of course, allow the discount for early plea of guilty as found there. 
     
      
    29 I propose the following: 
     
      
       
      (1) Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      (2) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      (3) In lieu thereof the respondent sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 13 February 2009 and expiring on 12 February 2011 with a balance term of 2 years commencing on 12 February 2011. 
       
      (4) The earliest date of eligibility for parole is specified as 12 February 2011.

    31 LATHAM J: I agree.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 By summons filed on the 7th of May 2010, the plaintiff seeks orders against the defendant, Keith William Johnson, pursuant to the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006. 2 The final relief sought in the proceedings is that the defendant be subject to an extended supervision order under section 9(1)(a) of the Act for a period of five years. However, the State does not seek an order for the continued detention of the defendant.  
     
      
       
        
        The matter has proceeded today as a preliminary hearing under section 7(3) of the Act for the court to determine whether to appoint two psychiatrists to examine the defendant and furnish separate reports. The matter is also listed for a hearing of the State's claim for an order that the defendant be subject to an interim supervision order under section 8(1) of the Act from the 3rd of June 2010.  
        
       
      
    3 The defendant is presently serving a sentence of imprisonment for two years for the offence of indecent assault. The defendant's sentence expires on Thursday, the 3rd of June 2010.  4 The defendant committed the index sexual offence a little more than two months after his release from custody, at the expiry of his sentence in respect of the sexual offence that he committed in 2006. 5 The defendant is 69 years of age. He has a history of committing sexual offences against children and adults of varying ages. He has been convicted of sexual offences in New South Wales in 1992, 1998, 2001, 2007 and 2008. He has also been convicted of a sexual offence in South Australia in 1974. 6 There are also convictions in 1972 in Queensland and in 1982 in New South Wales, committed in a sexual context. For the main part, the defendant's victims of his sexual offences have been males aged 16 years or under.  
     
      
    7 In support of the present application, the State relies upon an affidavit of Emma Bayley, affirmed on 7 May 2010; a further affidavit of Emma Bayley, affirmed on 19 May 2010, with an attached exhibit which has become exhibit A on these proceedings; an affidavit of Cheryl White, affirmed 19 May 2010; an affidavit of Jillian Mears, affirmed 17 May 2010, with an attached exhibit that has become exhibit B on these proceedings; an affidavit of Nicholas Vrzic, affirmed on 17 May 2010, and a confidential exhibit which has been marked exhibit C on these proceedings; and, lastly, a chronology which has been marked exhibit D on these proceedings. 8 Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Act are relevant to this application. Sections 6 and 9 deal with extended supervision orders. Section 6, which is headed ""Application for extended Supervision Order"" stipulates the circumstances under which the State may apply to this court for an extended supervision order against a sex offender. 9 Section 6(3) provides that an application must be supported by documentation that addresses each of the matters referred to in section 9(3). 10 Section 9 is headed ""Determination of Application for extended Supervision Order"" and provides that an extended supervision order may be made if, and only if, the court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that, in determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the court must have regard to a number of factors that are listed from (a) to (i) in subsection (3). 11 Section 7 of the Act provides for a preliminary hearing to be undertaken in which the court is to consider whether it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a final order. If they would, the court is required to order that psychiatric examinations be undertaken of the defendant. If the court is not so satisfied, the application must be dismissed. 12 Section 8(1) of the Act empowers the court to make an interim supervision order if the offender's current custody will expire before the proceedings are determined and the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order. 13 The interim supervision order cannot exceed 28 days, although it can be renewed from time to time, but not so as to exceed a total period of three months. In these circumstances, it is necessary to have regard to section 9 of the Act and, in particular, to the factors identified in section 9(3),14 The court's role on an application for an interim order, under section 8(1), is the same as the task established on a preliminary hearing under section 7. At a preliminary hearing for an extended supervision order or on an application for an interim supervision order, the court must consider whether the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order. 15 At both the preliminary hearing, required under section 7(3) of the Act and when considering an application for interim supervision under section 8(1), the court is not to weigh the documentation or to try to predict the result of the case at a final hearing, but is to assess whether, if proved, the documentation would justify the making of either type of final order. This is to be determined on a prima facie basis. 16 I turn to the matters alleged in the supporting documentation for the purposes of determining whether they would satisfy the requirements of section 9. Those requirements are that the matters alleged in supporting documentation would, if proved, satisfy the court to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and the matters set out in section 9(3). 17 Turning, firstly, to the defendant's offending history, as required by section 9(3)(h) of the Act, the defendant has convictions for sexual offences in 1974, 1992, 1998, 2001, 2006 and 2008. The defendant also has convictions for aggravated assault on a female child in 1972 and an assault against a 12-year-old boy in 1982, both of which were committed in a sexual context. 18 The index sexual offence, which was committed on 16 May 2008, and, as I have noted, was committed little more than two months after his release from custody at the expiry of a sentence for a sexual offence committed in 2006, was committed on a 16-year-old male.  19 At the time of the offence, the defendant was 67 years of age. The defendant befriended the victim at Central Railway Station and assisted him in buying cigarettes. The defendant told the victim that he was an Aboriginal Elder in Western Australia and also that he was ex-army. When the victim's train arrived, the defendant offered to travel with the victim. During the journey, the defendant moved closer to the victim and twice placed his hand on the victim's leg. The victim objected and the defendant said, ""It's all right.""  20 Shortly after, the defendant forcibly placed his right hand down the front of the victim's jeans and underpants and squeezed the victim's testicles and penis. The victim stood up, but the defendant blocked his path. The victim then kneed the defendant to the leg and ran to get assistance from a guard. In the meantime, the defendant got off the train when it stopped at Hurstville Station. 21 The defendant was later interviewed by police and denied having left Central Station. He was unable to explain images of himself at Hurstville Railway Station shortly after the offence. 22 On the 3rd of November 2008, the defendant was sentenced to a term of two years imprisonment with a nonparole period of 18 months. The term of imprisonment commenced on 4 June 2008 and will expire on 3 June 2010. 23 Pursuant to section 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the court made an order directing that the defendant be released on parole on 3 December 2009, subject to conditions and supervision during parole, particularly in respect to sex offender programs. 24 The pre-sentence report of the 31st of October 2008 notes that the defendant described feeling disassociated from the circumstances of the offence and cited a period of blackout, primarily related to excessive alcohol consumption prior to the offence. A similar note appears in a departmental record of the 18th of November 2008. 25 In the course of that record, it is noted that the defendant declined to be assessed for the CUBIT Program stating that he denies the charges and has no recollection of the events.  26 In a psychological risk assessment report of the 6th of April 2010, Jillian Mears reports the defendant as asserting, in respect of the index offence, that the contact had been consensual and that the victim had lied. The defendant also confirmed that he was ""pretty drunk"" at the time. 27 Ms Mears reported that the defendant was bitter at having to plead guilty in order to avoid embarrassment for the victim and that he is in gaol at the victim's expense. 28 It is not necessary to recount in the same detail the offences, other than the index offence, constituting the defendant's criminal history. Suffice to say that all of the defendant's offences, but for an offence committed at Goulburn in January 2001 involved prepubescent and pubescent boys who were befriended by the defendant and sexually assaulted by him, generally by fondling of their genitalia, either inside or outside their clothing. In every case, the defendant claimed that the offences arose out of his excessive consumption of alcohol. 29 I turn to the matter provided for by section 9(3)(f) of the Act, namely noncompliance with parole conditions and other supervision obligations. 30 The defendant has a history of failure to appear and noncompliance with conditions of parole and good behaviour bonds. He has demonstrated a generally poor response to supervision. He has two convictions for failure to appear in court: One in October 1981; and another in May 1998. 31 His criminal history also records a number of entries where he has not appeared in court and a bench warrant has issued, namely in March 1981, October 1982, August 1983, March 1986 and November 1995. 32 In addition, when the defendant committed the offence on 25 October 1982, he was in breach of his recognisance to be of good behaviour for two years imposed on 26 November 1981. That recognisance had been imposed in respect of a conviction for taking and using *-a used motor vehicle without consent. 33 On 23 February 2007, the defendant was convicted of indecent assault and sentenced in the Mudgee Local Court to imprisonment for 18 months with a nonparole period of 12 months. He was ordered to be released on parole on 11 September 2007, subject to conditions and supervision. 34 On 25 October 2007, less than two months after the defendant's release on parole, the defendant's parole was revoked on the basis that he had failed to obey reasonable directions of a supervising officer; that he had failed to reside at an agreed address; and that he had failed to observe a condition not to associate with specified persons. 35 In revoking the defendant's parole, the State Parole Authority had regard to a probation and parole report of the 25th of October 2007, recommending that his parole be revoked as a matter of urgency. 36 Following revocation of parole on 25 October 2007, a warrant was issued and the defendant was returned to custody. He served the remainder of that sentence in custody. 37 Turning to the issue of the defendant's compliance with reporting obligations under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act of 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act of 2004, there are no complaints that have been made regarding the defendant's compliance with reporting obligations in this respect. 38 Turning to section 9(3)(e) of the Act and the issue of the defendant's compliance with sex offender treatment, it is noted that, prior to his entry into the CUBIT Program, the defendant's attitude towards treatment was described as being ""ambivalent to negative"".39 The defendant has, on occasions, indicated a disinterest in undertaking sex offender treatment. 40 On 29 April 2009, the defendant commenced the preparatory program for sex offenders. He attended 12 sessions, however, he was noted as refusing a referral to treatment programs. 41 On 19 October 2009, the defendant commenced treatment in the custodial-based CUBIT Program designed for high risk sex offenders. He completed the program on Tuesday, 26 May 2010. 42 In order to undertake the CUBIT Program, the defendant signed documentation consenting to decline parole until completion of the treatment program. The defendant would otherwise have been released on parole on 3 December 2009. 43 On 26 November 2009, at his request, the State Parole Authority revoked the defendant's parole order. A report of the 12th of November 2009 supported the defendant's request for revocation of parole. 44 After commencing the CUBIT Program, a treatment update report of the 2nd of March 2010 noted that the defendant's participation in group sessions varied between poor and satisfactory. The defendant's work in CUBIT, on issues directly related to him, was described as ""problematic"". The defendant was said to have displayed a pattern of avoidance that appears to be longstanding. 45 The defendant's treatment progress has also been described as ""very slow"" because his responses to questions, either in group or in written homework, are often not related to his particular situation or are so generalised that they are irrelevant. 46 In a report of the 6th of April 2010, Ms Mears records her discussions with a Mr McElhone on the 2nd and 24th of March 2010 relating to the defendant's progress in CUBIT. The defendant was reported to be experiencing difficulty engaging in a number of treatment-related issues. 47 Mr McElhone reported a concern about the defendant's emotional regulation and stated that avoidant and defensive behaviours by the defendant were a repetitive theme in treatment. The defendant's progress was described as ""slow"" and that that was likely to be the case just prior to his release from custody. 48 I turn to the issue of the defendant's abuse of alcohol (see section 9(3)(i) of the Act). 49 The defendant has a longstanding problem with the abuse of alcohol and has identified himself as a chronic alcoholic. He has reported that he began drinking alcohol from age 10. Furthermore, alcohol has been identified as a factor in respect of a number of his sexual offences. The defendant himself has linked his alcohol abuse with his sexual offending. Alcohol is linked to the offences in 1992, 2001, 2006 and 2008. 50 In an early psychiatric report of the 8th of October 1980, the defendant's severe drinking problem was noted. Since that time, his chronic alcoholism has been a constant theme in various reports, including a report of the 6th of July 1992 under the hand of Dr Yolande Lucire, a consultant psychiatrist. Dr Lucire said that the defendant has been a heavy drinker for 35 years and is not likely to change. 51 A court report of the 15th of May 1998 describes the defendant as a self-confessed alcoholic.  52 To similar effect is a report under the hand of Dr Stephen Allnutt of the 20th of February 2002. There are many other references to the defendant's alcohol abuse in pre-sentence reports in March 2002 and September of 2007. 53 I turn to the issue of risk assessment addressed under section 9(3)(c) and (d) of the Act. 54 In a psychiatric report prepared for the District Court and dated 20 February 2002, Dr Allnutt diagnosed the defendant as suffering from ""substance abuse disorder and dependence"". Dr Allnutt referred to the defendant's history of substance abuse, predominantly alcohol, dating from the age of ten, which significantly impacted on his occupational and social functioning. Dr Allnutt suggested that his history was indicative of possible paedophilia. 55 Ms Jillian Mears carried out a psychological risk assessment for the purposes of a potential application under the Act. Ms Mears is a recognised specialist in the field. For the purposes of her report, Ms Mears interviewed the defendant on the 2nd and 24th of March 2010. She assessed the defendant by reference to both actuarial risk assessment, otherwise known as ""Static 99 R"" and dynamic risk factors. 56 The defendant scored a 5 on the Static 99 R, thus placing him in the moderate to high risk category relative to other adult male sex offenders. 57 Ms Mears also considered the defendant's score of 5, by reference to relative risk. In this respect, Ms Mears stated that, in the Static 99 R sample population, sex offenders with a score of 5 showed 2.42 times the recidivism rate of a typical sex offender. 58 In terms of the defendant's age, Ms Mears regards the Static 99 R as underestimating his risk of sexual recidivism, having regard to the fact that the offender has sexually offended at 67 years of age and previously at 66 years of age. 59 In addition to the Static 99 R assessment, Ms Mears considered both stable, dynamic risk factors and acute dynamic risk factors. 60 In relation to the stable dynamic risk factors, Ms Mears had regard to intimacy deficits, social influences, distorted attitudes, general self-regulation and sexual self-regulation. 61 Ms Mears identified a number of stable dynamic risk factors for the defendant which, in summary, indicate that the defendant has limited capacity to invest in intimate and stable relationships; that he remains isolated and lonely with very limited social networks; that he has cognitive distortions associated with his offending; a life-long problem with general self-regulation and difficulty with sexual self-regulation. 62 In terms of the potential acute dynamic risk factors, Ms Mears identified substance abuse, emotional collapse, victim access and collapse of social supports as key risk factors. 63 Ms Mears states that, while the defendant recognises these factors, he has not yet developed the skills to manage them. Having regard to both actuarial and dynamic risk assessment, Ms Mears assessed the defendant as presenting a high risk of sexual re-offending. 64 The remaining matter to discuss is that referred to under section 9(3)(a) of the Act, namely the safety of the community. All of the above factors that have been discussed are relevant to this matter. 65 In summary, then, having regard to the safety of the community, the defendant has a lengthy history of committing sexual offences over a span of four decades. He committed the index sexual offence within a short period of time after his release from custody for a similar offence. He has a longstanding problem with alcohol abuse and a history of noncompliance with parole and supervisory conditions. 66 Whilst he is has undertaken the CUBIT Treatment Program, his progress was described as ""slow"" and he was assessed as presenting a high risk of sexual re-offending and requiring a high need for continuing supervision. 67 Taking all of these matters into account, I am satisfied that the orders requested by the plaintiff are justified. Accordingly, I make the following orders, pursuant to section 7(4) of the Act:  
     
      
     
     
      
      1. That Dr Allnutt and Dr O'Dea be appointed to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and that reports be furnished to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations on or before 8 July 2010, and I direct the defendant to attend those examinations.  
      
     
     
      
      2. Pursuant to section 8(1) of the Act, I order that the defendant be subject to an interim supervision order from 3 June 2010 for a period of 28 days and, pursuant to section 11 of the Act, direct that, for the period of the interim supervision order, the defendant comply with the conditions set out in the schedule to these orders which will be annexed to this judgment. 
       
       
      3. I list the matter for further mention and for the purpose of any application by the plaintiff to renew the interim supervision order before the duty judge at 2pm on Friday, 25 June 2010. 
       
       
      4. I grant liberty to apply on one day's notice. 
       
       
      5. I direct that access to the court file, in respect of any document, shall not be granted without the leave of a judge of the court. If any access is made by a non-party, in respect of any document, the parties are to be notified by the registrar, so as to be given the opportunity to be heard.

      2010/410845 RICHARDSON V THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES  
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1 In 1995 the Defendant was sentenced in respect of a number of offences including assault with an offensive weapon, intent to rob, and two counts of aggravated sexual assault.  
     
      
    2 He was sentenced by Newman J on 24 November 1995 to a 16-year head sentence for the attempted murder and two concurrent fixed terms for sexual assault. 
     
      
    3 The sentence for the sexual assault expired on 19 December 2004 and the sentence for the attempted murder expires on 19 December 2010. He was given a non-parole period in relation to the attempted murder charge which expired in 2004, but he has not been released on parole for the whole period of his head sentence.  
     
      
    4 The State of New South Wales now makes application under the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 for orders, first of all under s 8 for an interim detention order, and then under s 9 for an extended supervision order.  
     
      
    5 The reason for the late application is that the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010 only came into force on 7 December 2010. The effect of that Act was that if a prisoner was serving a sentence other than for a serious sex offence an application under the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 could be made whereas previously such an application could only have been made if the prisoner was serving a sentence at the time for the serious sex offence.  
     
      
    6 In any event, as I have said, the Defendant's sentence expires on 19 December 2010. The Plaintiff seeks orders that 2 qualified psychiatrists be appointed to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the Defendant, and asks for an interim 28-day order under s 16 of the Act. 
     
      
    7 The slightly unusual situation in the present case is that the Defendant has never been convicted of any other serious sex offences or, indeed, any other sex offences. There is evidence that he suffers from a mental illness, probably schizophrenia, and has for most of his life had substance-abuse problems. It seems likely that the offences for which he was sentenced by Newman J were committed under the influence of alcohol and drugs. 
     
      
    8 I have been provided with a large number of affidavits amongst which are affidavits from psychologists who have had contact with the Defendant in the prison system. Those affidavits record conversations with him as well as their appraisals of him, and identify the fact that the Defendant has violent tendencies and says that he intends to play out those violent tendencies if he can by harming or killing various people. However, none of the psychologists identifies any particular sexual violence or other indications of sexual problems in the Defendant.  
     
      
    9 The Defendant has been examined by Professor James Ogloff who is Professor of Chemical Forensic Psychology at Monash University. He has conducted what appears to be a lengthy examination of the Defendant and has provided a detailed report of that examination and his opinion of the Defendant. In particular he has given some detailed evidence about the likelihood of the Defendant re-offending in a sexual way as well as in a non-sexual way.  
     
      
    10 He carried out a series of tests and assessments on the Defendant. Two of those which concern the likelihood of sexual re-offending are the STATIC-99 instrument and the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol.  
     
      
    11 Professor Ogloff acknowledges the limitations in the use of STATIC-99, particularly for this Defendant who has been in custody for a long period of time. Nevertheless, based on the use of that instrument he assesses that the Defendant falls into the moderate to high category of risk for sexual re-offending. 12 Professor Ogloff’s assessment, based on the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol, identified that the Defendant's overall score fell at the lower end of the high range, indicating that the Defendant demonstrates most of the personality traits and behaviours associated with psychopathy, and that such a finding indicates (all things being equal) that his level of risk for re-offending again, violently and sexually, is greater than would be the case for someone with lower scores. He also concludes, on the basis of another Protocol known as 82R20, that the Defendant is at a high level of risk for re-offending violently. 
     
      
    13 Section 9(2) of the Act provides that on an application for an extended supervision order, which is a final order in these proceedings, such an order can be made only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. What the Court is concerned with is a risk of the offender committing a serious sex offence and not with the risk of the offender committing any other sort of offence, even an offence involving violence. 
     
      
    14 My task, however, where an interim order is sought, is on the basis of a number of authorities, in effect, only to be satisfied that a prima facie case has been made out. It is not part of my task to decide whether a final order is likely to be made: see Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119; The State of New South Wales v White (unreported – Grove J - 7 April 2009); Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Haytar [2007] NSWCA 983.  
     
      
    15 In State of New South Wales v Brooks [2008] NSWCA 150 Fullerton J discussed the requirements when an interim order is sought and drew attention, in particular, to the fact that because of the objects of the Act, two of which are to ensure the safety and protection of the community and to facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders, it is appropriate to give weight to risk avoidance.  
     
      
    16 The Defendant says that it is not appropriate to make even an interim order in the matter and points particularly to the lack of criminal record involving multiple sexual offences. I have already mentioned that the only sexual offences committed are those for which the Defendant was convicted in association with the attempted murder charge. 
     
      
    17 A challenge is made by the Defendant to a number of matters in Professor Ogloff's report including, for example, the chronology of some of the history that he took concerning, the length of sexual relationships that the Defendant has had in the past which is a matter that goes to the question of likelihood of sexual re-offending.  
     
      
    18 The Defendant challenges the paucity of the history taken by Professor Ogloff in relation to sexual matters and sexual deviance and points also to the fact that he had available to him records of the Defendant going back to the Defendant's childhood which would indicate that there was nothing of that sort in his history.  
     
      
    19 He also points to the fact that there is very much reduced significance in the failure of the Defendant to undertake various courses for sexual offenders available within the prison system. Whilst it is true that at one point that the Defendant conceded he refused to consent to undergo such a sexual offenders' program, it is said that that was at the time at which he was coming up, as he thought, for release on parole and for that reason he was not interested in undertaking it.  
     
      
    20 It is also said because of the particular classification of the Defendant at Goulburn gaol that the courses were simply not open to him whether or not he consented to undergo them. In that way it is said that the fact that he refused at one stage or another to undergo the courses ceases to have very much relevance. It is nevertheless significant in my view that when the Defendant was being examined by Professor Ogloff he declined to discuss with Professor Ogloff matters relating to his sexual history in any great detail and certainly declined to discuss issues associated with sexual fantasies. 
     
      
    21 The Defendant also points to the fact that for a number of years now within the prison system he has been able to be described almost as a model prisoner with all prison disciplinary matters having been some time in the past. 
     
      
    22 The Defendant particularly points to the fact that the majority of the material, whilst disclosing him to have a series of issues in relation to violence and also to have schizophrenia and, at least in the past, substance-abuse issues, is not indicative that there is any likelihood of a re-offending by the commission of sexual offences.  
     
      
    23 It seems to me that many of the submissions made by the Defendant are likely to be more appropriate to the consideration of whether there should be an extended supervision order. My task is, in effect, to determine if the material indicates that there is a prima facie case that an extended supervision order will be made having regard to the high degree of probability that s 9(2) requires.  
     
      
    24 In my opinion the evidence of Professor Ogloff, even accepting some of the limitations that needs to be placed on it, is sufficient for me to be satisfied that an interim order should be made.  
     
      
    25 I have regard to the fact that, although it was the view of the sentencing judge that the offences for which he was sentenced commenced merely as a robbery, nevertheless, they escalated to a very serious degree of violence and to prolonged sexual offending against the victim which resulted in the two particular charges. The length and extent of the sexual assault on the victim is an indication that they were not merely incidental to any robbery that was taking place at the time. 26 In my view the State has made out at least a prima facie case for an interim order and I intend to make the order contained in the Short Minutes.  
     
      
    27 I will note that the Defendant's counsel accepts that the form of the interim order contained in the Short Minutes of Order provided to me by the State is appropriate and I will make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 6 and grant the liberty to apply referred to in those orders.

      2009/5918 REGINA v Damien Charles BUGMY 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT – Fitness to Plead 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: The accused Damien Charles Bugmy has been committed to the Supreme Court for trial for the murder of his de facto partner Anita Rose Williams. The offence is said to have occurred at Ivanhoe on 14 June 2008. The question comes before me of his fitness to stand trial in respect of that charge, that issue arising under section 11 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.  
     
      
    2 Mr Bugmy was arrested on 14 June 2008, that is, the day of the alleged offence.  
     
      
    3 There was a previous fitness hearing conducted before Hidden J (R v Bugmy [2009] NSWSC 1215) which began on 27 October 2009. His Honour described the Crown case in these terms: ( at [2]) 
     
      
       
        
        “2. Put shortly, it is the Crown case that the accused fatally stabbed Ms Williams at the house where they were staying in the afternoon of 14 June 2008. Their relationship had not been without its difficulties. He had been drinking during the day of the killing and was well affected. There was no eyewitness to the killing, but the accused went to a nearby house and raised the alarm, asking the occupants of that house to ‘come and check’ Ms Williams because ‘there is something wrong with her’. Ambulance officers and police arrived, and the accused said to the police, ‘She’s dead. I can’t believe I killed her.’” 
        
       
      
    4 Having received medical evidence, and having heard evidence from Professor Hayes and the then solicitor for Mr Bugmy, that is, Ms Emma Manea, Hidden J, on 13 November 2009, made a determination that, as a matter of probability, Mr Bugmy was unfit to be tried. He then referred the matter to the Mental Health Tribunal.  
     
      
    5 On 21 June 2010, the Mental Health Review Tribunal conducted a determination of fitness and published reasons on that day for its view that Mr Bugmy was fit it be tried. The decision of the Tribunal referred to the medical evidence placed before Hidden J, that included a report from Dr Furst (forensic psychiatrist) and Professor Greenberg (forensic psychiatrist). Both Dr Furst and Professor Greenberg found that Mr Bugmy had sufficient capacity to meet the requirements of what has become known as the Presser Test (Smith J in R v Presser (1958) VR 45 at 48). 
     
      
    6 However, at approximately the same time as the review undertaken by each of these doctors, there was an examination by Professor Hayes. She found, having conducted certain tests concerning the mental capacity of Mr Bugmy, that there were significant deficits and, in her opinion, also deficits in his understanding of the complete range of issues required by the Presser Test. Professor Hayes expanded in these views in her evidence before Hidden J. 
     
      
    7 In her evidence before Hidden J, the then solicitor for Mr Bugmy, Ms Manea, reported her perception of Mr Bugmy’s difficulties in comprehending matters important to his ability to give instructions during the trial that had been foreshadowed. 
     
      
    8 The Review Tribunal also examined material which had become available since Justice Hidden's determination. It included nursing reports that made detailed observations of Mr Bugmy whilst in gaol and his progress. It included a report from Dr Stephen Woods, whose views were set out in the Tribunal's findings. He found that, given time to process information, an appropriate explanation and assistance, Mr Bugmy was fit to stand trial. 
     
      
    9 There was a further report from Dr White before the Tribunal. Dr White had the opportunity of treating Mr Bugmy and had observed him after he entered custody. He found that he had a rudimentary understanding of the Presser criteria and was fit for trial.  
     
      
    10 The Tribunal, in these circumstances, said this:  
     
      
       
        
        “The Tribunal has also had regard to the original material before the trial judge and to Mr Bugmy's oral evidence before the Tribunal. On that material, supplemented by the material before the Tribunal, Mr Bugmy appears to be fit for trial. Having regard to issues of culture, educational background and the necessity for fairness in the procedure, it appeared clear that Mr Bugmy was able to sufficiently to instruct his counsel. The Tribunal therefore concluded that for the purposes of section 16 and section 47(4), Mr Bugmy had become fit for trial.""  
        
       
      
    11 The Tribunal's conclusion was, therefore, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to:  
        
       
       
        
        The expert oral and written evidence presented by Dr Andrew White, Dr Stephen Woods, Dr Richard Furst, Professor Greenberg, Professor Susan Hayes and Ms Barbara Wojtkowiak; and 
        
       
       
        
        The fitness criteria referred to in the decisions of Smith J in  
        Regina v Presser 
         [1958] VR 45 at 48, and Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in  
        Kesavarajah v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 245, 246:""  
        
       
      
    12 In the hearing before me, Ms Kerry Robinson (solicitor), who now acts for Mr Bugmy, was called to give evidence. She was assigned the file on 1 February 2010. The file reached her a matter of weeks after that date. 
     
      
    13 Since that time she has conferred with Mr Bugmy at length on six occasions and had other conversations from time to time, including today. She has discussed with him the trial process and the various options available to him, as well as defences that may be available to him.  
     
      
    14 She has the impression that, over the ten months that she had been seeing him, he has an understanding of the system and the choices available to him. He has been attentive and has exhibited concentration during their conferences. She is satisfied that he understands the defences available and that he is able to give rational and reasonable instructions. 
     
      
    15 Ms Robinson indicated, when cross-examined by the Crown, that, when she inherited the file, she reviewed the material in the file and was aware of the evidence given by Ms Manea and the determination of Hidden J. She was conscious of that material when she conducted her conferences with the accused. She approached the matter cautiously and found him, as I have stated, to be attentive and to exhibit concentration. He was not, to use an expression which appears in the material, ""a blank wall"". She regarded him as having the requisite capacity according to the Presser criteria.  
     
      
    16 Both the Crown and Ms Manuell SC, who appears for Mr Bugmy, have urged a finding, as a matter of probability, that Mr Bugmy is fit for trial. I am persuaded upon this material that he is fit and I so find.  
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    17 This being my determination, I order: 
     
      
       
      1. That the matter be listed before the Arraignment Judge on 4 February 2011. 
       
       
      2. That Mr Bugmy be remanded in custody in the meantime.

     JUDGMENT 
    2 BARR J: The appellant appeals against convictions entered in the District Court following his trial by a jury and the Crown appeals against the sentences imposed. The appellant was charged with three counts of what may be shortly described as indecent assault upon the complainant, Margaret Heathwood, who was at the time under the age of 16 years. The first count was alleged to have taken place between 1 January and 3 August 1976 at Caringbah, when the complainant was 11 years of age. The second was said to have taken place at Caringbah between 1 September 1975 and 30 June 1976 when the complainant was 11 years of age. The third was alleged to have taken place at Wanda Beach during 1977, when the complainant was 12 or 13 years old.3 The complainant was born on 3 August 1964 and during the 1970s lived with her mother, father and sisters in Caringbah. She attended a Church school. Her mother and father were adherents to the Catholic faith. In October 1975, when the complainant was 11 years old, the appellant joined the parish as assistant to the parish priest, Father Keller. The appellant visited the school which the complainant attended and she saw him there as well as at church. He visited her home occasionally and took afternoon tea. He officiated at a baptism and at a marriage that took place in the family. He had not long before emerged from a long period of years in an enclosed order of monks. He was apparently a likeable man and the complainant developed an affection for him as well as the respect which was due. He developed an affection for her.4 The appellant and the complainant got into the habit of jogging round Caringbah oval early each morning. The oval was close to the complainant’s house. The Crown case was that the two would do sprints and rests and exercises and that the appellant would use the occasions of the exercises to hug the complainant. As he did so the appellant put his hands down inside her pants and touched her on the bottom and on the outside of the vagina under her underwear.5 There was one occasion which the complainant could identify, because after the appellant had handled her in the manner I have summarised she saw Father Keller nearby, at the gates to the oval. That made her very embarrassed and made the occasion stick in her memory. The priest had apparently walked to the oval from the direction of the presbytery. They had a conversation that she remembered, about the priest’s having trained an athlete at that same oval.6 That occasion was made the basis of the second count in the indictment.7 The Crown case was that early in 1976 the appellant began taking the complainant into the sacristy of the church and over a substantial period of time indecently assaulted her there on many occasions. The one which was made the subject of the first count took place on Ash Wednesday in 1976. The complainant remembered it because the appellant called her into the sacristy to look at the ashes he had prepared for ritual purposes. On that occasion he pulled down her pants, touched her on the breast and touched her on the outside of her vagina. He rubbed himself against her until he ejaculated.8 The complainant began attending Endeavour High School in 1977 and the Crown asserted that during that calendar year the appellant took her in his car to Wanda Beach from time to time. Whilst they were in the car he put her hand on his penis and had her masturbate him. He fondled her on the breast and inserted his finger into her vagina. The first occasion on which those things happened was made the subject of the third count.9 The complainant also said that the appellant indecently assaulted her in more or less similar ways at other places, including in his bedroom in the presbytery.10 The jury convicted the appellant of the first two counts and acquitted him of the third.11 Judge Ford of Queen’s Counsel, the trial judge, sentenced the appellant on each count to imprisonment for two years to be served by way of periodic detention. Both sentences commenced on 11 November 1998.12 The first ground of appeal is that the verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, because the jury could not have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant on the third and not at once entertain a reasonable doubt about his guilt on the other counts. Reliance was placed on Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439.13 The question for this Court is whether upon all the evidence the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant on the first two counts. M v The Queen (1984) 181 CLR 487; Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439.14 An appellate court should interfere only where there is no way properly to reconcile the verdicts said to be inconsistent. If there is some evidence to support the verdicts said to be inconsistent it is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. Jones v The Queen at 456.15 The appellant’s submissions coupled what was said to be an inconsistency of verdicts with these features - 
     
      
       
        
         
         1 There was an unexplained delay of more than 20 years between the offences and the trial; 
          
         2 The offences were said to have occurred in circumstances in which other people might have noticed something, yet there was no independent evidence to support the complainant’s evidence; and 
          
         3 No directions were given to the jury on the impact of delay. 
         
        
       
      
    16 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that there was no way of reconciling the verdicts. The Crown submitted that there were a number of ways of doing so, but principally because the Crown bound itself at trial to prove that the events charged on any count occurred within the times set forth in the indictment. The third count was different from the others, because there was evidence which the jury might have used to raise a reasonable doubt whether, although the event occurred as the complainant said it did, it did not occur until after 1977.17 The evidence of the complainant was that the appellant indecently assaulted her many times over a period of years. One of the considerations in framing the charges was no doubt the need to identify occasions which could, by reference to the evidence, be distinguished from every other occasion. S v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 266. Accordingly, for the second count the Crown relied on the only occasion at the oval on which there had been a conversation with Father Keller, for the first count on the only occasion on which the appellant had called the complainant into the sacristy to look at the ashes and for the third count on the first time that the complainant was taken by the appellant to Wanda Beach.18 Unless there is a reason to treat them differently, pleadings as to the time at or the times between which an alleged offence was committed are regarded only as particulars. Indictments which fail to state time or state it wrongly or imperfectly will not be held bad or insufficient unless time of the essence. Crimes Act s 360. If during a hearing it appears that an offence was committed at a time other than that pleaded, the court of trial has power to order the amendment of the indictment. Crimes Act s 365. However, this Court has no power to amend. R v Burns (1920) 20 SR (NSW) 351.19 Proof of time may become essential for various reasons. For example, although it has not become contentious in this appeal, the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt in the present case that any offence took place before the complainant’s sixteenth birthday. That was a requirement of the statute creating the offences with which the appellant was charged. Sometimes the parties make time essential by the way they refine the issues during the conduct of a trial.20 As this trial began it would not have been considered that the times particularised in the indictment were essential (there could have been no suggestion that anything relevant had happened after the complainant turned sixteen years of age), even though the parties knew that the complainant had already exhibited some uncertainty about the precise times at which events happened.21 It became obvious during the examination and cross-examination of the complainant that she was uncertain as to the times at which things had happened, the state of affairs then existing and the order in which they had happened. The dates of two events, however, were certain. The complainant turned eleven years old on 3 August 1975 and the appellant did not arrive in the Caringbah parish until October 1975, when the complainant was eleven years old.22 The complainant said that she accepted the appellant’s invitation to go jogging with him. She had already met him and the invitation was extended to her one day at school. After that she went jogging with him every day for years and years, including 1977 and 1978, when she was in years 7 and 8 in high school.23 She said that she began to have her periods in year 5, when Sister Maria was her teacher. It was at the end of the year. It was agreed that Sister Maria was the complainant’s teacher in year 5, 1975, but not in the next year.24 In cross-examination the complainant was reminded that she had told the Local Court at committal that she had got her periods around the middle of the year when she was ten or eleven. Her response was that she was sure that she started her periods during year 5.25 She said that she started jogging with the appellant in year 5, towards the end of 1975, before she began her periods. She remembered his asking her whether she had started her periods. She knew that she had not done so because she did not understand his question. She agreed with the cross-examiner that it was “some months” after she met the appellant that she began jogging with him. She was then invited to agree that she did not begin jogging with him until 1976. These questions and answers followed - 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. But you’ve already agreed with me that it was some months after you first met him that you started jogging with him? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. You couldn’t have met him until October 1975? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. So if it was some months after that that you started jogging with him, it must have been 1976? 
          
         A. Why? 
          
          
         Q. Because October 1975 and then some months takes you into 1976, do you understand that? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Do you accept that? 
          
         A. Yes I accept that. 
          
          
         Q. So you started jogging with him after you had your first period didn’t you? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
       
      
    26 The complainant was reminded about her statement she had made to the police on 9 May 1996. These questions and answers follow - 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. It says, “I remember one time we were running around the oval. One day he said to me, “Have you got your periods yet?”. I didn’t know what they were so I said, “No””. Right? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. “I was 10 years old at the time”? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. That means that that incident occurred before August 3 1975 doesn’t it? 
          
         A. No. that means that at the time I made this statement I was inaccurate. 
          
          
         Q. I see. So when do you say you started jogging with Father Cox? 
          
         A. In year 5. 
          
          
         Q. You see you’re now being very vague about the time when things happened, you’re just saying generally in year 5 because you now know that he didn’t arrive at Caringbah until October 1975. I suggest to you you’ve been caught out and you’re changing your story? 
          
         A. I’m trying to keep to my story as much as I can because it’s the truth. 
         
        
       
      
    27 The cross-examination continued - 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. See you said in the statement to the police that you were ten years old at the time this conversation occurred between him and you didn’t you? That’s in paragraph 9 of the first statement? 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: On page 5. 
          
          
         Q. That’s wrong isn’t it, according to what you’ve said? 
          
         A. Yes, it’s wrong. 
          
          
         Q. And it then says after the statement, “I was ten years old at the time when this conversation occurred. A few weeks later I got my periods.” Do you see that? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. You were ten years old up until August 1975, that’s right isn’t it? 
          
         A. Yes, but I mean maybe I was saying I was ten years old in relation to being in year 5, I don’t know. Maybe ten, eleven, year 5. I’m not very good with numbers which is probably why this is all. 
          
          
         Q. You didn’t say anything in this statement about it happening in year 5. You just said you were ten years old at the time the conversation took place, that’s right isn’t it? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. And a few weeks after that conversation you said you got your periods? 
          
         A. That’s what it says. 
          
          
         Q. And it’s wrong isn’t it? 
          
         A. It’s inaccurate. 
          
          
         Q. You know that Father Cox was never even here when you were ten years old don’t you? 
          
         A. Well I know that now. 
          
          
         Q. So your statement made to the police is wrong isn’t it? 
          
         A. It’s inaccurate. 
          
          
         Q. It’s wrong? 
          
         A. It’s six months out. 
          
          
         Q. Can’t you use the word “wrong”? 
          
         A. Okay, wrong, wrong. 
          
          
         Q. And you’ve changed your story haven’t you? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
       
      
    28 As I have observed, there was nothing to fix the second count in time by reference to its particular facts. If, as the complainant told the jury, her periods began at the end of 1975, it was not impossible for her to have jogged with the appellant before that event or for the subject of the second count to have occurred before her periods began. I have not lost sight of the fact that the complainant agreed that jogging had not begun until “some months” after she met the appellant, but the term “some months” is vague and could admit the commencement of jogging, followed after a few weeks by the commencement of periods, all by the end of 1975. The complainant did not concede that jogging had not commenced until 1976.29 The complainant was reminded that she had told the Local Court that the events the subject of the second count had happened before her periods began. These questions and answers followed - 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. Miss Heathwood, you were asked in the magistrate’s court, again by Miss Dennis, this question. “Did the incident that you told us about, the jogging when you were jogging with him”, reference to Father Cox, “and you recalled a specific incident when Father Keller came up afterwards, did that happen before or after you already had your periods, if you can remember?”. See that? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Your answer was, “Before”? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. That right? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Your recollection now is that it was some months after, is that right? 
          
         A. That answer was wrong. 
          
          
         Q. If that answer was wrong, can you give any explanation as to why it was wrong? 
          
         A. I was possibly nervous, upset, not really a very - I can’t really give you a very qualitative answer, a solid one. 
         
        
       
      
    30 The evidence on the first count, the sacristy incident, was that the complainant was in year 6 and may still have been eleven years old. The appellant invited her in to look at the ashes which had been prepared for use on Ash Wednesday. The complainant demonstrated for the jury the use of the thumb in the ritual of ashing. Although the appellant assaulted the complainant in the sacristy many times, this was the first occasion, and the only one of which she spoke in which there had been any mention of ashes.31 The complainant was cross-examined about the incident but not about the timing of it.32 The evidence about the third count was that the appellant took the complainant to Wanda Beach on a number of occasions, beginning in 1977 and continuing after the end of that year. The complainant was of the ages of thirteen to fifteen during that period of time. That might have permitted the assaults to have continued as long as 1979. The event relied on for the third charge was the first occasion on which such a thing had happened. The complainant said that the appellant took her in his light blue car and that the assault took place on the front seats of the car. They were individual, reclining seats. In cross-examination she confirmed that the seats reclined. It was suggested to her that the appellant’s car had a bench seat at the front in 1977, and she said that she did not know. These questions and answers followed - 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. I suggest to you Miss Heathwood that you are wrong about Father Cox’s Car. You have wrongly described it? 
          
         A. Should I answer? 
          
          
         Q. Your description of the car that Father Cox had at this time I suggest to you is wrong, because he had a car which had a bench seat, not individual bucket seats? 
          
         A. Okay, well I will have to acknowledge what you are saying. 
         
        
       
      
    33 Later on there were this question and answer - 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. I suggest to you that Father Cox didn’t have a car that had bucket seats in it until May 1978, are you able to recall that? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
       
      
    34 The appellant gave evidence. He said that between 1975 and 1978 he had a Holden car with a bench seat in the front. In May or June 1978 he acquired a large Ford car which had bucket seats in the front that could be reclined. It was an ex-police car and the registration plate bore the letters JSA and numbers the appellant could not remember.35 A letter from the Roads and Traffic Authority was tendered which showed that the appellant acquired a 1977 Ford sedan JSA-391 on 13 May 1978. Of course, the letter said nothing about the seats of the car.36 His Honour summed up the case to the jury and made some reference to the arguments of counsel and the evidence. In doing so his Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
         
         All of these charges allege an assault and at the time of the assault the commission of an act of indecency. In respect of the first and second charges, the first one being the sacristy allegation and the second involving the jogging allegation at that time it is said in the charge that Margaret Heathwood was then eleven years of age and the dates which are expressed there are very important as you will appreciate. Important because there is some evidence to indicate Margaret Heathwood could very well be mistaken if the events did occur then nonetheless she was mistaken as to the occasions when they did occur, the times when they did occur, the dates when they did occur.  
         And if she is mistaken about dates it may also indicate that she may not be accurate when she gives evidence as to the alleged act of indecency involved 
         . (emphasis added). 
         
        
       
      
    37 At the end of the summing up defence counsel, relying upon that passage, asked for a further direction. Counsel said this - 
     
      
       
        
         
         Your Honour it is just this question of dates. I haven’t in the course of my address to the jury made a big point of it, I didn’t intend to at least I should say, the jury may wonder what situation they are in if they believe for example that - just to use an example, the Wanda beach incident happened in early 1978 as it was suggested rather than in 1977, as I understand the way the case has been put the dates are an element, the date of which the alleged offence committed is an element of the offence, I would in the circumstances seek a direction which effectively informs the jury that if they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the incident in particular happened at the time alleged then they should acquit. I know your Honour in the course of your Honour’s summing up did say that dates are very important, I am just reading from my inadequate notes but your Honour said dates are very important, if she is mistaken about the date then perhaps she is wrong about the fact that she was indecently assaulted. 
          
         Your Honour the direction that I would ask is that if she is mistaken about the date and the jury were in fact to find that perhaps incidents of the kind alleged did occur but not in the time frame alleged in the indictment then they must still acquit because that’s an element of each of the offences. It is important because of that s 78 (sic) problem in particular. 
         
        
       
      
    38 I think that the reference in the transcript to “that s 78 problem” contains a typographical error. Counsel must have been referring to the possibility of a finding that the event happened in 1978.39 When invited to respond, the Crown prosecutor said that he did not have any difficulty with that request.40 Accordingly, his Honour gave the jury the following additional direction - 
     
      
       
        
         
         … the dates, the dates are important and you must when you consider each of these charges consider whether or not it has been established, and established beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged incident if it did occur occurred in the time span specified. 
         
        
       
      
    41 The existence of the problem adverted to by defence counsel in seeking the further direction arose out of the evidence of the purchase of the Ford car and related only to the third count. However, the request was not confined to that count. The evidence about the third count and the difficulty of distinguishing between the events of 1977 and 1978 were adverted to only as an example of the problem, not as the whole problem.42 In the circumstances his Honour’s further direction was a proper one, and the contrary has not been submitted in this Court. The result is that the Crown took upon itself to prove not only that the events had taken place but that each of them had taken place within strictly defined temporal limits. R v VHP Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 June 1997, unreported; R v Dossi (1918) 13 Cr App R 158.43 In view of the evidence of the date of acquisition of the Ford car, assuming that it and not its predecessor had reclining seats, there is an obvious reason why the jury might have wished to acquit the accused of the third count. Such an acquittal on the temporal basis would be consistent with an acceptance of the honesty of the complainant and a reasonable doubt about her accuracy as to time.44 Were the jury, then, obliged also to have a reasonable doubt about the times between which either of the other two events relied on took place? It is convenient to deal with the second count first. The period of time pleaded began on 1 September 1975. There was no reasonable possibility that any assault took place before that day because the appellant did not enter the parish until the following month.45 However, because of the way the Crown limited its case, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the incident happened by 30 June 1976. I am unable, by reference to the evidence, to understand the significance of that date.46 The complainant said various things which might have related to the date of the assault. She told the jury that she got her periods late in 1975 and that it happened after that. She conceded that she had told the magistrate that it happened before she got her periods. She was sure that it happened whilst she was in primary school. In her examination in chief she told the Crown prosecutor that it happened when she was eleven years old. She also said this - 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. Are you able to assist us with when it was that this incident occurred? 
          
         A. I was in year 5. Now (sic) I was in Year 6. It wasn’t the first time that we had been jogging. 
          
          
         Q. This was some time after the first time? 
          
         A. It was still in primary school. 
          
          
         Q. You say it was Year 6. Are you able to identify any bench mark that can - against which you can identify this having occurred in Year 6? 
          
         A. Well no not really. 
         
        
       
      
    47 The complainant conceded that she had told the police in her statement that it happened whilst she was in 5th grade.48 These questions and answers also appear in the transcript - 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. Miss Heathwood, how long after you started jogging did the incident with Father Usher occur, I’m sorry, not Father Usher, Father Keller? 
          
         A. A long time later, like, months. I was - I believe that I was in year 6 when that happened. 
          
          
         Q. You’re sure about that? 
          
         A. As sure as I can be in that I know that I was still at primary school. 
          
          
         Q. How old were you when it happened? 
          
         A. Twelve, 11, 12. Because my birthday is in August, in the middle of the year. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         Q. You say that that was some considerable time after you first met Father Cox do you? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. How long? 
          
         A. I was in year 6. 
         
        
       
      
    49 The complainant was shown a copy of one of her statements to the police and these questions and answers followed - 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. That’s a description of the general incident which you say involved Father Keller about which you’ve given evidence in this Court, is that right? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. You see the first two lines of the paragraph? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. You say the incident happened at the end of 1976, is that the truth? 
          
         A. I don’t know. I know that it happened in primary school and I believe that it happened a long time after the jogging, but. 
          
          
         Q. You know the purpose of the second statement was to clarify in particular times and dates when things occurred don’t you? That was explained to you by the police wasn’t it? 
          
         A. Yes, but I was also told not to worry about exact dates because it happened such a long time ago. 
          
          
         Q. You were asked to clarify dates. You agree with that don’t you? 
          
         A. Well yes and clarify what happened. 
          
          
         Q. And you understood the seriousness— 
          
         A. Very much so. 
          
          
         Q. –attaching to this document didn’t you? 
          
         A. Very much. 
          
          
         Q. And you understood obviously the importance of being as accurate as you possibly could? 
          
         A. Always. 
          
          
         Q. And you said in that statement that the incident involving Father Keller happened at the end of 1976? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Is that right? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. When you were twelve years old, is that right? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
       
      
    50 I think that the jury were entitled to make proper allowance for the inability of the complainant to state precise dates, especially because of the distressed condition in which she found herself from time to time during the trial, but it seems to me from the evidence cited and summarised above that it was not possible for the jury to exclude the reasonable possibility that the incident happened after 30 June 1976. The complainant’s evidence that the incident happened when she was eleven years old would make such a conclusion reasonably possible. If she was twelve years old, the offence must have been committed outside the range of dates permitted for a conviction.51 I think, therefore, that the difference between the verdicts on counts three and two is not explained by the raising of pleaded times from a particular to an element of the charges.52 The complainant said that the event the subject of the first count happened during 1976 and there was no suggestion that she had ever said that it happened in any other year. It happened on or close to Ash Wednesday, which fell in February of that year. It must have happened between the pleaded dates 1 January and 3 August 1976. On the temporal basis, there is no inconsistency between the verdicts on the third and the first counts.53 That is not the end of the matter, however. That the jury convicted the appellant on the second count and acquitted him on the third when they should have acquitted him of both shows either that the verdicts were compromised or that the jury entertained a reasonable doubt on the third count for reasons which applied to that count but not to the other counts.54 I have carefully considered the evidence on all counts, putting aside the uncertainties about times. The evidence on all counts was attended by common problems for the jury, namely - 
     
      
       
        
         
         (a) The very age of the events, resulting in accounts by the two opposing witnesses which lacked precision and spontaneity; 
          
         (b) The fact that there was sworn evidence from only two witnesses, both unsupported by objective evidence, giving opposing versions; 
          
         (c) The fact that neither version was internally inconsistent or inherently improbable; 
          
         (d) The fact that the criticism of the complainant’s motives, namely an assertion that she had invented the story out of a grievance against the Church or in an attempt to recover monetary compensation, applied equally to all counts; 
          
         (e) That the defence assertion that the complainant exaggerated (a matter which went to her honesty rather than her accuracy) applied equally to all counts; and 
          
         (f) That the defence criticism of the Crown case, namely that there were alleged to have been many hundreds of similar events which might or ought to have come to the attention of members of the public but that no such person came forward, applied equally to all counts. 
         
        
       
      
    55 It seems to me that, apart from any evidence going to discrepancies about times, there was no evidentiary basis upon which the jury could properly have distinguished between the third count and the other counts. Their convicting the appellant of the second count shows that they did not dispose of their verdicts on the temporal basis. That being so, the verdicts are unreasonable because they are inconsistent, so the conviction on the first count must be set aside as well.56 It is unnecessary to deal with the other grounds of appeal.57 The appeal should be allowed and the convictions quashed.58 The Crown appeal against the sentences imposed by his Honour does not arise.IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL

     ADAMS J 
     : I have read the judgment in draft of Barr J, to which I am indebted.  
      
     60  
     I agree with his Honour that the verdict on the second count cannot stand. Having regard to his Honour’s review of the facts in the case, it is not necessary for me to repeat them in my judgment. I wish, however, to refer to some particular matters.  
      
     61  
     As Barr J mentioned, the occasion relied on in respect of the third count in the indictment was the first time that the complainant was taken by the appellant to Wanda Beach. She was, she said, then in Year 7 at High School. She said that they went to Wanda Beach approximately four or five times and that the light blue vehicle in which the assaults took place had reclining or bucket seats. Although her evidence is somewhat confused about this, she eventually disclosed that trips in the car to Wanda Beach or to other beaches when assaults occurred, took place once a week (in the summer months) from the age of about 13 to 15, that is to say in 1977, 1978 and 1979. Aside from his denials, the appellant’s evidence was that although he had a blue motor vehicle in 1977, it was a model without reclining or bucket seats and that he did not acquire a car with such seats until the end of May 1978. The complainant had said that these assaults in the car had occurred at first at the same time as those in the sacristy. However, over time, the latter assaults ceased. For the reasons expressed by Barr J, I agree that the most likely explanation for the jury’s verdict on the third count was that they accepted that it was reasonably possible that the appellant did not have a car fitted with reclining or bucket seats until late March 1978. Even so, the mere statement of dates does not, to my mind, expose the real measure of the complainant’s possible confusion. She appeared to be quite adamant that the offences occurred, in effect, in her first year of high school which, to my mind, would be a significant marker. For the complainant it was especially significant since the high school to which she was sent was not the high school of her choice and it is clear that she deeply resented being sent there. I am not unmindful that the effluxion of time since the offences with its consequent effects on memory together with the emotionally laden character of the incidents themselves, might well explain a significant degree of confusion. However, it is important not to overlook other possible explanations more adverse on the issue of credibility and to bear in mind that the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt rests on the prosecution. Thus, even though the most likely explanation is mere confusion of dates, the question remains whether, together with all the other evidence, there was, in the end, a reasonable doubt about guilt in a substantive sense.  
      
     62  
     As I have said, I agree with Barr J’s conclusion that the conviction on the second count should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. I agree that it was, to use his Honour’s language, not possible for the jury to exclude the reasonable possibility that the incident happened after 30 June 1976, that date being, with the agreement of the Crown, an element of the offence. As his Honour mentioned, the evidence does not explain why that date is significant. Nor is there an explanation as to why no amendment of the indictment was sought when, on the face of it, a proper basis for such an amendment was available. However, this does not mean that there was no good reason for the specification of the date in the count nor that there was no good reason for the prosecutor not to seek an amendment. I mention these things simply because it might otherwise be thought that allowing the appeal by reference to a date which is not usually regarded as an element requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt might be thought to be unduly technical. It would be quite wrong for this Court to speculate why the prosecutor took the course he did in the Court below, still more, to suppose that he did so inadvisedly. 
      
     63  
     Grounds of appeal 2 and 3 are in the following terms - 
      
       
     2. On the whole of the evidence, the jury should have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the Appellant on the first and second counts on the indictment. 
      
       
        3. The quality of the evidence adduced in relation to the first and second counts on the indictment was insufficient to establish the offences charged in those counts beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       There does not appear to me to be any material difference in these grounds.  
        
       
      
     64  
     So far as the provisions of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 are concerned, the question posed by these grounds of appeal is whether “the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”. Although, for the reasons stated in  
     Fleming v The Queen 
      [1998] HCA 68 (11 November 1998), the phrase “unsafe and unsatisfactory” which has hitherto been commonly used in this context is potentially confusing and should be abandoned, the test for determining whether a verdict is unreasonable or not supportable on the evidence, is nevertheless that articulated by the majority in  
     M v The Queen 
      (1994) 181 CLR 487: see  
     Jones v The Queen 
      (1997) 191 CLR 439 per Gaudron McHugh and Gummow JJ at 450 - 2. To use the language of s 6, the test to be applied to a verdict which is sought to be set aside as unreasonable or not supportable on the evidence, is whether the Court is of the view that upon the whole of the evidence it was “open to the jury” to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. In  
     M 
     , the majority said (181 CLR at 493) - 
      
       
     In answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.  
      
     65  
     The application of the test was explained as follows (181 CLR at 494) - 
      
       
     In most cases, a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a Court of Criminal Appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.  
      
     66  
     In  
     Jones, 
      Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ (191 CLR at 452) point out that the ‘open to the jury’ test is significantly different to that implied by asking whether the jury  
     must 
      have had a reasonable doubt or whether the evidence for the prosecution was so weak or flawed as to make it  
     wrong 
      for the jury to accept it. These latter tests were described by the majority in  
     Jones 
      as “much stricter” than the test formulated by the majority in  
     M 
      (191 CLR at 453). 
      
     67  
     It was submitted on behalf of the appellant in this court that the complainant’s version of events was ‘inherently improbable’. However, whilst an ‘inherent improbability’ might well be fatal to acceptance of any particular fact, I am of the view that the relevant test is not correctly so described. One of its more obvious problems is that the assessment of the evidence of a witness is almost never confined to its inherent probability but will involve in the overwhelming majority of cases a consideration of the whole of the evidence including, in a case of this kind, the evidence of the accused. After all, in this case, there was nothing which was inherently probable in that evidence either and, of course, if there was a reasonable possibility that it was true then acquittal must follow.  
      
     68  
     The jury was confronted with the evidence of the complainant which, although confused in some respects, was certainly capable of belief but was not supported in any way by other or objective evidence, together with the contradicting evidence of the appellant also reasonably capable of belief and also, in every material respect, uncorroborated. As it happened, however, the jury (on one view of the verdict of acquittal) considered that it was reasonably possibly true that the appellant did not possess a car with reclining or bucket seats until 1978 and thus that when the complainant asserted that sexual assaults had occurred in such a vehicle in 1977, they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was so. It was argued by the Crown in this Court that, by contrast, the offence giving rise to the first count had occurred on one specific occasion and therefore was not subject to the weaknesses which may have affected the other counts. However, the particularity of this count is more apparent than real. The evidence of the complainant concerning the date of the offence contained in the first count is as follows - 
      
       
     Q. And was there an occasion when you were in the sacristy with the accused? 
      
       
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q. How did that come about, how did you come to go there? 
        
        A. He invited me to have a look at the ashes. 
        
        Q. What ashes? 
        
        A. Palm Sunday, the palms are burnt for Ash Wednesday and they put a charcoal cross and that’s where they burnt the ashes. 
        
        Q. You have just demonstrated by using your thumb to mark a cross on your forehead. The ashes from the palms that are burnt are used? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Who does that? 
        
        A. The priest. 
        
        Q How old were you when you went into the sacristy with the accused? 
        
        A. Eleven. No, I was in sixth grade. 
        
        Q. In Year 6? 
        
        A. So I may have still been 11, yes. 
        
        Q. Because you had turned 11 in Year 6? 
        
        A. In Year 5. 
        
        Q. Now what happened in the sacristy?  
        
        A. I don’t remember seeing the ashes. I remember standing in front of a mirror with my back to it. Can I have a break? 
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, you may step down if you wish. Is there someone here that you can speak to? 
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes there is your Honour. 
        
        WITNESS STOOD DOWN 
        
        SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
        
        Q. Now on the - just in relation to what you were telling us about the sacristy, you told us that it was to see the ashes to be used after Palm Sunday? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q. I think you told us you were in year 6 at that time? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q. How did you come to go to the sacristy with the accused, how did that come about? 
        
        A. He was - he came out, I think he was in church, we were on the grounds, he said “Come and have a look at the ashes”. 
        
        Q. What were you doing? 
        
        A. I was playing in the playground, I think I was riding my bike, or I could have been throwing a ball. But the playground was a playground. 
        
        Q. And when he made - or give that invitation, you followed him to - into the sacristy? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q. By what means did you enter that room? 
        
        A. The door, the back door. 
        
        Q. The external door? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. What time of day was is? 
        
        A. It was afternoon. 
        
        Q. A school day? 
        
        A. No, it was the weekend your Honour. 
       
      
     69  
     Later, when cross-examined, she said that she remembered the ashes were burnt and added “It was Ash Wednesday”. She said, at a later stage, that the accused was burning the ashes in preparation for Ash Wednesday. The complainant was unable to say whether the jogging incident occurred before or after the sacristy incident saying “I can’t go and - I can’t - it’s all one thing, it’s just all - well, you know, obviously, it does. 
      
       
     Q. Are you now able to answer the question, which event occurred first? 
      
       
        A. Which event out of the sacristy and the jogging? 
        
        Q. Yes. 
        
        A. The jogging was always - I’ve always said the jogging occurred first. 
       
      
     70  
     The jury were directed that the sacristy incident occurred when the complainant was invited by the accused to view the ashes which were “ashes of palms burnt after Palm Sunday, which were used apparently on Ash Wednesday”. As was pointed out in cross-examination of the complainant and is the fact, this could not have been accurate since Ash Wednesday occurs forty days before Easter Sunday whilst Palm Sunday occurs only the week before Easter Sunday. Furthermore, although his Honour directed the jury that of the incidents that allegedly occurred in the sacristy, that which was the subject of the charge was the first, the complainant did not in fact give that evidence, either explicitly or implicitly. To my mind, the reasons that led the jury to acquit on the third count, which depended (at least) on the reliability of the complainant’s evidence as to the vehicle in which the assaults allegedly occurred, applied with almost equal force to the first count where conviction depended, according to the way in which the essential elements of the charge were put to the jury, upon whether it occurred after Palm Sunday 1976. 
      
     71  
     The complainant said that sexual assaults in the sacristy occurred once or twice a week for a number of years; she went jogging every day except when it was raining or she was ill and she said that on every one of those occasions sexual assaults occurred. Whilst this intensity of sexual activity is, of course, possible, to my mind it is improbable.  
      
     72  
     I accept that the evidence of the complainant, considered by itself, might well be accepted to be true, although it demonstrated the adverse elements to which Barr J referred and which I have briefly mentioned. Those elements are, however, quite capable of innocent explanation. On the other hand, the evidence of the appellant was also, considered by itself, capable of being believed.  
      
     73  
     In my opinion, it is wrong to approach the issue as to the reasonableness of the jury’s verdict as though the accused had not given evidence. Such an omission may have significant forensic consequences: see  
     Weissensteiner 
      (1993) 178 CLR 217 and  
     OGD  
     (unreported NSWCCA 3 June 1997). It is correct that the jury were entitled to reject the defence case but, of course, it could not do so before weighing up the whole of the evidence, including what the accused’s testimony. One possible approach to this question is to ask whether the accused’s version of events is reasonably possible so that conviction depends upon determining beyond reasonable doubt that it is not reasonably possible.  
      
     74  
     In  
     Moffa v The Queen 
      (1977) 138 CLR 601, the Court was concerned with the ‘defence’ of provocation in connection with the charge of murder. However, the principle applied by the Court is apt in a case such as the present. Barwick CJ said (at 601) - 
      
       
     Of course, if a jury does not believe the account of the accused of the matters which are suggested to constitute provocation, it may be said that the Crown has satisfied the onus of establishing that the killing was unprovoked. But their function is not merely to weigh the accused’s credit. If the accused’s account is a reasonably possible account - and that is the first step they must take - they must in substance be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those events did not happen. Disbelief of the accused may not in all the circumstances compel that satisfaction to the requisite degree.  
      
     75  
     In  
     Regina v Johnston 
      (unreported NSWCCA 31 July 1998), the Chief Justice (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said (at 16) - 
      Cases involving alleged sexual assault are only one example of criminal proceedings in which the conduct of a defence can be adversely affected by delay. There are however cases which are characterised by a direct conflict of word against word, between a complainant and an accused. It is often the case that there will be no independent verification of the basic allegations of whether a sexual act occurred at all, and if it is conceded that it did occur, whether it was a consensual act. In order to resolve a direct conflict of oral testimony, the contextual details of the alleged conduct will often prove to be of determinative significance. However, it is precisely such contextual details which may be lost by reason of delay. 76 After citing Longman (168 CLR at 90-91), his Honour commented (at 17) - There are two features of the Longman warning which should be emphasised. First, the jury is to be told why it is “dangerous to convict” namely, the delay meant that the evidence of the complainant could not be “adequately tested”. Second, the jury is to be told how they should go about their task because of the identified danger namely, “strutinize the evidence with great care”.77 In considering this question and, indeed, the level of appropriate acceptance of the complainant’s evidence, the delay of some twenty years between the time of the alleged offences and their disclosure by the complainant was a very significant matter. In Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 91, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said -  But there is one factor which may not have been apparent to the jury and which therefore required not merely a comment but a warning to be given to them: see Reg v Spencer [1987] AC at 141. That factor was the applicant’s loss of those means of testing the complainant’s allegations which would have been open to him had there been no delay in prosecution. Had the allegations been made soon after the alleged event, it would have been possible to explore in detail the circumstances attending on its occurrence and perhaps to adduce evidence throwing doubt upon the complainant’s story or confirming the applicant’s denial. After more than twenty years that opportunity was gone and the applicant’s recollection of it could not be adequately tested. The fairness of the trial had necessarily been impaired by the long delay (see Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 31-32, 42-44, 56-57, 71-72) and it was imperative that a warning be given to the jury. The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. 78 No such direction was given in this case by the learned trial Judge; indeed, none was sought. However, it seems to me that this Court, in evaluating the reasonableness of the jury’s verdict, must bear in mind the significance of the effluxion of time on the nature of the cases presented, with the result that the prosecution case might appear to be stronger than it actually is and the defence case weaker than it now appears. 79 This argument is quite independent of that based upon the (frequently mistaken) supposition that delay in complaint indicates that the complaint is likely to be untrue. The argument that time may have robbed both the prosecution and the defence of corroborative material and thus can be ignored only has to be stated to demonstrate its error. Furthermore, the passing of time effects the manner and content of the evidence given by the protagonists. Of course, as has frequently been observed, offences such as that charged here are almost invariably performed in secret. However, the offences allegedly committed on Canterbury Oval and in the sacristy, not to speak of the school and the presbytery, were places to which other persons had access. Indeed, the jogging incident allegedly occurred when one Father Keller was relatively close by, whilst one of the most vividly recalled incidents in the music room of the school (of doubtful admissibility, as it seems to me) occurred whilst some people were outside the room, requiring it was said, the complainant and the appellant to remain in the room for a considerable time before they were able to escape undetected. 80 Whatever might have been the consequences had the failure to give a direction in accordance with the Longman been made the subject of this appeal, it is clear that this Court must take (as the jury should have taken) the considerable delay into account in evaluating not only the complainant’s evidence but also that of the appellant. I mention also, but in the circumstances I do not think it necessary to do more, the warning in R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 where the Crown case comprises in substance the evidence of one witness unsupported by any other evidentiary material. Again, no such direction was given and none was sought; but it seems to me that this warning is one to which we should give heed. In this respect, I am somewhat concerned with the way in which the learned trial Judge dealt with the issue of the complainant’s evidence and the onus and standard of proof in his directions to the jury. This was not the subject of an application for redirection; nor was it the subject of submissions in this Court. I raise it because it such directions are given from time to time and create, as it seems to me, a serious risk that the jury will misunderstand their purport. His Honour said this - You are the sole judges of the facts in the case. You decide the question of credibility - what evidence is to be believed, what evidence is not to be believed and there may be a situation of course where you would not know what to believe. And in that third position where you do not know what to believe, then the only possible verdict is one of not guilty. And it is only if you accept the evidence of the complainant Miss Heathwood and accept her evidence as being substantially true that you could find the accused guilty of any one or more of these charges. 
      
       
        Bear in mind that the burden of proving the case is upon the prosecution and remains there throughout the proceedings. That burden of proof does not ever shift to the accused person. He is not called upon or required to prove anything. It is for the prosecution to prove its case and if there is to be a finding of guilt, it must be on the basis that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused on the basis that you are satisfied that each and every element of the charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
      
     81  
     I think that the language used by his Honour was capable of suggesting to the jury that ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ meant the same as ‘substantially true’. It must be remembered that the jury is listening to a statement so that there is no opportunity for analysis of the written word and the distinction between evaluating the complainant’s evidence on the one hand and the standard of proof of the elements of the offences charged on the other may not have been obvious. This would be especially so in a case where the whole of the case of the Crown rested upon the evidence of the complainant. I also consider that the phrase ‘substantially true’ is dangerously ambiguous. In the context of this case, the jury had to be satisfied that the complainant’s account of the material events identified in the indictment was true beyond reasonable doubt. To my mind, the fact that his Honour did not identify the elements of the charge to which he referred significantly adds to the confusion which may have resulted from these directions.  
      
     82  
     I am left with a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant on the first, and if it be material, on the second count. I do not consider that the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable in the circumstances of this case of resolving this doubt. Accordingly, the conviction on these counts “cannot be supported having regard to the evidence” (vide s 6(1),  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
      1912) and must be quashed. I also agree with Barr J’s conclusion that the verdicts on the three counts cannot be reconciled.  
      
     83  
     I agree with the orders proposed by Barr J.

     70044/98 REGINA -V- JOHN CHARLES MAXWELL 
    Reasons for Verdict1 HIS HONOUR: The accused, John Charles Maxwell, stands charged with the murder of Mervyn James Alchin at Wagga on 25 March 1998. He has been tried by me sitting without a jury. There is no issue that he killed the deceased. The only matter to be determined is whether he was mentally ill, as the law understands that expression, at the time of the killing.2 The accused is now twenty-five years old and was twenty-three at the relevant time. He is a single man. He had been living with his mother at Darlington Point. In early 1998 he moved to Wagga and took up residence with a lifelong friend, Brendan Carter. He was an accomplished footballer and he began playing with a local football club at Wagga. It was in that context that he met the deceased, Mr Alchin, who was a man of about fifty years of age who was described as a strapper at that club.3 On 20 March 1998 the accused had an argument with Mr Carter about his, that is the accused's, standard of tidiness in the house. The accused left and moved in with the deceased. It was there in the early afternoon of 25 March that he killed the deceased. He attacked him with a knife, inflicting a large number of wounds. To recount the details of the incident and of the deceased's injuries would be needlessly distressing. It is sufficient to say that it was a sustained and ferocious attack. From the injuries and from the accused's own account of the event I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to kill the deceased. His counsel, Mr John Nicholson SC has not suggested otherwise. Accordingly, the elements of the crime of murder are made out.4 To understand the circumstances it is necessary to examine the accused's psychiatric state. On this aspect I have the benefit of expert evidence from two experienced and respected forensic psychiatrists, Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr C L Wong.5 Dr Nielssen, in his capacity as a visiting psychiatrist with the Corrections Health Service, treated the accused for a considerable period of time from 1 April 1998, only a matter of days after the killing. The history he obtained from the accused was to the effect that about eighteen months prior to the killing he began to experience auditory hallucinations. These were benign at first but increased in intensity. He began to attend church and to read the Bible and he formed the idea that passages in the Bible related to him. Indeed, he came to believe that he was the Son of God. 6 More significantly, the voices became demonic. He believed that he heard the voices of demons who wanted to kill him because he was the Son of God. He believed that they had great powers and came to believe that he was in acute and immediate danger of being killed.7 He had been popular and had many friends but as the illness developed he began to withdraw from social contact, and became distrustful even of good friends. Dr Nielssen also obtained from the accused a history of his use of alcohol and drugs but I do not consider that to be material for the purpose of my decision today. 8 There is some confirmation of this history in the other evidence in the case. In a statement to police the accused's mother, Mrs Brenda Maxwell, spoke of a deterioration of his mental condition over the period of months leading to the killing. She recalled his hallucination of a demonic figure in the fire of the home. He spoke of seeing demons in his bedroom. She confirmed his interest in religion and the Bible, which she said he had never had before, and her account of that interest suggests it to have been obsessional. On one occasion he claimed to her to be Jesus. His mother spoke of other bizarre behaviour which it is unnecessary to recount.9 She became sufficiently concerned to ask him to seek treatment. Indeed, it seems that on her behalf an arrangement was made for the accused to see a local medical practitioner, Dr Robert Byrne, but he did not attend for that appointment and he refused to seek any treatment. One can only wonder if the deceased might well be alive if he had not refused.10 Similar observations of the accused to those of his mother were made by his friend, Brendan Carter and another lifelong friend, Rohan King. Both of them spoke particularly of his religious obsession and his withdrawal from normal social contact. 11 I also received in evidence in the defence case the statement of Mr Geoffrey Foster, a former police officer, who knew the accused through his interest in rugby league. Mr Foster is himself a religious man. He said that the accused had never been religious and spoke of his new involvement in the Bible as ""unguided and misinterpreted"". It is clear that Mr Foster had held the accused in very high regard as a person and sportsman, but he described his behaviour in the period leading to the killing as spiralling downwards.12 On the night before the killing, 24 March, Brendan Carter visited the accused at the deceased's home, having heard that he was unwell. The accused told Mr Carter that he had been having really bad headaches. Mr Carter visited him again, twice on the day of the killing. On the second occasion, in the early afternoon, the accused came to the door holding a knife. He was pale. He told Mr Carter not to come in and said that he was ""freaking out"". Mr Carter asked if he was all right but the accused slammed the door. Mr Carter could hear him mumbling in the house but could not decipher what he was saying.13 Tragically, the deceased came home from work early that day because he was feeling sick. It was when he arrived at the home in the early afternoon that he met his death. What happened is encapsulated in the history which the accused gave Dr Nielssen and I quote from pp 2 and 3 of Dr Nielssen's report, exhibit 2: He said that Mr Alchin came home soon after Mr Carter left, and went to the toilet in the laundry before coming into the house. Mr Maxwell said he believed Mr Alchin's delay in coming into the house arose from preparations to kill him, and caused him to arm himself with a knife and stab Mr Alchin to death when he came into the house.14 I pass over the next sentence and the beginning of the one after it and, starting in mid-sentence, the doctor continued: …the immediate reason for attacking Mr Alchin was that the voices told him that Mr Alchin planned to kill him. He said that after stabbing Mr Alchin he took his car and attempted suicide by crashing it into a tree. However, he said the car spun into a paddock and he escaped uninjured and was treated at the roadside before his arrest, where he again heard voices urging him to kill the people attending him.15 His mother said in her statement that in the late morning of that day the accused phoned her and said that he was “stressing out”. It appeared to her from the telephone conversation that he was then hearing voices. 16 The accused made full admissions to police of what he had done. In an electronically recorded interview in answer to question 62 he said that when he drove at the tree he wanted to kill himself, rather than someone else, but that he missed the tree.17 Mrs Mavis Menz saw this course of driving, which by her description was quite erratic, and she saw the car veer on to the paddock where it came to rest. She went to the accused's assistance. She said that the accused looked vacant and did not appear to understand her when she spoke to him. He spoke of wanting to go to “Joyland”. The accused told an ambulance officer who attended the scene, Mr Colin Apps, that he meant to hit the tree and he admitted to Mr Apps that he had killed a man. 18 At the hospital to Det Senior Const Burns the accused said, ""I have killed him. I am in hell now."" To Det Inspector Bernasconi at the hospital he said: ""I'm fucked man. The devil made me do it. I killed the cunt and I will kill someone else. No reason, just the devil.""19 In the course of the recorded interview with police the accused's description of events revealed the same delusional pattern which he had described to Dr Nielssen. Indeed, in answer to a series of questions commencing at question 203, he said that from the previous day he had been scared to leave the house because the voices told him he was to be killed. In answer to question 80, he said that he did not know why he killed the deceased, he was just ""a pawn"".20 For the most part during that interview his answers were responsive to questions but some answers were unresponsive and bizarre, consistent with his religious fantasy, and his answer to one of the questions, question 138, suggests that he was hearing voices in the course of the interview itself.21 He later took part in what is known as a walk through of the scene which was video taped and that video was shown in court yesterday.22 When Dr Nielssen first saw him in custody, only days after the offence, he described him as floridly psychotic. He said his condition improved only after what he described as enforced medication. 23 In the video of the walk through interview the doctor saw, as he described in evidence, clear signs of mental illness, although he noted that the accused's demeanour was much more subdued than it had been when he saw him in prison. He saw this as explained by the fact that during that walk through the accused was accompanied by a number of police officers and was responding to questions asked of him.24 Let me turn then to the law relating to the defence of mental illness. The Crown having proved the elements of murder beyond reasonable doubt, the burden of proof shifts to the accused to satisfy me on the balance of probability that he was mentally ill at the relevant time.25 The leading legal authority on mental illness is still the reported summing up of the former Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Owen Dixon, in R v Porter, a trial which took place in 1933 but the summing-up of which was reported some years later in 55 CLR 182. In some ways, Sir Owen Dixon's language is the language of the thirties but what his Honour said remains as true today as it was then. Speaking of the rationale of the defence of mental illness, his Honour said this at p186: The purpose of the law in punishing people is to prevent others from committing a like crime or crimes. Its prime purpose is to deter people from committing offences. It may be that there is an element of retribution in the criminal law so that when people have committed offences the law considers that they merit punishment, but its prime purpose is to preserve society from the depredations of dangerous and vicious people. Now, it is perfectly useless for the law to attempt, by threatening punishment, to deter people from committing crimes if their mental condition is such that they cannot be in the least influenced by the possibility or probability of subsequent punishment; if they cannot understand what they are doing or cannot understand the ground upon which the law proceeds. The law is not directed, as medical science is, to curing mental infirmities.26 At p188 his Honour gave the time honoured definition of the defence of mental illness in law: there must be a state of disease or disorder or mental disturbance arising from some infirmity, temporary or of long standing. It must be of such a character as to prevent the accused from knowing the physical nature of the act he was doing or from knowing that what he was doing was wrong. It is the second leg of that twofold definition that is relied on here. It is not suggested that the accused was unaware that he was stabbing a man, and doing so fatally, but it is urged that his mental illness was such that he was prevented from knowing that what he was doing was wrong.27 Sir Owen Dixon expanded upon that concept a little later in the summing up at pp189-190. His Honour said this: If through the disordered condition of the mind he (that is, the accused) could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by “wrong”? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.28 I have the evidence of two eminent forensic psychiatrists whose opinions are that the defence is made out. Properly and responsibly, the Crown Prosecutor has not submitted to the contrary, although she has taken that stance only after a careful consideration of the evidence and a brief but searching cross-examination of Dr Nielssen yesterday. Nevertheless, the decision remains one for me, assisted as I am by the stance taken by counsel, and I must examine the psychiatric opinions in the light of the whole of the evidence. 29 Before I turn to the psychiatric evidence what I can say is this, the other evidence establishes that the accused was only recently acquainted with the deceased. There is no suggestion of any animosity between them. Nothing in the evidence points to any rational motive for the accused having attacked the deceased particularly with such savagery.30 I gather from the evidence that the accused has no prior convictions and that he was normally not an aggressive person. I have referred already to the statement of Mr Geoffrey Foster, the former police officer, that he was a young man of impeccable character. The observations of his mother and of the other witnesses to whom I have referred makes it clear that his mental condition was deteriorating seriously in the period leading to the killing. All these matters lend force to the conclusions of the psychiatrists. 31 Both psychiatrists diagnose schizophrenia, a very serious mental illness. In evidence yesterday Dr Nielssen recited, from the history of the accused's behaviour in the months leading up to the killing, the classic symptoms of that terrible disease. Dr Nielssen's conclusion was this, and I read from pp5-6 of the report: Mr Maxwell is a twenty-four year old man who killed a man he had only recently met as a result of symptoms arising from an acute episode of psychotic illness. The psychosis was characterised by eighteen months escalation of full syndrome of schizophreniform symptoms, including delusions of reference, thought broadcasting and vivid, frightening auditory hallucinations. Mr Maxwell had never previously been treated for mental illness or had any alternative explanation for his symptoms presented to him and believed at the time of the offence that the victim planned to kill him. There was no provocation or any kind of rational basis for wanting to harm Mr Alchin. 
     
      
       
        The corroborative statements confirm that Mr Maxwell underwent a morbid change in the months before the offence, characterised by withdrawal from company and a preoccupation with religious themes. 
       
      
    32 I pass over the next sentence and continue: He had no history of any kind of criminal conviction and although he was a semi-professional footballer, according to the statements provided he was not known as an aggressive or violent person.  
     
      
       
        I believe Mr Maxwell has the mental illness defence open to him as he had a defect of reason, that is a belief that the victim was planning to kill him owing to a disease of the mind, that is acute schizophrenia. Mr Maxwell probably knew the nature and quality of his act as the voices told him to kill the victim and other people. However, he was not aware that the act was morally wrong as he believed that the world was populated by demons with superhuman powers who planned to kill him because he was the son of God. Moreover, the effects of an acute psychotic episode of the type observed in Mr Maxwell made it impossible for him to reason with a moderate degree of calmness. 
       
      
    33 Dr Nielssen in oral evidence encapsulated his opinion by saying that the accused was acting in a kind of self-defence because of his delusional beliefs.34 Dr Wong in his report, part of exhibit A, expressed his opinion in this way and I read from pp4-5 of his report: There is no doubt that the accused was suffering from acute symptoms of Schizophrenia at the time of the alleged killing and for about one and a half years prior to that. These consisted predominantly of delusions, largely of a persecutory nature, and auditory hallucinations.35 I pass over a number of sentences and continue: The symptoms he manifested are highly characteristic of the illness. The account he gave me is in keeping with the observations by his mother and his friend Brendan. It is also consistent with the account he gave to the police at the record of interview. I have no reason to believe that the accounts he gave were anything but genuine. 
     
      
       
        The accused was aware of what he was doing and that what he was doing was wrong at the time of the alleged killing. However, being consumed with his delusional beliefs and hallucinations and in the grip of intense fear engendered by his abnormal experiences, it could not be said that he was able to reason about the rightness and wrongness of his alleged act with any degree of sense and composure. I am therefore of the opinion that he can avail himself of the defence of mental illness. 
       
      
    36 After examining all the evidence, and giving appropriate weight to the opinions of the two experts, I am satisfied that the defence of mental illness has been made out to the requisite standard. Indeed, in my view, no other view could possibly be taken of the evidence. In arriving at that conclusion I have regard to the consequences of the special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness, as I am required to do by s37 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. Dr Nielssen gave evidence of those consequences yesterday.37 My verdict is that the accused is not guilty by reason of mental illness.38 I turn now to the order which I must make. In the light of my verdict, I order that the accused be detained at the Long Bay Prison Hospital or at such other place as may from time to time be determined by the Minister for Health until released by due process of law. 39 The Court extends its deepest sympathy to all those affected by the loss of the deceased.

     REGINA -v- COLLEEN THERESE GILLARD 
      
    1 THE COURT: The appellants, who are husband and wife, appeal against their convictions and Ronald Douglas Gillard seeks leave to appeal against the alleged severity of the sentence imposed on him following a joint trial in the District Court, Sydney, which took place before a judge and jury between 28 April, 1997 and 6 May, 1997.2  The appellants were found guilty on the following charges:-3 Count 1: That Ronald Douglas Gillard between 1 March, 1989 and 1 June, 1990 at Sans Souci did have sexual intercourse with V, a child between the age of 10 years and 16 years, namely 13 or 14 years and then under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard.4 Count 2: That Colleen Therese Gillard during the same period of time and at the same place, did have sexual intercourse with V, being then under the age of 16 years, namely 13 or 14 years and under the authority of the said Colleen Therese Gillard.5 Count 3: That Ronald Douglas Gillard and Colleen Therese Gillard between the same dates and at the same place, did commit an act of indecency towards V, being then under the age of 16 years, namely 13 or 14 years and under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard and Colleen Therese Gillard.6 Count 4: That Ronald Douglas Gillard between the same dates and at the same place did have sexual intercourse with V, a child between the age of 10 years and 16 years, namely 13 or 14 years and under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard.7 Count 5: That Ronald Douglas Gillard between the same dates and at the same place did assault V and at the time of the said assaults, did commit an act of indecency upon the said V, being at the time of the said assault under the age of 16 years and under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard.8 Count 6: That Ronald Douglas Gillard between the same dates and at the same place, did have sexual intercourse with D, a child between the age of 10 years and 16 years, namely 12 or 13 years and under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard.9 Count 7: That Ronald Douglas Gillard and Colleen Therese Gillard between the same dates and at the same place did commit an act of indecency towards D, the said D being then under the age of 16 years, namely 12 or 13 years and under the authority of the said Ronald Douglas Gillard and Colleen Therese Gillard.10  The Crown case which, by its verdict, the jury accepted with regard to each count may be summarised as follows:- Count 1: 11  The complainant V was born on 20 October, 1975. In January, 1989 she moved with her parents and sister D to Taren Point where they took up residence in a partly completed boat, which their parents were building. The accommodation in the boat was very cramped, there were no shower facilities and the family environment was poor. The male appellant worked in a scrap-yard adjacent to the boatyard where the boat was located. 12  The complainant V and her sister D used to collect cans and bring them to the metal scrap-yard where they were paid some money for them.13  The complainant V was first introduced to the male appellant by her sister D, who had been to the appellants' house swimming and looking after their two children, aged 3 and 5 respectively. V said that her parents had also met the appellants. She was first invited to the appellants' house in the same suburb of Sans Souci around April of 1989.14  On the first evening that V slept over at the appellants’ house she was given wine with her evening meal and became light headed. She went to bed at about 10.30 pm. She heard footsteps in the corridor and the male appellant came into her room and got into bed with her. He moved his hand under her underwear, touched her breast area and her vaginal area and then put his fingers in her vagina. She said it hurt. She gave evidence that she moved and he then put his finger deeper into her vagina. The appellant left the bedroom and the next morning asked the complainant V if she had enjoyed it.15  The complainant V said that she considered the appellants’ home to be a better environment than living in the partly completed boat. She gave evidence that she liked to play with the appellants’ children and to swim in the pool at their house. After the incident, which gave rise to Count 1, she continued to visit the appellants’ home about once a month, often sleeping the night.  Counts 2 and 3: 16  The complainant V gave evidence of being in the appellants’ home around January, 1990. She consumed wine at dinner and was lying on the appellants’ bed with their children. The female appellant put her children to bed in another room and following her return, the complainant gave evidence of having seen her place her husband’s penis in her mouth and thereafter to engage in sexual intercourse in her presence. The complainant V gave evidence that she wanted to leave the room, but was told that she could stay if she wanted to sleep there. She remained in the double bed and gave evidence of later having experienced the female appellant being on top of her, kissing her on the breast area, moving down towards her vagina and ultimately kissing, licking and sucking her vagina. Count 4:17  The complainant V gave evidence of having been in the appellants’ bedroom with their children when they came and carried the children out and put them to bed. One or other of the appellants had told her she could stay in the bedroom. The complainant V said that she had fallen asleep and when she awakened she found that the female appellant was on her left side and the male appellant on her right side in the double bed. The male appellant started to touch the complainant V on her vagina. She moved and he desisted. He then touched her again and started to put his finger inside her vagina. She moved once more and he then stopped, but then put his finger deeper into her vagina. She was eventually able to get away and return to her own room. Count 5:18  The complainant V gave evidence that after April, 1989 when she was bathing with the appellants’ children, the male appellant came in and got into the bath with her, washed her back, then her breast area, then rubbed and washed her vagina. Count 6:19  The complainant D was born on 26 December, 1976. She gave evidence of collecting cans with her sister V, and taking them to the scrap-metal yard where the male appellant worked. She gave evidence of the violent relationship between her parents and of the relief she felt when going to the appellants’ home.20  She gave evidence that at about Easter time in the evening of a particular day, the male appellant had asked her if she wanted a massage to which she replied “Yes”. He told her that it would be more comfortable in his bed. Both appellants and the complainant D went into the bedroom and got into bed. The male appellant massaged the complainant D’s back and she fell asleep.21  When she awoke she found her underpants were down and he was rubbing his fingers on and inside her vagina. The complainant D said that when he put his fingers in her vagina, it hurt her, he had scratched her and she was scared and nervous. D gave evidence that the female appellant at this time was also in the bed next to her and was watching television. The complainant D said that she tossed and turned to show that she was waking up and that the male appellant quickly pulled her pants on and put the blanket over her. Count 7:22  The complainant D gave evidence that at about the end of 1989 when she was staying at the appellants’ home for a few days, she was in bed in the appellants’ bedroom with their children when the young children fell asleep. They were taken to their bedroom by their mother and put to bed.23  The appellants and the complainant D were then watching a movie whilst in the appellants’ double bed. She was asked by the male appellant if she had ever seen anyone having sex to which she responded “No”. He said “Do you want us to show you?” to which she replied “No”, to which he had responded “Well we’ll show you anyway”. The appellants engaged in sexual intercourse in the bed beside the complainant D and the male appellant said to the complainant D “Look do you want to join us?” to which she responded that she wasn’t interested at all. She said she was, scared, nervous and didn’t know what to do.24  The complainants’ mother gave evidence of having been in the appellants’ home on one occasion when she saw the male appellant go into the bathroom where the complainants were having a bath. She asked him what he was doing there and received the reply “I always wash the backs of the girls”.25  The complainants’ father gave evidence that the complainants had gone to the home of the appellants with his consent, it being the Crown case that the complainants were under the authority of the appellants.26  In separate records of interview conducted by investigating police, the appellants denied they had sexually assaulted the complainants. The appellants’ case:27  Both appellants gave evidence and were cross-examined. They denied the allegations that they had sexually assaulted the complainants or engaged in acts of indecency towards them.28  Evidence was given on behalf of the female appellant that she was a person of good character. This witness had known her for some six years and had never observed any activity of a sexual nature towards children. The female appellant carried out day care for children in addition to her own two children.29  It was the appellants’ case that both complainants had concocted stories against the appellants.30  It was contended that the delay between the period when the offences were allegedly committed and when the investigating police first spoke to the appellants, i.e. some six years later, was so great as to gravely prejudice them.31  It is convenient to deal first with the following grounds of appeal: R -v- Ronald Douglas Gillard:32 Ground 1 - His Honour erred in failing to adequately direct the jury about the significance of delay in complaint.33 Ground 5 - His Honour erred in law in admitting into evidence the complaints on each case. R -v- Colleen Therese Gillard:34 Ground 4 - His Honour erred in law in failing to direct and/or directing the jury as to complaint in particular as to consistency and delay and lack of complaint in some instances.35 Ground 7 - His Honour erred in law in admitting into evidence the evidence of complaints on each case.36  The evidence of complaint by V was comprised of a conversation with her mother about the end of 1990 when she and her sister D, together with their mother, were living at Caringbah. They had moved to this location following the separation of their parents and this conversation took place some six months after the parents had separated. She told her mother that the male appellant “had touched her”.37  D said that in 1992 when on holiday in France she recounted to V what had happened to her in the appellants’ house and had later also told her mother. She said that V had been supportive of her when she recounted her experiences and “just agreed sort of thing” with what she was saying about digital penetration by the male appellant and sexual intercourse by the appellants in front of her, but she could not recall V saying that similar things had happened to her.38  V gave evidence that in 1992 during the holiday in France, at the time when she had the conversation with D, she had said that the male appellant “had touched her”.39  The complainants' mother, gave evidence of having been told by V and D of digital penetration by the male appellant and of sexual intercourse by the appellants occurring in their presence. 40  There was no evidence of complaint in relation to the second count.41  Mr Papayanni, counsel for the female appellant, whose submissions on these grounds were adopted by Ms Burgess, counsel for the male appellant, submitted that the evidence of complaint was inconsistent and more particularly was admitted contrary to the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act).42  Section 66 of the Act relevantly provides:- “(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact. (2) If that person has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by: (a) that person, or (b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if (1) the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation”43  The representations in the nature of complaints, having been made firstly at the end of 1990, some twelve months after the alleged events, and in 1992, it is submitted that the requirement that the asserted fact be fresh in the memory of the maker of either of the complaints has not been met.44  Reliance is placed on the decision of the High Court in Graham -v- The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 1491. In that case the complainant, who was the appellant’s daughter, complained to her friend of sexual offences against her which had occurred at least six years previously.45  The view expressed in this Court (from which court the appeal was brought) of the notion of “freshness” was in the context of s 66 not being “… anchored to nor determined by simple notions of the lapse of time” but is concerned with “the quality of the memory”, did not find favour.46  In the judgment of Callinan J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed at paragraph 34, his Honour said:- “… Whilst it cannot be doubted that the quality of vividness of a recollection will generally be relevant in an assessment of its freshness, its contemporaneity or near contemporaneity, or otherwise will almost always be the most important consideration in any assessment of its freshness. The Court of Criminal Appeal took the view that the section laid emphasis on the “quality” of the memory and in consequence, the regard that should have been paid to the delay in making the complaint was not paid. There may be cases in which evidence of an event relatively remote in time will be admissible pursuant to s 66, but such cases will necessary be rare and requiring of some special circumstance or feature.”47  In a joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at para 4 appears the following:- “The word ”fresh”, in its context in s 66, means “recent” or “immediate”. It may also carry with it a connotation that describes the quality of the memory (as being “not deteriorated or changed by lapse of time”) but the core of the meaning intended, is to describe the temporal relationship between “the occurrence of the asserted fact” and the time of making the representation. Although questions of fact and degree may arise, the temporal relationship required will very likely be measured in hours or days, not, as was the case here, in years. There are several reasons for adopting this construction. First the section applies only where the person who made the representation has been, or is to be, called to give evidence. To permit leading of evidence of out of court statements made by that person based upon some assessment of the vividness or quality of the recollection (as opposed to its being made very soon after the events) would be to distract attention from the quality of the evidence that the witness gives in court. Secondly, whatever a person may believe, and no matter how earnestly that person may try to be accurate, experience demonstrates that the memory of events does change as time passes. Thirdly, the exception created by s 66 should be limited in its application to those cases where the tender of the earlier statement is likely to add to the useful material before the court.”48  In our opinion the evidence of these ""complaints"", such as they were, were not admissible under s 66 as an exception to the hearsay rule because they did not have the necessary element of ""freshness"" in the sense of being ""recent"" or ""intermediate"" as is necessary in the light of the majority judgment in Graham. The lapse of time to the first ""complaint"" by V was to be measured at least in months, and the later ""complaints"" in France, in terms of years. None of the evidence of complaint was to be measured in terms of hours or days. It follows that the evidence being hearsay was not admissible: s 59(1) and did not come within any of the exceptions to that rule, in particular it did not come within the exception provided by s 66(2).49  Alternatively, it was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the evidence of complaint was admissible under Part 3.7 of the Act as credibility evidence.50  Section 102 provides that evidence relevant only to a witness' credibility is not admissible, but the following sections in that Part provide a number of exceptions. Section 108(1) provides that the credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness and no leave is required; but in the present case the evidence was adduced in examination in chief.51  Furthermore s 108(3)(b) makes admissible evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if it is or will be suggested (expressly or by implication) that the evidence of the witness has been fabricated (deliberately or otherwise) provided the leave of the court is obtained. In the present case the whole basis of the defence, that the events alleged had not occurred, constituted a suggestion that the evidence of the complainants was fabricated; and so it would have been open to the Crown to seek leave to adduce evidence of the ""complaints"" as evidence relevant to the complainants' credibility, but such leave was never sought nor given, and in its absence the evidence was not admissible.52  A similar situation (i.e. no application for leave under s 108(3)) arose in Graham where the High Court held that it was by no means inevitable that leave to adduce such evidence would have been given, that would have been a matter for the trial judge when leave was sought taking into account a number of factors referred to in that case. Similar considerations apply here.53  However, no objection was taken at the trial to the admissibility of the ""complaint"" evidence, and accordingly the appellants may not rely upon this ground without the leave of this Court: Rule 4.54  The effect and application of that rule has been discussed in a number of cases including recently in R -v- PAH (CCA - 18 December 1998). Generally speaking this Court will only grant leave under Rule 4 if it is satisfied that the wrongful admission of evidence or erroneous direction, in either case not objected to at the trial, has led to a miscarriage of justice; and in particular an appeal will not be allowed on the ground of wrongful admission of evidence which was not objected to at trial if it appears that the failure to object may have been deliberate and intended to obtain a tactical advantage.55  In the present case there are features which may have led counsel not to object to the evidence of complaint so as to show up discrepancies between the evidence led at trial and the contents of the so called complaints. When V spoke to her mother late in 1990, she told her that the male appellant had ""touched her"", but apparently made no mention of digital penetration (counts 1 and 4) nor of both appellants having sexual intercourse in her presence (count 3) nor of any cunnilingus by the female appellant (count 2). The conversation between the two complainants in France two years later made no reference to the cunnilingus alleged in count 2. It would have been open to counsel to draw attention to the differences between what was said on those occasions and in evidence at the trial, as apparently counsel did to some extent (see summary of his arguments to the Jury in the Summing Up at pp 30, 31, 32, 34), and they also relied on the lateness of the complaints.56  However there is, we believe, a more fundamental problem in this case in that the whole trial appears to have been conducted as if the Evidence Act 1995 had never been enacted. At no stage, either in relation to the admissibility of the evidence of complaint or on any other issue, was any reference made to the Act. The Act commenced on 1 September 1995, the trial was from 28 April to 6 May 1997 and the judgment in Graham was delivered on 30 September 1998. 57  We do not suggest that in any case where an objection to admissibility based on a provision of the Act could have been but was not taken, leave will be granted under Rule 4, nor that such will generally be the result; but in the present case where we are satisfied that the Act was completely ignored and where the High Court has, since the trial, thrown light on the relevant statutory provisions, we consider that leave to argue the point should be granted; and for the reasons given are of the opinion that the evidence of complaint in this case was wrongly admitted, and the convictions should be set aside.58  We turn now to consider the other grounds of appeal relating to the evidence of complaint, namely that the directions in relation thereto were inadequate.59  His Honour referred to the delay in making the complaint, and pointed out (as required by Crimes Act 1900, s 405B(2)) that absence of or delay in complaint does not necessarily indicate that the allegation of the offences is false and that there may be good reason why the victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in or refrain from making a complaint; but he did not balance the direction by pointing out that in evaluating the evidence of the complainants and in determining whether to believe them the Jury could take into account their failure to complain at the earliest reasonable opportunity as reducing their credibility: R -v- Harvey (CCA - 9 April 1998) see also Longman -v- The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 91, Crofts -v- The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427. Moreover his Honour failed to warn the jury that the allegations were first drawn to the attention of the police in 1995-6, which was when the appellants were first notified of them. That was some five to six years after the offences were alleged to have been committed and such delay may have made it more difficult for the appellants to prepare their defences, a matter which was aggravated by the demolition of the house thus making it more difficult to establish whether a person in the bath would have been visible from the kitchen, a reference to the mother's evidence relating to count 5. These matters should all have been brought to the jury's attention, not merely by way of summarising counsel's arguments but as part of the directions of law on how the jury should deal with the evidence of delay in complaints: Longman, supra, R -v- BL Johnston (CCA - unreported - 31 July 1998), R -v- K (CCA - unreported - 8 October 1997).60  Each of the appellants also appeal on the ground that the verdicts against them are unsafe and unsatisfactory (Ronald Douglas Gillard ground 4, Colleen Therese Gillard ground 2), and our attention has been drawn to what it is claimed were a number of discrepancies in the evidence of V compared with her statements to police and a couple of other features including what was said to be the similarities between the evidence of V relating to the third count and that of D in relation to the seventh count, and it was suggested this indicated that the two complainants may have jointly concocted the allegations. In our view the discrepancies referred to related to peripheral matters and were essentially matters of credibility for the Jury. The case involved a credit clash between the Crown witnesses on the one hand and the appellants on the other. There were no contradictions or inconsistencies relating to the essential ingredients of any of the charges and bearing in mind the advantages enjoyed by the Jury in seeing the witnesses and the principles laid down in M -v- The Queen 181 CLR 487 we are satisfied that it was open to the Jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of each of the accused. It follows that it is not appropriate to direct verdicts of acquittal and the consequence will be orders for a new trial. It will be up to the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether, in the light of the health of the male appellant and the sentence imposed on the female appellant it is appropriate to proceed further.61  It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal, but as the issue will arise if there is a new trial, and we have reached a firm conclusion in relation to it, we are satisfied we should deal with the question of whether consensual sexual intercourse between husband and wife in the circumstances alleged by the Crown in counts 3 and 7 constituted ""acts of indecency"" towards the young person contrary to s 61E(2A) Crimes Act 1900, see now s 61N.62  Obviously consensual sexual intercourse between husband and wife is not of itself in any way indecent and so, because it is not indecent, if it takes place in the presence of a young person, the intercourse of itself is not an act of indecency in the presence of the young person.63  But what was alleged here was not merely consensual intercourse between husband and wife, it was allegedly accompanied by an invitation to, and encouragement of, the young person to watch and in respect of count 7, to join in. The intercourse, although not an indecent act in itself, became indecent when carried out in front of the young person, with the invitation and encouragement to watch which were both directed to or in the direction of the young person.64  We were referred to Saraswati -v- The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 1, but that was a case alleging acts of indecency ""with"" a young person, contrary to the then s 61E(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, and was concerned with the question whether acts which constituted indecent assaults (contrary to s 61E(1)) and/or carnal knowledge (contrary to the then s 71) could be charged as ""acts of indecency with"" the complainant so as to avoid the requirements of the then s 78 that in the relevant circumstances prosecutions under s 61E(1) or s 71 had to be commenced within twelve months. The case throws no light on what constitutes an ""act of indecency towards"" a complainant.65  In R -v- Francis (1988) 88 Cr App R 127 it was held that a man who masturbated in the presence of children, knowing they were watching and deriving added stimulation from the fact that they were watching could be said to be committing an act of gross indecency towards them, contrary to s 1(1) of the Indecency With Children Act 1990 (UK). In our view similar considerations apply when a couple (even a married couple) engage in sexual intercourse not only in the presence of a young person but when they also invite and encourage the young person to watch.66  In view of our conclusion in respect of his conviction appeal it is inappropriate to deal with an application for leave to appeal against his sentence by the male appellant.67  The order of the Court in each appeal will therefore be: Appeal allowed; Conviction and sentence quashed; New trial ordered. **********

   THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONKIRBY JMonday 8 March 1999070092/96 - REGINA v Anthony Stuart MOFFATTJUDGMENT re application for a verdict by direction - see transcript page 197.1 HIS HONOUR: This matter has proceeded before me as a Judge sitting alone. The Crown has presented its case, subject to the resolution of one issue. It sought to tender an interview with the accused which is recorded on video, and in respect of which there is a transcript of the ERISP tape, MFI 4. The argument and ruling on the admissibility of that interview has been postponed. The accused, through Counsel, has foreshadowed a challenge to its tender on the basis that it was not voluntary. Instead of dealing with that issue on the voir dire, it was thought sensible that it be postponed until after certain medical evidence was given, in the accused's case.2 I mention this background because it has some relevance to an application by the accused at the end of the Crown case for a verdict by direction. In dealing with that application I must, for the moment, assume that the interview is included in the Crown case and is available as material which may be considered in determining the present application.3 I indicated at the close of argument that I would dismiss the application and later provide brief reasons.4 The submission is directed to the first count, that is the count of murder. The issue is one of causation. The submission was that there was no evidence upon which the Crown could establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that the actions of the accused caused the death of the deceased, Mr Richard James Fyfe.5 For the purposes of determining this issue, I must take the Crown case at its highest. The question of causation has been described as one to be determined by the application of commonsense to the facts, rather than approaching the issue as a philosophical or scientific question. The essential question, in the context of this case, is whether there is evidence capable of satisfying a jury, beyond reasonable doubt, that the actions of the accused accelerated the death of Mr Fyfe.6  A number of matters, at least on a prima facie level, appear to be clear.· First, Mr Fyfe, who was 43 years of age at the time of his death, suffered from severe coronary arteriosclerosis, which included 75 percent stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. This was a condition which may give rise to a spontaneous heart attack which could be fatal. It was also a condition which was capable of being aggravated, were Mr Fyfe subjected to trauma.· Secondly, Mr Fyfe, the deceased, was, before his death, in an advanced state of intoxication. His blood alcohol level at the time of death was estimated to be 0.48 g/100 ml. He was approaching a level where death from the effects of acute ethanol intoxication may occur.7 The case against the accused substantially depends upon admissions said to have been made by him, either to neighbours or to the police. I need not refer to all the evidence. In the ERISP interview, the accused described an incident which had the following features.· First, immediately before the incident, he described the deceased, in terms of his health, as ""fine"" (Q 179). He had not complained of ""being crook or anything"".· Secondly, he described a conversation in which the deceased called him a “mutt”, and this in the context of having previously called him a “dog”, and having been warned not to repeat the insult.· Thirdly, the accused, according to the interview, then began striking the deceased on the chest, a number of blows with the flat part of a claw hammer. He described these blows as being ""not soft"" (Q 161). · Fourthly, he described what happened thereafter in these words, and I quote from MFI 4: (page 12) ""Q91 After you hit, after you hit him …? A … I threw the hammer away and then I choked him to death. Q92 O.K. How long did you hold him around the throat for? A Wouldn't have been any more than a minute and a half, two minutes. Then I … you know, where my hands were around him, my fingers were down there like that, and my hands were around him, I just went, I just went crack and that was it, he was dead. Q93 How do you know …? A Nothing much I could do after that. Q94 How did you know he was dead? A His eyes rolled back in his head and his tongue turned blue. And he wasn't breathing. Q95 Was that … A Couldn't feel no pulse in his neck.""8 Elsewhere, in the course of the interview, the following answers were provided: (page 13) ""Q100 All right. A His tongue was goin’ blue while I was strangling him. Q101 All right. A. The only thing was he couldn't push me away. Q102 He couldn't push you away? He … A No, no, when I'm coming in on top of somebody, I'm not easy, I'm not an easy thing to push away. Q103 So he was trying to push you off him? A He was trying to, but it didn't work.""9 Dr Christopher Lawrence performed the autopsy. He provided a report. The report, exhibit A, included the following description of the cause of death: “The combined effects of compression of the neck, blunt force, chest injury and acute ethanol intoxication.”10 Dr Lawrence also identified a “significant condition contributing to the death, but not relating to the disease or conditions causing it”, namely, “arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease”.11 Dr Lawrence gave evidence. He acknowledged that his findings on post mortem were consistent with a number of possible causes of death, including death from a spontaneous heart attack. Counsel for the accused submitted that the Crown had not, in these circumstances, excluded two possible causes of death, namely, death through a spontaneous heart attack,, and death through the action of a lethal dose of ethanol. However, on the basis of Dr Lawrence's evidence read as a whole and, in particular, his evidence in re-examination, I believe there is evidence that the actions of the accused were the substantial or significant, or the operating cause, of the death of the deceased (Royall v R [1990] 172 CLR 378).12 There is evidence upon which a jury could form the view that the Crown has excluded causes which are unrelated to the accused (cf Puckeridge v R  (CCA, unreported, 2 November 1998)).13 As I said on Friday, therefore, I dismiss the application. The application can, of course, be renewed once the admissibility of the ERISP interview has been determined.

     REGINA v GREGORY GLENN GREENHAM 
      
      
    JUDGMENT1 SHELLER JA: I agree with Hidden J.2 DOWD J: I have seen and agree with the reasons and proposed orders in the draft judgment of Hidden J.3 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Gregory Glenn Greenham, has appealed against his conviction of three counts of aggravated indecent assault after a trial at the Newcastle District Court. He was sentenced effectively to penal servitude for three years, comprising a minimum term of one year and an additional term of two years. An application for leave to appeal against his sentence was not pursued at the hearing. The Evidence4 The appellant was alleged to have interfered sexually with a girl over a period which began when she was thirteen years old and ended around the time of her fourteenth birthday. She lived at an address in Edgeworth with her parents and her older sister, Leanne. In the house next door lived Ms Laurelle Rankmore and her two children, Erin and Kieran, both of whom are considerably younger than the complainant. The complainant frequently visited Ms Rankmore’s home. Ms Rankmore’s sister, Tammy Rankmore, was in a relationship with the appellant, and they also visited the home fairly regularly.5 The first two counts arose from an incident said to have occurred early in 1994, not long after the complainant’s thirteenth birthday. She was in Laurelle Rankmore’s bedroom, sitting on the bed, watching Erin and Kieran playing a Sega game. Her evidence was that the appellant came into the room, sat on the bed next to her, and squeezed her in the area of her breasts outside her clothing. (She was not then developed in that area.) She pushed him away and told him to stop. He then rubbed her legs and her genital area, also outside her clothing. Again, she pushed his hand away and said, “No.” He left the room. She was scared, and feared telling her parents what had happened because she thought that she would get into trouble.6 The third count arose from an incident said to have occurred in early 1995, about a year later. On this occasion also, the complainant was in Laurelle Rankmore’s bedroom, and Erin and Kieran were playing the Sega game. Also in the bedroom were two school friends of the complainant, Tina Nicholas and Danny Evans. Fairly detailed evidence was given about what is then alleged to have ensued, but it is sufficient to summarise it briefly. According to the complainant, she was sitting on the bed when the appellant entered the room. He sat on the floor next to the bed, placed his hand under her T-shirt and squeezed her breasts. From her description of their position in the room, it is unlikely that Tina Nicholas or Danny Evans would have seen this. Indeed, she said that Tina Nicholas turned to look in their direction but the appellant quickly removed his hand, so that she could not see what he was doing. 7 Danny Evans gave evidence. He did not see the appellant do anything to the complainant. Tina Nicholas gave evidence of sexual contact between the appellant and the complainant but her account was significantly at variance with that of the complainant. According to her, the appellant put his hand up the complainant’s skirt while she was standing, looking out the window. She pushed his hand away and said, “Don’t.” She then lay on her stomach on the bed and the appellant sat on the bed next to her. Again, he put his hand under her skirt and she pushed it away. In cross-examination, she was not entirely sure that she had seen the appellant put his hand up the complainant’s skirt on the first occasion, but she said that the complainant later told her that he had done so. 8 The complainant said that, immediately after this incident, she asked Tina Nicholas to accompany her outside. There she told Miss Nicholas what the appellant had been doing to her and, according to her, this was the first occasion on which she had complained to anyone about his behaviour. I shall return to the evidence of complaint in a moment.9 The incident the subject of the third count was the last episode of sexual impropriety alleged. However, evidence was admitted of sexual contact other than that charged in the indictment. The complainant described an occasion at the Rankmore home, a couple of days before the incident giving rise to the first and second counts, where the appellant told her she was “beautiful”, led her to the side of the house, put his arms around her and tried to kiss her on the mouth. She spoke of yet another occasion in Laurelle Rankmore’s bedroom when the appellant came in and exposed his penis to her. She said that frequently he would touch her on the breasts or the genital area and would try to kiss her.10 I have referred to the complainant’s evidence that she told Tina Nicholas about the appellant’s behaviour immediately after the incident giving rise to the third count. According to her, she said that he “grabbed me on the boobs, down between my legs, and kissing me and that”. She said that she had not told anyone before then because she was scared to. Several days later she also complained to Danny Evans, in the presence of two friends of his identified only as Ben and Luke, while walking home from school. Danny Evans had her tell her father, whereupon the matter was promptly reported to police.11 Broadly speaking, the complainant’s evidence on this aspect was supported by the evidence of Danny Evans. However, again, her account was markedly different from that of Tina Nicholas. Miss Nicholas confirmed that the complainant spoke to her about the appellant’s sexual impropriety immediately after the incident giving rise to the third count. According to her, however, the complainant had complained to her on an earlier occasion, when they were walking through bushland on their way home from a friend’s house. The complainant had said that the appellant was “always touching me on the boobs, on the moot (meaning her vagina) and on the arse and that”.12 It was on 3 April 1995 that the matter was reported to police. The complainant was accompanied by her father to Cardiff police station, where Sergeant Gareth Robinson spoke to her and, later on the same day, to Tina Nicholas. The course of the investigation thereafter, I trust, is rare and will never be repeated. 13 Sergeant Robinson referred the matter promptly to Detective Senior Constable Christine Robertson of the Child Mistreatment Unit at Wallsend. Detective Robertson obtained a statement from the complainant on 9 April 1995 and from Tina Nicholas on 17 May 1995. It seems that little or nothing was then done for the best part of two years. The appellant was not approached about the matter until 31 January 1997. Statements from at least two witnesses, Danny Evans and the complainant’s father, were not obtained until later in that year. Danny Evans had then lost touch with his friends, Ben and Luke, as had the complainant, and it is perhaps not surprising that they were unable to be located and were not available to give evidence at the trial. Detective Robertson conceded in evidence that she had not made “a great deal of effort” to find them. She also claimed, somewhat half-heartedly, to have had some difficulty locating the appellant, but she relied primarily upon pressure of other work to explain the delay in pursuing the matter.14 To what extent Detective Robertson ought be blamed for this tardy investigation is not a matter which this Court could, or should, determine. No doubt, resources are limited and officers in the field have heavy work-loads, particularly in this area of the criminal law. Nevertheless, such delay as occurred here is unacceptable. It is obviously in the interests of justice, from the point of view of the complainant, the suspect and the community, that allegations of this kind be investigated as expeditiously as possible. However, the problems with this investigation do not end there.15 I have referred earlier to the terms of the complaint to Tina Nicholas as Miss Nicholas recounted it, with the reference to the appellant touching the complainant “on the boobs, on the moot and on the arse…” This was also how she had recounted it in her statement to police of 17 May 1995. As already observed, these were not the terms which the complainant herself used when giving evidence of her complaint. Nor had she when recounting the complaint in her police statement of 9 April 1995.16 At the request of a solicitor from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Detective Robertson took a further statement from the complainant on 26 August 1997, not long before the trial. She asked her again to recount her complaint to Tina Nicholas but the complainant said that, while she could remember that there was a conversation, she did not recall the terms of it. Detective Robertson said in evidence that the complainant appeared to be nervous, embarrassed and reluctant to talk about the matter. Apparently for this reason, the Detective read to the complainant the relevant part of the statement of Tina Nicholas. The complainant agreed with Miss Nicholas’ account of what had been said, and the Detective transposed the words from Miss Nicholas’ statement into the further statement of the complainant. The complainant then read that statement and signed it.17 The impropriety of such an approach hardly needs to be stated. In evidence, Detective Robertson conceded that it was probably not “the most prudent course to have taken”, although she added that it was “the only course I had”. However, in answer to a question from the trial judge, she agreed that she had been “in effect putting words” into the complainant’s mouth. When the complainant was cross-examined about this matter, she denied that Detective Robertson had read Miss Nicholas’ statement to her and disclaimed any knowledge of its contents. 18 The appellant gave evidence, denying all of the complainant’s allegations. However, he recounted an incident at his brother’s twenty-first birthday party, which was held at Laurelle Rankmore’s home at the end of 1993. He was having his photo taken with the complainant’s sister, Leanne. The complainant was “being a pest”, rubbing her chest against him, and in irritation he “tweaked her on the breast”. There is no evidence directly corroborative of this incident. Tammy Rankmore gave evidence that the complainant was at the party, and that the appellant had told her about the incident after he had been charged with the present offences. On the other hand, the complainant denied having been at the party, and this was supported by the evidence of her mother, her father and Laurelle Rankmore. Leanne herself agreed that her photo had been taken with the appellant, but she also said that the complainant was not there.  The Appeal19 Counsel for the appellant, who did not appear at the trial, argued a number of grounds of appeal which were said, individually or in combination, to demonstrate that the trial had miscarried and that the convictions should be set aside. In addition, it was submitted that the verdicts are unsafe in the sense that they are unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence: s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; Fleming v The Queen (1998) 158 ALR 379 at 382-3 (paras 7-11).20 The latter submission can be dealt with briefly. The problems inherent in the Crown case are obvious from my brief summary of the evidence. Nevertheless, typically of cases such as this, the jury’s decision was no doubt based upon their assessment of the witnesses, particularly the complainant. Appellate courts are slow to set aside a jury’s verdict as unreasonable, not only out of respect for the jury’s function as the trier of fact, but also in recognition of the advantage the members of the jury enjoy from seeing and hearing the witnesses: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-3. Although there were a number of respects in which the complainant’s credibility was subject to challenge, it was open to the jury, acting reasonably, to accept the substance of her account. Equally, where the evidence of the complainant and Miss Nicholas was in conflict, it was open to the jury to accept the evidence of the complainant and to reject that of Miss Nicholas. While the appellant consistently maintained his innocence, his own evidence was not free from difficulty.21 That said, I am satisfied that the conviction on each count should be set aside and verdict and judgment of acquittal entered: s6(2) of the Act. In my view, a number of errors in the conduct of the trial have led to a miscarriage of justice. In arriving at that conclusion I have not found it necessary to consider all the grounds of appeal, some of which have more substance than others. Further, for discretionary reasons to which I shall turn later, I have concluded that it would be inappropriate for this Court to order a new trial. Evidence of other sexual conduct (Ground 2)22 I have referred to the fact that the complainant gave evidence of sexual impropriety other than that charged: touching her on the breasts or genital area, trying to kiss her and, on one occasion, exposing his penis. It was submitted that this evidence was inadmissible and that, in any event, the trial judge’s directions about it were inadequate.23 It is well established that evidence of this kind may be admissible to place the acts charged in their context and to demonstrate a guilty passion on the part of the accused for the complainant. If the evidence is led for that second purpose, to show guilty passion, it is tendency evidence which must meet the tests set out in s97(1) and s101(2) of the Evidence Act 1995: R v A.H. (1997) 42 NSWLR 702, per Ireland J at 708-9. Whether the evidence is admissible may involve consideration of the restrictions imposed by s409B(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 and the balancing exercise required by s137 of the Evidence Act. If the evidence is admitted, the circumstances may require that its use be limited under s136 of the Evidence Act: R v Fraser (CCA unreported, 10 August 1998) at p18ff.24 It follows that careful consideration should always be given to whether evidence of this kind is admissible and, if so, upon what basis. Its prejudicial effect is obvious, particularly in a trial by jury, arising from “the circumstance that the ordinary person may well think that someone with an established tendency, desire or passion to behave in a particular way, whenever a suitable opportunity arises, will yield to that personality characteristic or emotion and so behave in the circumstance of the particular case…”: Fraser at p26.25 Here, the complainant gave the evidence without objection. There does not appear to have been any discussion at that stage about the purpose for which it was led. However, in summing up his Honour left it to the jury as evidence of the context in which the offences occurred and of guilty passion on the part of the appellant. What his Honour said was this:  …that activity, if you accept that it occurred, and of course that’s the crucial issue in this case, whether you accept her evidence or not, the Crown says that that activity is evidence of a guilty passion. It’s not the subject of any charge. But it’s evidence of a relationship, a guilty passion, on the part of the accused towards the complainant and it’s also led on the basis, of course, that the Crown says, well if you just had these two incidents in 1994 and then another incident in 1995, it wouldn’t be the true context of what happened and you’re entitled to also take into account that there was this conduct going on in determining whether you accept the evidence of the complainant or not.26 After referring specifically to the evidence that the appellant exposed his penis to the complainant, his Honour continued: Well, of course, members of the jury, that again is not the subject of any charge, but the Crown is entitled to lead that evidence and it’s a matter for you as to whether you accept it or not as being helpful in your determination of the facts in this case.27 The argument that the evidence was inadmissible confronts the difficulty that it was not objected to at the trial. On the face of it, it would appear to be admissible on both the bases upon which it was left to the jury. However, we cannot know what the fate of an objection might have been as there may have been material in support of it of which we are unaware. It is the inadequacy of his Honour’s directions about the evidence which has persuaded me that this ground should succeed. 28 In Fraser (at p28) the Court referred to a passage from the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510, in which his Honour emphasised the need for a trial judge to ensure that evidence of this kind is not used improperly by the jury (at 516):  …an explanation should invariably be given to the jury as soon as the first of that evidence is given and, if necessary, again in the summing-up as to the purpose for which the evidence is admitted, together with a warning to the jury that they must not either substitute evidence of such other sexual activity for the specific activity which is the subject of the offence charged or reason that, because the accused may have done something wrong with the complainant on some other occasion or occasions, he must also have done so on the occasion which is the subject of the offence charged.29 In my view, his Honour’s directions in this case were insufficient to guard against the jury’s use of the evidence for the impermissible purposes referred to by Hunt CJ at CL in that passage. It is not enough merely to tell the jury that the conduct alleged is not the subject of any charge, and is led as evidence of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant and of his sexual pre-occupation with her. It must be emphasised that the evidence is no substitute for proof to the requisite degree of the elements of each of the offences charged. With respect, one could not go past the passage from the summing up of Wood J (as his Honour then was) quoted at pp3-5 of the judgment of Gleeson CJ in R v Wickham (CCA unreported, 17 December 1991). For present purposes, it is sufficient to set out the last paragraph of that passage:  However, I emphasise to you again that you must not substitute evidence of other acts for the specific acts charged and you must not reason on the basis: well, this accused may have done some wrong things on other occasions relating to this girl and therefore, we will convict him on these two particular acts. The Crown must prove those particular acts beyond reasonable doubt. You have the wider history merely to place her evidence into context and, if you think it appropriate, to show the existence of a strong and guilty passion for her by the accused.30 No redirection was sought by counsel for the appellant at the trial. Nevertheless, the matter is of such significance that leave to argue it ought to be granted. In so far as it relates to his Honour’s directions, this ground is made out.  Warning about complainant’s evidence (Grounds 6 & 9)31 At the trial counsel for the appellant asked his Honour to warn the jury that the evidence of the complainant might be unreliable, given her age: Evidence Act, s165(1)(d) and (2). His Honour declined, without giving reasons.32  A trial judge need not give a warning, despite a party’s request for one, if he or she considers that “there are good reasons for not doing so”: subs165(3). That subsection does not expressly require those reasons to be stated, but in most cases the judge should do so: R v Beattie (1996) 40 NSWLR 155, per James J at 160; R v Stanton (CCA unreported, 24 July 1998) per Mason P at p5. There were a number of reasons why a warning was appropriate. While not of tender years, the complainant was quite young at relevant times: thirteen and fourteen at the time of the events complained of and sixteen when she gave evidence. She made no complaint about the appellant’s behaviour until about a year after it was said to have first commenced. Her evidence conflicted with that of Miss Nicholas in significant respects. Her willingness to sign a further statement in the circumstances described above, when part of the statement of Miss Nicholas was incorporated in it, reflects poorly on her credibility, as does the conflict between her evidence and that of Detective Robertson about that matter.33 The nearest his Honour got to a warning during the summing up was a direction about corroboration. It will be remembered that Tina Nicholas gave evidence about the occasion in Laurelle Rankmore’s bedroom giving rise to the third count, but her version of what occurred was markedly different from that of the complainant. Having defined corroboration as evidence “from an independent source”, his Honour went on: If you accepted Tina Nicholas’ evidence that she did see the accused put his hand up the dress of the complainant…, then that… would be capable of being used by you as corroboration of the fact that they were in the bedroom and that basically something happened.34 However, his Honour went on to say that the evidence was not corroborative of the third count and that, accordingly, all three counts were uncorroborated. He told the jury that it was open to them to convict on the complainant’s uncorroborated evidence, but added:  …but you should scrutinise her evidence carefully, because there is no independent evidence, as it were, of those three acts, before you do so.35 It is difficult to determine what the jury might have made of these directions. On the face of it, his Honour appears to have told the jury that Miss Nicholas’ evidence was in some way corroborative of the third count, then later told them that it was not. From a submission made by the Crown prosecutor immediately before the summing up, it seems that his Honour was seeking to convey that the evidence could not corroborate the complainant’s evidence about the third count, but might be used in support of the evidence of the appellant’s sexual desire for the complainant generally. Whether this is how the jury would have understood the direction is quite another matter. However that may be, I cannot accept that evidence about a specific incident which is in significant conflict with the complainant’s evidence about the same incident could be used as corroboration, not of the occurrence of that incident, but of the appellant’s guilty passion for the complainant. 36 In the result, his Honour gave a direction about corroboration, although the law does not require it: s164(3) of the Evidence Act. He then referred to certain evidence as capable of amounting to corroboration, in some ill-defined way, when in fact it was not. On the other hand, the direction that the jury should scrutinise the complainant’s evidence carefully because of the absence of evidence corroborative of the three counts fell far short of an appropriate warning under s165(2). I am satisfied that such a warning should have been given for the reasons I have outlined above. That subsection requires a judge not only to warn the jury that evidence may be unreliable and that it should be assessed with care, but also to inform the jury of the matters which may cause it to be unreliable. This required reference not only to the lack of corroboration, but also to the complainant’s age, the delay in complaint and the evidence about her making the additional statement shortly before the trial.37 Again, no redirection was sought by counsel for the appellant at the trial, but the matters complained of are significant and leave to argue them should be granted. These grounds also are made out. Delay in complaint (Ground 10)38 The only direction his Honour gave the jury about complaint was by reference to the evidence of Tina Nicholas. He said that, if they accepted her evidence about the complaint, they would be entitled “to use that as evidence that these acts happened”, if they thought that “this is the sort of thing that would be likely to be said by a person who is truthful and who had been sexually assaulted”.39 On the evidence, the complaint about the appellant’s behaviour generally was made promptly after the incident giving rise to the third count but, of course, the first two counts were said to have occurred about a year earlier. His Honour made no reference to the delay in complaint in relation to those counts. Section 405B(2) of the Crimes Act required a direction that that delay did not necessarily mean that the complainant’s evidence was false, while fairness and balance called for a direction that it may reflect adversely upon her credit: Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427. On the one hand, her delay in complaining might have been explained by her age and her evidence that she feared the consequences of doing so. On the other hand, it might have borne upon her credibility which, for the reasons I have stated, was vulnerable in other respects. 40 Crofts has been applied in a number of decisions of this Court, including R v Johnston (CCA unreported, 31 July 1998), in which the issue of delay in complaint was considered at length by Spigelman CJ (at p10ff). The Chief Justice examined not only the effect of delay upon a complainant’s credibility, but also the prejudice which it may cause an accused in answering allegations which have not been brought to his attention in a timely fashion. That, also, is a matter of concern here. Quite apart from the time which elapsed before the complainant first told anyone about the appellant’s alleged behaviour, almost two more years passed before the police got around to confronting him with her allegations. His Honour did comment in the summing up about the delay in the investigation. Having referred to a submission by the Crown prosecutor that, unsatisfactory as that delay was, it did not impact upon the issues in the case, his Honour continued:  But the accused would say, look, he should have been told about these allegations when they were made, that is only commonsense and fairness. His ability to recall details would have been compromised perhaps by the delay involved in confronting him with these allegations and you should take that into account when you assess his evidence.41 In the circumstances of the case, I do not consider that that laconic direction, confined to tardiness on the part of the investigating police, was adequate to convey to the jury the prejudice suffered by the appellant from the delay as a whole. However, I am content to decide this ground on the basis of his Honour’s failure to direct the jury about the effect of delay on the complainant’s credit.42 Yet again, no redirection was sought. Nor had it been in Johnston (supra) and other decisions of this Court referred to by the Chief Justice in that case, in which appeals on a similar point were successful. Leave to argue the matter should be granted, and this ground also is made out. Other grounds43 Grounds of appeal directed to other aspects of the trial were argued, but I consider them to be of less substance and do not consider it necessary to determine them. There was a further ground relating to the directions on complaint, requiring a consideration of various sections of the Evidence Act against the background of the common law. Certainly, the direction quoted above would have conveyed to the jury that the evidence of complaint might be used as evidence of the matters complained of, rather than as material going only to the complainant’s credibility. That may well have been so as to the third count, because there was evidence of complaint made immediately after the incident giving rise to it: s66(1) of the Act. On the other hand, the evidence could not have been used in that way in respect of the first and second counts, as they were too remote in time: Graham v The Queen (1998) 157 ALR 404. However, submissions on this ground invited a consideration of the extent to which the Act has changed the common law and whether, under the Act, evidence of complaint could ever be used other than on the question of a complainant’s credibility. We were informed from the Bar table that this issue is the subject of an application to the High Court for special leave to appeal in another case, yet to be heard. That being so, it is neither necessary nor desirable that we decide it. Conclusion44 As I have said, the grounds of appeal which have succeeded require the convictions to be quashed. It would be open to this Court to order a new trial if we were satisfied that the resultant miscarriage of justice could be remedied more adequately by such an order “than by any other order which the court is empowered to make”: s8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In my view, this is not such a case. On its face, the Crown case is far from overwhelming. The appellant was admitted to bail pending the appeal, but not until he had served almost eleven months of the twelve month minimum term imposed upon him. Perhaps more importantly, the Crown should not be allowed another opportunity to prosecute charges which have been tainted by a dilatory and, in one respect, improper investigation.45 I would propose that the appeal be allowed and that, in respect of each count, the conviction be quashed and verdict and judgment of acquittal entered. **********

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
      
      
     1  
     GROVE J : This is an application for extension of time and leave to appeal against severity of sentence by Alan Robert Thomas who appeared for sentence before Flannery DCJ in the Sydney District Court on a number of occasions culminating in sentences being imposed on 1 June 1998. The extension of time should be granted and further comment on that is not necessary. The applicant is presently held in the Special Purpose prison at Long Bay for reasons which will be apparent from what appears hereunder.  
      
     2  
     The applicant is now aged 49 years and was formerly a detective sergeant of police. Setting to one side the crimes for which he is now in prison, there was evidence of commendable police service. He had no prior convictions. He was married and the father of two small daughters as well as an older son from a previous marriage. That son was in frequent contact with the applicant and his new family and stayed with them as a member of their unit on regular occasions. The applicant’s wife gave extensive evidence at the sentencing hearing. As a result of significant assistance which the applicant has given and is continuing to give to law enforcement authorities his wife and daughters were placed into protection although it appears that they withdrew from the scheme last year during the sentencing proceedings. 
      
     3  
     The applicant pleaded guilty to offences charged in four indictments and adhered to pleas of guilty previously given to a magistrate in respect of four further charges upon which he was committed for sentence pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act. In respect of the first three indictments offences scheduled on forms pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act were taken into account. The terms of the charges were more completely specified by Flannery DCJ in his remarks on sentence and it suffices for present purposes that I record short descriptions. The first indictment consisted of a single count of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and two offences of possessing and disposing respectively of unlicensed firearms were taken into account on the schedule; the second indictment contained three counts of perjury, and taken into account were two charges of perverting the course of justice; the third indictment contained a single count of attempting corruptly to receive commission, and taken into account on a schedule were 18 offences of unlawfully accessing the police computer system, two offences of attempting corruptly to receive a commission and four offences of corruptly receiving commission; the fourth indictment contained two counts of concealing a serious offence, in each case the offence related to a separate murder, and finally, the committals by a magistrate were for sentence on one count of perverting the course of justice and three counts of corruptly receiving commissions. 
      
     4  
     The applicant is not legally represented in this appeal but has placed submissions before the Court in writing. In the initial application filed with the Court the applicant indicated that the discount for assistance to authorities which he had received was 50% whereas he claimed other persons who had given similar sorts of assistance were more favourably treated. The applicant stated “this is the only matter I wish to raise in this appeal against the sentence imposed upon me”. The learned sentencing judge (as was necessary) imposed a series of sentences upon the applicant but he made orders that all sentences could be served concurrently so that the effective enveloping term amounted to a total sentence of eight years penal servitude which was divided into a minimum term of three years and an additional term of five years. It ought to have been specified that the applicant would become eligible for release on parole at the expiry of the three year minimum term; s 8 Sentencing Act. Since filing the original notice the applicant has received a copy of his Honour’s unpublished further remarks on sentence and has indicated a wish to challenge a fact found therein. That challenge should also be dealt with. The applicant was represented by counsel in the sentencing proceedings and by consent, and I gather, at the suggestion of counsel then appearing for the applicant, his Honour’s published remarks on sentence were supplemented by a confidential document prepared for this Court should, as in the event has happened, either the applicant or the Crown have sought to bring the sentences before it for review. The reason for this course was stated by his Honour to be his concern that disclosure “could be gravely detrimental” to the applicant in the sense that the detail of the assistance that he had given and was giving may place his life and the lives of his family in jeopardy from wrongdoers whose activity he had revealed and in respect of which he was prepared to give testimony in any prosecution. 
      
     5  
     The applicant referred to a statement in the confidential remarks when his Honour recorded that the applicant outlined to detectives who were interviewing him that he had agreed to provide an alibi for a man referred to as “X”, who had been charged with murder, for the sum of $100,000. “X” was tried for murder in the Supreme Court and found not guilty after false alibi evidence (in respect of the arrangements for which the applicant had participated) was given. He did not himself give evidence. The interview included these questions and responses: 
      
      “Q. How much money over the, the period of time you’ve known them, would you have gotten off “X”? 
      
       
        A. Oh, I included them all in, you know, all in one group because … 
        
        Q. How much would you have gotten off this group? 
        
        A. Oh you know, I’d say I would have received you know about one hundred thousand dollars.” 
       
      
     6  
     The judge’s observation that there had been an agreement to receive $100,000 for provision of the alibi for “X” was, as the applicant asserts, incorrect. However, given the circumstances and the content of the answers that I have recited, I am unable to conclude that that inaccuracy in any way tainted the ultimate exercise of sentencing discretion by Flannery DCJ. It would appear that the jumbling of the information concerning the sum of $100,000 occurred in a police collation of facts for the purpose of placing before the Court but there is no basis for any suggestion that the inaccuracy played any part in inflating any sentence imposed upon the applicant. 
      
     7  
     In the written submissions the applicant contended that, as his original solicitor and counsel assigned by legal aid withdrew in February 1998 by reason of a conflict of interest arising out of other professional commitments, the subsequently appointed counsel and solicitor had insufficient time to properly prepare his case. In fact, on his own calculations, approximately two months were available and I am unable to attribute any validity to this complaint. My view is somewhat fortified from the observation that the matters were before the sentencing judge on 13 March, 17 April and 8 May and the applicant wrote a letter to his counsel dated 14 May which commenced with the expression “Thank you for the excellent manner you conducted my sentencing hearing last Friday”. The applicant forwarded a copy of this letter to the Court.  
      
     8  
     The applicant referred to an incident said to have occurred during the proceedings when counsel said to the presiding judge that perhaps he should have drawn “a clearer picture” which was accompanied by a gesture of drawing a square in the air with his fingers. The applicant complained that he gained the impression that this angered the judge and he went on to express a conclusion that he did not receive proper legal representation. There is no reflection in his Honour’s remarks or in his conclusion as to sentence which gives rise to any justifiable impression that any anger was vented upon the applicant. The transcript of evidence and the material placed before the judge are eloquent of diligent and competent attention to matters which could be advanced on behalf of the applicant. I reject the contention that the applicant did not receive proper representation. 
      
     9  
     I return to the principal thrust of the applicant’s written argument. He stated that Flannery DCJ had remarked that having regard to all the charges if he was not to take into account the assistance by the applicant he would have imposed a sentence of “eight years with a non parole period of six years”. The applicant then contended that it was stated by his Honour that he had decided “to reduce my non parole period from six years to three years”. It is from arithmetical extrapolation of these remarks that the applicant reaches the conclusion that he was given a “discount” of 50%. Save for Federal offences, the language of the submission has been obsolete since the supersession of the Parole of Prisoners Act by the Sentencing Act 1989. It can be observed, of course, that division of a total sentence of eight years pursuant to the formula mentioned in s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act would result in a minimum term of six years with an additional term of two years. 
      
     10  
     The transcript does not reveal any remarks in terms attributed to his Honour however an affidavit of Elizabeth Catherine Corbett sworn 10 March 1999 deposes to her presence on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions at the proceedings on 1 June 1998 where she heard Flannery DCJ indicate that the “total” minimum term will be 3 years but would have been 6 years but for assistance. She has exhibited a contemporaneous notation to that effect. His Honour was not obliged to separately quantify the amount of discount:  
     R v Gallagher 
      1991 23 NSWLR 220. It is clear that the special circumstances expressly found were a basis for the division of the total term otherwise than in accordance with s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act. It would appear that the exercise engaged in by Flannery DCJ was to reduce the minimum term component of the division of total term whereas what the applicant was entitled to was a discount of sentence (as distinct from minimum term) for his assistance to authority. Although his Honour apparently limited himself to the remarks mentioned, it is open to conclusion that the total of 8 years was so low as an assessment for the overall offences that some discount was in fact applied. Accepting, as I do, the evidence of Ms Corbett there remains no revelation of what process was adopted to result in the total term of eight years. The circumstance that there was no submission from the applicant about term other then the asserted insufficiency of the reduction of minimum term from 6 to 3 years can be noted but some reference should be made. Arithmetically, if a similar discount has been applied to the longest sentence, his Honour would have to be taken to have started with a notional sentence of 16 years penal servitude which is two years in excess of the available maximum for the offence specified in the single count of the relevant indictment. I cannot perceive that the overall criminality for the 39 offences in the indictments, committals for sentence and schedules could possibly be adequately reflected (ignoring discount for assistance) by an enveloping total imposition of 8 years and I therefore conclude that that figure represents the discounted result of some higher notional assessment upon which the record is silent. It appears however that his Honour’s intention was, as the applicant claims and Ms Corbett’s evidence suggests, to apply a reduction of 50%. Although I would not assess the maximum prescribed penalty as appropriate to the count in the first indictment, if the structure of the various impositions for the other crimes is preserved, I would impose a sentence of 14 years penal servitude on that count to reflect the totality of criminality involved. I would thereafter apply the discount of 50% for assistance to reach a sentence of 7 years penal servitude. 
      
     11  
     In his original filed document the applicant claimed that Flannery DCJ commented that he could “understand why (the applicant) could feel I should lodge an appeal against his decision”. The applicant went on to repeat his assertion about the “discount” of 50%. The reference to appeal made by his Honour appeared in the published remarks on sentence and referred to his adoption of the suggestion that there be a second confidential set of remarks detailing the assistance given by the applicant. His Honour stated: 
      
      “I have adopted a suggestion, lest this case goes on appeal, (it is the sort of case in which either side may appeal because of the unusual set of facts)”. 
      
     12  
     The applicant made a further attribution to the remarks of the sentencing judge that because the applicant was helping numerous people “with the money I obtained from people who were trying to rort the judicial system” that he was a “type of Robin Hood”. This contention does not find expression in the record of proceedings. 
      
     13  
     The applicant has sought to support his assertion of the inappropriateness of the “50% discount” which, as I have sought to demonstrate has uncertain arithmetical antecedents in the applicant’s own impressions of the proceedings, by reference to discounts said to have been received by other prisoners. The applicant goes so far as to assert that his “discount” of 50% is the lowest received by any person imprisoned with him in the Special Purpose unit. The contention that for assistance to authority a discount of over 50% is either the norm or the common experience is contrary to my observations in the passage of appeals through this Court. Reference has been made to  
     R v Cartwright 
      1989 17 NSWLR 243, where in the joint judgment (Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ) the following appears (@ 255-6): 
      
      “There is, of course, no fixed tariff in this State against which a discount for assistance to the authorities can be judged. Nor do we suggest that there should be, as the possible variations between individual cases are infinite. In  
     R v King 
      (at 123), the English Court of Appeal referred to a tariff for discounts in that country of between about one-half and two-thirds of what was otherwise an appropriate sentence, according to the particular circumstances. We believe that there may well be some cases where less than one-half discount would be appropriate. But the magnitude of the discount given is nevertheless very apparent. 
      
      
       
     It is not always possible from the judgments in the various cases to ascertain the length of sentence considered to have been appropriate to the particular case (without reference to the assistance given), in order to calculate the extent of the discount in fact allowed. In  
     R v 
       
     King 
      itself, such a sentence was considered to be ten years; the judge had imposed six years and this was reduced on appeal to four and a half years. In the earlier case of  
     R v Sinfield 
     , the equivalent figures were fifteen to eighteen years as otherwise appropriate, eight years imposed, reduced to five on appeal. In  
     R v Golding 
     , a discount of approximately 50 per cent was given. In  
     R v Hayes 
     , a sentence of seven years was reduced to 
       
     four. In  
     R v Heard aka Summers 
     , a sentence of three years was converted into a bond for the same period. In  
     R v Perez-Vargas 
     , the initial sentences imposed without reference to the assistance given were considered to be excessive in any event, so that the extent of the reduction (although substantial) is masked. Again, the magnitude of the discounts given in all of those cases is apparent.” 
      
       
       In that case the effect of the order made was to apply a reduction of 50%. 
       
      
     14  
     Be that as it may, the sentencing judge was obliged to pay heed to s 442B of the Crimes Act (inserted by Act No 2 of 1992, subsequent to  
     Cartwright 
     ) which specifically bound him not to reduce a sentence, discounted for assistance to authorities, so that the sentence became unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence: see s 442B(2). It can be accepted that (in favourable terms) the sentencing judge said that he had “never seen anything like it” and he described the level of assistance as “huge”, “quite extraordinary” and “magnificent”. Accepting that those findings were open to his Honour and that this Court should act upon them I am nevertheless of the view that having regard to the seriousness, range and number of the applicant’s offences, any lower imposition of minimum term than that finally pronounced by Flannery DCJ would offend the terms of the obligation cast by s 442B(2). The applicant has made reference to his claim that he was “very mentally ill” at the time of his offences but it must be observed that they were committed over a significant span of time and obviously involved repeated and deliberate criminality. His position as a senior non commissioned officer in the police service could not be ignored. 
      
     15  
     Save the remark concerning $100,000 discussed above, I detect no error in his Honour’s remarks or assessment. The duty of this Court expressed in s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act is, in effect, to dismiss the appeal unless it is of opinion that a less severe sentence should have been passed. The sentence imposed subject to adjustment to recognize the notional “overrun” of the prescribed maximum penalty on the count in the first indictment was well within the range of sound exercise of discretion giving proper account of the applicant’s assistance in accordance with the precepts of s 442B of the Crimes Act.  
      
       
       I would grant the extension of time and leave to appeal against sentence and make the following orders: 
        
       1. Appeal allowed to the extent that the sentence imposed on the first indictment be quashed. 
        
       2. In lieu thereof, taking into account the two matters on Form 1, the appellant be sentenced to 7 years penal servitude to consist of a minimum term of three years commencing on 4 January 1997 and expiring on 3 January 2000 together with an additional term of 4 years from 4 January 2000. 
        
       3. Specify the appellant will be eligible for parole from 4 January 2000. 
        
       4. Subject to the foregoing all other sentences and orders made in the District Court confirmed.

       REGINA V TROY GORDON SARA 
       
       
       
      The appellants were found guilty of aggravated robbery under s 95(2)(a) of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      . The Crown case was that they had met the victim in a nightclub and had had a disagreement about a wager. The disagreement resulted in the appellants assaulting and robbing the victim in a street near the club. The appellants acknowledged the disagreement, but contended that it was the victim who had thrown the first punch. Moreover they asserted that they had not robbed the victim. They were convicted. Hunter was sentenced to a minimum of penal servitude for 12 months and Sara to a minimum term of 18 months. 
       
       
      The appellants appealed the convictions and sentences on the grounds that (1) there was a miscarriage of justice due to the alleged incompetence of their counsel; and (2) that the verdicts were “unsafe and unsatisfactory” and should be set aside pursuant to s 6(1) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
      .  
       
       
      HELD 
       (allowing the appeals): 
       
       
      (1) There is no single test of general application as to whether errors of counsel have led to a miscarriage of justice. Each case will depend on its own facts and upon an assessment of whether the incompetence displayed was of such a nature as to have led to a miscarriage of justice.

      (2) The errors made by counsel in this instance included: not ensuring that the accused had separate representation; failing to recognise the different cases available to each; failing to ensure that character evidence was put for one of the accused; failing to object to inadmissible and prejudicial evidence; and failing to fulfil basic standards of advocacy. These errors amounted to the defence case being very poorly conducted.

      (3) The factors in (2) above lead to the view that there was a miscarriage of justice, such that the convictions of each appellant should be set aside. 
       
       
      (4) In the case of Sara, it was open to a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt of the offence charged; but not so in the case of Hunter.

      1  
      Meagher JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
       
      2  
      WOOD CJ at CL: 
       The appellants were indicted in the District Court at Coffs Harbour on 4 February 1998, on the charge that they, on 22 May 1997, did rob Raymond Gordon Forbes of certain property comprising a wallet, $150 in cash and some personal papers, and immediately after the robbery did use corporal violence on him. This charge was preferred under s95 Crimes Act 1900, and carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for 20 years. 
       
      3 At the conclusion of a five day trial, they were each found guilty of the offences charged. The appellant Sara was thereafter sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for 18 months to commence on 9 February 1998, and to expire on 8 August 1999. An additional term of 18 months was fixed to commence on 9 August 1999. The appellant Hunter was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for 12 months, to commence on 9 February 1998 and to expire on 8 February 1999. An additional term of 12 months was fixed to commence on 9 February 1999. Hunter was granted bail on 25 June 1998, pending appeal. Sara was similarly granted appeal bail on 3 July 1998. 
       
      4 The appellants were represented by the same Counsel at their trial, but were separately represented during the sentencing proceedings. Each now brings an appeal against conviction and sentence. Although now separately represented, their appeals raise essentially the same grounds: first, that by reason of the alleged incompetence of their Counsel there was a miscarriage of justice; and secondly, that the verdicts were “unsafe and unsatisfactory” and should be set aside pursuant to s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
       
        
      The Crown Case 
       
      5 It was the Crown case that at about 7.30pm on 21 May 1997, the victim went to the Coffs Harbour RSL club. He set out for the night with $30 in cash. Whilst there he won $210 on the poker machines. At 9pm. he went to the Coffs Harbour Hotel where he continued to drink. In the early hours of the following morning, he moved on to the nearby Penguins Nightclub. 
       
      6 At that club, the victim met the appellant Sara, who introduced himself as “Torres”. The appellant Hunter was in his company. Sometime before 3am, as the bar was closing, the victim offered to bet Sara $20 that he would be able to purchase another drink. Sara accepted the bet. The barman refused to serve the victim the drink. He and Sara were escorted out of the premises by the hotel security officer. 
       
      7 As they walked into the alley behind the nightclub, Sara kept insisting that he was owed $20. The victim tried to explain that it was not a serious bet, but when Sara persisted with his demand, he pulled out his wallet and went to hand over $20. Sara knocked the wallet from his hand. It fell to the ground. Sara then struck him in the head near his right temple. The victim put up his arms to protect himself. As he did so the appellant Hunter, he said in chief, hit him in the side of the head from behind. The victim fell to the ground and covered his head and face with his arms. He was hit twice more whilst on the ground, but could not tell who had hit him while in that position. He heard both men swearing at him, but in cross examination he was less certain whether Hunter struck him. At best he said that he “sensed” his participation in the assault, and reconstructed his involvement from the circumstance that he had not seen any other persons in the vicinity.  
       
      8 As the victim recovered his footing he saw the two men crossing the road. He glanced around for his wallet unsuccessfully, and replaced a boot which had fallen off in the struggle. He saw Hunter running back toward him. He then began to run in a southerly direction down the Pacific Highway across West High Street past the Coffs Harbour Hotel. Hunter pursued him for a time, but gave up the chase outside the Coffs Harbour Hotel. The victim saw both appellants meet up at the entrance to the mall which runs off the highway. They walked down the mall together. 
       
      9 The victim returned to the entrance to the nightclub, making another search for his wallet. It was similarly unsuccessful. He did not notice anybody else in the vicinity either at the time he was struck, or was chased, or when he returned to the nightclub. The incident was reported to police, who arrived at the scene at 2.40am. They had been called by Mr. Todd, a Chubb security officer, who had been alerted by yelling from outside the Coffs Harbour hotel, where he was making a security check. After going outside, he saw two men run across the highway towards the man whom he had seen outside the hotel a little earlier shouting at them. 
       
      10 A taxi driver, John Arkan, was called to give evidence that he saw two men crossing the Pacific Highway from the Vernon Street intersection. While obtaining fuel at the Mobil Service Station a little way up the highway, he saw them again. The engaged his taxi and he drove them to a house in middle Boambee. They were loud and boisterous. They man, who he identified as Hunter, said that he had dragged “this guy bald arsed across the road”. That man added “then he fucking well said sorry - I didn’t want any fucking sorry”. They both laughed, and Hunter said, “then I hit him”. 
       
      11 The fare of $15.80 was paid by the man with the shorter hair (agreed to be Sara) with a $20 note. Mr. Arkan was invited to keep the change. As he was backing his taxi out of the driveway two police officers arrived and spoke to him. 
       
      12 A barman from the nightclub, Damien Cameron, gave evidence of seeing the two men at the Mobil Service Station, and of recognising them as the men who had left the club about 15 to 20 minutes earlier. He said that he had seen them arguing at the club with a third man over a bet. They were asked to leave when the conversation became somewhat tense. 
       
      13 Senior Constables O’Mahony, Gray and Black who had spoken to the victim and to Messrs Forbes, Todd and Arkan, entered the premises where the two men had been dropped off. As Senior Constable O’Mahony approached the house he saw a light, in what appeared to be a kitchen. He observed the two appellants in that room. He heard Sara say, “That’s paid for the cab and our night out”. There was a knock at the front door, and as Sara walked out of the room, Senior Constable O’Mahony saw Hunter pick up some cash from the kitchen bench and place it in his pocket. 
       
      14 Sara was arrested and searched. Police located $180 in notes (comprising three $50 notes, one $20 note, one $10 note) and coins to the value of $17 on his person. Hunter was also arrested and found to have $240 in cash (comprising four $50 notes, two $10 notes, and one $20 note). The victim’s wallet was found by Robert Rose in the gutter on the corner of Vernon Street and the Pacific Highway at about 5.40am. Some cards and personal papers of the victim were lying nearby. Mr. Rose took the wallet and papers to the police station. Some further personal papers were retrieved from the same location by police a little while later. 
       
      15 The appellant Hunter denied any wrongdoing and said that he required legal advice before being interviewed. He declined to participate in an identification parade. Sara took the same course. As a result of an incident occurring between Sara and a police officer, while he was being strip searched, he was additionally charged with an offence of indecently assaulting that officer. That matter was later no billed. 
       
      16 The banknotes found in the possession of the appellants were entered into their property, but not tested for fingerprints. Detective James explained that prior attempts to obtain identifiable fingerprints from banknotes had proved unsuccessful, and for that reason the notes went untested. The wallet and some of the papers that were recovered from the roadway were, however, tested, with a negative result. 
       
      17 An admission was made by counsel, on behalf of both appellants, pursuant to S184 of the Evidence Act 1995, that Mr. Forbes had won a jackpot at the RSL on the night in question, and had received a sum of money from that source. 
       
        
      The Case for Hunter 
       
      18 This appellant gave sworn evidence to the effect that he had been employed by Bay Island Taxi Service in Queensland as a captain of a motor vessel and earned $560 gross each week. He was a friend of Sara and had travelled with him to Coffs Harbour in May. They stayed with Sara’s uncle in Boambee. He had brought about $600 in cash with him from Queensland. On the evening of 21 May he, Sara and two other people went to the Hoey Moey hotel, where he drank ten to twelve glasses of rum and coke, and four or five “shooters” of straight Benedictine, before going on to the Penguins nightclub. 
       
      19 He acknowledged having spoken to the alleged victim (Forbes) at the nightclub. At about 2.30am Forbes and Sara were standing together at the bar, while he was sitting at a table. Sara came over and said that a guy had made him a $20 bet that he would get a drink after closing. He went to the bar and realised there were no drinks available. Sara left. A short time later he walked to the door, where he spoke briefly to the bouncer, and then proceeded out into the alley. He estimated that he had spent between $160 and $180 that night of the $600 that he had brought with him. 
       
      20 He said that he saw Sara and Forbes standing on the footpath. As he approached he saw Forbes hand over some cash, and then pull the money away, before taking a swing at Sara. The latter hit him a couple of times and Forbes fell to the ground. He stood back for a while and then walked over toward them. As they wrestled on the ground he said to Sara, “don’t worry about it mate, it’s not worth it”. He grabbed Forbes by the foot and dragged him away. Forbes said “I’ve had enough”. He let him stand and then chased him down the road towards the hotel, in order to get rid of him. He stopped near the West High Street intersection, and then met up with Sara again. 
       
      21 He denied striking or punching Forbes, and said that he did not see or do anything with the wallet after Forbes had made as if to give the $20 to Sara. 
       
      22 He said that he was very drunk but was able to walk to the Mobil Service Station where they got into a taxi. He agreed that he and Sara were laughing and joking, but he could not recall any particular conversation they had. The taxi driver was given a piece of paper with their address written on it. 
       
      23 He said that the words spoken in the kitchen by Sara were “that was a good night out”, and not “that’s paid for the cab and our night out”. He said that he had pulled all the money out of his pockets and placed it on the table, to see how much he had left. 
       
      24 When he was taken to the police station he did not realise what it was about. It was not until Detective James told him that he was there in relation to a robbery that he realised it was serious. He advised police that he wanted legal advice before making a statement, as he was still under the influence. He said that his requests to make a telephone call were refused. 
       
      25 He had only one prior entry on his criminal record. For an offence of behaving in a disorderly manner, he had been fined $50, without a conviction being recorded, in the Cleveland Magistrates Court on 5 September 1995. Evidence of his good character, that would have been available from several sources, was not called in his trial, but it was tendered in the sentencing proceedings. Its effect was to show that having attained Master Class V qualifications, he had secured the command of a sixty foot catamaran, carrying 120 passengers, between the Island and the mainland. He had a steady relationship and marriage plans in conjunction with a planned move to Cairns. He had a very positive reference from his employer, as well as references from Island residents as to his courtesy, reliability, honesty and maturity. Oral evidence was also called in the sentencing proceedings from his step father, mother, partner and recent employer, all confirming his positive character and suggesting that the offence of which he had been convicted was foreign to his nature. That evidence, it may be assumed, would have been available to be called at the trial had a decision been made to place his character before the jury. 
       
        
      The Case for Sara 
       
      26 The appellant Sara, who similarly lived on Russell Island in Queensland, gave sworn evidence. He said that he travelled to Coffs Harbour to sell his car with his uncle’s assistance. The appellant Hunter accompanied him because he did not have a driver’s licence. He took $600 in cash with him. After drinking with Hunter at the Hoey Moey they went on to the Penguins nightclub where he met Forbes. After going to the bar to get another shout, he was informed that it was closed. Forbes bet $20 with him that he could get another drink. When the barman refused, he told Forbes that he owed him $20. Forbes changed the subject, and said that he only had a $50 note. He told Hunter that he was leaving and walked outside. 
       
      27 Forbes, he said, approached him outside the club with his wallet open. He saw that it contained only one $20 note. Forbes took out the note, placed it in his hand, and then snatched it back before throwing a punch at him, which missed. Sara punched him twice in the head and wrestled with him on the ground. He heard Hunter say “it’s not worth it”. Hunter dragged Forbes away and chased him down the road. He remained where he was standing. At no time, he said, did either he or Hunter go near the Vernon Street intersection where Forbe’s wallet was later found. He did not take the wallet or any money from it. 
       
      28 He said that he walked with Hunter to the Mobil Service Station where they engaged Mr. Arkan’s taxi. He denied that Hunter said in the taxi that he had hit anyone. While they were in the kitchen he instructed Hunter to keep quiet as his uncle and aunt were asleep upstairs. Any conversation that occurred, he said, was in a whisper. The window to the kitchen he said was closed, and the blind was drawn. He denied making the observation attributed to him by Senior Constable O’Mahony. 
       
      29 He later saw his uncle talking to a police officer. He realised that it was to do with the fight, so he went down to the police station. It was not until later that he realised that he was being investigated in relation to a robbery and assault. He told police that he was too drunk to make a statement. He went to sleep for a short while at the station. When he woke he was strip searched. 
       
      30 The uncle of Sara gave evidence to the effect that the kitchen window was fitted with a ‘block out’ blind. The window was always kept shut, and the blind was “almost closed”, which he defined as 90% closed. It was in that condition before he went to bed on the evening of 21 May, and was still in that condition the following morning. He said that from the driveway, even if the window and blind were open, very little of the kitchen could be seen, and with the blind almost shut, the fittings in the kitchen could not be seen. 
       
      31 Sara had a significantly more extensive criminal record than Hunter, commencing with an entry on 5 November 1985 when he was discharged, without a conviction being recorded, on a recognisance to be of good behaviour for twelve months on a charge of unauthorised dealing with shop goods. His subsequent record included convictions in August 1986 for counts of possession of a prohibited plant and of a utensil, for which he was fined; entries in July 1987 for stealing and false pretences, for which he was respectively convicted and released on probation to be of good behaviour for twelve months, and ordered to pay compensation (without a conviction being recorded); convictions in November 1990 on two counts of supplying a dangerous drug for each of which he was fined; convictions in February 1991 for two further counts of supply dangerous drugs, which for which he was ordered to perform community service; a conviction in August 1991 for possession of a utensil for which he was fined; a conviction in October 1993 for false pretences for which he was fined; and convictions in May 1996 on six counts of false pretences for which a recognisance to be of good behaviour for six months was imposed. In the meantime, in November 1993, he was sentenced to suspended terms of imprisonment for 6 months and 3 months in respect of breaches of probation and community service orders, which had earlier been imposed in relation to offences for driving while disqualified. 
       
      32 His character was similarly not placed into issue. He was unemployed and on a disability pension, by reason of an earlier motor vehicle accident. He was engaged to be married. For the purpose of the sentencing proceedings, a number of character references, gathered after conviction, were tendered, the effect of which was to suggest that, despite spending most of his childhood in foster care or in State homes, having encountered the earlier problems with the law apparent from his criminal history, and becoming involved in the serious motor vehicle accident which led to the cessation of his employment, he had nevertheless managed to purchase a house and to become actively involved in a Youth Action Group on Russell Island He was well thought of by the Island community being described as a person who was reliable, generous, honest and trustworthy.  
       
      33 The effect of this evidence would have been to water down, but not to eliminate entirely the suggestion of bad character conveyed by his criminal antecedents. The number of offences recorded may, however, have been somewhat misleading, since it is clear from the sentences imposed that they were not regarded as sufficiently serious to attract immediate terms of imprisonment. Most were in fact dealt with by way of fine, the more serious items attracting either suspended sentences or community service. 
       
        
       SUGGESTED INCOMPETENCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL 
       
      34 Material was placed before the Court in the form of affidavit evidence, from each appellant, their solicitors, the Crown Prosecutor, solicitors from the Office of the DPP, and from Counsel who appeared for the appellants at their trial. The appellants and defence counsel were cross examined upon those affidavits. The grounds of incompetence in representation, with which this material, and this ground of appeal, were concerned, relate to a number of matters. 
       
      35 So far as Hunter is concerned, they relate to:  
       
      (a) the failure of counsel to advise him that the appellants should be separately represented at their trial; 
       
      (b) the failure to call evidence of good character on his behalf, or to explore the precise nature of the one matter on his record; 
       
      (c) errors of fact or of law, made during the closing address by defence counsel, which required correction by the trial Judge and censure of counsel, in the presence of the jury. These related to the reference made by counsel to the circumstance that conviction of the appellants would lead to their imprisonment; that motive needed to be proved by the Crown; that it was the Crown case that Forbes had been struck twice from behind (when in fact he said that he had only been struck once in that manner), and that a club security officer (William) should have been called by the Crown. 
       
      (d) incidents of apparent inexperience by defence counsel, during the examination or cross examination of witnesses, for example his habit of talking over witnesses which attracted either a rebuke or correction by the trial Judge, and his failure to ask pertinent questions that made it necessary for several witnesses to be recalled for further cross examination;  
       
      (e) arranging for a semi-retired local solicitor to attend for the first day of the trial to assist him, contrary to Bar rule 80; 
       
      (f) failure to advise the appellants adequately on the charge and penalty that they were facing, so far as it had been held out to them that the maximum penalty for the offence was only twelve years (when it was in fact 20 years), and that there was no risk of them facing a sentence of imprisonment if convicted; 
       
      (g) failure to take him or Sara through the police brief or statements of the witnesses before the trial, in conferences; 
       
      (h) failure to explain his option of giving evidence or remaining silent at his trial. 
       
      36 The appellant Hunter said that his reason for retaining Counsel, who was briefed on a direct client access basis, was that he understood him to be acquainted with relatives of his co-accused. 
       
      37 In a supplementary affidavit, he deposed that in November 1997, he asked counsel whether he should be separately represented at his trial. The reply from counsel, he said, was to the effect that it would be better for him to appear for both accused as he was aware of a similar case where the accused had been separately represented and ended up going to gaol. He added that, had he been advised to engage separate counsel either before, or during the trial, he would have done so.  
       
      38 He also deposed to the fact that, prior to the trial, he had supplied to his counsel a substantial number of references attesting to his good character, and informed him that these referees, as well as his partner and his employer, were available to give evidence on his behalf. According to him, his counsel said that it would not be advisable to use this evidence at the trial because it would reflect adversely on his co-accused. Had he understood the benefits of calling good character, he said that he would have insisted that the material be used in the trial.  
       
      39 The appellant Sara relied on the same matters, and raised a number of additional complaints concerning the conduct of his case by defence counsel. Thus it was that he asserted that: 
       
      (a) Counsel agreed to conduct the trial for the two appellants for a fee of $500 each, upon the basis that it was a simple matter that would be completed within a day, an estimate which obviously had to be wrong; 
       
      (b) he was late in appearing for his trial because of advice received that it was unlikely to proceed, and was then disadvantaged because counsel failed to seek an adjournment, even though he was suffering from a temporary facial palsy and a severely lacerated hand; 
       
      (c) on the morning when he was advised that the trial was to proceed, he was, for the first time, informed that he needed to provide an additional sum ($285) by way of fees for another person to assist defence counsel, that being a person to whom he had never spoken, who was present only for the first day of the hearing, and who turned out to be a semi retired solicitor practising on a part time basis from a farm in the district; 
       
      (d) defence counsel made an admission on his behalf (and on behalf of Hunter) without their instructions, that the victim had won a jackpot at the RSL club during the night in question, and had received a sum of money from that source. This admission was in fact offered and given in response to a question asked by the jury, during the case for the accused, in the following terms: “Can the Court establish that Mr. Forbes actually had money in his wallet, that is winnings from the RSL?” The admission was made following counsel’s assurance to the trial Judge, that he had personally checked with the club, and had confirmed that the victim had won a jackpot. This arose from an exchange concerning the omission of counsel to challenge the victim along the lines that he had only a $20 note in his wallet. 
       
      (e) he received no advice as to whether he could, or should, exercise the right not to give evidence at his trial; nor was there any exploration with him of the factual issues, or of the Crown case, other than in the initial conference, or any discussion with him of the evidence that he should give other than advice to the effect that he should endeavour to confine his answers to ‘yes’ or no without any further expansion; 
       
      (f) his assertion, made as far back as the initial conference, that there was never more than $20 in the wallet of the victim at the time of the alleged incident, was not properly placed before the jury, and was effectively conceded as incorrect by reason of the admission that was made concerning the jackpot, and by the terms in which the victim was cross examined, so far as it was put to him that he did not know how much was in his wallet, other than that he had $50 notes in it; 
       
      (g) in so far as either, in the cross examination (particularly of Senior Constables O’Mahony and Gray), or in his address, counsel had spoken in terms suggesting an acceptance by him that there had been a “robbery” and an “assault” of the victim, this was without instructions from him and was counter productive for his case; 
       
      (h) the explanation for his act in taking a swing at Mr. Forbes, as an act taken in self defence following a punch thrown at him, was not sufficiently put to the jury; 
       
      (i) from the outset he was advised by defence counsel that he was at no risk of receiving a prison sentence if convicted, and that it was not until the jury delivered a note suggesting that they were deadlocked, before the  
      Black 
       direction was given, that the possibility of a plea to the lesser offence of assault was discussed. 
       
      (j) defence counsel failed to raise, through cross examination, the possibility that another patron leaving the club, or a passer by, had seen and picked up the wallet after it was knocked from the victim’s hand; 
       
      (k) defence counsel, in his cross examination of Senior Constable Gray, secured his corroboration for the admission in the kitchen of which Senior Constable O’Mahony had given evidence, even though the Crown Prosecutor had not led that evidence in chief through Gray; and failed to put to Senior Constable O’Mahony that the conversation did not occur at all (as was his instructions); 
       
      (l) defence counsel, in his cross examination of Senior Constable O’Mahony, painted a picture of Sara being drunk, noisy and abusive when spoken to by police and, despite a caution from the trial Judge, repeated this line in his cross examination of Senior Constable Gray, a matter that was likely to rebound to his discredit in the eyes of the jury; 
       
      (m) defence counsel displayed his incompetence by the manner in which he endeavoured to call evidence from the appellant in the trial, that saw him inviting an account in a narrative form after he had been stopped from leading the witness, and then cutting his evidence short, causing the trial Judge to ask some further questions of him concerning the important issue of whether it would have been possible to see into the kitchen, from the garden, in the way that the police had described. Counsel’s complaint, in the absence of the jury, that he had not been allowed to examine the appellant as he had wished led the trial Judge to give him what he described as a ‘lecture on evidence’ concerning the way a witness should be examined; 
       
      (n) defence counsel failed to object to a jury question concerning whether Sara had been “affected by anything else other than alcohol to cause his behaviour”, which when put to Senior Constable Gray, evoked a positive response, followed by the explanation: “Could’ve been some form of a drug, they form similar influences in persons”, even though the witness then acknowledged that he had found no material that would assist him to come to that conclusion; 
       
      (o) defence counsel failed to appreciate the circumstance that, absent an adoption by the other accused, any “admission” made by Hunter in the taxi, or by Sara in the kitchen, was admissible only in relation to the accused who made it. Not only was this point not taken during the evidence, it was raised for the first time at the end of the summing up when the Crown Prosecutor persuaded his Honour to give a redirection to the jury concerning the matter. Although that redirection was appropriately given, the apparent failure of Counsel to direct his mind to the point was said to be a further circumstance demonstrating his incompetence. 
       
      40 Although not expressly relied upon by Sara as a ground of incompetence, it was the case that evidence was permitted to be led from Detective James without objection, concerning his attempt to secure an interview with the accused, in the following terms: 
       
       “I said, ‘I am Detective James and this is Detective Atkinson, are you Troy Sara’ the accused said ‘Troy but people call me Tory,  
      turn that fucking machine off 
      ’, indicating the ERISP machine. I said ‘it isn’t on’ the accused said ‘ 
      it fucking is, the light’s on 
      ’ I said ‘settle down it’s not going, look there are no tapes in there, I am making inquiries into a man being assaulted outside Penguins Nightclub early this morning, the man was also robbed of his wallet which contained a hundred and fifty dollars. I'm going to ask you further questions about this matter I want you to clearly understand that you’re not obliged to say anything unless you wish as anything you say may later be used in evidence, do you understand that’ the accused said ‘ 
      I’m not fucking doing any interview, this is all shit, you cunts are picking on me 
      , I want to speak to my solicitor’ I said’ who is that’ the accused said ‘he’s in Brisbane’ I said ‘are you prepared to go in a line up about this matter’ he said ‘ 
      no, 
        
      just fucking charge me’ 
       I said ‘are you prepared to participate in an electronic recorded interview he said ‘no’. 
       
      41 Sara similarly said that, at no time, was the question of separate representation discussed with him, nor was his entitlement to have separate representation explained, save so far as defence counsel said that it would be cheaper for ‘you guys to go together’. Counsel agreed that he had not seen any need to discuss separate representation with Sara, since had he seen any potential conflict in interest, it would have been Sara for whom he continued to appear, as he was his “primary client”. 
       
      42 Sara submitted, similarly to Hunter, that defence counsel had failed to recognise the separate issues that arose in relation to each accused which should have led to them being separately represented. The failure to recognise those differences, or the possibility that certain evidence may have been admissible in respect of one accused but not the other, as well as his election to conduct the trial as a single defence, it was submitted, meant that he was also deprived of the opportunity of a fair trial. 
       
      43 In this regard, attention was drawn to the cross examination of the witnesses Arkan and Senior Constable O’Mahony, in the course of which counsel framed questions in terms which assumed that the accused had acted in concert, when that was not an accurate representation of their instructions, or additionally in the case of Mr. Arkan, a fair representation of his evidence in chief. So it was that counsel asked Mr. Arkan questions in the following terms: 
       
       “Q. But they were also talking about some sort of - did you think - what did you think it was  
      they 
       were talking about when  
      they 
       were talking about dragging him off the road and that sort of thing?” and 
       
       “Q. but there is no doubt in your mind that  
      they 
       said  
      they 
       dragged him across the road?’ 
       
       which he then adopted. 
       
      44 Similarly he asked questions of Senior Constable O’Mahony in the following terms: 
       
       “Q. They did not deny that they had anything to do with assaulting the man did they?” 
       
       and 
       
       “Q. They didn’t deny they’d been in a fight in other words” 
       
       propositions with which he did not express any disagreement. 
       
      45 Sara said that defence Counsel did not discuss with him the collection and placement before the Court of references in the event of him being convicted, or advise him of his right to call character evidence during the sentencing proceedings. The references that were available he said were gathered by his girlfriend, at his initiative. Further, he said that counsel did not take any instructions from him as to his antecedents until the morning of the proposed sentencing hearing. He similarly recalled counsel saying, before or during the trial, that it would not be advisable to raise Hunter’s good character, because it would reflect adversely on his own position. 
       
      46 Sara also said that although the duty solicitor had indicated that he was eligible for legal aid, defence counsel indicated that he did not really need it, as he would ‘only be in and out’ and would get a ‘slap on the wrist and a bond’. He added that counsel had never mentioned that the maximum available penalty for the offence was penal servitude for 20 years, and that he first learned of the possibility that imprisonment was a real option during the trial. Counsel gave a different version of events concerning the first of these matters, stating that when he discussed legal aid with Sara he was ‘most emphatic’ that he did not want it. He acknowledged, however, being in error as to the maximum available penalty. 
       
      47 Defence counsel provided a chronology of his involvement in the proceedings, the material events in which were recorded as follows: 
       
      22 May 1997- the appellants were charged and bailed to appear in the Coffs Harbour Local Court 
       
      4 June 1997 - a preliminary conference was held in which the police facts sheets were discussed, the procedures and rights of the appellants were discussed, some notes were made of the instructions given and they were asked to provide written summaries of the events (which were later provided) 
       
      5 June 1997 - the committal hearing was conducted as a paper committal: 
       
      20 June 1997 - request was made to Sara’s solicitors in Brisbane, placing them on notice that details of his medical history may be required; 
       
      21 June 1997 - an application for a no bill was made in relation to Hunter, and an invitation was extended to vary the charge concerning Sara; 
       
      30 October 1997 - a conference was held with the appellants in which their summaries of events and the police brief were discussed, arrangements were made for character references to be obtained, and an inspection of the scene was carried out; 
       
      20 November 1997 - letters were sent to Sara and Hunter enclosing draft proofs of the evidence that each would be expected to give at their trial for checking, and completion or correction as necessary; and providing an estimate of the probable legal costs of a one day trial at Legal Aid rates (including fees to date on a shared basis); 
       
      12 December 1997 - an application was made to the District Court for a separate trial in relation to the charge of indecent assault against Sara; 
       
      December 1997 - counsel inspected the home of Sara’s uncle, and made inquiries at the Mobil Service Station, and at the Coffs Harbour RSL Club; 
       
      3 and 4 February 1998 - pre-trial conferences were conducted with the appellants, during which the possibility of offering a plea to a lesser charge of assault was discussed. 
       
      48 In his evidence defence counsel acknowledged that although he had formerly been a police officer and a detective of many years standing, he had only appeared as a junior to another counsel in three or four trials in the District Court, and that this was the first trial that he had conducted by himself. His area of practice, since coming to the Bar in 1991, he said was principally in the area of employment law. At the end of his cross examination he made a frank concession concerning his ability to conduct a criminal trial in the following exchange: 
       
       “Q. Did it at any time cross your mind this may have been beyond you? 
       
       A. Not a case of being beyond me, I well know my way around all these courts. I have been in them for nearly 50 years. However, by the time this trial was over I was quite certain I wouldn’t do another one.” 
       
      49 He explained that he had agreed to act for each appellant for the reason that he was so instructed. He said that he had not seen any potential conflict in interest or difference between their cases, although he accepted that the jury could have returned different verdicts for each. 
       
      50 That this was so is obvious since it was the case for Hunter that he had nothing to do with the bet, or with its attempted recovery, and that he intervened only after the exchange in the street over the money, and then only to break up the fight. Moreover, defence counsel put to the taxi driver in cross examination that it was Sara, and not Hunter, who said “I hit him”. This was a matter of some significance for each accused. It was incriminatory of Sara, and it needed to be understood in the context that the victim, Forbes, had conceded in cross examination that he was unable to say whether Hunter had hit him at all. 
       
      51 Additionally defence counsel deposed to the follow matters: 
       
      (a) he had asked the semi retired solicitor to assist him by taking a note of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, and to give him advice, although he could not recall whether he was present beyond the first day; 
       
      (b) he had been optimistic that the trial could conclude within a day; 
       
      (c) he had secured an understanding with the Prosecutor on the morning of the trial, that he would accept a plea of guilty to a charge of assault, subject to the approval of the victim, but that was not carried forward as the victim would not agree, and he had discussed that matter with the appellants in the presence of the semi retired solicitor; 
       
      (d) he went through the police brief, and the evidence likely to be called by the Crown, with the appellants either on 5 June or on 30 October; 
       
      (e) he had reached a tactical decision that it would be ‘too dangerous’ to place evidence of Hunter’s good character before the jury, because of his understanding of the earlier incident when Hunter had been charged after going to the assistance of a person involved in a fight in the street, and had explained to the appellant that the apparent factual similarity of the two incidents, and its element of “violence”, was the reason for his decision, rather than any concern that he entertained as to the consequences for Sara; 
       
      (f) he had discussed with the appellants on the morning of the trial, their option to give evidence, or to remain silent; 
       
      (g) he acknowledged that he had erroneously advised the appellants that the maximum penalty for the offence charged was penal servitude for twelve years, although he had told them that it was a serious matter that was likely to attract a custodial sentence if they were found guilty of the offence charged (with its element of robbery), as distinct from the offence of common assault; 
       
      (h) he did receive the instructions of the appellants before making the admission concerning the jackpot; 
       
      (i) he had not considered it necessary to seek any directions from the trial Judge concerning accessorial liability or joint enterprise, as he had judged the matter as one involving an ‘all or nothing situation’ so far as Hunter was concerned; 
       
      (j) he acknowledged that his cross examination of the police officers to show that the appellants were quite intoxicated produced ‘the wrong answers’, but said that his purpose had been to raise a doubt concerning their mens rea - ie the existence of their intention to steal the property in question; 
       
      (k) he acknowledged his error in raising in his closing address, the consequences for the appellants if they were convicted of the offence charged, but explained that he had simply become “carried away”. 
       
      52 The circumstances in which incompetence of trial Counsel may give rise to a miscarriage of justice, leading to intervention by a Court of Criminal Appeal, were examined by Gleeson CJ in  
      Birks 
       (1990) 19 NSWLR 677at 683 to 685. His Honour initially noted at 683: 
       
       “In our system of criminal justice a trial of an accused person is conducted in the manner of a contest between the Crown and the accused, and that trial has many (although not all) of the features which attend civil litigation conducted in accordance with what is sometimes described as the adversary system of justice. To a large extent the parties to such proceedings are bound by the manner in which they conduct them. It is the parties who decide, for example, what information will be put before a tribunal of fact, and the tribunal bases its decision on that information. 
       
       As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case.” 
       
      53 His Honour then noted the tension between the principles governing the independent role of counsel, and the binding consequences for the client ,of decisions taken in the running of a case, and the power and duty of a Court of Criminal Appeal to correct a miscarriage of justice, observing at 684: 
       
       “It would be wrong, however, simply to regard these as two competing considerations which must from time to time yield to some compromise. The principles as to the role of counsel and the capacity of counsel to bind the client, are fundamental to the operation of the adversary system, and form part of the practical content of our notions of justice.  
       
       It sometimes happens that a person who has been convicted of a crime seeks to have the conviction set aside on the ground that counsel at the trial has acted incompetently, or contrary to instructions. It is well settled that neither of these circumstances will, of itself, attract appellate intervention. At the same time the courts acknowledge the existence of a power and duty to quash a conviction in some cases. The difficulty is to find, in the authorities, a formula which adequately and accurately defines the class of case in which a Court of Criminal Appeal will intervene. A common theme running through the cases, however, is that such intervention is a matter about which the courts are extremely cautious”. 
       
      54 His Honour cited with approval (at 685) the view expressed by the Lord Chief Justice in  
      Ensor 
       (1989) 1 WLR 497: 
       
       “that if defending counsel in the course of the conduct of the case makes a decision, or takes a course, which later appears to have been mistaken or unwise, that generally speaking, is not a proper ground for an appeal. To that, however, his Lordship added the rider that ‘if the court had any lurking doubt that the appellant might have suffered some injustice as a result of flagrantly incompetent advocacy by his advocate, then it would quash the convictions.’ 
       
      before continuing: 
       
       “The relevant principles may be summarised as follows: 
       
       1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 
       
       2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes ofthe client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
       
       3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.” 
       
      55 This statement of the law by Gleeson CJ in  
      Birks 
       has been adopted in several subsequent decisions of this Court (eg  
      Igniatic 
       (1993) 68 A CrimR 333;  
      Sandford 
       (1994) 72 A CrimR 160; and  
      D 
       Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, 22 February 1996, unreported. What does emerge from these decisions is that no single test of general application exists, by which it might be determined whether an error, or series of errors, of counsel has led to a miscarriage of justice. Each case will depend on its own facts and upon an assessment whether the errors made or incompetence displayed were of such a nature or consequence, in the particular circumstances of the case, as to have led to a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      56 The first matter of significance for the present case concerns the circumstance that counsel elected to appear for each accused, and did not advise them to secure separate representation, or ensure that they received independent advice on that question. 
       
      57 As I have observed earlier, there was a real difference between the cases of the two appellants in that Hunter (on his case) had not been party to the bet, or to any demand for its payment. At the highest he only became involved after the wallet had been knocked from the victim’s hand, and that person had been struck by Sara. There was no direct evidence to suggest that he did anything to assist Sara in taking the money, or was there present ready to assist him in that activity. On his account, he did no more than break up a wrestling match, and chase away a man who he said, had tried to assault his companion. 
       
      58 Whatever may have been Sara’s role, it was incumbent for Hunter’s involvement to be examined by reference to the principles concerning joint criminal enterprise as discussed in  
      Tangye 
       (1997) 92 ACrimR 545;  
      Clough 
       (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 and  
      McAuliffe 
       (1993) 70 ACrimR 303 (affirmed on appeal by the High Court (1995) 183 CLR 108), a matter that appears to have been overlooked not only by Counsel but also by the trial Judge, who gave no relevant instructions in this regard. 
       
      59 A direct consequence of the single representation, and prosecution of a ‘joint defence’, was that the individual cases of the two appellants were not adequately separated in the addresses or in the summing up. Moreover, the possibility of different verdicts for each, and of any statutory alternative involving a lesser offence for Hunter, was left unexplored. 
       
      60 A serious question also arose, in respect of which Hunter was entitled to independent advice, concerning whether or not evidence of his good character should have been raised. It is difficult to see how counsel acting for both accused could have delivered impartial advice on this question. Raising the character of one of two accused alone inevitably invites speculation, by the jury, as to the position of the other accused, who in this case was the one against whom the prosecution case was a good deal stronger. 
       
      61 Additionally, there were some respects in which it would have been to Hunter’s advantage, in the light of the manner in which the trial unfolded, to distance himself from Sara, including the circumstance that evidence was received showing that the latter had behaved very aggressively and had spoken to police in obscene terms, when they sought to interview him at the police station. Further, it was evident from the several questions asked, at the request of the jury, that they saw Sara’s role (and possible motivation) as somewhat different, so far as they inquired whether he thought Mr. Forbes was gay, when it was prior to this incident that he claimed to have seen gay people in the mall, and whether he had taken some substance other than alcohol to make him behave in the way he did. None of these questions seems to have been relevant, and the fact of their asking invites the possibility that the jury were reasoning along inappropriate lines. Counsel did not address the admissibility of those questions. 
       
      62 Although there was something of an issue as to whether or not defence counsel gave the appellants any advice as to their representation, and if so what the advice was, it is in my view clear, for the reasons mentioned, that they should have been separately represented, and that counsel made a serious error in not ensuring that Hunter at least received independent advice on this question. 
       
      63 The next matter of significance relates to the decision whether or not to raise Hunter’s character, a question that emerged during the trial, after defence counsel had led from him some material concerning his family background and his work history. The Crown Prosecutor, being concerned that an attempt was being made to raise character, cautioned defence counsel, at the short adjournment, that he was ‘sailing close to the wind’ if he did not intend to do this. Counsel replied that it was not his intention to do so, his purpose being merely to show that Hunter had money of his own (and did not need to steal money from Forbes). This was confirmed in open Court, in the absence of the jury, later that day. 
       
      64 Hunter agreed that he had gathered a portfolio of character evidence, which was presented in a folder, at defence counsel’s request, before the trial. He denied that any explanation was given by counsel along the lines he described. It was his assumption that the portfolio would be used in the trial, since the single prior entry on his record related to a street offence, when he was aged about 22, had not involved violence on his part, and had not led to a conviction being recorded. He still considered himself a person of good character. It was his evidence (as well as that of Sara) that Counsel informed him, either before or during the trial, that he would not use the evidence in the trial because it would reflect adversely on his co-accused, and that in any event, it would not make any difference to the outcome.  
       
      65 The decision whether or not to open up character is often a difficult one, upon which minds may differ. It is one that needs a great deal of careful consideration, as well as a full knowledge of what might be elicited or led by the Crown if character is raised The potential damage that may be caused to the defence case, if an error is made is considerable:  
      Hamilton 
       (1993) 68 ACrimR 298 at 300 to 301. Hunt CJ at CL there said, at 300: 
       
       “All of this makes it obvious that counsel for an accused (and I include here a solicitor for the accused where acting as the advocate) bears a very heavy burden when advising the client in relation to the decision which  
      the client 
       must make as to whether good character should be raised. That advice can only be given properly when it is based upon a  
      full knowledge 
       of what may be elicited or led by the Crown should character be raised by the accused. It is  
      not 
       sufficient for counsel merely to rely upon a  
      belief 
       based only on information provided by the accused. To put it bluntly, a person facing a criminal trial which may have a severe consequence to his or her liberty and/or reputation is not always a reliable source of such information. Such unreliability may result from the client’s educational standards, culture, health, embarrassment or lack of comprehension. It may also result from the client’s mendacity. Not only is it wise, it is imperative, that the information which the client gives be checked from a source which is reliable  
      before 
       any forensic step is taken to raise character.” 
       
      66 It may be accepted that there is here an issue of fact as to the reason defence Counsel gave for the decision that he says was in fact made. It does, however, appear that his inquiry into and his appreciation of the nature of the earlier incident, was at best superficial, and that the present case is one where counsel failed to fulfil the obligations enunciated in Hamilton.  
       
      67 The decision reached was, in my judgment, erroneous. The ‘portfolio’ assembled was impressive and persuasive, and the earlier incident, which did not involve any element of robbery, was capable of being explained away. More important, however, is the consideration I have previously identified, arising out of the conflict of interest counsel had in appearing for both accused. The present case is, to my mind, more akin to  
      D 
       (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, 22 February 1996 unreported) where it was held that the failure of trial Counsel to lead character evidence did lead to a miscarriage of justice, than  
      VRJ 
       (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, 22 November 1996) where the decision was regarded as justifiable, on tactical grounds, and not such as to lead to a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      68 The remaining matters relied upon by the appellants vary in their significance, and not all have been conceded as having any factual foundation. I do not, however, consider it necessary to resolve those factual issues. I am of the view that sufficient has been conceded, or is apparent on the face of the record, to show that the defence case was very poorly conducted, with the consequence that the jury were likely to have been left with a most unfavourable impression of its merits. 
       
      69 In this respect, the following matters appear to me to be of significance: 
       
      (a) the circumstance that the trial Judge found it necessary to intervene repeatedly, by reason of the apparent inability of defence counsel to lay the foundation of his case in the cross examination of prosecution witnesses (leading to their recall, on more than one occasion) or to call the evidence that he wished to adduce from the appellants eventually leading his Honour to give counsel advice as to how he should go about his task; 
       
      (b) the impression formed by the trial Judge, which is evident in his remarks on sentence, to the following effect: 
       
       “The trial was marked by a number of occasions when … counsel, for both prisoners at the time, omitted to observe important rules of evidence and presentation. Without prejudice to either the prosecution or defence, a good deal of latitude was allowed to defence counsel to ensure that each of the prisoners had a fair trial.” 
       
      (c) the need for his Honour to correct a number of errors in the closing address of the appellants’ Counsel including the observation, (of which he was particularly critical), to the jury to the effect that the “freedom of the accused was in (their) hands” and that the offence attracted a gaol sentence; 
       
      (d) the failure to object to the evidence concerning Sara’s aggressive and obscene response to the police when they sought to interview him, evidence which had no probative value but was of such a prejudicial kind that it should have been excluded under S135 or S137 Evidence Act 1995; 
       
      (e) the failure to object to the jury question, the response to which floated the possibility, for which there was no factual foundation whatsoever, that Sara may have consumed drugs and that this may have accounted for his behaviour; 
       
      (f) the cross examination of police inviting agreement to the proposition that the appellants had been intoxicated and boisterous, the net effect of which served only to raise the possibility that, being disinhibited by the effects of alcohol, they may well have engaged in the conduct charged (particularly as no direction concerning the relevance of intoxication to intent was sought or given); and 
       
      (g) accepting a brief in a matter involving a serious offence, without the benefit of the assistance of a junior or experienced solicitor who was properly instructed, who was able to give meaningful assistance, and who would be present through the trial, when his own experience as trial counsel was so limited; 
       
      70 This combination of circumstances leads me to the view that there was a miscarriage of justice, such that the convictions of each appellant should be set aside. 
       
        
      VERDICT UNSAFE AND UNSATISFACTORY? 
       
      71 Having regard to the conclusion reached in relation to the first ground of appeal, which would require the convictions to be quashed, this ground can be confined to the question whether upon the whole of the evidence properly before the jury, it was open to them to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of either appellant, as that principle was stated by the High Court in  
      M 
       (1994) 181 CLR 487;and in  
      Jones 
       (1997) 72 ALJR 78, and later explained in  
      Gipp 
       155 ALR 15. If the question is answered in the affirmative, then it would follow that a new trial should be ordered. If the answer is in the negative, in respect of either accused, then a verdict of acquittal should be substituted for that accused. 
       
      72 The position in relation to Sara is relatively simple. Although the prosecution case depended largely upon acceptance of the complainant and of the police officers, there is nothing in their evidence which was inherently improbable, or cut down in cross examination. The assessment of those witnesses was quintessentially a matter for the jury, whose advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence unfold, and in assessing its credibility, must be respected. 
       
      73 I am not persuaded, after an independent review of the evidence earlier outlined, that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt in the case of Sara. It is accordingly my conclusion that, while his conviction should be quashed for the reasons raised in relation to the first ground of appeal, a new trial should be ordered. 
       
      74 The position in relation to Hunter is somewhat more complicated in that, on the Crown case, this appellant was not involved in the argument between the victim and Sara, either inside or outside the hotel, or in knocking the wallet from the hand of the victim, or in the initial blow to his head. Moreover, the victim conceded in cross examination that he did not know who had struck him while he was lying on the ground. The only evidence of physical contact came from the appellant himself so far as he acknowledged dragging the victim across the road, and away from Sara, by his foot, before ‘chasing him off’. There was no evidence that he picked up the wallet, or that he subsequently shared in its contents. Nor was there any evidence of preconcert.  
       
      75 The Crown case against him, when properly viewed, depends upon the proposition that he acted in concert with Sara in the robbery and physical assault of the victim, and in that capacity either provided actual assistance, or was ready to provide assistance as required. It would not be enough to make out the offence charged (as distinct from some other offence) if, not being party to any such joint criminal enterprise, he was present at the early stages of the incident as a passive observer; or if after the assault and taking of the wallet by Sara, he intervened and assaulted the victim, or even if he received a share of the money known to have been stolen from the victim by Sara. Conduct of this kind, depending on the circumstances, might have given rise to offences of common assault, harbouring, or goods in custody, but these were not the charges preferred, nor was any statutory alternative left to the jury. 
       
      76 It is true that elaborate pre-arrangement is not an essential element for a joint criminal enterprise, since such an enterprise may arise spontaneously: see  
      Lawson 
       (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 16 March 1988 unreported) where Gleeson CJ said, at 11: 
       
       “… it is not necessary that there be any kind of elaborate pre-arrangement. If a number of people together set upon a person in the street and join in punching and kicking him, then their conduct bespeaks concert on their part.” 
       
      However, what is necessary is that there be concert in relation to the offence charged, not in relation to some other offence. Unless the evidence supported the rational inference that by his conduct, Hunter acted in concert with Sara in the robbery and assault of the victim, then he was entitled to an acquittal. 
       
      77 While it is the case that the victim remained of the view when giving evidence, that Hunter had struck him from behind before he fell to the ground, he had in his statement to the police made no mention of Hunter striking him before that occurred. The account that he gave was to the effect: 
       
       “This bloke Torres then struck me in the right side of the fact with a closed right fist and I fell to the ground. In the cover up on the ground, this bloke Torres then kept punching me in the head area whilst I was covering up on the ground. As Torres was bashing his mate was standing right next to him. This bloke also punched me once while I was on the ground.” 
       
      78 In cross examination, after being taken to this statement and asserting that he had omitted to mention the blow from behind while he was standing, he gave the following evidence: 
       
       “Q. I’m asking you what happened, and you said with no equivocation that it was whilst you were on the ground that Hunter hit you. Not from behind when you’re standing up? A. When I was standing I was hit from behind --- 
       
       Q. By someone you don’t know who? A. Mr. Hunter because I didn’t see anyone else and when I got up there was only them two. 
       
       Q. But see in here in this statement you say it happened on the ground? A. I hit the ground. 
       
       Q. And you’ve already - you said not only that you were punched on the ground, but you were punched by Mr Hunter and then in this court today you have admitted that you could not have seen who punched you on the ground because you were covering up? A. I gathered that I was punched once by Mr. Hunter and once by Mr Torres --  
       
       Q. See your - 
       
       CROWN PROSECUTOR: Please let him finish. 
       
       HIS HONOUR; Let him finish please …. 
       
       Q: Yes? A. Because they was both swearing at me while I was on the road. And they were right next to me, there was no-one else.  
       
       Q. See the fact of the matter is Mr Forbes you do not know if Mr Hunter hit you at all? A. Not exactly no.” 
       
      79 Earlier, there was the following exchange: 
       
       “Q. And he (Sara) then claimed you in a sort of a wrestle and there was a bit of a scuffle between youse, during which you fell to the ground? A. No then Mr Hunter knocked me from behind and I hit the ground. 
       
       Q. Are you sure that Mr Hunter punched you, well firstly are you sure that Mr Hunter punched you at all? A. He could’ve hit me with anything. 
       
       Q. Well he hit you at all, are you sure he did? A. Cause I didn’t - cause I didn’t see it. 
       
       Q. You didn’t see it. Well how ca n you be sure it was him? A. Cause when I got up the two of them were together, there was no-one else around and they – 
       
       Q. So you put two and two together and think it was him, that’s about the best you can do isn’t it? A. Yes.” 
       
      80 Given this equivocation, and his reference to a ‘sixth sense’ that Hunter was behind him, and his concession that he had no recollection of seeing Hunter approaching him, there must remain a reasonable doubt as to the moment this appellant intervened, and whether he did any more than drag the victim away from Sara, in order to end the incident, as he deposed. 
       
      81 In these circumstances, upon the whole of the evidence, I am of the view that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of Hunter in respect of the offence charged, and that as a consequence, in his case, a verdict of acquittal ought to be entered. For the reasons discussed by Sperling J, in  
      Francipone 
       (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, 23 December 1988 at 28 to 34), I do not consider it appropriate to order a new trial that would permit the Crown to mount a different case, on the same evidence, in respect of the offence either of assault, or of goods in custody, or of harbouring, that may have been otherwise available to it.  
       
      82 In the light of my conclusion, it is inappropriate to deal with the application by Sara for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed. 
       
      83 The orders I would accordingly propose are as follows: 
       
      (1) In the case of the appellant Hunter, appeal allowed, conviction and sentence quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered; 
       
      (2) In the case of the appellant Sara, appeal allowed, conviction and sentence quashed, and a  
      new trial ordered. 
       
      84  
      DUNFORD J:  
      I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

     JUDGMENT 
    1 McINERNEY J: I agree with Barr J.IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEALNo 60257 of 1998 McINERNEY J HULME J BARR J Friday, 12 March 1999. 
     
     REGINA -v- Stephen Arthur LEASK 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    2 HULME J: Stephen Arthur Leask appeals against his conviction, on 20 January 1998, on each of 42 counts alleging an offence against Section 31(1) of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth). (The Act has since been renamed as The Financial Transaction Reports Act.) On 17 April 1998 the Appellant was fined $765 on the first count and $835 on each other count.3 To a significant extent the determination of the issues raised in the appeal depends on the proper construction of sub-section 31(1). The sub-section provides:-  31(1) A person commits an offence against this section if:- (a) the person is a party to 2 or more non-reportable cash transactions; and (b) having regard to: (i) the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, including, without limiting the generality of this, all or any of the following: (A) the value of the currency involved in each transaction; (B) the aggregated value of the transactions; (C) the period of time over which the transactions took place; (D) the interval of time between any of the transactions; (E) the locations at which the transactions took place; and (ii) any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted; it would be reasonable to conclude that the person conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that: (iii) would not give rise to a significant cash transaction; or (iv) would give rise to exempt cash transactions.4 “Non-reportable cash transaction” and a number of other terms are defined in Section 3. So far as is relevant these definitions are:-  “Cash dealer” means:- (a) a financial institution; (b) … “Financial institution” means: (a) a bank; (b) … “Non reportable cash transaction” means a cash transaction: (a) to which a cash dealer is a party; and (b) that is not a significant cash transaction or is an exempt cash transaction. “Significant cash transaction” means a cash transaction involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value.Section 3 contains the usual reservation “unless the contrary intention appears”.5 It is unnecessary to refer to those provisions of the Act which define or describe an “exempt cash transaction”. It is clear that the transactions with which the Appellant was concerned did not fall within this description. It may however be noted that, by s4, the expressed objects of the Act are to facilitate the administration and enforcement of taxation and other laws of the Commonwealth and other provisions of the Act are directed to ensuring that significant cash transactions are reported by banks and other cash dealers to an officer of the Australian government. 6 The constitutional validity of s31(1) was challenged by the appellant but upheld in Leask v Commonwealth of Australia (1996) 187 CLR 579. In the course of their reasons for the decision made in that case the judges of the High Court made a number of observations relevant to the operation of the sub-section but because these were not definitive, it is necessary to make some observations of my own. 7 On its face, sub-section 31(1) is expressed in restrictive terms. It states that a person commits an offence if two conditions are satisfied. Paragraph (a) stipulates that a person be a party to two or more “non-reportable cash transactions”. When regard is had to the further definition of the expressions used in the definition of “non-reportable cash transaction” the latter expression may be seen to mean:- “A cash transaction: (a) to which a cash dealer (a term which includes a bank) is a party; and (b) that is not a significant cash transaction (i.e. a cash transaction involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value) or is an exempt cash transaction.”8 Whether the requirements of the paragraph are met is a simple factual inquiry although, as the inquiry arises in the context of the criminal law, implicit in it is whether the actions of an accused were voluntary, and whether “he knew of the facts which gave the transactions the character of ‘non-reportable cash transactions’”. In Leask v Commonwealth of Australia (at 592), this was the view of Brennan CJ who took the view that this was the extent of mens rea required.9 In R v Dinh Hue Tran (1998) 38 ATR 19, Doyle CJ, with whose reasons Cox and Duggan JJ agreed, elaborated on this formulation of the issues which arise under sub-section 31(1), saying:- “In my opinion proof of guilt of an offence against Section 31(1) requires, at the least, stating that the Section required, at the least, that it be proved:-· That the accused person knew that he or she was a party to a transaction that involved the physical transfer of currency;· That the accused person was aware of the facts that made another party to the transaction a cash dealer for the purposes of the Act; · That the accused person knew that the amount of currency involved in each transaction had a value of less than $10,000. To require proof of that much is to require proof of knowledge of the facts that make the transactions “non-reportable cash transactions”.”10 However, disagreeing with Brennan CJ, Doyle CJ, went further, expressing the view that there is another aspect of the mental element that must be proved, viz-· that the accused person knew that a transaction involving currency of $10,000 or more in value must, by law, be reported to a government agency, and that a transaction involving currency of less than $10,000 in value did not have to be reported to a government agency.11 His Honour went on to say that he considered guilt would be established only if the accused person has knowledge of the facts that attracted the operation of s 31(1)(a) and knowledge of the circumstances that attended its occurrence and made it criminal. He continued:- “ … I would expect it to be necessary to prove the further element that the accused person is aware of the difference between a reportable transactions and a non-reportable transaction. … For these reasons, I am inclined to the view that Parliament intended to punish a person only if that person was aware of the difference between an SCT (a significant cash transaction) and a non-reportable cash transaction.”12 These remarks were made during the course of His Honour’s deliberations on sub-paragraph (a) and were made subject to his consideration of sub-paragraph (b). However there was nothing in that later consideration to qualify the contents of the passages I have quoted.13 In substantial measure, His Honour’s views were influenced by what he saw as the rationale in sub-section 31(1) and the importance to that rationale of conscious wrongdoing on the part of an offender. With respect, it seems to me firstly that, on its proper construction, sub-paragraph (b) adequately accommodates these matters and, secondly, even if it does not, there is no justification for importing into sub-paragraph (a) the additional element which found favour with His Honour.14 That element, properly analysed, is knowledge of the law as it is to be found in some portions of the statute. Yet as His Honour recognised in another portion of his reasons:- “It is not usually necessary to prove that a person is aware of the illegality of an act before an offence is committed. It usually suffices to prove knowledge of the circumstances which render the relevant event criminal, as distinct from proof of knowledge of the illegality of the act: He Kaw Teh at CLR 572 Brennan J, Leask at CLR 598 … Dawson J.”15 In He Kaw Teh v R (1984-5) 157 CLR 523, the appellant had been charged under Section 233B(1) of the Customs Act which provides, inter alia, that “any person who imports into Australia any prohibited imports to which this section applies shall be guilty of an offence”. By Section 233B(2) the prohibited imports to which the section applies are prohibited imports that are narcotic goods. There was no suggestion that the appellant had to know what items were prohibited imports or that these included narcotics. For present purposes, what he had to know was that the goods he did import were narcotics - see per Gibbs CJ (with whose reasons Mason J agreed) at p 537, Brennan J at pp 568-572 and 584. Adapting the words of Brennan CJ which I have quoted above, what the appellant in that case had to know were, “the facts which gave the transactions the character of (prohibited imports)”.16 The expression “non-reportable cash transaction” clearly includes a deposit into a bank account of cash in an amount of less than $10,000. So far as is relevant here, the operation of paragraph (a) is no different than if it had read, “The person is a party to 2 or more cash deposits, each of not less than $10,000, into a bank” and had that formulation been used, it would be impossible to contend that the knowledge of which Doyle J spoke would be required. The fact that the Act chooses to impose its prohibition on such transactions by reference to the expression “non-reportable cash transactions” and definitions which serve to bring transactions of the nature indicated within the expression “non-reportable cash transactions” does not in my view justify the importation of the further element to which Doyle CJ referred.17 I turn to paragraph (b). It addresses three matters. One is purpose. In that the paragraph directs attention to the purpose of the person who conducted the transactions referred to, it seems to me that the paragraph requires that consideration be paid to the state of mind of any person accused. The requirement that regard be had to explanation made by that person reinforces this view and leads me to the conclusion that a tribunal faced with the determination of a charge under the section is required to consider whether the particular accused had the sole or dominant purpose referred to. With respect, that requirement makes it difficult to accept that the mental state of an alleged offender is of the limited relevance to which Brennan J referred in Leask (at 592). I would understand Dawson J (at 596-8) and Toohey J (at 611) and by their agreement (at 616-7) Gaudron, McHugh JJ to hold the view I have expressed in this paragraph.18 In determining what purpose it is of which the provision speaks one is again entitled, indeed required, to substitute for the defined expression used, its defined meaning. (There is nothing to suggest a contrary intention appears in s 31(1).) Thus, so far as is presently relevant, the purpose referred to is “of ensuring or attempting to ensure, that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that: (iii) would not give rise to a cash transaction involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value”.This, it seems to me is the extent of the purpose which the Crown must show for the “purpose” element of sub-section 31(1) to be established. 19 Putting this in the context of the balance of the sub-section, a person who is a party to two or more cash transactions with, e.g. a bank, being transactions involving less than $10,000, and the manner and form of those transactions and any explanation given makes it reasonable to conclude that the person conducted the transactions the way he or she did for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the currency involved in them was transferred in amounts of less than $10,000 is guilty of an offence.20 No more than there was in the case of paragraph (a) does there seem to me to be any occasion to regard knowledge of the law, even limited to knowledge of the concepts used in the Act, by an accused as something required to be proved in the course of the determination of a charge under the sub-section. There is nothing in the terms of the sub-section requiring that a person know what a “significant cash transaction” is.21 However in R v Dinh Hue Tran (at p 25) Doyle CJ said:- “Like Dawson J in Leask, I have come to the conclusion that sub-para (b) imposes a requirement to prove;· that the accused person knew that a transaction involving the transfer of currency of $10,000 or more in value must be reported to a government agency and that a transaction involving the transfer of currency of less than $10,000 in value need not be reported to a government agency;· that it is reasonable to conclude that the accused person in fact had the sole or dominant purpose referred to in sub-para (b). Approaching sub-para (b) in the fashion accommodates the requirement to prove an awareness of the difference between a SCT and a non-reportable cash transaction, and the presence of sub-para (b), by treating sub-para (b) as dealing with proof of an actual or subjective intention rather than an objective quality of the transactions (sic). Although I have separated the elements of knowledge and purpose, it seems to me that an element of knowledge is necessarily implicit in proof of the identified purpose. The purpose that has to be proved need not be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The question for the jury is simply whether it is reasonable to conclude that, in fact, the accused person had the identified sole or dominant purpose. On the other hand, the jury must find it reasonable to conclude that the accused person in fact had the identified purpose.”22 With respect, it does not seem to me that Dawson J went as far as the passage attributed to him. It seems to me that all His Honour said in this regard was :- “The Commonwealth submitted that s31(1) does not create an offence of absolute or strict liability. It pointed to the fact that the circumstances to which regard must be had in reaching the required conclusion include “any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted” (s31(1)(b)(ii)). Moreover, the Commonwealth submitted, the required conclusion is that the person concerned conducted the transactions for a specified purpose, namely, the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring that the transactions would not give rise to a significant cash transaction or would give rise to exempt cash transactions. Upon this basis the Commonwealth argument was that the sub-section requires proof that the person charged with an offence knew of the nature of a significant cash transaction or of exempt cash transactions and intended by structuring his or her transactions in the manner or form alleged to ensure that they would not give rise to a significant cash transaction or exempt cash transactions. The only effect of the words “it would be reasonable to conclude” is, the Commonwealth contended, to lower the standard of proof from that of beyond reasonable doubt to that of a reasonable conclusion. There is no doubt that the wording of s31(1) leaves it far from clear whether intention, or mens rea (65), is an ingredient of the offence which it creates and, if so, the nature of the intention required. In that situation, it is my view that the Commonwealth submission should be accepted.”23 It is not clear whether this acceptance of the Commonwealth submission extended to all of the submissions referred to or only that the effect of the words “it would be reasonable to conclude” was to lower the standard of proof. Furthermore, it is a long step from acceptance of the proposition that “the sub-section requires proof that the person charged with an offence knew of the nature of a significant cash transaction” to a conclusion that the person knew when reporting of transactions was required. A little after the passage I have quoted, Dawson J said that “mens rea does not require knowledge of the illegality of the act”.24 But be that as it may, what Dawson J said was concurred in by only one other judge and, in my view, the effect of the provision in the circumstances of this case is as I have stated it in paragraphs 17 and 18 above.25 A second topic which paragraph (b) addresses is the standard of proof by which the question of whether an accused had the purpose specified is to be judged. 26 Traditionally the criminal law, even those parts of it which are contained in legislation, requires that any relevant purpose or state of mind be proved beyond reasonable doubt. However, Section 31(1)(b) poses the question whether “it would be reasonable to conclude…” In Leask v The Commonwealth (at 597), Dawson J, with whose reasons on this topic McHugh J agreed, said that the effect of the words is to lower the standard of proof from that of beyond reasonable doubt to that of a reasonable conclusion. At p 611 Toohey J (with whose reasons on this topic Gaudron J agreed) made remarks to similar effect. Brennan CJ (at 592) took a different view and Gummow and Kirby JJ did not commit themselves. 27 In R v Dinh Hue Tran (at 26-7) the Supreme Court of South Australia reached a similar conclusion to that proposed by Dawson J. I share that view.28 Paragraph (b) also says something concerning the matters to which attention is to be paid in the determination of whether the purpose exists. Sub-section 31(1) is curiously expressed. In its terms, the formulation:- “A person commits an offence against this section if: (a)…, and (b) having regard to: (i) the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, including, without limiting the generality of this, all or any of the following: … (A) … and (ii) any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted; it would be reasonable to conclude …”seems to me to indicate that the judgment on whether “it would be reasonable to conclude” is to be made by reference to only the matters specified. This view is reinforced by the fact that the draftsman has specifically provided that the matters listed as (A) to (E) are not to limit the generality of the reference “the manner and form in which the transfers were conducted” but there is nothing to indicate that that manner and form and any explanation relating to it were not to limit the matters from which the purpose of the person conducting the transfers could be inferred.29 Also tending to reinforce that view is the fact that the matters specifically referred to in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) are so obviously relevant that, absent some restriction on the matters to which regard might be had in the drawing of any conclusion as to the purpose of any person charged with an offence under the section, consideration would be had to them by a tribunal charged with the task of drawing that conclusion. Thus it is difficult to regard the mention of these matters as directed either to widening the field of those to which consideration should be given or ensuring that such matters were not overlooked. 30 If the view be taken that the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (b) are a non-exhaustive statement of the matters to which regard may be had and any other matter relevant to the issue of purpose can be taken into account, the specification of those matters is entirely otiose and so much waste paper. If it had been intended simply to provide that any person who participated in two or more non-reportable transfers of currency with “the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that no significant cash transaction or exempt cash transaction would occur, (or no report in relation to the currency involved in the transfers would be made)” it would have been easy to say so and, if desired, to stipulate that the existence of the purpose was to be determined on the balance of probabilities or whatever other standard of proof was required. Instead a far more detailed and apparently restrictive form of words has been used.31 Furthermore, in its use of the phrase “it would be reasonable to conclude” Parliament has chosen a criteria of guilt different from those traditionally used in the criminal law, “beyond reasonable doubt” and, less commonly, “on the balance of probabilities”. Should one not proceed on the basis that what has been said is definitive?32 By s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), the courts are constrained to prefer a construction of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) which will promote the purpose or object underlying the Act. Clearly one of the objects of the Act is to have transactions involving significant amounts of cash reported. But another may be to have guilt determined more simply - by a test lower than usual but in light of a limited range of circumstances.33 On the other hand, there are difficulties in concluding that the matters stated are exhaustive. The sub-section does not say in terms that regard may be had to only the matters referred to in it. What if an explanation given was false and could be proved to be? Would a tribunal be precluded from considering evidence to that effect? And would that evidence, if admitted, on the issue of falsity of the explanation be available for all purposes, or would the tribunal be required to make its judgment by reference to only the evidence of the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted and a (rejected) explanation?34 Before I proceed further in respect of this question, it is appropriate to direct attention to the course of the trial and the grounds of appeal. At trial the Crown undertook the obligation of proving, and the matter was put to the jury on the basis that, in respect of each charge, the Crown had to establish three matters:- (i) that the accused was a party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions; (ii) that the accused knew that the bank had an obligation to report significant cash transactions involving the transfer of $10,000 or more; and (iii) that having regard to the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted it would be reasonable to conclude that the accused conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the cash involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction.35 The first element was not in dispute, the Appellant making a number of admissions. As to the second, the jury were directed that they could take into account “not only the transactions that are the subject of the charge … but also the transactions that are the subject of all the other charges”. As to the third, the jury was initially instructed that:- “in considering this element you can have regard to the two of more non-reportable cash transactions that are the subject of the particular charge you are considering. You cannot have regard for the purposes of this element to any of the other transactions which are the subject of any of the other charges”36 However later in his summing up the trial judge said:- “The Crown contends in respect of the third element of each charge that if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the second element, that is that the accused knew of the bank’s obligation to report cash transactions of $10,000 or more, when you have regard to the manner and form of the transactions which are the subject of the particular charge you are considering, you will be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it would be reasonable to conclude that the accused carried out the transactions in that way for the sole or dominant purpose of avoiding making a significant cash transactions… Mr Byrne (counsel for the Appellant) contends that if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew of the bank’s obligations to report, that is, that you are satisfied the Crown had proved the second element of the charge, you would nevertheless still have a reasonable doubt about the third element, based on the accused’s explanation that he carried out the transactions in the way he did for reasons of security and because the accused had no logical reason to avoid the banks’ reporting obligation… The Crown on the other hand contends that if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had knowledge of the bank’s reporting obligation then you will have no difficulty once you consider the way the accused carried out the transactions which are the subject of each charge, that the third element has been established beyond reasonable doubt.”37 It may be that the Crown sought only to prove the second of their matters as an aid to proof of the third but for present purposes, this is immaterial. The necessity for the Crown to prove the second matter seems to have been at least conceded by counsel for the Appellant, if indeed, it was contended for by him. 38 Three grounds of appeal were argued before this Court:- (1) His Honour the learned trial judge erred in permitting evidence on one count to be used as evidence in the other counts. (2) His Honour the learned trial judge erred in not directing the jury at the conclusion of the Crown case to find the Applicant not guilty on all counts on the indictment. (3) His Honour the learned trial judge erred in his direction to the jury regarding the approach they should take if they were to find that some other conclusion apart from that specified in the legislation establishing the offences, was reasonably open on the evidence.It was also submitted that His Honour erred in leaving it open to the jury to decide whether the third element existed on an objective basis rather than considering the sole or dominant purpose of the Appellant himself. A fourth ground of appeal, that the recording of a conviction and the decision to impose a financial penalty was excessive, was not pursued. Ground 139 At the trial the objection to the use of the evidence of transactions the subject of one count on other counts seems largely, and perhaps exclusively, to have been based on the terms of ss 97, 98 and particularly s101(2) of the Evidence Act which provides:-  “101(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.”40 However in this Court, the point was taken that, in respect of any charge, the terms of s 31(1) limited the material to which regard in could be had to that relating to the transactions the subject of that charge. Given that during the trial there was objection to the use of the evidence, rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules does not preclude the Appellant relying on the argument. The Crown did not suggest any other reason why the Appellant could take the point and the Court must determine it.41 It will be apparent from what I have said above that I regard the second of the matters which the jury were asked to consider as not an essential element in proof of the commission of an offence under s 31(1) although obviously, if a tribunal faced with deciding whether an offence under s 31(1) has been committed, comes to a conclusion that an accused was aware of that matter or of the provisions of the Act imposing the obligation, and is entitled to have regard to those facts, the Crown’s chances of satisfying that tribunal of the existence of purpose referred to in paragraph (b) are increased. 42 I have set out above the factors which seem to me to argue for and against the proposition that it is only matters falling within sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (b) to which regard may be had. Although not with any great confidence, the conclusion at which I have arrived is that on balance these factors lead to the conclusion that the matters set forth in the sub-paragraphs should be regarded as, with one possible exception, definitive. That way, some operation is given to the terms of those sub-paragraphs. (The exception to which I refer is evidence that any explanation offered is false. It is difficult to believe that such evidence is excluded but I do not need to decide this issue. I acknowledge that the recognition of any exception provides grounds for thinking that the conclusion at which I have arrived is wrong but the factors which support it seem to me the more weighty.)43 The extracts I have set out above from the summing up to the jury indicate that, although not directly, the jury had been invited to take into account indirectly on any charge the evidence of transactions not the subject of that charge. This should not have occurred and, subject to the proviso to Section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act, the appeal should be allowed.44 Before turning to the topic of the proviso, it may be convenient to record my views on some of the other matters which were argued.45 It was submitted that in relation to any individual count, the evidence on the other counts was either “tendency evidence” within Section 97 of the Evidence Act or “coincidence evidence” within Section 98 and that the terms of Section 101(2) precluded its use.46 So far as is relevant Sections 95, 97, 98 and 101 provide:- “95(1) Evidence that under this Part is not admissible to prove a particular matter must not be used to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose. (2) Evidence that under this Part cannot be used against a party to prove a particular matter must not be used against the party to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose. 97(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if: (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence; or (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, has significant probative value. 98(1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if: (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence; or (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 101(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.”There was no issue before this Court arising out of the terms of paragraphs (a) or (b) of Sections 97 and 98.47 It is apparent from the terms of Section 95 that evidence, the effect of which is to show a tendency or coincidence, is not inadmissible merely because it fails to comply with the requirements of Sections 97, 98 and 101(2). It merely may not be used in proof of the particular matters to which Sections 97 and 98 refer. In this case the evidence of the totality of the Appellant’s actions may most accurately be described as evidence which showed he had a particular state of mind rather than as evidence which showed he had a tendency to have a particular state of mind and I would not regard it as tendency evidence at all. 48 On the other hand the evidence of the totality of the transactions did constitute coincidence evidence. Its relevance was that because of the improbability of over 100 transactions just under $10,000 occurring coincidentally the Appellant had a particular state of mind. That state of mind extended at least to a recognition of some importance in keeping deposits of cash under about $10,000. 49 Thus it was necessary that the requirements of Section 101(2) be satisfied. The trail judge took the view that they were and, observing that the test set forth in Section 101(2) was the same test as that enunciated in Pfennig v R (1995) 182 CLR 461 - citing R v AH (unreported, CCA, 27 November 1997) in support of that proposition - went on to record that he was satisfied that there was no rational view of the evidence other than that the Appellant knew of the bank’s obligation to report cash transactions of $10,000 or more.50 If that is the test I am unable to agree. I accept that the fact that banks had an obligation to report deposits of not less than $10,000 makes available the further inference that the Appellant knew of the obligation to report and structured his deposits accordingly but I do not see that as the only rational one. Other inferences open seem to me to include that the Appellant might have thought all, or all large transactions were monitored (without any report by a bank); he may have thought additional documentation was required of him.51 I accept that there is a deal of authority that the test posed by s 101(2) is as stated by the trail judge. In Pfennig v R (1994-5) 182 CLR at 461 at 481 et seq. Mason CJ and Deane and Dawson JJ referred to the fact that in Hoch v R (1988) 165 CLR 292 at 294 it had been stated that the basis for the admissibility of similar fact evidence lay in its possessing a particular probative value or cogency such that, if accepted, it bore no reasonable explanation other than the inculpation of the Appellant in the offence charged and that those principles correctly stated the law with respect to the admissibility of similar fact evidence. A little later these judges said that the statement that propensity evidence would be admissible only if its probative value exceeds its prejudicial effect was of little assistance unless it was understood that such evidence is circumstantial and as such was admissible only if there was no reasonable view of it consistent with innocence. Having regard to the totality of their Honours’ discussion at pages 481-485 I would understand them to be saying the same approach applied to similar fact evidence also.52 In Lock (1977) A Crim R 356 at 361 Hunt CJ at CL said that the test posed by s 101(2) was the exercise discussed in Pfennig and “it was said in that case that … the trial judge must apply the same test as the jury does in dealing with circumstantial evidence and ask whether there is available a rational (or reasonable) view of the similar fact evidence which is consistent with the innocence of the accused; it is only if there is no such view available that a conclusion can safely be reached that the probative force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.” Without discussing the matter, this Court in Foley v R (unreported, CCA, 5 June 1997) accepted this test. It was also accepted by this Court in R v AH.53 However, it is the text, and not a gloss on the text, of an Act of Parliament to which regard must primarily be had - Kavanagh v The Commonwealth (1959-60) 103 CLR 547 at 578, Ogden Industries Pty Ltd v Lucas (1970 ) AC 113 at 127. Consistently with that proposition it does not seem to me that there should be substituted for the test set out in the clear words of s 101(2) of the Evidence Act, a test expressed quite differently. Pfennig v R was not a decision under the Evidence Act. It was handed down on 17 February 1995, after the Evidence Act (1995) (Cth) had passed through both Houses of the Federal Parliament although it must be recognised that the decision did precede the Evidence Act (NSW), the Bill for which was introduced into Parliament on 24 May 1995, passed on 30 May, and received the Royal Assent on 19 June 1995. However, so far as is presently relevant, both Acts are in the same terms. It may be noted that the ALRC Report 26 into Evidence (volume 2, page 226, text and note 76) describes the approach subsequently adopted in Pfennig as “extreme” although it is also appropriate to record that s 101(2) lays down a test different from those suggested in either ALRC 26 or the later report of the same topic, ALRC 38.54 There is one further matter I would add though, given the extent of discussion of the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence in Pfennig and in the numerous authorities referred to in that case, I do so with great hesitation. The principal that a conviction on circumstantial evidence is only warranted if that evidence permits of no rational explanation consistent with innocence - see e.g Chamberlain v R (No 2) (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 536, 570, 599 - is but a particular application of the rule that guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt - Knight v R (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 502. There is something strange in applying it universally to the admissibility of one type of evidence unless, in the circumstances of a particular case, that evidence is essential to conviction - c.f. Chamberlain v R (No 2) 537, 599, 626.55 Unconstrained by the above authorities I would incline to the view that there is nothing in the Evidence Act which precluded the evidence on all counts being used in proof of the Appellant’s state of knowledge at the time of his commission of the acts relevant to one count. Fortunately I am able to base my decision on other matters.56 Before I leave this part of my Reasons, there is one further matter arising on the terms of s 31(1) to which I should advert. The question in paragraph (b) is whether it would be reasonable to conclude that the person conducted “the transactions” in the manner and form they took for the purpose specified. It would seem to me that “the transactions” are those referred to in paragraph (a), that is all of them. However it is appropriate to record that whether this is the correct approach to the interpretation of the sub-section was not argued, nor was it suggested that of the transactions referred to in a count, some might have been conducted with the purpose referred to in the sub-section and some not.Ground 257 The application for a verdict by direction was stated to be based on the proposition that there was no evidence of knowledge by the Appellant of the terms of the legislation and “in particular, that he knew that by depositing cash amounts of less than $10,000 he would avoid the requirements of the Cash Transactions Reporting Act”.58 Given my view that, despite the Crown’s concession at the trial, the Crown carried no obligation to establish such knowledge, any failure to do so did not entitle the Appellant to the direction he sought. This ground fails.Ground 359 In my consideration of the proper construction and operation of s 31(1) above, I have expressed my views on a number of matters relevant to the determination of the third ground of appeal and the further submission which I have detailed above. Subject to those comments, I agree with the reasons of Barr J in dealing with the third ground and that further submission.THE PROVISO TO SECTION 6 OF THE CRIMINAL APPEAL ACT60 The trial of the Appellant miscarried principally because in respect of each count, at the deliberate instigation of the Crown, the jury was allowed to take into account evidence which was not only inadmissible but, relative to the evidence which was admissible on the issue of purpose, extremely strong. Those remarks are of less weight in the case of counts where more than two transactions alleged but these were in a significant minority. 61 It should also be borne in mind that the selection of the number of transactions to be included in any one count also lay largely within the control of the Crown. If a limited number were insufficient to enable the purpose contended for to be demonstrated, it was open to the Crown to, in effect, combine a number of counts. As it was, the Crown seems to have almost minimised the number of transactions included in each count and maximised the number of counts.62 Having had to struggle with it myself, I can appreciate that a major cause of the Crown prosecutor taking the stance he did was the terms of the legislation with which he had to deal but, given the authorship of that legislation, the claim by the Appellant that the proviso should not be applied is not lessened.63 However it seems to me that before any concluded view on the application of the proviso is reached, further attention should be given to the admissible evidence on each count. The counts were all in virtually identical terms apart from their statement of the time of the offences alleged and the number of non-reportable cash transactions referred to. Thirty of the counts alleged 2 non-reportable cash transactions, 1 alleged 3, 7 alleged 4 and 4 alleged 6 such transactions. It is convenient to set out by way of example the first count and parts of the second, eighteenth and twenty-fourth counts. “1. For that he between about 2 January 1991 and 5 January 1991 at Pennant Hills and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did commit an offence against section 31 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 in that he was a party to four non-reportable cash transactions, to wit, the cash purchase of two bank cheques each for an amount of $9,200 each of which was subsequently deposited with the amount of $9,800 in cash to the account of Central Distributors held with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation, and having regard to the manner and form in which the said transactions were conducted it is reasonable to conclude that he conducted the transactions in the manner for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in such a manner and form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction. 2. Further for that he on 24 January 1991 at Pennant Hills in the State of New South Wales did commit an offence against section 31 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 in that he was a party to two non-reportable cash transactions, to wit, the cash purchase of one bank cheque for the amount of $9,400 which was subsequently deposited with an amount of $9,600 in cash to the account of Central Distributors held with …  18. Further for that he on or about 2 April 1991 at Pennant Hills and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did commit an offence against section 31 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 in that he was a party to two non-reportable cash transactions, to wit, the separate cash deposits of $9,200 and $9,000 to the account of Central Distributors held with the Australian and New Zealand Banking Corporation, and having regard to the manner and form in which the said transactions were conducted it is reasonable to conclude that he conducted the transactions for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in such a manner and form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction. 24. Further for that he on about 19 April 1991 at Lindfield and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did commit an offence against section 31 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 in that he was a party to six non-reportable cash transactions, to wit, the cash purchase of three bank cheques each for the amount of $8,900 each of which was subsequently deposited with separate cash amounts $9,400, $9,400 and $9,600 respectively to the account of Central Distributors held with …”64 As I have said the Appellant made a number of formal admissions. Those relating to the these four counts, which again I use by way of example, and certain matters associated with the Central Distributors Account were in the following terms:- “1.1 On 3 January 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask purchased for cash at the 267 Old Northern Road Castle Hill branch of the Commonwealth bank a bank cheque no 029669 for $9,200 payable to Central Distributors.  1.2 On 3 January 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask purchased for cash at the 274 Pennant Hills Road Thornleigh branch of the Commonwealth Bank a bank cheque No 000438 for $9,200 payable to Central Distributors. 1.3 On 4 January 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask deposited at the Turner Road Berowra Heights Branch of the ANZ Bank $9,800 cash and a Commonwealth Bank bank cheque No 029669 for the amount of $9,200 payable to Central Distributors for credit to ANZ account no 4101 34087. 1.4 On 4 January 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask deposited at the 3 Hillcrest Road Pennant Hills branch of ANZ $9,800 in cash and Commonwealth Bank cheque number 009438 for the amount of $9,200 payable to Central Distributors for credit to ANZ account number 4101 34087. 2.1 On 24 January 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask purchased for cash at the 108 Yarra Road Pennant Hills branch of the Commonwealth Bank a Commonwealth Bank bank cheque no 033396 for the amount of $9,400 payable to Central Distributors. 2.2 On 24 January 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask deposited at 3 Hillcrest Road Pennant Hills branch of the ANZ Bank $9,600 cash and a Commonwealth Bank bank cheque no 0033396 for the amount of $9,400 payable to Central Distributors for credit to ANZ account no 4101 34087. 18.1 On 2 April 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask deposited at the 7 Campbell Street Blacktown branch of the ANZ Bank $9,000 cash for credit to ANZ account no 4101 34087. 18.2 On 2 April 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask deposited at the 3 Hillcrest Road Pennant Hills branch of the ANZ Bank $9,200 cash for credit to ANZ account no 4101 34087. 24.1 On 19 April 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask purchased for cash at the 330 Pacific Highway Lindfield branch of the Commonwealth Bank a bank cheque no 019310 for the amount of $8,900 payable to Central Distributors. 24.2 On 19 April 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask deposited at the 306 Pacific Highway Lindfield branch of the ANZ bank $9,400 in cash and a Commonwealth Bank bank cheque no 019310 for the amount of $8,900 payable to Central Distributors for credit to ANZ bank account no 4101 34087. 24.3 On 19 April 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask purchased for cash at the 118 Edinburgh Road Castlecrag branch of the Commonwealth Bank a bank cheque no 011731 for the amount of $8,900 payable to Central Distributors. 24.4 On 19 April 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask deposited at the 147 Victoria Ave North Willoughby branch of the ANZ bank $9,400 in cash and a Commonwealth Bank bank cheque no 011731 for the amount of $8,900 payable to Central Distributors for credit to ANZ bank account no 4101 34087. 24.5 On 19 April 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask purchased for cash at the 466 Victoria Ave Chatswood branch of the State Bank of NSW a bank cheque no 181014 for the amount of $8,900 payable to Central Distributors. 24.6 On 19 April 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask deposited at the 8 Railway Street Chatswood branch of the ANZ bank $9,600 in cash and a State Bank of NSW bank cheque no 181014 for the amount of $8,900 payable to Central Distributors for credit to ANZ bank account no 4101 34087. 43. On about 28 November 1989, Stephen Arthur Leask obtained the registration of Central Distributors as a business name in the Northern Territory. 44. On 28 March 1990 Stephen Arthur Leask trading as Central Distributors opened an account no 4101 34087 at ANZ bank at the Todd and Parsons Street Alice Springs. 45. Throughout 1991 Stephen Arthur Leask was the sole signatory on said account no 410134087 capable of affecting withdrawals from it.”65 As is apparent from the foregoing, in some cases only cash was involved, in others there was cash and a bank cheque. Maps tendered by the Crown showed that in some cases the bank branches used on the one day were very close. In others they were some, occasionally many, kilometres apart. There was no evidence as to the time of the day at which the various transactions occurred.66 Other matters given in evidence prior to the close of the Crown case were that the Appellant lived at Berowra Heights, that he was engaged in a business of buying and selling tobacco products and also in selling cane furniture, that people involved in the former business traditionally dealt in large amounts of cash, that persons in possession of large amounts of cash are at risk of having it stolen, that prudence demands that large amounts of cash be banked as soon as possible and that it was undesirable to be known that a person habitually banks a large quantity of cash at one bank (or branch).67 The Appellant made an unsworn statement. It is sufficient to set out extracts from this:- “I’ve been a tobacco retailer for 20 years which constituted handling reasonably large amounts of cash. I’ve always been conscious of security and attempted to bank my money in small amounts to avoid routine (sic). I became vaguely aware of restrictions on banking cash in late 1990 just when the Cash Transactions Reports Act I believe came into force and I had a belief that the point of it was to create some restriction on banking over $10,000… At no time did I - was I aware of these restrictions or these - the need to report the banking. There was no - at any time I was never conscious of trying to avoid any restrictions… I seemed to get into a pattern of using this limit of banking $10,000 in cash. I got into a pattern of making sure I was banking only that amount and quite often I only had that amount, but that’s how I understood the law to be. The reason why I sometimes bought bank cheques instead of going to the bank it was when I acquired the money I might have had the - been near a bank other than an ANZ bank, so that I came across the idea that I could by going in and buying a bank cheque. I could, in fact, bank the money even though it wasn’t my bank by getting rid of the money in that way. Well, for security I had a piece of paper instead of cash and I could at some later stage just put with the cash to an ANZ bank and I seemed to get into the pattern of that over time. … If I could just emphasise I really had no knowledge of that there was some sort of requirement to notify if a transaction was over $10,000.”68 The Appellant provided no other explanation why there were a number of visits to different branches in one day nor why, for example, the first deposit on 4 January included only one of the bank cheques purchased on the previous day.69 The explanation he did give however makes it clear that, considering each count separately, and only the evidence relating to that count, the Appellant offended against s 31(1) on what I regard as its proper construction.70 The appeal should be dismissed.IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 
     
     60257 of 1998 
     McINERNEY J HULME J BARR J Friday, 12 March 1999 
     
     REGINA v Stephen Arthur LEASK 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    71 BARR J: The appellant, Stephen Arthur Leask, appeals against convictions and seeks leave to appeal against sentences entered in the District Court. On 20 January 1998 a jury found him guilty of each of 42 counts with which he had been charged under s 31(1) Cash Transaction Reports Act (now Financial Transaction Reports Act) 1988 (“the Act”). On 17 April 1998 his Honour Judge Keleman of Senior Counsel convicted the appellant on each count, imposed a fine of $765 on the first count and $835 on each other count and allowed the appellant 28 days to pay the fines.72 By s 4, the Act’s principal object is to facilitate the administration and enforcement of taxation laws. A further object is to facilitate the administration and enforcement of laws of the Commonwealth and of the Territories other than taxation laws. By s 7, a cash dealer who is party to a significant cash transaction is obliged to prepare a report of the transaction and send it to the Director of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre within a time limited by the section. By s 3, a cash dealer includes a bank. A significant cash transaction means a cash transaction involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value. Cash transactions which are not significant, and therefore not reportable, are called non-reportable transactions.73 S 31 concerns itself with the arrangement of transactions so as to avoid reporting requirements. It was considered in Leask v Commonwealth of Australia (1996) 187 CLR 579 and held to be a valid law of the Commonwealth. Subs (1) is in the following terms - (1) A person commits an offence against this section if: (a) the person is a party to 2 or more non-reportable cash transactions; and (b) having regard to: (i) the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, including, without limiting the generality of this, all or any of the following: (A) the value of the currency involved in each transaction; (B) the aggregated value of the transactions; (C) the period of time over which the transactions took place; (D) the interval of time between any of the transactions; (E) the locations at which the transactions took place; and (ii) any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted; it would be reasonable to conclude that the person conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that: (iii) would not give rise to a significant cash transaction; or (iv) …74 The facts giving rise to the first count are as follows. The appellant had an account at the Alice Springs branch of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation (“the ANZ Bank”) in the name of himself trading as Central Distributors. On 4 January 1991 he deposited at the Berowra Heights branch of the ANZ Bank $9,800 in cash and a Commonwealth Bank of Australia bank cheque in the sum of $9,200 payable to Central Distributors. The deposits were made for transmission to the credit of the Central Distributors Account at the Alice Springs branch of the ANZ Bank. The Commonwealth Bank cheque had been purchased by the appellant on the day before at the Castle Hill branch of the Commonwealth Bank.75 Also on 4 January 1991 the appellant deposited at the Pennant Hills branch of the ANZ Bank for transmission to the Alice Springs account $9,800 in cash and a Commonwealth Bank bank cheque for $9,200 payable to Central Distributors. That cheque had been purchased the day before from the Thornleigh branch of the Commonwealth Bank.76 The facts were quite similar in four other counts in that there were two deposits of cash, each in an amount a little under $10,000, and two deposits of bank cheques, each also in an amount a little short of $10,000. Two branches of the ANZ Bank were used, and at each branch there was a deposit of one amount of cash and one cheque.77 The facts of the second count were that on 24 January 1991 the appellant deposited at the Pennant Hills branch of the ANZ Bank $9,600 in cash and a bank cheque in the sum of $9,400 that he had obtained earlier on the same day from the Pennant Hills branch of the Commonwealth Bank. The deposits were for transmission to the Alice Springs account.78 There were 21 other counts in which the facts were quite similar, although in one count the amount of cash involved was only $1,800 and in another it was only $5,000. Generally, however, the deposits of cash varied between $7,000 and $9,800.79 Nine of the remaining counts concerned deposits only of cash. On five occasions two deposits were made in a day, always using two different branches of the ANZ Bank. On one occasion three deposits were made in a day, on another occasion four and on two other occasions six deposits in the one day. Except on one occasion, when one of the Chatswood branches of the ANZ Bank was used twice in a day on which six deposits of cash were made, no branch was used more than once on any day for the deposit of cash.80 The deposits were spread over the period from 4 January to 9 July 1991. Four counts concerned deposits made in January, seven concerned February, six concerned March, nine concerned April, eight concerned May, six concerned June and two counts were concerned with deposits made in July 1991. Altogether there were 114 transactions at the ANZ Bank.81 The appellant always purchased his bank cheques from either the Commonwealth Bank, the State Bank or the National Australia Bank.82 His Honour instructed the jury that in each count the Crown had to prove each of the following matters beyond reasonable doubt - 1. that the appellant was a party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions; 2. that he knew that that bank had an obligation to report significant cash transactions; and 3. that having regard to the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, it would be reasonable to conclude that the appellant conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the cash involved in the transaction was transferred in a manner and form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction.83 The Crown was relieved of the burden of proving the facts constituting the first element of each count because the appellant made formal admissions to the appropriate effect.84 Although at first glance it might not appear necessary for the Crown, in prosecuting an offence under s 31(1) to prove that the accused knew that the relevant cash dealer had an obligation to report significant transactions, the Crown took it upon itself to do so because of remarks made in the High Court of Australia in Leask v The Commonwealth. Some members of the Court considered whether mens rea was an ingredient of the offence created by the subsection. See the judgments of Brennan CJ at 591-593, Dawson J at 597-599 and Kirby J at 638-639. At 638 Kirby J said - Conformably with its concession in this case, it may be expected that the prosecutor for the Commonwealth will accept the obligation to establish mens rea in the prosecution of Mr Leask.85 The prosecutor acted accordingly and relied, in proof of the requisite knowledge for the purposes of any count, upon every transaction that took place between January and July 1991.86 The first ground of appeal asserts that his Honour erred in admitting evidence of all transactions in proof of the requisite knowledge for any transaction. It is convenient to consider with it the second ground of appeal, which asserts that his honour erred in not directing the jury at the conclusion of the Crown case to find the appellant not guilty on all counts.87 It was submitted for the appellant on appeal that evidence on any count of the circumstances on which any other count was based was admissible only as tendency or coincidence evidence. So it had to pass the tests contained in Part 3.6 of the Evidence Act 1995, including that provided by s 101. Subs(2) provides that such evidence cannot be used unless its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on a defendant. Since such evidence cannot directly prove guilt, that means that it must be rejected if it bears any inference consistent with innocence. Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461; R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356 per Hunt CJ at CL at 363. The evidence did not pass that test.88 The Crown submission on appeal was that the evidence did not fall within the provisions of Part 3.6 of the Evidence Act and that the test in s 101 did not apply. The only tests that did apply, therefore, were the general ones requiring a comparison of the probative value of the evidence with the danger of unfair prejudice. There could be no unfair prejudice in the present case because the material relied on by the Crown was all admitted by the defence.89 The alternative submission was that, if Part 3.6 applied, his Honour was correct in concluding, in applying the test under s 101(2), that there was no inference reasonably open other than that the appellant had the knowledge contended for.90 To come within the contemplation of s 97 the evidence had to be that two or more related events occurred which was tendered to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, the appellant did a particular act or had a particular state of mind. See subs (1).91 The Crown submitted that the evidence did not come within s 97 because - (a) By adducing it, the Crown was not trying to prove that the appellant had a tendency to have a particular state of mind, but that he knew something. The words of the section were not apt to embrace proof of that fact. (b) If s 97 applied, the Act would have unintentionally effected a fundamental change in the common process of proving a person’s knowledge by inference from surrounding objective facts. The common law never required proof of such matters beyond reasonable doubt, and nothing in the ALRC reports which preceded the passing of the Evidence Act suggested any need or intent to make such a change to the law. (c) Ss 97 and 101(2) in combination set up a requirement to balance the probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence. If the conduct relied on was not part of the criminal conduct under consideration in any count it was not itself criminal. The conduct was all admitted by the appellant. There could therefore be no prejudice.92 S 98 concerned itself with evidence that two or more related events occurred which was tendered to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, the appellant did a particular act or had a particular state of mind. See subs (1).93 The Crown submitted that the section had no application because - (a) The Crown did not rely on the improbability of events occurring coincidentally. There was no coincidence. By common consent, all the acts relied on were done by the appellant. As ALRC report 26 shows, the expression “improbability of the events occurring coincidentally” is directed to cases where the question is whether or not the accused was the perpetrator of the acts charged. (b) Arguments similar to those in (b) and (c) under s 97 above were advanced.94 The true position may be that neither of the sections applied to this case, with the result that the stringent Pfennig test was not imported by s 101(2), but the determination of this appeal does not require an answer to the question.95 The appellant had the advantage at the trial of his Honour’s application of the test.96 In his judgment dated 23 January 1998 his Honour said this - In R v Beserick (1990) 30 NSWLR 510 knowledge was regarded as a state of mind (at 521). The same arguments that are before me as to whether s.97 (or s.98) applies were before the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Fordham (CCA, NSW, unreported, 2/12/97 at 13-14). The issue there was whether the use of other conduct between the parties to infer knowledge of lack of consent on a particular occasion involved the use of tendency evidence or was merely evidence proving a state of mind. The Court found it unnecessary to resolve that question in that case for on either basis the court held the evidence was admissible. In my view the same situation applies here.97 There were some remarkable features of the transactions relied on by the Crown. Every one was for an amount of some round hundreds of dollars. It would have been surprising if every receipt of cash by the appellant had been in round hundreds of dollars. This implies that the selection of the amounts to be deposited had more to do with what the appellant found it convenient to deposit than with any amount he had received. Only three amounts of cash ($1,800, $2,000 and $5,000) were in amounts less than $7,000. Only seven amounts were less than $8,500. 78 of the 114 amounts involved sums of $9,000 or more, yet none exceeded $9,800.98 On several occasions the appellant went to a shopping centre or district where there was a branch of the ANZ Bank, only to take his cash to the branch of another bank to buy a cheque.99 There was no apparent commercial reason for the appellant to manage his banking in this peculiar way.100 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that the tribunal of fact could not infer the requisite knowledge beyond reasonable doubt from the fact that a person makes two separate deposits of cash on a single day. In the absence of evidence as to the time at which each deposit was made, one could not exclude the reasonable possibility that the appellant received the second amount of cash after he had banked the first. So the tribunal of fact would be bound to entertain a reasonable doubt whether the person concerned had had all the money and split it into separate amounts, each smaller than the critical amount for reporting purposes.101 I think that this reasoning may be sound when applied to two or a handful of transactions, but it fails when applied to the large number of transactions which occurred in the present case.102 The appellant then pointed to a number of deficiencies in the Crown case tending against an inference beyond reasonable doubt of the requisite knowledge. They were that there was no evidence that the 114 transactions the subject of the 42 counts were the appellant’s only transactions or, if they were not, of what other transactions the appellant might have made, including deposits of cash of a value of $10,000 or more, that there was no evidence of his practice prior to the introduction of the Act, that there was no evidence that he had ever possessed more than $10,000 in cash at any one time, that there was no evidence of the timing of the individual transactions on any one day, that there was no evidence of any apparent effort by the appellant to conceal the deposits made and that there was no evidence that there was any campaign by the relevant authorities to alert people to the provisions of the legislation.103 The final submission was that there was evidence which suggested that there was a reasonable explanation for the appellant’s conduct which was not consistent with his knowledge of the bank’s obligation to report significant cash deposits. It was agreed that the appellant traded in the tobacco industry, where it is customary to pay accounts in cash. Reference was made to answers given in cross-examination by Sergeant Dent, and it was submitted that a reasonable inference arose that the appellant had arranged his affairs in the manner he had in order to avoid being held up and robbed. The evidence was as follows - Q. I suppose it’s within your knowledge that people who are in possession of relatively large amounts of money are at risk at having it stolen from them? A. Yes. Q. And it’s a prudent thing to do if you run a business which involves large amounts of cash to put it in the bank? A. Yes, put it in the bank quickly, I would suggest. Q. It’s also probably a prudent thing to do if you run a business like that not to become too well known at any particular single bank as a person who habitually turns up there with large quantities of cash? A. Yes. Q. See, it would be very unwise for a person who is habitually dealing in large quantities of cash to become well known as a person who conducts a particular routine, goes to the same bank at a particular time every day, always with large quantities of cash that would be unwise? A. Exactly. If I had a large amount of cash, I would want to get rid of it as quickly as possible at the nearest bank. … Q. If a person who did have $50,000 cash took it into a bank, that would be noticed perhaps by some people, wouldn’t it, that he was depositing a large amount of cash? A. It could be noticed. It would be noticed by the bank. Q. It might be noticed by the people who are present in the bank as a customer, a great big pile of money put on the counter to be counted? A. Yes. Q. It might be prudent to put the cash into the bank in relatively small amounts to avoid the spread of knowledge that you were in possession of large quantities, couldn’t it? A. That could be one course of action.104 I do not think that the inference contended for is reasonably open in all the circumstances of the case. The suggested motive is no explanation for the appellant’s purchasing bank cheques when he could have deposited cash and it does not explain the concentration of the deposited amounts within a very narrow band of values, all short of the critical $10,000 figure.105 His Honour expressed himself satisfied that there was no rational view of the evidence other than that the appellant knew of the bank’s obligation to report cash transactions of $10,000 or more. I think, with respect, that that was the only available conclusion on the evidence.106 Counsel for the appellant was at pains to restrict the grounds of appeal so as to limit this Court’s consideration to the admissibility of evidence at the time of tender and to the evidentiary position at the close of the Crown case. I have dealt with the first two grounds of appeal on those restricted bases and I think that they should fail.107 It should be pointed out, however, that in his unsworn statement the appellant told the jury a number of things about his understanding of the Act and about why he acted as he did. He denied knowledge of the bank’s obligation to report, but also said this - I became vaguely aware of restrictions on banking cash in late 1990 just when the Cash Transactions Reports Act I believe came into force and I had a belief that the point of it was to create some restriction on banking over $10,000. I think at the time I believed it was for reasons to stop drug dealers to tax avoiders banking large amounts of cash. At no time did I - was I aware of these restrictions or these - the need to report the banking. There was no - at any time I was never conscious of trying to avoid any restrictions. I had no reason to. Couldn’t have cared less whether they reported it a hundred times. It was - I seemed to get into a pattern of using this limit of banking $10,000 in cash. I got into a pattern of making sure I was banking only that amount and quite often I only had that amount, but that’s how I understood the law to be.108 I think that the proper inference to draw from that passage is that the appellant was referring to the amounts about which the Crown had adduced evidence. The appellant never claimed that he had banked an amount as high as $10,000. The “pattern” that he referred to was the pattern of transactions about which evidence had been adduced in the Crown case. By his statement, the appellant implied that the transactions evidenced in the Crown case were his only transactions for the relevant period. That goes some way towards explaining why the appellant did not give evidence on the objection to the admission of the evidence.109 The third ground of appeal complains about his Honour’s directions to the jury on the third element of the offences.110 His honour twice directed the jury that the third element of each count, which had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, was - that having regard to the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted it would be reasonable to conclude that the accused conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the cash involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction.111 After reviewing the evidence, his Honour continued as follows - Returning now to other aspects of the third element. Once you have had regard to the manner and form of the non-reportable cash transactions in the way in which I have directed you must then determine whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it would be reasonable to conclude that the accused conducted the transactions which are the subject of the charge you are considering in that manner and form for the sole or dominant purpose, I will repeat that, for the sole and dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the cash involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner or form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction. To put this another way which I hope may be more meaningful to you, you must determine having regard to the manner and form of the transactions whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it would be reasonable to conclude that the accused carried out the transactions in that way for the sole or dominant purpose of avoiding the making of a significant cash transaction. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it would be reasonable to so conclude then the Crown would have established the third element. You must only consider in respect of each charge the two or more non-reportable cash transactions upon which that charge is based when looking at this third element.112 His Honour then reviewed the Crown and defence arguments and in the course of doing so said this - Even if you were to arrive at another or other reasonable conclusions so long as you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it would be reasonable to conclude that the accused carried out the transactions for the sole or dominant purpose of avoiding the making of a significant cash transaction then the Crown would have established the third element of the charge. However, if you have a reasonable doubt that it would be reasonable to so conclude then you must find the accused not guilty.113 It was this part of the summing-up that came under attack. Counsel for the appellant submitted that his Honour should have directed the jury in the following terms - If there is a conclusion reasonably open regarding the sole or dominant purpose for which the transactions were conducted in the manner and form they were, and that conclusion is inconsistent with the conclusion required, then the Crown would not have established the third element of the offence to the necessary standard of proof.114 Both sides maintained on appeal the position they had taken before his Honour, the appellant contending for proof beyond reasonable doubt and the Crown for a direction that the jury should be satisfied that it would be reasonable to conclude that the appellant had the relevant purpose.115 It was put on behalf of the appellant that if there were a reasonable doubt about whether the required conclusion was reasonable, then the appellant should be acquitted. There would be a doubt about the reasonableness of the conclusion if there were another conclusion reasonably open and inconsistent with the required conclusion. His Honour failed to direct the jury as proposed and there were inferences available from the evidence, including that the appellant at no time possessed $10,000 or more in cash and that he acted as he did to protect himself from robbery, so the Court should quash the convictions and order a new trial.116 In Leask v The Commonwealth the High Court of Australia was concerned with the question whether by its operation and effect subs 31(1) revealed a sufficient connection with the taxation or the currency, coinage and legal tender heads of power to be declared a valid law of the Commonwealth. One of the arguments put against the sufficiency of connection with the currency power incorporated a submission that the subsection imposed a strict or absolute liability, because a person might be found guilty on the basis that it would be reasonable to conclude that the person conducted the cash transactions in question for the prohibited purpose.117 Brennan CJ took the view that although the offence created by the subsection is not one of strict liability its mens rea is extremely limited. It is confined to the elements of para (a) and the Crown does not have to prove a specific intent in an accused person to achieve the sole or dominant purpose of para (b).118 Dawson J said this at 597 - The Commonwealth submitted that s 31(1) does not create an offence of absolute or strict liability. It pointed to the fact that the circumstances to which regard must be had in reaching the required conclusion include “any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted” (s 31(1)(b)(ii)). Moreover, the Commonwealth submitted, the required conclusion is that the person concerned conducted the transactions for a specific purpose, namely, the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring that the transactions would not give rise to a significant cash transaction or would give rise to exempt cash transactions. Upon this basis the Commonwealth argument was that the sub-section requires proof that the person charged with an offence knew of the nature of a significant cash transaction or of exempt cash transactions and intended by structuring his or her transactions in the manner or form alleged to ensure that they would not give rise to a significant cash transaction or exempt cash transactions. The only effect of the words “it would be reasonable to conclude” is, the Commonwealth contended, to lower the standard of proof from that of beyond reasonable doubt to that of a reasonable conclusion. There is no doubt that the wording of s 31(1) leaves it far from clear whether intention, or mens rea … is an ingredient of the offence which it creates and, if so, the nature of the intention required. In that situation, it is my view that the Commonwealth submission should be accepted.119 His Honour then referred to a number of cases and the presumption that a knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act constituting it is an essential ingredient in every offence unless displaced by the words of the statute creating the offence or by the subject matter with which it deals, and continued - I would apply the presumption in the case of the offence created by s 31(1) of the Act and would do so with increased confidence because of the ambiguity inherent in the wording of the sub-section. Even if with some statutory offences the nature of the offence may indicate that the presumption operates weakly, if at all, the nature of the offence created by s 31(1), gleaned from the way in which it is worded, indicates that it is not an offence of that kind. That means that I adopt the submission made by the Commonwealth that the words “It would be reasonable to conclude” go to the standard of proof to be applied and do not rebut a presumed requirement of mens rea as an ingredient of the offence.120 Neither Toohey J nor Gummow J found it necessary to consider the matter. Kirby J said that there were some indications that supported the Commonwealth’s contention for mens rea, but found it unnecessary to decide the matter.121 This Court has an advantage that was not available to the trial judge. After the case concluded before his Honour the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia considered the subsection in R v Dinh Hue Tran (1998) 38 ATR 19. Unlike Leask v The Commonwealth, that case directly raised the issue of the mental element required for proof of guilt of an offence under the subsection.122 The principal judgment was delivered by Doyle CJ. His Honour began with the position, extracted from the judgments in Leask v The Commonwealth, that an offence against the subsection required proof at least that - (i) the accused person knew that he or she was a party to a transaction that involved the physical transfer of currency; (ii) the accused person was aware of the facts that made another party to the transaction a cash dealer for the purposes of the Act; and (iii) the accused person knew that the amount of currency involved in each transaction had a value of less than $10,000.His Honour considered that the subsection was directed at evasion rather than at carelessness or ignorance and that evasion implied knowledge. That necessitated proof in addition that (iv) the accused person knew that a transaction involving currency of $10,000 or more in value must, by law, be reported to a government agency, and that a transaction involving currency of less than $10,000 in value did not have to be reported to a government agency.123 His Honour went on to consider para (b) and concluded that in it the Parliament must have intended to deal with the knowledge of the accused and the difference between a significant cash transaction and a non-reportable cash transaction and must have imposed a requirement to prove an actual purpose. Consistently with the judgment of Dawson J in Leask v The Commonwealth, his Honour concluded that para (b) imposed a requirement to prove - (i) that the accused person knew that a transaction involving the transfer of currency of $10,000 or more in value must be reported to a government agency and that a transaction involving the transfer of currency of less than $10,000 in value need not be reported to a government agency; and (ii) that it is reasonable to conclude that the accused person in fact had the sole or dominant purpose referred to in the paragraph.His Honour concluded at 26 - The purpose that has to be proved need not be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The question for the jury is simply whether it is reasonable to conclude that, in fact, the accused person had the identified sole or dominant purpose. On the other hand, the jury must find it reasonable to conclude that the accused person in fact had the identified purpose. 124 Cox J agreed with the Chief Justice, observing that it was better to construe the subsection as requiring proof of an actual intention on the part of the accused and better to interpret the “reasonable to conclude” formula as simply stating the standard of proof of a purpose that the accused actually had.125 Duggan J agreed about the need to prove the intention or purpose of the accused, leaving the words “it would be reasonable to conclude” as going only to the standard of proof.126 With respect, the judgment of their Honours accords with principle in requiring the Crown to prove mens rea. See He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523 at 569-582.127 The construction preferred by their Honours, which confines the application of the words “reasonable to conclude” to the standard of proof, also removes the problem that would otherwise exist of giving meaning to a form of words which requires a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it is reasonable to reach the relevant conclusion.128 I think that this Court should apply the reasoning in the judgments of Dawson J in Leask v The Commonwealth and of the Court in R v Dinh Hue Tran. By that reasoning it appears that the direction given by his Honour went further than necessary in that it required proof beyond reasonable doubt that it was reasonable to come to the relevant conclusion. I think that the jury would have taken that formulation as meaning that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the relevant sole or dominant purpose. The direction was favourable to the appellant.129 Given that proof is not required beyond reasonable doubt, an accused person may be convicted if the jury think it reasonable to conclude that the accused’s sole or dominant purpose was the purpose proscribed by the subsection. The existence of a dominant purpose, which is sufficient for a conviction, requires the concurrent existence of another purpose or other purposes. It follows that the jury may well think that other conclusions are reasonably open and still convict. That is what his Honour told the jury.130 The appellant’s argument fails.131 Counsel for the appellant made a further submission, based on R v Dinh Hue Tran, that his Honour erred in leaving it open for the jury to decide the third element on an objective view and never invited them to consider the sole or dominant purpose of the appellant himself. I disagree. I think that the directions that - … you must then determine whether … the accused conducted the transactions … for the sole or dominant purpose … and … you must determine … whether … the accused carried out the transactions in that way for the sole or dominant purpose …made clear to the jury that it was for them to determine whether in carrying out the transactions the appellant himself had the relevant purpose as his sole or dominant purpose.132 I would dismiss the appeal against convictions.133 No submissions were made in support of the application for leave to appeal against the sentences. They were well within the proper range of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. I would refuse leave to appeal. ***********************

       REGINA v KIM WILLIAMS 
       
       
      The applicant was convicted of sexual intercourse with a child above 10 and under 16 pursuant to s 66C(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      . He was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for three years, with a three year additional term. He sought leave to appeal against the sentence and appealed against the conviction on three grounds: (1) that the directions concerning the delay in the complaint were inadequate; (2) that the warning concerning the complaint evidence was inadequate; and (3) that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
       
      HELD 
       by Wood CJ at CL, Spigelman CJ and McInerney J concurring - dismissing the appeal: 
       
       
      Directions concerning delay in giving complaint evidence 
       
      (1)  
      If the s 405B(2) direction is given (to the effect that delay in making a complaint does not necessarily indicate that the allegation is false), it will normally be appropriate to draw the attention of the jury to the balancing consideration concerning the effect of delay upon a complainant’s credibility. In the present case this was sufficiently done.

       (CCA NSW 18 December 1998),

       (1996) 186 CLR 427, applied. 
       
        
       
      (2)  
      The point of the direction is to bring to the jury the collective experience of judges and researchers of sexual assault, as to the difficulty that many complainants have in bringing such matters to light and in giving evidence concerning them. Although the judge’s observation (which was that the jury may be able to think of “101 or 1001 reasons” for the complainant’s delay in bringing the complaint) was inappropriate, it did not give rise to any miscarriage of justice. Where reference is made, in the summing up, to reasons that may have affected the complainant, it will be appropriate to confine any discussion on that matter to reasons in fact offered by the complainant, and inappropriate to invite speculation as to other possible specific reasons for delay or absence of complaint that were not mentioned. 
       
        
       
      (3)  
      The absence of any reference by the trial judge to the possible effects of delay on the appellant did not amount to an error, as no evidence emerged to show that the appellant was in fact prejudiced by the delay. Each case needs to be considered individually; mere delay is not enough. Where, in the present case, the defence was able to test the complainant, and to call a positive case in reply, the likely effect of delay diminished in significance.

      Warning concerning evidence of complaint 
       
      (4)  
      It is not customary to give a direction that the complainant’s “evidence” must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. What must be proved beyond reasonable doubt are the elements of the offence charged. The judge gave an appropriate direction. 
       
        
       
      (5)  
      A direction pursuant to s 165 of the  
      Evidence Act 
       may be required (notwithstanding no request was made by counsel) where the judge assesses that the evidence may be “unreliable”. The matters identified in s 165(1) are not exhaustive. Here, a sufficient warning to assess the complainant’s evidence with care was given.

       (1987) 11 NSWLR 12, considered. 
       
        
       
      (6) The trial judge should ensure the jury has sufficient guidance in taking relevant matters into account. However the extent of the guidance depends on the length and complexity of the trial. Here it was unnecessary for the trial judge to have undertaken a comprehensive analysis.

      Verdict unsafe and unsatisfactory 
       
      (7) The complainant’s vagueness as to the relevant date, the lack of corroboration, and the delay in the complaint, are matters which should properly be taken into account when considering this ground, but only if examined in context, and with due respect to the advantage the jury enjoys in assessing the witnesses. In this case, these matters should not have caused the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt.

      Sentence 
       
      (8) While sentencing statistics must be viewed with care, they do show, in the instant case, that a full term of 6 years falls toward the top of the range. Top of the range is, by definition, within range, and cannot therefore be said to be manifestly excessive. His Honour expressly took into account the excellent subjective circumstances of the appellant, in finding special circumstances so as to alter the usual statutory proportion in favour of the appellant. He also properly recognised that severely deterrent sentences for child sexual assault are required. His Honour did not fall into error in this regard.

       NEWCASTLE: TUESDAY 23 FEBRUARY 1999 
       
       
       
       REGINA v KIM WILLIAMS 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
       
      1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I will invite Mr Justice Wood to give the first judgment. 
       
      2 WOOD CJ AT CL: The appellant was convicted, after trial before a jury, of one count of sexual intercourse with a child above the age of ten years and under the age of sixteen years ( 
      Crimes Act 
       1900 s 66C(1)). For that offence he was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for three years and to an additional term of three years. He now appeals against that conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
       
      3 He was initially indicted on three counts, two of indecent assault and one of sexual intercourse without consent, each allegedly occurring over a weekend, when the complainant went to stay at his home, in order to assist him with the muster of some cattle. The three counts spanned the period 6 May 1989 to 8 May 1990. It became apparent during the trial that the relevant occasion of the muster was the weekend of 4 and 5 May 1991. 
       
      4 The trial judge thereupon permitted an amendment of count 3 to accommodate this circumstance and directed an acquittal on the other two counts for the reason that s 61E, under which the charges had been brought, had been repealed before May 1991. 
       
      5 It was the Crown case that the complainant, who was a keen horsewoman and aged fifteen years in May 1991, was invited to the home of the appellant for the muster. The appellant was a friend of her father. He had performed some work as a farrier in relation to her horse and he had also had contact with her through the local Pony Club. The complainant's recollection in chief was that the visit to the appellant's home, and the muster at Chichester Dam, occurred when she was in Year 7 and aged thirteen years. She recalled that the appellant's wife had been present at the home, along with their three daughters, the youngest of whom was a baby. She also recalled that his wife had been pregnant with their fourth child at the time.  
       
      6 That was one of two material circumstances in dating the alleged incident, since it was established that this fourth child was born in November 1991. 
       
      7 The complainant said that a bed was made up for her in the sitting room and placed next to a common wall to the main bedroom. It was her account that during the night the appellant came to her bed, and committed an indecent assault that was charged as one of the two counts, that were later taken away. In the course of rebuffing the appellant she said, ""No"" several times to him, in a progressively louder voice. Her intention was to attract the attention of his wife and to discourage him. She was successful in that latter respect. 
       
      8 The next day she went out with him to the dam to muster the cattle. During the afternoon she said that he touched her breasts, removed her riding pants and placed his penis in her vagina before withdrawing and ejaculating. He said that he desired to marry her. This conduct gave rise to the second count of indecent assault and to the count of sexual intercourse with a child aged between ten and sixteen years. 
       
      9 The victim said that she did not complain to her parents because: 
       
       ""my father was very good friends with Kim, and my father's also got a very bad temper, yeah, and I was just frightened of the consequences. The way I felt, Mum had no power or say anyhow, over my father."" 
       
      10 The complainant brought the matter to the notice of police in May 1996. By the time she gave evidence she was aged twenty-one years. 
       
      11 The appellant gave sworn evidence to the effect that the cattle had been mustered for sale, because he had suffered an injury, and had decided not to keep them any longer. He produced records showing their sale on 6 May 1991 through the Maitland Saleyards. It was his evidence that he had enlisted the assistance of the complainant, because the muster was to take place in rugged country, and could not safely be done alone. He was certain that it had lasted for the two days of the weekend, whereas the complainant thought that she had only been to Dungog for one night and one day.  
       
      12 He recalled going to her home on the Friday night to pick her up, and having to wait until she returned from a Blue Light Disco. The bed on which she slept was made up in the sunroom and placed on the opposite side of that room to the position described by the complainant. He said that the house was of fibro construction, with walls that were paper thin.  
       
      13 He denied committing any of the offences alleged, and said that he had been asked by the complainant, on several subsequent occasions, to carry out farrier work for her. Additionally, he said she had been to his house on several occasions to give his children riding instruction. 
       
      14 The appellant's wife also gave evidence. She said that her fourth pregnancy had been very difficult, and that she had not been sleeping well, at the time of the complainant's visit. She also said that the bedroom door was very noisy and that, if opened during the night, it would awaken her. 
       
      15 She said that the appellant had originally asked for the complainant's younger brother to assist in the muster, and that it was only at her family's suggestion, that the complainant had been invited for that purpose. 
       
      16 There were three grounds of appeal against conviction. 
       
        
      GROUND 1. ADEQUACY OF DIRECTIONS CONCERNING THE DELAY IN COMPLAINT 
       
      17 Assuming that the offences occurred in May 1991, there was a five year delay in complaint. The directions given in relation to delay were in the following terms: 
       
       ""There are a couple of directions of law that it remains for me to give you. There's a section of the Crimes Act relating to what's called absence of complaint, and I'm required to tell you that when evidence is given which suggests absence of complaint on the part of the complainant with respect to the commission of this offence - an offence of this kind, I'm required to tell you that - I'm required to warn you, the Act says that I should warn you - that I should warn the jury to the effect that absence of complaint or delay in complaining, in this case of course it's a case of delay in complaining because the common ground is that it was some years before a complaint was made, does not necessarily indicate that the allegation made by the complainant was false. So the delay in complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed was false. That's a provision of the Crimes Act and I'm required to warn the jury in those terms. I'm required to warn you that the mere fact that a complainant doesn't complain or that the complainant delays the complaint doesn't necessarily mean that the allegation is a false one. And I'm to inform you, the Act goes on to say, that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in making or may refrain from making a complaint about the assault. Now you have to apply your common sense to that because that's very much an area that the jury's experience of life applies to. You have to ask yourselves in the circumstances of this case what reasons might there have been and were they good reasons, were they not good reasons. I'm sorry, I'm hesitating myself to start suggesting things to you because there might be no end to that. I'm sure if you all think about this in a general way not applying your mind to this case for the moment, you may be able to think of 101 reasons why a woman might not complain immediately about an event that occurred. What you have to do is to apply your mind to this case and say in relation to this case, what reasons may have operated on the mind of this woman, the complainant, if the assault actually did occur, the sexual intercourse, to delay her complaining, and you would ask yourselves were they good reasons. 
       
       I think the Act if I may say so uses that word 'good' in a rather strange way. It's not so much the goodness of the reasons that might justify a delay. What you have to ask yourselves is - I think that's a colloquialism, good reason for doing something. You don't necessarily mean that there was something good about the reasons, but was there a reason that explains the delay. It may have been quite a bad reason, but it's the genuineness I think, was there a sincere or a genuine or valid or cogent reason, something like that. But the expression used is 'good reason' and sometimes we do use that expression colloquially, he or she had good reason for doing something. It may not involve a value judgment that something was actually good as distinct from evil or - but that's what the Act says, I should inform the jury that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in making a complaint. I could perhaps give an example so far removed from this case that it couldn't be - couldn't confuse you at all, but one could imagine a situation where complaints have been made before and the person's parents or guardian had just laughed at them because it had happened with someone else six months earlier, and the victim might give a reason, 'Well, I didn't complain because last time I complained I was laughed at.' As I said, you could imagine not 101, 1001 reasons why something like that might occur or not occur. So I've given you the warning and I've given you that bit of information that I'm required to give you under the Crimes Act, but I'm also required to remind you that notwithstanding this section, you may, it's entirely a matter for you and I'm certainly not telling you to do it, you may nevertheless consider the delay when you're considering the credibility or believability of the witness. You may consider it. It may have some bearing on it in your mind. Just as an immediate complaint, an immediate complaint. Supposing she had banged the wall immediately as suggested by the defence counsel and said, 'Stop, help', that would have been something that you may well have considered in her favour. It is possible for you although you may see, as I said, there may be good reason why she didn't, but it is possible for you to consider a delay, a long delay, in the opposite way as reflecting adversely on her credibility. 
       
       You would also take into account may I remind you that she was a child at the time. On one view of it she could have been quite young, although it could have been - on one view could have been thirteen, but the preponderance of evidence seems to be fairly well produced now that she was older than that, possibly around about fifteen, and I'm not going to buy into the fact finding, but I have to think perhaps along the lines you may be thinking in order to make relevant comments to you. If you think she's about fifteen, you take into account the environment she grew up in, perhaps - there are many things a juror might want to consider when considering whether a person would complain. Consider whether he understanding of what happened at the time was something that would evoke an immediate complaint or might have allowed her to, so to speak, put it out of her mind at least for some time. They're all sorts of things that you're going to have to debate about and I assure you I'm not intending to convey any view one way or the other to you."" 
       
      18 It was submitted that these directions, in respect of which no complaint was made at the trial, were unbalanced, so far as they laboured in favour of the prosecution the matters referred to in s 405B(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ; in so far as they invited speculation as to possible reasons for delay that had not been offered by the complainant; in so far as they might have implied that delay was the norm in this type of case; and in so far as insufficient explanation was given concerning the way in which the jury were to assess the relevance of delay in relation to the complainant's credibility, or concerning any impact that delay had upon the appellant's ability to defend himself. 
       
      19 This is not a case where the trial judge gave only a s 405B(2) direction, without mention of the circumstance that silence or delay on the part of a complainant may weaken his or her credibility. The reason for the balancing direction lies in the assumption that where persons are sexually assaulted, particularly by strangers, they are likely to complain about it, and that absence or delay in complaint bespeaks an inconsistency in conduct on their part:  
      Kilby 
       (1973) 129 CLR 460. Prompt complaint consequent on sexual assault is however no longer regarded as a universal truism of human nature. Whether or not complaint is given may depend upon a number of circumstances including the nature and proximity of the relationship, the age and emotional maturity of the victim, the existence or otherwise of physical violence or threat, and the availability of a sympathetic person to whom a complaint might be made. 
       
      20 All this is recognised in the philosophy that underlies s 405B(2). However, as I noted in  
      PAH 
       CCA NSW 18 December 1998, unreported, if the s 405B(2) direction is given, it will normally be appropriate to draw the attention of the jury to the balancing consideration identified by the High Court in  
      Crofts 
       (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 451. The Court there said, in relation to the equivalent provision (s 61) in the  
      Victorian Crimes Act 
      : 
       
       ""...the purpose of such legislation, properly understood, was to reform the balance of jury instruction not to remove the balance. The purpose was not to convert complaints in sexual misconduct cases into an especially trustworthy class of witnesses. It was simply to correct what had previously been standard practice by which, based on supposed 'human experience' and the 'experience of courts', judges were required to instruct juries that complainants of sexual misconduct were specially suspect, those complained against specially vulnerable and delay in complaining invariably critical. In restoring the balance, the intention of the legislature was not to 'sterilise' complaints from critical comment where the particular facts of the case, and the justice of the circumstances, suggested that the judge should put such comments before the jury for their consideration. The overriding duty of the trial judge remains to ensure that the accused secures a fair trial. It would require much clearer language than appears in s 61 of the Act to oblige a judge, in a case otherwise calling for comment, to refrain from drawing to the notice of the jury aspects of the facts of the case which, on ordinary human experience, would be material to the evaluation of those facts."" 
       
      21 The balancing direction, concerning the effect of delay upon a complainant's credibility, required by  
      Crofts 
       was in fact given in this trial, and I am not persuaded that it was lost in the remainder of the charge. I shall deal with the associated submission that some greater explanation should have been given, in relation to the way that delay may impact upon credibility, when I come to the second ground of appeal. 
       
      22 The question which does require closer attention in this case is whether his Honour fell into error, in so far as he observed that the jury may be able to think of ""101 reasons or 1001 reasons"", why a victim of sexual assault may not make an immediate complaint.  
       
      23 The observations made in this respect were unhelpful and involved something of an exaggeration. However, they need to be understood in the context of the trial and of the summing-up as a whole. His Honour did no more than comply with the statutory direction in saying to the jury that ""there may be good reasons why a victim of sexual assault may hesitate in making or may refrain from making a complaint"". He correctly instructed the jury that they had to ask themselves, in the circumstances of the instant case, what reasons there might have been and whether they were good reasons.  
       
      24 Had the matter been left there and had his Honour reminded the jury of the reason that the complainant had in fact offered, there could have been no criticism. The jury were not necessarily, however, confined to the reason expressly articulated by the complainant, since there may well have been other reasons which she could not put into words or about which she felt some embarrassment. 
       
      25 The point of the direction is to bring home to the jury the collective experience and understanding of trial judges, as well as of those who have made a study of sexual assault, as to the difficulty that many complainants, particularly children, have first in bringing such matters to light, and then in articulating in the witness box the painful self reflections that they may have felt after the offence occurred. (Dr Woods, Sexual Assault, Law Reform in New South Wales, 1981, p 20.) 
       
      26 That experience, and that understanding, lies behind s 405B(2) of the Act, with which his Honour's direction literally complied. Had his Honour gone further and identified possible but unexpressed reasons why the particular complainant had remained silent for five years, then this ground of appeal would in my view have been made good. To have taken that course would have gone beyond the statutory requirement, and it would have risked sowing seeds in the minds of the jurors for which there was no evidentiary basis. It may have unwittingly misled the jury into assuming that there was in fact some other reason, unexpressed by the complainant, but known to the judge, for her silence. His Honour stopped short of speculating in that regard, or of inviting any consideration of specific reasons which had not been offered. Although his observations concerning ""101 or 1001 reasons"" would have been better avoided, I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated in that respect.  
       
      27 The remaining leg of the argument raised under this ground relates to the absence of any reference, by the trial judge, to the possible adverse effects of the delay in complaint, so far as that related to the ability of the appellant to defend himself. This involves a quite different argument, although it similarly needs to be examined in the context of the particular trial. 
       
      28 In  
      Johnston 
       CCA NSW 31 July 1998, unreported, Spigelman CJ, who delivered the leading judgment, set out the general principles which apply, where there is a delay in complaint, as follows: 
       
       ""(i) Wherever it appears to a trial judge that delay, whether occasioned by delay in reporting a crime or otherwise, may have affected the fairness of a trial, he or she should make such comments and give such warnings as will ensure that the trial is fair. 
       
       (ii) A comment or warning is required if it appears to the trial judge that a jury may not, from its own experience, fully appreciate the effects of delay on the ability of the accused to defend himself or herself whether by testing prosecution evidence or adducing evidence in his own case, to establish a reasonable doubt about his or her guilt. 
       
       (iii) The need for, and content of, any comment will depend on the circumstances of the case. 
       
       (iv) Whether or not there is a need for any, and if so what, warning will also depend on the circumstances of the case. 
       
       (v) Where it appears from the course of evidence, including cross-examination, or the conduct of the trial, including submissions, that specific difficulties were encountered by the accused in testing the evidence of the prosecution or adducing evidence in defence, then those specific difficulties should be highlighted in the summing-up in such a way as makes it clear that delay, for which the accused had not been responsible, had created those difficulties. 
       
       (vi) Where the summing-up identifies difficulties pursuant to (v), the trial judge should indicate to the jury how they should approach their task of determining whether the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. There is no universally applicable formula but some reference to the additional care or caution with which they should approach the prosecution evidence is usually appropriate. 
       
       (vii) In some cases a warning which uses terminology such as 'dangerous' or 'unsafe' to convict will be required. The reasons for the warning must be explained, generally by relating the danger to the specific difficulties of the character referred to in (v)."" 
       
      29 No request was made for any redirection so as to deal with points (v) or (vi) in these general principles. Although the case under appeal was decided before  
      Johnston 
      , the principles there enunciated were not new: (See  
      Harvey 
       CCA NSW 9 April 1998 unreported, per Smart J at pp 11 and 12; and  
      Jones 
       (1997) 72 ALJR 78 at 87.) 
       
      30 Nothing emerged, in the evidence led in this trial, to suggest that the appellant was in fact prejudiced by delay. On the contrary, he was able to date the relevant weekend by reference to documents, and both he and his wife professed to have a clear and consistent recollection of what had occurred. Additionally he was able to tender a video of the house, that demonstrated its construction and the squeaky door. At the highest, the appellant pointed to the possibility that, had the complaint been made promptly, he may have been able to provide some more specific detail of post-incident contact, of the actual time spent in the muster, and of the complainant's demeanour after the event. In my assessment, the matters identified do not rise above mere possibilities, which were not even thought of at the trial. They leave cause for wonder as to the kind of evidence or detail that might have been available but was lost. The present case in this regard is very different from  
      Johnston 
      , where the Crown itself used the fact of delay in attacking the reliability of the evidence given by the defence witnesses, to the point where a balancing direction was called for. In such a case it will only be fair to present both sides of the coin. Similarly it will be necessary to bring the effect of delay upon the defence case to notice, where some potential difficulty in that regard has been identified. Mere delay without more is not in my view enough. Each case will need to be considered upon its merits. Where, as in the present case, the defence was able to test the complainant in relation to detail and to call a positive case in reply, the likely effect of delay so far as this aspect is concerned will diminish in significance.  
       
      31 As no redirection was sought in respect of the matters raised and as I am unpersuaded of error, I would refuse leave under r 4 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Rules 
      . 
       
        
      GROUND 2. WARNING CONCERNING EVIDENCE OF COMPLAINT 
       
      32 It was submitted that the directions were deficient, in so far as his Honour did not instruct the jury that they should acquit, if the complainant's ""evidence"" was not proved beyond reasonable doubt, or that the onus of proof did not shift even when the accused gave evidence. Further, it was submitted that his Honour erred in not giving a warning under s 165(1)(c) of the  
      Evidence Act 
      , and in not highlighting the suggested weaknesses in the prosecution case which had been identified by the defence. 
       
      33 Again, no redirection was sought along these lines. The submissions concerning the onus of proof may be shortly disposed of. It is not customary, contrary to the submission advanced, to give a direction that the complainant's ""evidence"" must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Such a direction would tend to confuse. What must be proved beyond reasonable doubt are the elements of the offence charged. That was the direction his Honour gave when observing (p 149): 
       
       ""So just let me say in order to be satisfied that a crime was being committed, you must be satisfied that each of the essential elements existed."" 
       
       As to the second leg of this complaint, contrary to the submission put, his Honour did instruct the jury as follows: 
       
       ""it was said rightly that the accused didn't have to give evidence and that flows from the fact that he doesn't have anything to prove. The Crown must prove the case. The Crown carries the onus of proof."" 
       
      34 So far as the remainder of the submission is concerned, it may be accepted that the need for a caution, in relation to the reliability of a witness' evidence, does not depend solely on whether or not an accused seeks a direction under s 165 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      . As this Court said in  
      Vawdrey 
       CCA NSW 16 April 1998, unreported, a direction may be required where the judge assesses that the evidence may be ""unreliable"". The matters identified in s 165(1) are but instances of situations where unreliability may arise. They do not purport to be exhaustive. 
       
      35 The present case is one where it was patently obvious that the complainant was uncorroborated, and that her evidence was directly contradicted by the appellant, who gave evidence on oath. His Honour at no stage fell into the error of suggesting, or encouraging, the jury to approach their task upon the basis that they were simply to decide which of the two they preferred. He underlined, in specific terms, the need to approach the complainant's evidence with care in the following passage: 
       
       ""Both counsel have suggested to you that I will say to you, both of them, that you should scrutinise carefully the evidence of Ms Chapman. Because we live in an age when we have to be careful that what we say is politically correct if I may say so, it becomes important for me to say to you very hastily and very forcefully, that's not because she's a woman, it's not because she's the female victim of an assault by a male person. I have not suddenly become a sexist. Why I say that to you is this, that in every case whether the person complaining be a male or a female or something else, in every such case where the evidence is not - where the evidence as it were stands alone or very much alone and someone's - and the conviction of another person depends on it, it stands to reason that you will look at the evidence in a critical sense. That's not a sexist remark, and it happens that this person, Ms Chapman is a woman, but that's the only connection between what I'm saying to you and that fact. It of course is important that you look at it critically. In another case where you may have twenty witnesses supporting one another in various ways and where the evidence is not so isolated, you might not have to look quite so critically at individual witnesses. But there is no evidence corroborative of what Ms Chapman says and all I'm asking you to do is to do what counsel have suggested you should do, and that is look at the evidence, scrutinise it carefully and I think the Crown Prosecutor joined in that as well because it's common sense. It's obviously a requirement of justice."" 
       
      36 Within the context of this trial, this appears to me to have constituted a sufficient warning to the jury to assess the complainant's evidence with care, in accordance with the approach outlined in  
      Murray 
       (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19, even though such a direction is not now automatically required. There is, in that regard, no longer any basis for the assumption, which was always dubious, that the evidence of complainants in sexual assault cases is potentially unreliable. Section 405B of the  
      Crimes Act 
       and recent authority show that to be so. 
       
      37 It was next submitted that his Honour failed sufficiently to summarise the key points of the defence case, specifically in relation to weaknesses in the complainant's evidence. The trial was a short one, the evidence having begun and concluded within two days. In those circumstances it was entirely appropriate for his Honour to take the course followed, of not summing-up the evidence, as is permitted by s 405AA of the  
      Crimes Act 
      . 
       
      38 It is the case that trial judges should ensure that the jury have sufficient guidance as to the issues, including any issue that arises concerning the credibility of a principal Crown witness:  
      RJC 
       CCA NSW 1 October 1998, unreported. 
       
      39 The need for guidance, so as to ensure that the relevant matters are appreciated and taken into account, however, depends upon the nature of the trial, its length and its complexity. In  
      Domican v The Queen 
       (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 561 the Court said: 
       
       ""Nevertheless, the requirement of fairness means that ordinarily the respective cases for the prosecution and the accused must be accurately and fairly put to the jury. But that requirement does not oblige the judge to put to the jury every argument put forward by counsel for the accused (14).""  
       
       ""Whether the trial judge is bound to refer to an evidentiary matter or argument ultimately depends upon whether a reference to that matter or argument is necessary to ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence(16)."" 
       
      40 The need to focus upon the critical issues, and to consider that matter in the context of the trial, was also made clear by the observations of Allen J in  
      Condon 
       (1995) 83 ACR 335, where his Honour said at p 347 that the duty of the trial judge is, 
       
       ""to give them assistance so that they understand what the critical issues of fact are upon application of the law to the particular case. The trial judge is not relieved from that duty by the arguments of counsel. Indeed, as Murphy J pointed out in  
      Salvo 
      , it would not be enough even for the trial judge accurately to state what the case for the accused is as it has been presented. He must instruct the jury what the law is in respect of that case and do so in terms which throw up, clearly, what the critical issues of fact are which it raises."" 
       
      41 In the present case his Honour summarised in short form the essential submissions of the Crown Prosecutor and of defence counsel. So far as the defence was concerned his Honour said, in relation to the credibility issue: 
       
       ""Defence counsel on the other hand says that you should at least have a doubt about the reliability of her evidence, and he gave you a lot of eloquent reasons which I wouldn't do justice to if I tried to repeat them, but they must still be ringing in your ears because he only not long ago stopped talking to you, and he presented his arguments to you very thoroughly and you should give them the weight you think they deserve."" 
       
      42 His Honour went into no greater depth in dealing with the prosecution case. In a single issue trial as short as this, when the summing-up concluded within a morning and followed immediately upon the address of defence counsel, I am unconvinced that it was necessary for the trial judge to have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the kind that the appellant now contends for. His Honour's assessment of the position was made evident by the observation as to the eloquence of the defence submissions concerning the complainant's credibility, which he said would ""still be ringing"" in the jury's ears. 
       
      43 The common sense and intelligence of the jury requires respect, as does the experience of trial counsel who, in this case, expressly stated that he did not require any further direction or redirection.  
       
      44 I am unpersuaded that in a short trial, where the focus was on the complainant's credibility, anything would have been achieved by yet another restatement of that issue or of the points made either by the Crown or by the defence. The position is likely to be otherwise in a complex and lengthy trial, to which the observations in  
      Domican 
       are particularly apposite. It would also have been otherwise had the trial judge here undertaken, for example, a detailed analysis of the Crown case and then dismissed the defence case in short terms. What is required is a fair balance when any excursion into the issues and evidence is undertaken. Again I am of the view that leave should be refused to argue this ground under r 4 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Rules 
      .  
       
      45 Without wishing to labour the point which has now been made many times, I would repeat the observations that I made in  
      PAH 
       concerning the need for trial counsel, among whom I include both the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel, to be vigilant in ensuring that any necessary directions or redirections are sought at trial. A clear risk of a miscarriage of justice will need to be identified, before this Court would intervene, where complaint has not been made at the trial. Particularly is that the case in relation to those matters which are well recognised as potentially calling for warnings.  
       
        
      GROUND 3. VERDICT UNSAFE AND UNSATISFACTORY 
       
      46 This ground was confined to the question of whether, upon the evidence, the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant:  
      M 
       (1994) 181 CLR 487 and  
      Jones 
       (1997) 72 ALJR 78. 
       
      47 The matters relied upon included the circumstance that the complainant's evidence was uncorroborated, the delay in complaint, the complainant's mistake as to the time of the relevant events, her age at the time, the suggested inherent unlikelihood of the night events that were said to have given rise to one of the indecent assault charges, the contradiction in the complainant's evidence as to the sequence of the events involved in the night incident, the suggested improbability that the complainant would have gone along with the appellant on the muster had she been assaulted the night before, the later contact or association between them, the fact that the appellant gave sworn evidence denying the offences, and the fact that he was corroborated as to some of those matters of detail by his wife. Counsel also placed reliance upon the remarks passed by the trial judge when sentencing the appellant, which focused upon her vagueness as to the relevant date, the lack of corroboration and the delay in complaint, all of which were said to have been indicative of some unease in his mind as to the verdict.  
       
      48 It needs to be immediately observed that any unease that his Honour felt in this regard was not accompanied by a certificate under s 6 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
      , or by any report for the assistance of this Court. Moreover, the three matters identified are common features in trials of this kind, each being understandable consequences of the complex human relationships that are involved in cases of child sexual assault. They are properly to be taken into account when considering this ground, but only so long as they are examined in context, and with due respect to the advantage the jury is still to be taken as having enjoyed in the assessment of the witnesses:  
      Chidiac 
       (1991) 17 CLR 432. 
       
      49 The reasons for the delay in complaint were unsurprising and not unreasonable. The uncertainty as to the timing of the weekend, although of considerable legal significance for the first two counts, was of no great significance for the complainant's credibility. She had pinpointed the incidents to a particular weekend from the outset, her evidence as to the visit to the appellant's home for the muster was unchanged and it was accepted by all involved that there was such a visit. The age of the complainant, particularly by the time of the trial, was not such as to invite concern; nor does it seem to me that any differences in the complainant's account of the night incidents were of any great moment. They concerned, for example, whether the appellant lay on her before or after she cried out, ""No""; whether there was a door from the lounge room to the kitchen, or whether the bed in which she slept was placed up against the common wall or somewhere else. Those were matters of detail, of no real moment, as to which memories may well be uncertain.  
       
      50 The circumstance that the complainant went on the muster the following day is again not inherently improbable. She has been successful in managing to rebuff the appellant the night before, and the activity planned was of an entirely different nature, in which a job outdoors had to be completed. Moreover, I am unable to conclude that the night events were inherently improbable. Experience does show that sexual assault of children does often occur within homes, where others are present, and in circumstances where some risk of discovery exists. In this case the appellant, on the complainant's account, desisted once she made her views known, and without the need for any great deal of effort on her part.  
       
      51 Again I do not consider the fact of post-incident contact for horse-related activities to be inherently inconsistent with the complainant's account. In the circumstances described, the opportunity for, and the risk of unwanted sexual advances on those occasions, was remote. 
       
      52 After an independent review of the evidence, and taking these matters into account, I am not persuaded that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the appellant's guilt. Accordingly I would propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
       
        
      SENTENCE 
       
      53 His Honour expressly took into account the excellent subjective circumstances of the appellant in finding special circumstances, so as to alter the usual statutory proportion in favour of the appellant. He also properly recognised that severely deterrent sentences for child sexual assault are required:  
      Fisher 
       (1989) 40 ACR 442 and  
      Baxter 
       CCA NSW 26 May 1994, unreported. 
       
      54 The question that exercised my mind is whether an overall sentence of six years, representing 75 per cent of the maximum prescribed under the Act, was manifestly excessive for a one-off offence of this kind involving a fifteen year old girl, without any element of force or abuse of trust, and committed by a person whose antecedents were assessed by the sentencing judge as incapable of being bettered. 
       
      55 While sentencing statistics of the kind placed before us need to be viewed with care, and are subject to the limitations that are associated with sample size, the range of activities encompassed particularly within an offence of the kind charged and the inevitable variation in objective and subjective circumstances, they do serve, in the instant case, to show that a full term of six years falls towards the top of the range of sentences recorded. Although at the top of the range it is, by definition, within range, and cannot therefore in my view be said to be manifestly excessive. The offence was one involving penile penetration of a girl under sixteen years. Such conduct properly attracts the condemnation of the community, and the element of general deterrence remains a very important factor. 
       
      56 In the present case the favourable subjective circumstances were properly taken into account, in extending the additional term. I am unpersuaded that his Honour fell into error.  
       
      57 While I would grant leave to appeal against sentence, in my view the appeal should fail.  
       
      58 Accordingly, the formal orders that I would propose are: 
       
      59 1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted. 
       
      60 2) The appeal against conviction and sentence be dismissed. 
       
      61 3) The conviction and sentence below be confirmed. 
       
      62 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Justice Wood. 
       
      63 MCINERNEY J: I agree also. 
       
      64 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are as indicated by Justice Wood.

       REGINA v Robert Paul HOWLAND 
        
        
       
       
      Held (By the Court):  
       
       
      1.  
      Driving “in a manner dangerous” pursuant to s52(1)(c) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 constitutes an alternative to driving which occurred in circumstances of excessive speed or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The focus must therefore be on the conduct constituting the driving “in a manner dangerous”. 
       
        
       
      2.  
      His Honour’s exercise of the sentencing discretion erred in two respects. First, by failing to give appropriate weight to the objective seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum penalty. Secondly, by failing to give weight to the need for deterrence of others

       NSWCCA 30 October 1997 applied;  
      R v Jurisic 
       NSWCCA 12 October 1998 considered. 
       
       
      3.  
      This is not a case of momentary inattention or misjudgment on the part of the driver, but one of deliberate conduct on the part of the driver who took a calculated risk in the circumstances.  
       
        
       
      4.  
      This is not a case in which the second guideline in  
      Jurisic 
       is appropriate as a basis for sentencing. The conduct involved did not indicate an abandonment of responsibility in the sense identified in  
      Jurisic 
      .

       REGINA v Robert Paul HOWLAND 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
      1  
      SPIGELMAN CJ: 
       This is a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence imposed on Robert Paul Howland who was found guilty by a jury on 24 June 1998 of the offence that on 8 March 1997 at Wallsend he drove a vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person whereby the vehicle became involved in an impact as a result of which John Skyrus was killed. 
       
      2  
      This is a crime under s52A(1) of the  
      Crimes Act  
      (NSW) 1900 for which, at the relevant time, the maximum penalty was ten years. 
       
      3  
      Howland contested his guilt during the trial. However, the jury found him guilty. 
       
      4  
      The basic facts were as follows. On 8 March 1997, the respondent was driving a Daihatsu tipper truck north along Cowper Road at Wallsend. As he approached the intersection with Minmi Road, the traffic lights changed from green to orange. He was travelling behind another car which stopped at the lights. Howland directed the truck he was driving around the inside of that stationary motor vehicle and proceeded across the intersection. In doing so he collided with a motor cycle crossing the intersection and driven by the deceased, John Skyrus. 
       
      5  
      A number of eye-witnesses to the accident gave evidence before his Honour. This included the respondent, a passenger in the truck and other people present at the intersection. On the basis of hearing the whole of the evidence and seeing the witnesses, his Honour made two crucial findings of fact which were not challenged and could not seriously be challenged before us. 
       
      6  
      First, his Honour found that the deceased did not jump the lights. He only commenced to move the motor cycle, and even then did so slowly, after the lights turned green in his favour. His Honour expressly held, ""There was certainly no fault at all by the victim."" 
       
      7  
      Secondly, his Honour rejected the evidence of Howland that the car in front of him had jammed on its brakes quickly so that, ""He had a choice of either hitting the vehicle in front or going through the intersection."" His Honour expressly rejected this version of the case, propounded by the respondent and his passenger, on the basis of the other witnesses who observed the accident. His Honour found: 
       
       ""There was no sudden braking and...they had pulled up in a normal fashion."" 
       
      8  
      His Honour mentioned the seriousness of the offence. He then proceeded to identify certain other factors which he took into account in determining the sentence. First, his Honour said: 
       
       ""In the prisoner's favour there is no evidence of any excess speed. The vehicle pulled up within a reasonable time on the other side of the intersection. There is certainly no evidence of any drinking or drug taking as is often the case in cases involving driving in a manner dangerous and causing death. There have been a number of cases where people have been heavily affected by intoxicating liquor or drugs and cases where there was dangerous driving for some considerable time before the incident leading to the death. These are all absent in this present case."" 
       
      9  
      Subsection 52A(1) which creates the relevant offence applies in three different circumstances in relation to dangerous driving occasioning death. These are, firstly, where the driver was under the influence of liquor or drugs; secondly, where driving was at a dangerous speed; and thirdly, and alternatively, where the driver was driving the vehicle ""in a manner dangerous"". It was the last of these three alternatives with which the respondent was charged and of which he was convicted. 
       
      10  
      It is plain that the Parliament intended that driving in a manner dangerous was an alternative to driving which occurred in circumstances of excessive speed or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. While such factors are often present in accidents causing death on the highway, the focus must be on the conduct constituting the driving in ""a manner dangerous"". 
       
      11  
      It has long been established that even momentary inattention may amount to driving in a manner dangerous. I refer to  
      R v Coventry 
       (1939) 59 CLR 633 at 638-639; also  
      R v LKP 
       (1993) 69 ACrimR 159 at 162. It will be necessary to consider whether or not the facts as submitted by counsel appearing for the respondent constituted a momentary misjudgment in accordance with those authorities. 
       
      12  
      His Honour identified a number of subjective matters which were relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion. In this regard his Honour referred to the youth of the respondent and the fact that he had no criminal convictions and only one speeding fine. His Honour outlined certain references that were tendered on behalf of the respondent, emphasising and establishing his remorse and his general good character.  
       
      13  
      His Honour concluded that the respondent was ""unlikely to ever drive in such a fashion again"". 
       
      14  
      Such considerations of personal deterrence are significant in the sentencing process. 
       
      15  
      The Crown challenges the sentence of eighteen months periodic detention on the basis of its inadequacy. 
       
      16  
      The sentence in this case was handed down on Friday 14 August 1998. A few months later, on 12 October 1998, this Court handed down judgment in the case of  
      R v Jurisic 
       (unreported) 
      , 
       which constituted the first sentencing guideline judgment. In that case, the Court propounded a guideline with respect to sentencing for s52A of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , the section involved in this case. 
       
      17  
      It is not necessary to refer in detail to my judgment in  
      Jurisic 
      , with which four other members of the Court agreed. In that judgment I traced the history of sentencing with respect to such offences. I noted how community concern about the conduct of dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm had grown, and said: 
       
       ""The level of community concern about the conduct proscribed by s52A, as reflected in the substantial increase in the maximum penalties, must be reflected in the sentences which trial courts impose. The concerns manifested by Parliament in this way must be given effect to by the Court."" 
       
      18  
      In that judgment I also referred to a clear pattern of inadequate sentencing for this particular offence. I said: 
       
       ""Despite clear indications from this Court concerning the seriousness of this offence, there has been a continued flow of, almost invariably successful, Crown appeals from sentences for offences under s52A."" 
       
      19  
      On a number of occasions this Court had indicated, as reiterated in  
      Jurisic, 
       that a sharp upward movement in penalty was appropriate for this offence. Furthermore, there were clear indications of a lack of consistency in sentencing, for which some form of guideline was appropriate. 
       
      20  
      The two guidelines propounded by the five person Bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
      Jurisic 
       were as follows:  
       
       ""1. A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgment. 
       
       2. With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in a case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional."" 
       
      21  
      It is not necessary for present purposes to recite the list of aggravating factors to which I referred in my judgment in  
      Jurisic 
      . As his Honour Judge Job noted, few were present in the present case. There was no evidence of significant speeding or intoxication or substance abuse, competitive driving or showing off, or a long journey which exposed many people to risk, or escaping police. 
       
      22  
      On the other hand, there was no plea of guilty for which, in accordance with the Court's traditional policy, a discount of substance was appropriate. 
       
      23  
      The factors which seemed to weigh significantly with his Honour are factors which are not uncommon with respect to this particular offence. Young men, frequently of good character, commit this offence. Understandably, they and their families find it difficult to accept that a person, otherwise of good character, should serve a term of imprisonment in the same way as a person who is prone to criminal conduct. 
       
      24  
      The issue before the Court concerns in part the significant weight that his Honour gave to certain personal circumstances of the respondent in determining the sentence. In doing so, his Honour failed, in my opinion, to take into account the matters identified originally by Hunt CJ at CL in the case of  
      Musumeci  
      (NSW CCA 30 October 1997), which were adopted by the five person Court in  
      Jurisic  
      supra at pp 29-31. Relevant points were: 
       
       ""Such is the need for public deterrence in this type of case, the youth of any offender is given less weight as a subjective matter than in other types of cases. 
       
       The Court must tread warily in showing leniency for good character in such cases. 
       
       So far as youthful offenders of good character who are guilty of dangerous driving therefore, the sentence must be seen to have a reasonable proportionality to the objective circumstances of the crime, and persuasive subjective circumstances must not lead to inadequate weight being given to those objective circumstances. 
       
       Periodic detention has a strong element of leniency built into it and, as presently administered, it is usually no more punitive than a community service order."" 
       
      25  
      As I indicated in my judgment in  
      Jurisic 
       as quoted above, a non-custodial sentence for an offence under s52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgment. Judges of the District Court who impose sentences outside the framework of this guideline will need to explain why they have done so. 
       
      26  
      Of course, Judge Job did not have the advantage of the  
      Jurisic  
      guidelines. The principal explanation that his Honour has given for imposing a non-custodial sentence on the respondent was the subjective factors to which I have referred. Even before  
      Jurisic 
      , it was clearly established in this Court that such circumstances rarely justify such a sentence.  
      Jurisic  
      reinforced that line of authority in clear and specific terms. 
       
      27  
      The respondent was found to have committed the act of driving “in a manner dangerous"". The reason why a substantial penalty is appropriate in this case is not simply because of that conduct, but because of the consequences of the conduct in the specific case, namely, the death of Mr Skyrus. It is the fact that driving dangerously so often leads to consequences of this character that the conduct is to be regarded as a crime of seriousness. 
       
      28  
      In my opinion, the short sentence of periodic detention in this case is outside any reasonable exercise of the sentencing discretion, subject to dealing with one submission made on behalf of the respondent in this Court. It was said that the incident should be regarded as a case of ""momentary inattention or misjudgment"". This is a formulation which has appeared in the cases over a long period of time and is picked up in the guideline laid down in  
      Jurisic 
      , as I have quoted it above. 
       
      29  
      I am unable to see any other circumstance which would justify a non-custodial sentence in the present case. Accordingly, in my opinion, the success of this appeal turns on whether the respondent has made good the submission made on his behalf that this was a case of ""momentary inattention or misjudgment"".  
       
      30  
      In order to determine this question, the two findings of fact by his Honour, which I have set out above, are of great significance. First, his Honour found that the deceased did not jump the lights and that he proceeded slowly across the intersection after his lights had turned green. Secondly, his Honour found that the vehicle in front of the truck driven by the respondent did not apply its brakes suddenly. Rather, it came to a halt in a normal fashion. 
       
      31  
      Whilst rejecting the evidence of the respondent in both these respects, his Honour did not otherwise identify with any degree of precision the nature of the driving “in a manner dangerous"" which is the central element of the offence. 
       
      32  
      His Honour noted as a fact: 
       
       ""There was evidence before me that the lights were red when the prisoner drove through the intersection."" 
       
       It appears that his Honour accepted that evidence.  
       
      33  
      His Honour also said: 
       
       ""In the prisoner's favour there is no evidence of any excess speed. The vehicle pulled up within a reasonable time on the other side of the intersection."" 
       
      34  
      However, his Honour also found, relevant to the prior case law and the decision in  
      Jurisic 
      : 
       
       ""I do not regard the driving of the prisoner as merely being a momentary inattention. It may have been that he was not paying attention to the lights ahead and he realised too late that they were changing."" 
       
      35  
      In an interview with police, the respondent had indicated, in the context of asserting that the car in front of him had slammed on its brakes, that he was aware of the car in front of him and that both cars were coming to a set of lights. His explanation of what happened was as follows: 
       
       ""I didn't believe that I could stop in time so I went, went to the left, and feeling that if I did manage to stop I'd be halfway across the intersection. I put it back a gear and floored it and then I seen a motorbike sitting in front of me..."". 
       
      36  
      In his evidence during the course of the trial, the respondent said: 
       
       ""As I was approaching the lights I was following the Datsun in the middle lane, that would be lane number 2, and the lights changed orange. And when the lights changed orange the car in front of me slammed on the brakes, stopped quickly. I felt that I did not have time to stop for that to stop without hitting the vehicle in front of me so I moved to the left-hand lane and once I moved to the left-hand lane and actually passed the vehicle I was already on the intersection... 
       
       My view to myself was that I knew I wouldn't be able to stop so I had all intentions of proceeding through the orange light. However I did not expect the silver car in front of me to stop and that to stop as quickly as he did as well..."". 
       
      37  
      The respondent estimated that he was fifty metres from the lights and that the car in front of him was twenty-five to thirty metres closer than that. He went on to give the further evidence: 
       
       ""I did not jump on the brakes, I didn't slam on the brakes knowing that the wheels would lock up on the truck and I'd lose control so I applied the brakes gently then released the brakes to steer the truck to the left-hand side so I slowed down a little bit, I wouldn't say a hell of a lot, a little bit and I've steered it to the left-hand side and once I was past the vehicle I was well in the intersection...so I put it back a gear and accelerated as to get out of the intersection not to cause any confusion for any other vehicle once their lights changed. At this particular time I went back through the gears, applied the accelerator, started veering to the right a little bit as the road forms into one lane so I could back in the middle lane that I was previously in and then off to my left-hand side in the peripheral vision I noticed movement."" 
       
      38  
      His Honour's express finding that the car in front did not suddenly brake puts the respondent's version in a completely different light. The combined effect of this finding and the finding that the motorcyclist proceeded slowly after his lights had turned green indicate that this was not a case of momentary inattention of a character which can happen to any driver on the road. Rather it was a case in which the driver took a calculated risk to run the red light. In view of the action taken by the respondent in changing lanes and then accelerating, on his own version of the facts, he took the risk of running the light. 
       
      39  
      As his Honour Judge Job found, there is nothing to suggest mere momentary inattention. The conduct was of a deliberate character. It involved two distinct acts, albeit occurring within a short period of time: First, changing lanes to get around the car that had stopped, and secondly, accelerating to get through the intersection. These acts do not suggest momentary inattention or misjudgment. 
       
      40  
      His Honour's exercise of the sentencing discretion erred in two respects. First, by failing to give appropriate weight to the objective seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum penalty. Secondly, by failing to give weight to the need for general deterrence - the deterrence to others from engaging in irresponsible conduct that so often results in death or serious injury. 
       
      41  
      As to the first error, the community has indicated that it wishes to denounce this conduct in the strongest terms. The premium on human life which our society accepts as a fundamental value is such that culpable conduct which kills must be treated as a serious crime. By the increases in the maximum sentences, the community, acting through the Parliament, has indicated that this is a crime which it wishes to denounce and deter. It is the duty of the judges to reflect this community concern. 
       
      42  
      The second factor is the need to deter others from engaging in the conduct which might lead to the commission of this offence. Judge Job made no express reference to this factor. There is, and has been for many years, a debate as to the deterrence value of imprisonment. Judges will differ in their opinions with respect to this matter. It is perfectly appropriate for sentencing to vary, within reasonable bounds, to reflect such differences of opinion, being differences which judges share with members of the community as a whole. The emphasis, however, is on the reasonable bounds.  
       
      43  
      Sentencing has always been based on the acceptance of the proposition that condign punishment of offenders will have a deterrent effect on others.  
       
      44  
      In order to have this deterrent effect, sentencing practice of the courts must reflect a consistency in approach. That is what this Court sought to achieve in  
      Jurisic 
      . This is an offence most often committed by young men. Young men in our community must understand that if you drive dangerously and kill someone, you will go to gaol. 
       
      45  
      In my opinion, a period of imprisonment was the only appropriate penalty for this offence.  
       
      46  
      The matters relevant to the determination of the appropriate level of a custodial sentence include the various subjective factors to which Judge Job referred, as indicated above. These are factors in mitigation. The absence of a plea of guilty means that no discount is appropriate in that regard. 
       
      47  
      In  
      Jurisic 
       the Court noted by way of the second guideline that in the case of a plea of guilty, a term of imprisonment of three years in the case of driving causing death was appropriate where a factor, involving the conduct of the offender, which suggested that the offender abandoned responsibility for his own conduct was present to a material degree.  
       
      48  
      In the present case, there is no basis for such a finding. The dangerous driving was constituted by taking the risk involved in running the red light. This was the conduct which constituted the ""manner dangerous"" and there is nothing to indicate that it occurred in a fashion that involved an aggravating factor which could be described as abandoning responsibility for his own conduct. 
       
      49  
      The Crown in its appeal sought to rely on the reference to erratic driving as such a factor in the list of aggravating factors set out at page 36 of my judgment in  
      Jurisic 
      . That list was not intended to be exhaustive. It is not, in my opinion, appropriate in this case to identify the driving as erratic. There was a single occasion in which a decision was made to run the red light.  
       
      50  
      For the reasons I have indicated, this was not a momentary misjudgment. Nevertheless, the conduct involved did not indicate an abandonment of responsibility in the sense identified in  
      Jurisic. 
       There will be few cases in which the very facts relied on to constitute the offence in terms of dangerous driving will also constitute a factor of aggravation. That will be the case for an aggravating factor which is a question of degree, for example, speed. 
       
      51  
      This was not a case in which the driving could be described as “erratic”. There was, for example, no weaving in and out of traffic over a period. Accordingly, this is not a case in which the second guideline identified in  
      Jurisic  
      is appropriate to be a basis for sentencing. 
       
      52  
      We are left with a situation in which the objective seriousness of the offence indicates the need for a significant period of detention. There are, on the other side, the various subjective factors, including the good character, the absence of a prior record and the remorse expressed by the respondent. There is also a significant element frequently referred to as the element of double jeopardy involved in a Crown appeal, in which a person convicted of an offence has adjusted over a period of some time to the fact that he would have a lower sentence, in this case a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. 
       
      53  
      The appropriate test when the principle of double jeopardy applies is as set out in  
      Rose  
      NSWCCA 22 May 1996 at p3, as applied in  
      Jurisic 
       at 39, and it is as follows: 
       
       ""The least sentence that could properly have been imposed upon the respondent at first instance."" 
       
      54  
      The least sentence is less than one may usually expect for the serious offence of taking the risk of running a red light. It is the principle of double jeopardy that impinges on this case so that the least sentence that is appropriate on the facts of this case should not be regarded as the appropriate sentence for future offences of this nature. It is one of the most basic rules of the road that lights must be obeyed. Lights are placed on intersections where, either by reason of their configuration or the flow of traffic, accidents are prone to occur. We know in this community all too well that accidents frequently can lead to either death or serious injury. 
       
      55  
      In my view, the least sentence in the present circumstances was a period of eighteen months imprisonment. In the present case by reason of the factors identified by his Honour and the additional element of double jeopardy involved in a Crown appeal, I find there are special circumstances which would justify a longer than one-third additional term as referred to in s5(3) of the  
      Sentencing Act 
       1989 Accordingly, in my view the sentence should be divided into a minimum term of nine months and an additional term of nine months. 
       
      56  
      I would propose the following orders: 
       
       1 The Crown appeal against the sentence is upheld. 
       
       2 The sentence of periodic detention imposed by Job DCJ is quashed. 
       
       3 The sentence of disqualification of the respondent from holding a driver's licence for the period of three years is affirmed. 
       
       4 The respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of eighteen months, to comprise a minimum term of nine months commencing on 22 August 1998 and expiring on 21 May 1999, on which date the respondent is to be released on parole, and an additional term of nine months commencing on 22 May 1999.

       REGINA v. CHRISTIAN MATTHEW GILLETT 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: 
       
      1  
      Christian Matthew Gillett was indicted before me on a charge that on 5 April 1998 at Mona Vale in the State of New South Wales he did maliciously wound Keith Gillett, his father. 
       
      2  
      Although the former Chief Justice has issued Practice Note 98 in respect of the presentation of indictments in this court in respect of charges other than murder, piracy, treason and offences which are required by statute to be prosecuted in this court, the matter has proceeded here since the accused was originally indicted in this court for murder, however the Crown has elected to proceed only for malicious wounding, there being some doubt as to whether the death of Mr. Keith Gillett was occasioned by the acts of the accused. The accused had been arraigned in this court and committed to this court. The matter has been listed here and all the evidence may be conveniently given. 
       
      3  
      The accused had elected, by a written election of 5 November 1998 signed by him, for trial by judge alone pursuant to s.32 of the Criminal Procedure Act. That election records, as is required by s.32(1)(b), that the accused received advice from Siobhan Mullany, solicitor, in relation to the election and that as required by s.32(3), the prosecutor, T.R. Hoyle, SC., consents to the election on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The evidence has been provided to me in documentary form in a convenient volume by consent. This volume is marked Exhibit A. In all the circumstances I would not in the exercise of my discretion under s.16A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, reject the indictment. 
       
      4  
      The matter can conveniently proceed in this court. 
       
      5  
      The evidence discloses events of a deeply tragic nature affecting the accused and his father and mother. 
       
      6  
      Shortly, written admissions under s.184 of the Evidence Act tendered before me, record that the accused on the advice of his lawyer, Mr. D. Humphreys of the Legal Aid Commission, admits that as at 5 April 1998 he resided with his father, the deceased, at 27 Surf View Road, Mona Vale and was observed shortly after 10.00 am that day running from that residence. At 10.18 am, the ambulance station at Narrabeen received a call to attend to a male who had been assaulted at that address and upon the police arriving at 10.22 am, Keith Gillett, a double amputee, was found lying on the floor behind his wheelchair suffering from wounds that had clearly been inflicted by a mattock which was lying a short distance away. He informed the police that he had been attacked by the accused with the mattock. 
       
      7  
      Statements show that at 10.05 am on 6 April 1998, after visiting his mother's place of work, the accused was apprehended by police and taken to North Sydney Police Station where he participated in an electronically recorded interview. At the time of his apprehension, he appears to have been delusional, as is evidenced by his statements to the arresting police. 
       
      8  
      The transcript of the electronically recorded interview has been tendered in evidence. Many of the answers contained in it, as are noted by Dr. Nielssen, psychiatrist, in his report of 30 November 1998, are indicative of the accused suffering from mental illness acutely at that time. Dr. Nielssen, who gave oral evidence before me this morning, confirmed this. The accused denied that he had attacked his father. He appears to have asserted that denial while of the view that to do such a thing as was alleged to a man he liked would be terrible and thus it would have been unlikely for him to have so acted, although he also claimed a lack of memory for the relevant period. 
       
      9  
      Also tendered in evidence is the statement of Natalie Anne Rosa who saw the accused run from the house shortly prior to the ambulance arriving (and therefore shortly after the attack), the statements of the police officers to whom the accused's father complained of the attack on him by the accused, the ambulance officers' statements and those of medical practitioners establishing the severity of the wounds to Mr. Gillett and that he died on 15 April 1998 during his recovery from those wounds. 
       
      10  
      In addition, there was evidence from the accused's mother that from the age of 14 his behaviour had commenced to change until it became obvious by his late teens that the accused was suffering from a psychiatric illness. Over the years the police have had to be called on a number of occasions and the accused was, in about 1990, admitted to and assessed at the Royal North Shore Hospital, Cummins Unit. Whilst at this unit he medicated regularly. 
       
      11  
      Mrs. Gillett states that on about 6 May 1991, the accused attacked her with an iron bar, occasioning her severe injuries. He was apprehended and whilst detained at Long Bay Gaol was diagnosed by Dr. Westmore as suffering from schizophrenia and from that time on was medicated regularly with Haldol, complying with a community treatment order administered most recently through the Mona Vale Hospital. She remained in constant contact with Keith and Christian although living apart from them since the 1991 attack, the father and son having continued living together. She became aware that during the last six months, the accused had been using alcohol. 
       
      12  
      The attack is entirely consistent, in the opinion of the psychiatrists, Dr. Westmore who provided reports dated 14 April 1998 and 16 November 1998 and Dr. Nielssen who provided a report dated 30 November 1998 and gave oral evidence this morning, with that on the mother and with the accused's condition, as the psychiatrists diagnosed it. 
       
      13  
      Their reports disclose that they are both of the view that the accused was, at the time of the wounding of his father, suffering acutely from a psychosis, schizophrenia; that even if he were aware of the nature and quality of his act, he would have been deprived, on the balance of probability, from knowing that he ought not to do the act. 
       
      14  
      Dr. Nielssen, who has cared for the accused in the gaol system since shortly after his arrest, gave evidence and confirmed the diagnosis that he agreed with the view of Dr. Westmore. 
       
      15  
      Dr. Nielssen's report was provided to the Crown, puts the matter as follows:- 
       
       ""Mr. Gillett has a severe disabling form of mental illness which developed after a prodromal illness during which there was a marked disturbance of conduct, followed by the onset of acute psychotic symptoms of auditory hallucinations, ideas of reference and persecutory delusional beliefs."" 
       
      16  
      The doctor went on to characterise the condition as schizophrenia and to note that the assault on the mother occurred during an acute episode induced by taking hallucinogenic trips and that the acute episode which resulted in the attack on the father was similarly induced; these episodes were characterised by the hallucinations, ideas of reference and persecutory delusional beliefs referred to:- 
       
       ""The reason Mr. Gillett assaulted his father was that he believed his father was trying to kill him and he [was] prompted by persuasive auditory hallucinations arising from an acute exacerbation of his chronic mental illness. 
       
       I believe Mr. Gillett has the defence of mental illness open to him. He had a defect of reason in the form of a delusional belief that his father planned to kill him, owing to a disease of the mind, an acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia. He was aware of the nature and quality of his act but did not realise that the act was wrong, as he believed that his father was actually planning to harm him and he was prompted by persuasive auditory hallucinations."" 
       
      17  
      On the accused's arrival at the Corrective Services institution following his arrest, he was diagnosed as floridly psychotic. Subsequently he has, on medication, been restored to his previous level of functioning and has received treatment with anti-depressant medication and counselling to help him accept the loss of his father. There is no issue but that he was fit to plead, and to make the election for trial and the admissions I have referred to above. There is plainly sufficient evidence he committed the acts which would have, except for the effect of mental illness, constituted the offence. 
       
      18  
      To Dr. Nielssen he confessed that he had attacked his father in response to a voice saying ""Axe him"", although this admission was made at a time when he was suffering from disordered thought, his cognitive function being clearly affected by the presence of the chronic mental illness. 
       
      19  
      He had, to Dr. Westmore, on that doctor's initial examination on 11 April 1998, asserted that he wasn't there at the time and that he was not sure who had hurt his father. He had denied any memory of the incident later in the interview. He had denied the attack to Dr. Nielssen at one stage. 
       
      20  
      Notwithstanding his denials which no doubt proceed from a lucid realisation of the circumstances of the tragedy and a desire to reject his role in it, on considering the whole of the evidence I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused inflicted the wounds the victim suffered and that those wounds were inflicted with intent to injure:  
      Regina v. Stokes & Difford  
      (1990) 51 A. Crim. R. 25. Subject to the matter to which I will turn shortly, I am satisfied of all the elements of the offence of which the accused is charged beyond reasonable doubt. The presence of the accused at the scene, his fleeing the scene, the very nature of the attack and its consistency with his mental condition support my conclusion that those elements are made out to the requisite standard. 
       
      21  
      There remains however, the matter of mental illness. It is only necessary that this be established on balance of probabilities. I am entirely satisfied that the accused was mentally ill. The doctors are both of the view that the accused was, at the relevant time, psychotic. Their evidence in this respect is consistent with previous diagnoses and the relevant events. Their views are unanimous and unchallenged. I accept them. Therefore I find that at the time of the commission of the acts, the accused had the defence provided for those suffering from mental illness so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions. That is to say he was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong:  
      Regina v. M'Naghten 
       (1843) 8 ER 718;  
      Regina v. Porter 
       (1936) 55 CLR 182 at 188; and s.38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1900. 
       
      22  
      Being so satisfied, I return the special verdict required by s.38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, that is, that the accused is not guilty by reason of mental illness and make the order required by s.39 of that Act, that is, that he be detained in such place and in such manner as the court thinks fit until released by due process of law. 
       
      23  
      Christian Matthew Gillett, I order that you be detained in strict custody at the A Ward of the Long Bay Prison Hospital and thereafter in such other place as is determined according to law until you are released by due process of law.

       REGINA v BRIAN DAVIS 
       
       
      The appellant was convicted of several sexual offences against a child under ss 66 A, 61 M(2) and 61 O(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      . He was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for 6 years with an additional term of 2 years for one of the counts; and to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for 2 years for the other two counts. 
       
       
      He appealed against the conviction and sought leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence, on grounds that: (1) the trial judge gave insufficient directions concerning the reliability of the complainant’s evidence; (2) the trial judge erred in his directions concerning the appellant’s election not to give evidence; and (3) the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory.

      (1)  
      The extent of any exploration of the evidence and of the issues, in the summing up, is to be assessed in the context of the trial itself. The trial judge is not required in every case to identify and repeat points made by defence counsel and the relevant evidence. Counsel should disclose whether they seek more from the judge by way of summary of the evidence and the submissions.

      (2)  
      The need for a warning under s 165 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      , absent any request by counsel, is discretionary. The “obligation” to give a warning only arises, pursuant to s 165(2), if a party in a jury trial requests it. Otherwise the giving of the warning depends upon an assessment whether in the light of the evidence, and the way the trial was conducted, a question ariss as to the reliability of the complainant, such as to call for a warning, out of fairness to the accused.

      Directions as to the appellant’s election not to give evidence 
       
      (6) Ordinarily, it will be necessary, in giving such a direction, to refer to the possibility that the accused may have reasons for remaining silent. However the rule is not expressed in absolute terms. Although the trial judge should have referred to that possibility, the appellant did not suffer any miscarriage of justice by reason of the omission.

     REGINA v BRIAN DAVIS 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I will ask Mr Justice Wood to give the first judgment.2 WOOD CJ AT CL: The appellant was on 14 April 1997 indicted in the District Court at Muswellbrook on counts of indecent assault of a child under ten years (Crimes Act s 61M(2)); sexual intercourse with a child under ten years (s 66A); and incitement of a child under ten years to commit an act of indecency with himself (s 61O(2)). 3 The jury found him guilty in relation to each count, and he was sentenced, in relation to the second count, to a minimum term of penal servitude for six years with an additional term of two years. In relation to the other two counts, he was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for two years. 4 It was the Crown case that the offences occurred on the same day, 4 May 1996, at the home of the appellant. Those premises were located some seven kilometres down a gravel road from the complainant's own home. A friendship had developed between her stepfather and the appellant over the period October 1993 to May 1996.5 On Friday 3 May 1996 the appellant invited her stepfather over to his home for a drink. The complainant accompanied him and she stayed overnight with the appellant and his two sons. She was aged nine years at the time. 6 On the following afternoon the appellant, his sons and the complainant returned to her home. They remained there for a while, during which time the appellant and her stepfather consumed a quantity of alcohol, watched television and had a meal. Later the complainant left with the appellant and his sons to return to his home, it having been decided that the complainant could spend another night there. 7 During the journey home the appellant sat in the driver's seat of his vehicle; the complainant sat on his lap and took control of the steering wheel. While in that position the appellant put his hand up her shirt and touched her on the breasts. He asked her whether she liked it; she said, ""No"". That gave rise to the first count.8 When they arrived at the appellant's home they all went to his bedroom to watch television. The boys sat on the floor. The appellant lay on his bed and the complainant sat at the end of the bed. The appellant told her to lie down and to roll on her side. He then asked her to take her clothes off. She refused to comply with that request. She said that the appellant then removed her clothes and placed his penis in her ""bottom"". He told her to roll over and he then placed his penis in her vagina. This gave rise to the second count.9 After the appellant removed his penis he instructed the complainant to touch it. She refused, whereupon he grabbed her hand and tried to push it towards himself. She broke free of his grip. She was told to dress. She went to another room where she waited for a short while. This gave rise to the third count.10 When the complainant saw that the appellant was asleep she left the house and walked home. She found her own home to be in darkness, so she climbed into the back seat of the family car where she went to sleep. She was awoken the following morning at approximately 11am by the appellant who, upon finding her missing, had gone looking for her. The appellant asked her why she had walked home. She said that she was scared of what he had done to her. He said, on her account, ""You won't tell anyone, will you?""11 The complainant's mother, who noticed that she seemed to be upset, asked her several times why she had walked home. She said to her mother, ""If you really want to know, I walked home because Brian put his doodle in my minnie."" Her mother asked her to pull down her underpants. She observed that her inner thighs and vagina were swollen and red. The complainant herself said that she experienced pain when urinating. Her stepfather was informed. He said to the appellant, ""I'm not accusing you, Brian, but C has accused you of sexual assault."" He added that she had said that the appellant had played with her breasts and had penetrated her.12 The appellant denied the allegations and claimed that any touching was accidental and that it occurred during the drive home when she had been sitting on his knee. The appellant stayed for lunch and for dinner. During the afternoon the complainant's stepfather asked her to apologise to the appellant, which she did. Her mother at one stage asked the appellant whether he had done anything to her, to which he replied, ""Oh, no, I wouldn't do anything like that.""13 On the following Tuesday the complainant's stepfather contacted police. The next day she was examined at Tamworth Base Hospital by Dr Donnelly. He gave evidence of observing a number of areas that were suggestive of tissue injury or hymenal interference, including areas of superficial abrasion that were five to seven days old in appearance. Some of those signs were consistent with sexual penetration.14 When interviewed by police on 9 May by way of a relatively detailed ERISP the appellant denied all the allegations. 15 No evidence was called at the trial in the defence case. It had, however, been put to the complainant in cross-examination that the appellant had not touched her or had sexual intercourse with her. The ERISP containing his denials was tendered in the Crown case. It was edited to some extent.16 The appellant brings an appeal against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. Four grounds of appeal were raised.  GROUND 1 - REFUSED TO GRANT LEAVE TO CROSS-EXAMINE THE COMPLAINANT UNDER S 409B OF THE CRIMES ACT17 This ground was abandoned during the hearing, as a result of the appeal in HG (1999) HCA 2 having been dismissed on 9 February last. GROUND 2 - SUFFICIENCY OF THE DIRECTIONS CONCERNING THE COMPLAINANT'S EVIDENCE18 No complaint was made at the trial concerning the sufficiency, or otherwise, of the evidence given in this regard.19 The Crown case depended upon acceptance of the evidence of the complainant, who was nine years old at the time of the alleged offences. The appellant submitted on the appeal that a Murray warning (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 should have been given, and that, additionally, warnings concerning the reliability of the complainant's evidence should have been given pursuant to s 165(1)(c) of the Evidence Act by reason of her age; pursuant to s 165(1)(a) by reason of the fact that the complaint evidence was hearsay; and generally under s 165 by reason of the considerations discussed by this Court in Vawdrey CCA NSW 16 April 1998, unreported.20 A Murray direction is appropriate where one witness stands alone in providing proof of the Crown case. That is not the present case, because there was evidence of other circumstances consistent with the complainant's evidence in the form of her distress and prompt complaint, as well as the medical evidence, and the fact of her night walk home over a lengthy distance.21 The trial judge, with the consent of the parties, summed up without reference to the evidence. That was a course properly open to him under s 405AA of the Crimes Act, in a trial that had lasted three days, in which there were only six witnesses in the Crown case and none in the defence case. On one view, that approach worked in favour of the appellant, since it avoided the one-sided appearance that may have been presented by a reiteration of the evidence called by the Crown, and silence in relation to the defence.22 Attention was, however, drawn to the observations of this Court in RJC CCA NSW 18 August 1998, unreported, as well as in Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105 and Condon (1995) 83 ACR 335 as to the need for the jury to be instructed as to the issues of fact and law which arise in a trial, and where appropriate, to have the evidence to be related to those issues. 23 Those requirements are to be understood in the light of the explanation in Domican (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 561, which was discussed as recently as yesterday by this Court in Williams NSW CCA 9, 23 February 1999 unreported. 24 The need for, and the extent of, any exploration of the evidence and of the issues, in a summing-up, is to be assessed in the context of the trial, its length, its complexity and in the light of the way that it has been run. Where the summing-up in a short trial has followed hard on the heels of a defence address, particularly where the appellant has not offered any evidence, very little is likely to be achieved by a reiteration of the evidence or of the points made by counsel in their closing addresses. To so require would be to credit the jury with little in the way of intelligence or common sense. An exercise of judgment is always required, on the part of the trial judge, to frame the summing-up in a way that is helpful to the jury. To elevate the observations in RJC and Zorad to a requirement that, in every case, regardless of its length or complexity, the trial judge must identify and repeat the points made by defence counsel, the relevant evidence, would be to go too far. Counsel should be expected to contribute in this regard, and to disclose whether they seek more, by way of summary the evidence and of the submissions, than the judge proposes. 25 The asserted inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence, which it was argued should here have been highlighted, related to the circumstance that in chief the complainant had said that the appellant had first put his penis in her ""bottom"", a matter which she agreed she had not mentioned to anyone before the trial; the fact that she gave different accounts of the position which she assumed on the bed, particularly whether she had been lying on her side or on her back when the appellant placed his penis in her vagina; the fact that in her evidence she made no mention of the appellant placing his tongue in her mouth or of his penis being erect during the sexual assault, even though she had mentioned those matters to police; and the circumstance that there had been some equivocation, on her part, as to whether she had been scared that she would get into trouble from her parents for having walked home at night.26 Further, it was submitted that various matters that may have cast doubt on the credibility of her account should have been isolated and identified for the jury's assistance: namely, that the events were alleged to have occurred in the presence of the appellant's sons, who were apparently aged about seven and nine years; that the complainant had made no effort to call for help from them; that she had made no effort to complain to residents living near the appellant or in premises that she passed on her way home; that she had not complained to her parents immediately upon arriving home, or in the early hours of the following morning; and that the immediate reaction of her parents to the complaint was one of disbelief.27 Most of these matters do not seem to me to rise above matters of detail, or to be inconsistencies of any real moment. 28 The suggested criticism relating to the absence of complaint, or calls for assistance from the appellant's sons might have had some relevance had the children, particularly the appellant's children, been older or more mature. The absence of complaint to neighbours, or to the girl's parents on getting home, seems to me understandable in the circumstances of the time and place. Her parents' reaction, even if one of disbelief, was immaterial to an assessment of her reliability. It is not, in fact, evident that they did disbelieve her, since the matter was pursued appropriately and promptly by report to the police, followed by medical examination. 29 The fact of the girl's age might usually have been mentioned to the jury, but it was a matter that must have been patently obvious to them, and it needs to be assessed in the light of the rest of the evidence, including that supportive of her account.30 The circumstance that trial counsel expressed his satisfaction with what was left, after having had one item added to the relatively brief summary which his Honour did give of his closing submissions, is a powerful indication that what was said was sufficient. The summary given was, in fact, a little more comprehensive than that extended to the Crown case. 31 Counsel for the appellant on the appeal drew our attention to the decision of this Court in BD (1997) 94 ACR 131 where Hunt CJ at CL said: ""The fact that the evidence is hearsay will attract the obligation upon the trial judge imposed by s 165 of the Evidence Act to warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, to explain why that is so, and to warn of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it."" (at 139)32 Properly understood, there can be no quarrel with that observation. However, what his Honour did not expressly make clear is that the ""obligation"", referred to in the first sentence, is that which arises under s 165(2) of the Act, namely, where a party, in a jury trial, makes a request for the appropriate warning. The passage is not to be understood as suggesting that there is a universal obligation, independent of any request, to give warnings of the kind referred to in s 165.33 The need for a warning, absent any request by counsel, is discretionary and depends upon the judge's assessment, whether in the light of the evidence, and the way the trial has been conducted, a question arises as to reliability, such as to call for a warning, out of fairness to the accused.34 In the present case there was no request and the matter fell to be considered in the light of that principle. 35 I would refuse leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to argue this ground. Before parting from this ground I do however observe that, in the summing-up his Honour makes no mention of whether the evidence of complaint went to proof of the fact asserted, or was relevant only in relation to the complainant's credit. The complaint, having been made within twenty-four hours, was ""fresh in the memory"" of the complainant at the time it was made, within the meaning of s 66 of the Evidence Act. Graham (1999) 157 ALR 404. It was admissible, as evidence of the truth of what was said, as well as a matter going to credibility, in the light of authority current at the time of the trial. Its availability for the first of those purposes is subject to re-examination in the pending appeal to the High Court in Papakosmas. GROUND 3 - DIRECTIONS CONCERNING THE ELECTION OF THE APPELLANT NOT TO GIVE EVIDENCE36 The trial judge gave lengthy directions in relation to this matter, as follows: ""Members of the jury while I am on the question of the evidence, I want to give you a direction about a particular matter. The accused in this case elected not to give evidence. The accused could have given evidence either on oath or affirmation in the witness box, as any other witness, and if he had, his evidence would have been taken into account along with all of the other evidence by you. Now I wanted to give you this direction, and it is a direction of law, which I am required to give you by the decided cases. The failure of the accused to give evidence is not an admission of guilt. You are not allowed to regard it as an admission of guilt. The accused's right to silence, his right to remain silent, which is a right that we all have if any allegation of crime is made against us, but his particular right to remain silent means that no inference of guilt can be drawn from his failure to say or do anything in his defence. That arises because of the presumption of innocence, I think which I told you about at the beginning of the case, and which is the reason why the burden of proof is on the Crown, because there is a presumption of innocence. The whole idea of this trial is that it is the Crown adducing evidence to show you that the presumption of innocence should, by your verdict of guilty, be set aside. But until your verdict of guilty, there is a presumption of innocence, that is if you reach such a verdict. The accused has a right to remain silent, and it extends to this trial as well as other periods of time between the accusation and the trial itself. As you know he has not always exercised that right of silence and he took part in an interview with the police which you have heard and of which you have a transcript. In that case he did not exercise his right to silence. Those answers to the questions in that interview with the police you must of course keep in mind, was not on oath, and was not subject to cross-examination. So you have not seen the accused testify on oath or be subjected to cross-examination. Now the only effect that his failure to give evidence may have on you is this. His failure to give evidence here may affect the value or weight that you give to the evidence of some or all of the witnesses who have testified in the trial if you think the accused was in a position to himself give evidence about the matter. His failure cannot be treated as an admission. His failure to give evidence. But it may enable you to give, to help you to evaluate the weight of other evidence in the case, that he has not give evidence. I do not want to be more specific than that, because it is a matter for you, but let me give you an example that is not related to this case to show you what I mean. If the case was one of speeding, and a police officer got in the witness box and said he was doing 100 kilometres an hour in a 60 kilometre area, and the accused, although the defendant, although he pleaded not guilty, did not testify, the judge hearing the case might say, well he has not gone into the box and contradicted that. He could have. But to put it another way, to give you the converse situation, if the defendant had gone into the witness box and said, no, that's not true, I've got a very good speedometer in my car and I was only doing 60, it would make it - those two different situations would make the magistrate's evaluation of the policeman's evidence either more difficult or easier. It is not an easy concept I know that. The accused has remained in the dock as is his right. You cannot treat that as an admission of guilt. But the fact that he has not given testimony may assist you when you come to evaluating the other evidence in the case. If when you go outside you find you have not understood what I have said at all, you must come back and ask me again, but I think you have probably got some idea what I mean, at least I hope you understand it completely. Even if the evidence that you are concerned with was evidence that was dealt with in his interview with the police, the value or weight that you give to that particular piece of evidence, may have been affected one way or another if you had observed the accused himself giving evidence. If you had seen his demeanour in the witness box, if you had heard what he had to say, if you had seen him cross-examined, all of that may have affected the way in which you look at other evidence in the case. I will just repeat that last direction again. Even if the matter of evidence that concerns you was a matter dealt with in the interview between the accused and the police, the value or weight that you give to a particular piece of evidence may have been affected one way or another if you had observed the accused himself testify on that point.""37 This ground of appeal is to be considered in the light of s 20(2) of the Evidence Act, which provides: ""The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on a failure of the defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the defendant failed to give evidence because the defendant was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned.""38 The appellant acknowledged that this section permits judicial comment upon the election of an accused not to give evidence, although it does not require such a direction to be given. Reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in OGD (1997) 98 ACR 151 where Gleeson CJ, in considering the kind of comment that would now be appropriate, subject to the qualification expressed in the second sentence of s 20(2), identified three general principles as follows: ""First, the failure of an accused person to give evidence cannot be treated as an admission, by conduct, of guilt. The reason is that, if it were otherwise, the legal right to silence would be negated (Weissensteiner (1993) 178 CLR 217 at 229; 259-260)."" ... ""Secondly, it is commonly appropriate to instruct a jury that failure to contradict or explain incriminating evidence, in circumstances where it would be reasonable to expect it to be in the power of an accused to do so, may make it easier to accept, or draw inferences from, evidence relied upon by the Crown."" ""Thirdly, it is ordinarily necessary to warn a jury that there may be reasons, unknown to them, why an accused person, even if otherwise in a position to contradict or explain evidence, remains silent.""39 Turning to the qualification upon the right to comment which is contained in the second sentence of s 20(2), his Honour said: ""it is to be observed that what is prohibited is the making of a suggestion concerning the defendant's reason for failing to give evidence. This is consistent with the general law. There is, however, a difference between a judge making a suggestion to a jury concerning an accused's reason for taking a certain course at a trial, and the judge raising for consideration, with appropriate warnings, matters which relate to that subject. The prohibition appears to be aimed principally at giving statutory support to the first of the general principles referred to above. It must not be suggested to the jury that they can regard a failure to give evidence as an implied admission of guilt. It also reinforces the third of the above principles, emphasising the need to warn a jury that there may be a number of reasons, not known to them, why an accused chooses not to give evidence.""40 It was submitted that his Honour erred in relation to the third of those general principles, since the jury were not informed that there may be reasons unknown to them why the accused, even if otherwise in a position to contradict or to explain the evidence, remained silent at his trial. 41 It was submitted that his Honour also erred in not taking up the suggestion in OGD (at 159 to 160), to enquire of counsel, in the absence of the jury whether directions should be given. The reason for that course, which his Honour described as a ""practical matter"", and one that was ""prudent"", lies in the opportunity which it gives to trial counsel ""to suggest to the judge possible reasons for the accused's silence (or the failure to call a witness) which may not have occurred to the judge, and to debate the fairness of the direction"".42 In this regard Gleeson CJ in OGD drew attention to the dilemma, which might arise for an accused, when deciding whether or not to give evidence, particularly when facing more than one charge.  “The present case provides a good example of circumstances which demonstrate the need for caution. The appellant was charged with multiple offences. It was quite possible that he had an answer to one of the charges but not to the others. It was also possible that his answer to one of the charges would have involved him in making admissions in relation to others. This was hardly a consideration which trial counsel for the accused would have wished to draw to the attention of the jury. It was, however, a consideration which should not have been overlooked by the trial judge. The explanation for the failure of the appellant to give evidence might have been that he was faced with a dilemma to which he responded by saying nothing.”43 It is to be observed that, in the third of the general principles, it was said that ""ordinarily"" it will be necessary to refer to the possibility that the accused may have reasons for remaining silent. Trial judges should not overlook this clear admonition that ordinarily they should include this aspect, within any direction that is given including a comment upon the failure of the accused to give evidence: Bargwanna CCA NSW 15 June 1998. The principle was not expressed in absolute terms, and the consequence or significance of its omission, therefore, needs to be considered when the point arises on appeal, in the context of the case and in the light of the contentious assessment of trial counsel. Moreover, it must not be overlooked that this trial was held some two months before the decision in OBD was handed down, so that the trial judge did not have the benefit of its guidance.44 The reasons that were suggested in this present appeal, as having possibly impacted upon the decision of the appellant to my mind were, at best, speculative and not such as would have caused the trial judge to not give the direction, or to modify it. In particular, I am of the view that the appellant was not at risk of being cross-examined in relation to the reasons that he had offered in the ERISP (and that were edited from the record tendered), for the girl going home. So far as any answer to a question put to him along those lines, might have involved some disclosure by him of the fact that another complaint of a similar kind, had been made against him, which might possibly have come to the notice of the complainant in the course of a chat between the appellant and her parents, that would inevitably have been excluded by reason of its prejudicial effect.45 The election to rely upon the ERISP in lieu of giving evidence, being a second matter suggested as a possible reason for the election, is a matter to which I will turn in a moment. I am not, however, convinced that it could rationally have been considered as an alternative or a substitute for sworn evidence. Nor am I convinced that the fact that the appellant had been previously convicted in a trial for sexual assault (of which he was acquitted after a successful appeal), in which he had given evidence, was a matter of much significance; that if raised, it would have led to the comment not being made, or to some modification of it. Although it would have been far better for his Honour to have referred to the possible existence of reasons why the accused may have made the election, I am not persuaded, particularly in the light of the failure of trial counsel to take the point, that the appellant suffered any miscarriage of justice by reason of the omission. 46 The appellant next submitted that the case was not one in which a Weissensteiner (1993) 178 CLR 217 direction should have been given. The direction that was in fact given accorded with that stated in Weissensteiner, and with the second of the general principles enunciated in OGD.47 Some faint complaint was made to the effect that the example his Honour gave, in relation to this aspect of the direction, was not particularly helpful, since it depended upon the hypothetical motorist having had available an independent mechanical device in the form of a speedometer, which could have supported his case. Analogy or example are not always of value for this kind of direction, although that given did serve to explain the point. Moreover, in the present case it was the fact that there was more than the evidence of the complainant to be considered. Her parents' evidence also fell to be examined by the jury, and the comment as to the election of the appellant was equally applicable to any assessment by the jury of their evidence.48 It is true, as I have observed, that the appellant had provided a detailed account of the relevant events in the ERISP. In the course of that interview, he had repudiated the complainant's allegations but had otherwise confirmed certain surrounding circumstances. It is fair to say that it was a comprehensive interview, although he maintained a denial of any misconduct. It was, at one stage, submitted during the submissions an appeal that it gained credence because it was a spontaneous denial of the allegations. That is not entirely correct. The existence of an allegation of sexual assault on the night of 4 May had come to light several days earlier. He had been directly confronted with it by the girl's mother and stepfather. He could not be said to have been taken by surprise, or to have responded spontaneously in those circumstances, when approached by the police.49 Moreover, I do not accept the proposition that the fact that an appellant has participated in an ERISP, which is before the jury, necessarily militates against giving a Weissensteiner direction. 50 The account given by an accused to police in an ERISP is far from being the equivalent of sworn evidence in a trial. I do not consider it appropriate to add a gloss to the second general principle in OGD, to the effect that a Weissensteiner direction should not be given where an ERISP is before the jury, even where the ERISP is detailed. 51 His Honour did appropriately remind the jury, in relation to the ERISP, that it was unsworn and had not been the subject of cross-examination. To my mind that was an appropriate course. It is necessary that a trial judge place before the jury the fact that an ERISP, once admitted into evidence, is available to them as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted by the accused. To not remind the jury of that circumstance would constitute an error and would potentially be unfair to the accused. However, to elevate an ERISP to the equivalence of sworn evidence, and to refrain from an observation of the kind here made would be similarly erroneous, and, on this occasion, unfair to the Crown.52 I am unpersuaded that any risk of miscarriage of justice arose in relation to this aspect of the summing-up. 53 There is some doubt as to whether trial counsel did flag an objection to the Weissensteiner direction: It is clear that the topic of a comment, as to the appellant's election not to give evidence, was the subject of discussion during the morning of the final day of evidence. The discussion is not fully recorded, but sufficient appears to make it plain that his Honour did in fact give counsel an opportunity to consider whether a direction should be given, and as to its terms.54 In those circumstances, even allowing for the uncertainty which arose as to the precise submission advanced by counsel, I am unpersuaded that any of the errors identified by counsel were made good in relation to this ground. GROUND 4 - VERDICT UNSAFE AND UNSATISFACTORY55 The submission in this regard did not depend upon the proposition that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt upon the evidence led. Rather, it was submitted that, as a result of the cumulative effect of the remaining matters, the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory in the extended sense discussed by Gaudron J in Gipp (1994) 72 ALJR 1012 at 1016. I am unpersuaded that there is any merit in those other grounds. As a consequence, I am of the view that this ground should fail.56 However, before parting from that ground, I do draw attention to a matter that was raised peripherally in relation to one of the other grounds, concerning a preliminary observation by his Honour in the following terms: ""And you are bound by my rulings of law because what I am saying to you, this is the way it works if I quickly explain it to you. All I am saying to you is being recorded. Every word I say to you is recorded and if I say something wrong the parties can seek redress in another court. They can seek redress in an appeal, in a series of appeal courts. And so if I say something wrong, there is a way of redressing that. But if you do not take notice of what I tell you, and you go out to the jury room and apply some other rule other than the one I give you, no-one will ever know about it, because I tell you now your deliberations are secret, they are not recorded anywhere, and indeed after this case is over you have a right to keep your deliberations secret, forever and a day.""57 This was a curious and distinctly unhelpful observation. It would have been entirely erroneous if it was purporting to be understood as an invitation to the the jury that they could, if they wished, ignore his Honour's directions on the law with immunity. I am not, however, persuaded that it had that flavour, or that it conveyed a message along that lines. On the contrary, it needed to be understood in its full context, and particularly in the light of the passage which followed, in the following terms: ""And so you see it is very important that you follow my directions of law because then if I misdirect you, another court can consider whether there has been a miscarriage of justice"".58 The message which I think the jury would have gained is that they must not ignore the directions on the law, since if they did take that course it would not be possible for the error that they then made to be corrected on appeal. Its purpose was to underline the importance of applying the law as the trial judge explains it, not to weaken that direction.59 Having said that, I would not seek to encourage a similar direction or observation being made in other trials.60 It follows that the appeal against conviction should, in my view, be dismissed. SENTENCE61 The prescribed maximum sentence for the second count was penal servitude for twenty years. The offence involved in that count was serious and involved a child of tender years, as well as an abuse of the trust, which her parents had placed in the appellant, as her minder for the night. It is true that there was no threat of physical violence beyond that involved in the act of penetration. It is also the fact that the three offences may properly be regarded as a continuing event without any element of premeditation. 62 None of those circumstances, however, excuses or minimises the sexual violation of a nine year old girl.63 Whether or not the sentence was manifestly excessive should be considered against the prescribed maximum penalty of twenty years. Senior counsel for the appellant has provided a very useful table of cases which show a wide range of sentences, either confirming or varying on appeal sentences that have been imposed at first instance for s 66A offences. In relation to those cases involving penile/vaginal penetration for which overall terms have been affirmed or substituted on appeal, (including Crown appeals where the principle of double jeopardy applies), it can be seen that the sentence falls within the range. In that regard I make reference to Marr CCA NSW 4 March 1993 where, following a plea of guilty, an overall term of eight years was fixed on appeal; H (1994) 74 ACR 41, where again following a plea of guilty an overall sentence of eleven years was imposed; Boyd CCA NSW 25 July 1995, where following a verdict of guilty an appeal against the severity of a sentence of five years was dismissed; and finally, Brooker CCA NSW 21 February 1996, where following a plea of guilty, on a Crown appeal, an overall sentence of seven years was imposed. 64 Similar or longer sentences to that imposed in the present case are also to be seen in appeals where there have been pleas of guilty to offences involving digital penetration, fellatio or cunnilingus: eg Moore CCA NSW 12 April 1994 (nine years); Walker CCA NSW 26 August 1994 (ten years) and Latu CCA NSW 6 July 1993 (eight years).65 Each case must necessarily be understood upon its own facts, and by reference particularly to the objective circumstances, including the number of victims involved, the duration of the offence, and the extent of sexual invasion seen. 66 In Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451 the High Court rejected the proposition that each kind of sexual penetration as defined in the section, there under consideration, was to be regarded as neither more nor less heinous than another. The Court said such a proposition cannot be accepted. It appears to me that any other view would beggar common sense, and that penile/vaginal penetration of a child is significantly more serious than many of the other forms of conduct uncompassed within s 66A. On my assessment, although the sentence is high, as can be seen upon comparison with the sentencing statistics, it is not one that was out of range. Moreover, I am not persuaded that the case was one where there were special circumstances requiring a departure from the usual proportion.67 The three matters identified in this regard were the fact that this was the first sentence of imprisonment for the appellant; secondly, that he had a dependence on alcohol; and thirdly, that outside the gaol system he might benefit by a therapeutic sexual offender treatment programme. 68 In my view none of those matters constitutes special circumstances. In particular, there is within the prison system more than sufficient by way of counselling for alcohol problems. Further, the opportunity of two years on parole is sufficient so as to permit the appellant to participate in a therapeutic treatment programme if he is so motivated. In that regard, considerable doubt must arise as to his motivation, since he maintains his innocence of the offence and denies that he is in fact a sex offender requiring treatment.69 Accordingly, the formal orders I would propose are that leave to appeal against sentence be allowed, but that the appeal against conviction and sentence be dismissed and that the sentence and conviction below be confirmed.70 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Justice Wood's reasons and the orders he proposes.71 MCINERNEY J: I agree.72 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as Justice Wood has indicated.

    1 In this trial, the Crown prosecutor gave an opening address to the jury early in the day on Wednesday, 17 February 1999. That was followed by an opening statement by counsel for the accused. On Friday 19 February, several Crown witnesses had been called and several remained to be called.2 It was at this stage of the trial that a written request was received from a member of the jury, as follows: “I request a transcript of the opening addresses by both counsel, giving an overview of the prosecution and defence, and the names of all witnesses.Juryman 27-18-044”.Juror 27-18-044 is the foreman of the jury but, as will appear, nothing seems to me to turn on that.3 Before the jury was empanelled the Crown prosecutor had read out the names of the Crown’s proposed witnesses. Several of them were again referred to by name in the course of the Crown prosecutor’s opening address.4 The Crown prosecutor’s opening address was conventional. It commenced as follows: “Ladies and gentlemen, it is, as his Honour told you, my function at this stage of the proceedings to give you a brief outline or a potted version, as it were, of the evidence which I anticipate will be led for the Crown in this trial. I use the word ‘anticipate’ because I don’t give evidence in the trial. I call witnesses. They give their evidence to you in the witness box and they may very well produce certain exhibits which will also come your way for your consideration.”Then followed a resume of the evidence intended to be called. The Crown case as outlined was that Peter Mitris was believed by the accused and a colleague to have failed to account for a consignment of illicit drugs, that the accused and his colleague had beaten Mitris to death in retribution and that the accused had arranged for disposal of the body from a launch, and that the body had not been found. The Crown prosecutor concluded his opening address as follows: “Members of the jury that is a basic outline of the case. Please don’t make up your minds yet. You haven’t heard any of the evidence. It is all very well for me to tell you what I think will fall from the lips of the witnesses. It is quite another thing for the witnesses to come along, give their evidence and you be the judge as to what you make of them, not only what they say but the way in which they say things. That is your function and yours alone. Can I just repeat before I resume my seat, that the very, very important words that his Honour said to you at the start - and I have no difficulty with you hearing them from me as the Crown Prosecutor - the Crown brings the charges, the Crown has to prove them. The accused, as he sits in court, comes here with what is called the presumption of innocence, that is, he is presumed to be innocent until the Crown, with such evidence as it is able to muster, is able to convince each and every one of you beyond a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Until such time as we have done that, he is and remains innocent and he does not have to say, tell or prove a thing in that regard. That is very important, members of the jury. Your Honour, I think that is all I need to say to the jury by way of opening.”5 In his opening statement to the jury, counsel for the accused said the defence did not concede that Peter Mitris was dead, that, if he is dead, he did not die at the hands of the accused, that the accused did not take part in any assault on Mitris as alleged, that there was no drug debt, that the accused had no other motive to harm Mitris, and that the accused was being framed. Counsel for the accused concluded his statement as follows: “So hopefully, members of the jury, that short address will indicate to you where we feel or where the defence submits your attention ought to be focused and for you to perhaps better appreciate the significance of the evidence as it comes to you. I join with the Crown in reminding you that at the end of the day it is the Crown that must prove the guilt of the accused and unless and until it does, he remains not guilty.”6 On Friday 19 February 1999, I heard submissions from counsel concerning the juror’s request. I reserved my decision. On Monday 22 February 1999, I announced my decision that the jury should be provided with a copy of the Crown prosecutor’s opening address and of the opening statement made by counsel for the accused. I said I would give my reasons at a later time. These are my reasons.7 The Jury Act 1977 was amended by the Jury (Amendment) Act 1987 in a number of respects. Substantially, the amendments followed the recommendations of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in its report “The Jury in a Criminal Trial” (LRC48 1986). The amendments included insertion of s 55C which provides as follows: “A copy of all or any part of the transcript of evidence at a trial or inquest may, at the request of the jury, be supplied to the members of the jury if the judge or coroner considers that it is appropriate and practicable to do so.”8 It is my understanding that, prior to the 1987 amendment, juries were never provided with a transcript of evidence. If they were, that was a rarity. Juries were told that, if they wished to be reminded of any part of the evidence, it would be read to them. This was frequently done, usually by the trial judge reading the relevant evidence to the jury, sometimes at considerable length. I am not aware of any practice at that time concerning any transcript of the Crown’s opening address or concerning any transcript of an opening statement by the accused’s counsel. To this day, there is no universal practice in relation to the recording of opening addresses and opening statements. I am sure, however, that, prior to 1987, a request for the transcript of any such address or statement (if available) would have been refused, conformably with the practice in relation to transcripts of evidence.9 There is an inherent or implied power in this court to control its own processes. The power is hedged in by statute, rules of court, precedent and practice. I do not doubt, however, that a judge has, apart altogether from the operation of s 55C of the Jury Act, the discretionary power to make available to the jury a transcript of any part of the record of the proceedings to the extent that such proceedings have been conducted before them. My reasons for that view are as follows. 10 The report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission to which I have referred included the following recommendation. “Recommendation 49: The Jury Act 1977 should confirm the discretionary power of the judge to provide a copy of all or part of the transcript of evidence to the jury in the jury room.”This recommendation conveyed the opinion of the members of the commission that, without the need for any specific statutory power, a discretion to provide the jury with transcript of evidence existed. The members of the commission who signed off on that report were Mr K Mason QC (as he then was), Mr P Byrne (then of junior counsel), Mr G James QC (as he then was), Matthews DCJ (as she then was), Roden J (as he then was) and Mr R Sackville (as he then was). The opinion of these persons carries weight. That was, as I have said, in relation to transcript of evidence. 11 In Lowe (1997) 98 A Crim R 300, a District Court judge had, without any request from the jury or from counsel, provided the jury with a copy of the evidence of a Crown witness. In the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL, there was no criticism in principle of the trial judge having taken it upon himself to make part of the transcript available to the jury (at 308-309). The only question was whether fairness required that other parts of the transcript ought also to have been made available if that was to be done. In the opinion of Hunt CJ at CL a new trial was not required. Smart J, on the other hand, was of the opinion that the judge had erred in allowing the transcript of portion of the evidence to be furnished without the transcript of certain other evidence (at 324). In his Honour’s opinion, a new trial was required. Ireland J agreed with the orders proposed by Hunt CJ at CL and with his reasons. 12 It appears that, in this case, all three members of the bench were of the opinion that the trial judge had a discretion to provide transcript of evidence to the jury apart altogether from the operation of s 55C of the Jury Act, which is predicated on a request by the jury. That accorded with the opinion of the members of the Law Reform Commission to which I have referred. 13 The existence of such a discretion, apart altogether from s 55C, had also been accorded some support in the judgment of Ireland J in Guirguis (CCA (NSW), 11 November 1996, unreported). His Honour said: “I would not go so far as to say that, absent a request from the jury, it would not be open to a trial judge to place before a jury part of the transcript of evidence.”His Honour went on to refer to the possible need to supply to the jury additional balancing transcript in the circumstances of the case. Gleeson CJ said he was in substantial agreement with the reasons given by Ireland J and did not dissent from the observation to which I have referred. James J agreed with Ireland J and with the supplementary reasons of Gleeson CJ (which do not bear on this topic).14 These sources relate to transcript of evidence, as does s 55C. However, if there is a discretion in a trial judge to provide a jury with transcript of evidence dehors s 55C, as appears to be the case, there is no reason to doubt that the discretion extends to the provision of any part of the record of the proceedings, insofar as the proceedings have taken place in the presence of the jury. It remains to consider how the discretion should be exercised.15 The Crown prosecutor raised no objection to the jury having a copy of his opening address and of the opening statement by counsel for the accused. He submitted that a list of Crown witnesses would be unnecessary. Requiring the accused to present a list of defence witnesses would, of course, not be entertained. Counsel for the accused objected totally to the jury being furnished with the materials requested.16 The reasons given by counsel for the accused for his position are as follows. First, it is said that a jury might treat the transcript as evidence. Secondly, it is said that the jury might, later in their deliberations, treat the transcript as a summary of the evidence. Thirdly, it was said that the opening statement on behalf of the accused identified issues rather than specifying the evidence which would or might be called on behalf of the accused. It was submitted that the accused might be prejudiced by highlighting the fact that, at the commencement of the proceedings, the Crown had specified the witnesses it would call, whereas the accused had not done so.17 In my opinion, the jury should, generally speaking, be provided with a copy of the Crown’s opening address and of the opening statement on behalf of the accused if these have been recorded and if that is requested by the jury or by a juror for the following reasons. 18 First, what has been said in the Crown’s opening address and in the statement made on behalf of the accused has been said for a purpose. If the jury or a member of the jury wishes to be reminded of what was said, that will facilitate the purpose for which it was said in the first place. That is a strong reason for making the record available if requested. There would need to be reasons to the contrary which outweighed that consideration and which could not be met by appropriate warnings against misuse of the transcript. In another connection but in words which convey the present point, Everett J said in Williams (1982) Tas R 266,280: “To deny the jury the benefit of reading with their eyes the same words as they heard with their ears seems to me to put the law into an ill-fitting straightjacket.” 19 Secondly, to provide a transcript of the opening address and opening statement is to do no more than the jury are entitled to provide for themselves. A member of the jury might be able to make a shorthand note or might make a very comprehensive summary which can be read to other jurors in the jury room. If there could be no objection to that - and there cannot be - it is inconsistent to refuse to provide the official record, at request, when the record carries the additional quality of guaranteed accuracy. 20 Thirdly, the enactment of s 55C was an expression of opinion by the parliament that the practice in relation to the non-provision of transcript of evidence which existed prior to 1987 was wrong. The Law Reform Commission gave reasons for rejecting that practice and for the recommended reform to end it. In the introduction to Chapter 6 of the report, Making the Jury’s Task Easier, the Commission said (at page 71): “It is our view that efforts should be made to simplify the task of juries. We reject the argument that the difficulties identified lead necessarily to the conclusion that juries should be abandoned. In this chapter we recommend ways in which, at various stages, the task of the jury can be made easier, by which we mean more convenient, more comfortable, simpler and fairer. The easier this task is made, the more effective will be the jury’s performance and the more reliable the verdict.”In support of Recommendation 49, to which I have referred the Commission said (page 90): “The jury should be assisted to deliberate effectively and rationally on the evidence presented in court. We have recommend above (Recommendation 38, para 6.20) that jurors should be provided with notebooks as a matter of course and permitted to make notes during the trial. The provision of the transcript in addition could compensate for any lack of reliability in the notes made and could save time in the jury’s deliberations.”In the second reading speeches in the House and in the Assembly, it was acknowledged that the amending bill was an implementation of a number of the recommendations in the report (Hansard, 48th Parliament, 3rd Session, page 16523, 19 November 1987; and page 17131, 24th November 1987). The reasoning which led the Commission to make Recommendation 49, and which can be taken to have led the parliament to enact s 55C, applies to provision of the record of any part of the proceedings which take place before the jury and which bears on the jury’s function.21 Fourthly, since the enactment of s 55C, the provision of parts of the transcript of evidence to the jury, at their request, has become commonplace. In that regard, a new factor has arisen which bears on the provision of the transcript of an address or opening statement. If the purpose of providing a transcript of evidence is to remind the jury, accurately and in a complete way, of what was said in a part of the proceedings before them - as it is- consistency requires that the record of other parts of the proceedings conducted before the jury should also be provided, at request, for the same purpose. 22 There is no difference in the considerations which arise if the request is made by a member of the jury as distinct from the jury as a whole. Counsel for the accused could see no distinction.23 Lastly, I acknowledge the risk that the record of an opening address or of an accused’s opening statement might be misused. That is also true of the address or statement as delivered in court when one has regard to the possibility that a member of the jury might have made a full note which is subsequently used in jury room. But it has to be acknowledged that the risk of misuse is higher when a formal looking, typed record is provided. In another connection, that kind of heightened risk has judicial recognition: Driscoll (1977) 137 CLR 517 (per Gibbs J at 542). Driscoll is not, however, authority for proscribing the supply to the jury of part of the record of the proceedings. 24 As I have recorded, counsel in the present case had incorporated cautions against misuse in what they said to the jury. These could be reinforced and supplemented by me.25 Having regard to the foregoing considerations, I decided that it was appropriate in the present case to provide the jury with the transcript of the Crown’s opening address and of the accused’s opening statement.

     REGINA v Peter Gerard BOYS 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: Peter Gerard Boys appeals against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him by Acting Judge Nader, sitting in the District Court in Newcastle. His Honour sentenced the appellant to a period of ten years imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of seven and a half years and an additional term of two and a half years. This was allocated to the various charges which I will hereafter describe.2 The appellant pleaded guilty to eight separate crimes. Those crimes were sexual offences against five girls, each of whom had been a pupil of the appellant. Two separate offences were charged in the case of each of three girls, and one offence for two other girls. 3 The number of different victims, the circumstances in which the crimes occurred and the period of time over which they occurred are such as to establish a pattern of conduct for which his Honour concluded a period of imprisonment of ten years was appropriate. His Honour indicated that the determination of individual sentences for the different charges was made after assessing the overall criminality of the whole of the conduct, in order to arrive at the result of ten years with a minimum term of seven and a half years.4 No complaint is made of the way his Honour allocated the sentences to the individual offences; the appeal is directed to the total period and the relationship between the minimum and additional terms.5 This Court has heard this appeal and is delivering the judgment in the City of Newcastle. The crimes all occurred within this region where the appellant taught and directed the Marching Koalas Band, which was comprised of pupils from a number of schools. The evidence makes it plain that Boys was a manipulative sexual predator who abused his position of trust, exploited his power and subjected the girls to emotional blackmail. His conduct, together with the adverse effects on the victims and their families, was plainly such as to warrant a significant sentence of imprisonment.6 On appeal, the function of this Court is to review the sentencing process undertaken by Acting Judge Nader in the District Court and to consider whether it was affected by error, either of fact or of law. Our task is to determine whether the appellant received what he deserved; that is to say, measured punishment, administered justly, according to law. 7 Of the eight crimes for which he was sentenced, seven were contraventions of s73 of the Crimes Act (NSW) 1900 and one was a contravention of s76 of the Crimes Act. The offence under s76 is concerned with indecent assault. Section 73 is a special offence, dealing with school teachers and fathers or stepfathers.8 In the period up to 23 March 1986, the period which is relevant to four of the crimes, s73 read as follows: ""Whosoever, being a school master or other teacher or a father or stepfather, unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of ten years and under the age of seventeen years, being his pupil or daughter or stepdaughter, shall be liable to penal servitude for fourteen years.""9 This provision was amended with effect from 23 March 1986, when a new s73 was confined to girls of the age of sixteen years, and also the maximum penalty was reduced to a period of eight years. At the same time s66C(2)(b) was introduced into the Act, which applied to the situation with girls between the ages of ten and sixteen years, formerly covered by s73. Under s66C(2)(b) the maximum penalty was then ten years.10 It was common ground before us that, by reason of the application of s55 of the Interpretation Act (NSW) 1987, the appropriate maximum period for two of the offences under s73 was ten years, and that is because those offences were committed against girls at a time when they had not yet reached the age of sixteen years. In the other five s73 offences the appropriate maximum was eight years, and that was because on each of those occasions the victims were above the age of sixteen years.11 It is plain from his Honour's allocation of sentences to the ten separate charges, setting aside for the moment the s76 count, that what his Honour did was to impose a sentence in each case of half the maximum; that is to say, for what I will refer to as the first charge which involved a girl under the age of sixteen years, he imposed a sentence of five years, and for what I will refer to as the last charge, being count 2 on the indictment, he also imposed a sentence of five years, again in the case of the girl not having then reached sixteen years.12 It was this last sentence which he divided into a minimum and an additional term of two and a half years each, to reach the ultimate effect which he sought to attain, of a minimum term of seven and a half years and an additional term of two and a half years.13 The first of the eight crimes to which the appellant pleaded guilty involved a girl in his fourth form class. The occasion was a barbecue and sleep-over for members of the band at the appellant's own home. The girl was a virgin and not yet sixteen years of age. In her evidence she revealed the degree of abuse of authority involved in the offence when she said: ""I was really excited about being with him, because he was the king, he was the main number one man.""14 She also said: ""He was like a god to me and the other kids.""15 Furthermore, she said: ""During class he would single me out and just treat me like dirt. The same would happen during band. I would always be crying, I was never stable, I didn't know what he expected from me, I didn't know where I stood. I was really confused. He isolated me.""16 The second crime which he committed with the same girl occurred while the girl was in his fifth and sixth forms, including occasions on which the appellant attended at her house to tutor her for history, and on other occasions in which he took her late in the evening to the music staff room at Broadmeadow High School for the purposes of sexual intercourse.17 The second girl was his pupil at Broadmeadow High School. The first of the two crimes of which he was convicted in her case occurred at a camp with the Broadmeadow High School Band. Shortly thereafter, over the Christmas holiday period further acts of intercourse occurred at the appellant's home.18 The fourth crime to which he pleaded guilty with respect to the second pupil occurred over the course of the next year, when there were a number of acts of intercourse in rooms near the music room at Broadmeadow High School. This girl said that the appellant had manipulated her.19 The third pupil against whom the appellant committed the offences of which he has been convicted attended Morisset High School and then Newcastle High School, during which period she was a member of the Marching Squad with the Marching Koalas. She was sixteen years old in August 1987 when he took her to a friend's flat at Lambton for the purposes of sexual intercourse. 20 The second crime for which he had been convicted in relation to this girl occurred in the next month, September 1987, in the music staff room after band practice. This girl testified to the following effect: ""I think the reason I did have sex with Peter Boys was that he was our teacher. He had so much control over all the members, he told us what to do and when to do it.""21 The fourth girl against whom he committed the crime of indecent assault was his music student at a time that he taught at Cessnock High School. The girl was only fourteen when he enticed her to masturbate him on the return trip from a musical excursion attended by music students of Cessnock High School. This girl explained: ""The way Peter controlled me was to make me feel that I had done something wrong, and I would do anything for him to regain his attention. I would do anything to please him and he would use this knowledge often during our relationship...there was always a sense of control in his behaviour towards me. Looking back, it was frightening because of the emotional intensity created by his manipulation, which occurred daily.""22 The fifth girl against whom he committed a crime of which he has been convicted was a student at Broadmeadow High School and a member of the Marching Koalas Band. The appellant committed sexual intercourse with the girl after inviting her to his own home during the school holidays in January 1986. This young woman gave detailed testimony about the adverse consequences for her future life which were caused by this incident of sexual abuse. It was an incident in which no question of consent arose. She gave a description of really not knowing what was going on. The consequences for her in her future life were confirmed in the report of the clinical psychologist which was tendered before the trial judge. The girl said: ""I feel that Peter Boys abused his authority as a teacher to take advantage of me.""23 In his reasons for judgment delivered on 17 April 1998, Acting Judge Nader set out the details of the offences, the course of conduct and the evidence of manipulative conduct on the part of the appellant. His Honour gave particular weight, and properly so, to the fact that the appellant was in a position of trust. His Honour emphasised that the appellant as a teacher had a duty on behalf of the families of the girls, and also the community as a whole, both to protect them and to guide them. 24 The degree of dereliction involved in the course of conduct by the appellant was correctly taken into account by his Honour. His Honour also correctly gave particular weight to the effect of the position of power and authority that the appellant had over the girls, on their immature minds.25 I agree with his Honour that the course of conduct revealed by the eight offences constituted a gross dereliction of duty by a person in a position of trust. The abuse of his position and power and the emotional blackmail that he so demonstrated was such that only a substantial term of imprisonment was appropriate in this case. 26 Evidence was tendered below, including a number of character references from other members of the community. His contribution through his work as a music teacher and musician was emphasised in written statements and in oral evidence before the Court. The assertion is made in written submissions on behalf of the appellant that ""there is nothing in the remarks on sentence to indicate that his Honour had any serious regard to any of it"".27 This is wrong. His Honour expressly states in his judgment: ""A number of matters have been put on his behalf very lucidly and very concisely and shortly, but with considerable force, that stand in his favour. I need not repeat them.""28 It is not necessary for a trial judge to recite evidence of this character in detail. The proceedings on sentence and the oral evidence occurred on 17 April 1998. His Honour delivered his judgment on the same day. Plainly, all of these matters were in his mind. His Honour's general reference to them was adequate in the circumstances.29 The written submissions also made reference to the early plea of guilty which is entitled to weight. His Honour made express reference to that fact, indicating that he took into account the expense to the community saved by the avoiding of a lengthy trial and also the avoidance of the aggravation of the impact on the victims if they had had to give evidence at a trial and been cross-examined. All of this was avoided by the plea of guilty.30 His Honour also took into account the degree of contrition and remorse and also the aggravated circumstances of incarceration which will occur by reason of the need to serve the sentence in protective custody. His Honour also took account of the effect on the appellant by reason of the destruction of his career and the break-up of his family. 31 All of the matters referred to in the written submissions, and almost all of those referred to in oral submissions, were referred to expressly or implicitly in his Honour's judgment. 32 The basic submission for the appellant is that, looking at the sentence as a whole, the trial judge failed to properly assess the objective criminality of the offence. The principal thrust of this submission was that by reason of the length of the sentence it appears that the cumulative effect of the matters to which I have referred, and some other matters, were not given weight by his Honour.33 The submissions on behalf of the appellant focused on a number of propositions. First, that offences by teachers are less serious than by fathers. It is by no means clear to me that that is always so. Also, that offences against girls over sixteen, as all but two of the complainants were, in respect to the s 73 charges, should be regarded as less serious. There is no doubt that the age of the girls is a relevant consideration for sentencing. In this case, that is taken into account by the concession made by the Crown that the sentences were in some cases to be treated as those of ten years, and in other cases the maximum was to be eight years.34 It was also submitted that offences without threats or overt deception are less serious. That may be the case, although in many cases involving threats of violent conduct there may be other charges in respect of which more serious penalties could be imposed.35 It was also submitted that offences where a relationship continues into adulthood should be treated more leniently. It is by no means clear to me that that is always the case, but I accept that that is a relevant consideration.36 The other additional facts are the facts of an early plea of guilty and the serving of time in protective custody, which I have already made mention of.37 Also, considerable weight was placed on the proposition that the offences had ceased approximately ten years before the day the sentencing exercise was undertaken. Reliance was placed upon the case of R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 at 519-520, approved by the High Court in Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64 and 66. I accept that this is a material consideration for the imposition of sentences in this case.38 I have noted above that two of the offences occurred in circumstances in which the appropriate maximum penalty was ten years, and that in those cases, as in the other s73 cases, his Honour imposed a maximum of half the maximum, being five years. These were the two offences which his Honour decided to make cumulative upon each other. In one case he imposed a fixed term of five years, and in the other case he divided the five year period into a two and a half year minimum term and a two and a half year additional term.39 There has been no submission that it was not appropriate for his Honour to make these offences cumulative. His Honour's reasoning indicated clearly that he took into account the principle of totality. It is to the effect of his Honour's reasoning in that respect to which the submissions were primarily directed, namely, that considering all of the circumstances and notwithstanding the fact that his Honour had imposed individual sentences of half the maximum - in circumstances where there is no criticism of his decision to make two of the offences cumulative - nevertheless the overall sentence was disproportionate to the objective criminality involved.40 In my view there is nothing in the analysis presented to this Court to justify interference with his Honour's exercise of discretion. His Honour indicated with some care why he had come to the position of imposing a total sentence of ten years, consisting of a minimum of seven and a half years and an additional term of two and a half years. His Honour thus, on the cumulative sentences, took into account the principle of totality.41 In my opinion, his Honour was entitled within the exercise of his discretion to come to the conclusion that all of the circumstances in this case justified a sentence of the total amount which he imposed. I have identified earlier the important aspects of this conduct. I have described it as the conduct of a sexual predator and one who abused his position of trust, who exploited his power and indeed preyed on the vulnerability of young women under his authority. This conduct, occurring as it did, relevantly over a period of some five years, although there was one earlier offence under s 76, involving as it did five separate girls, entirely justified the total period of imprisonment which his Honour imposed.42 Nothing has been put which would suggest that the balance between the effective minimum term and the additional term was wrong. 43 Some reference was made in the written submissions to special circumstances. His Honour found none, and I agree that it was open to his Honour to so find.44 In my opinion, leave should be granted and the appeal dismissed.45 McINERNEY J: Yes, I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice for the reasons he has advanced.46 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is, leave to appeal granted; appeal dismissed.

       REGINA v TACK LEE PANG 
       
       
      The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity of heroin, contrary to s 233B(1)(d) of the  
      Customs Act 1901 
      . His role in the importation was that of a courier. He collected and signed for the heroin, and delivered it to an intermediary.  
       
       
      He was sentenced to a term of six years with a non-parole period of five years. He challenged the sentence on the basis that his Honour erred in not allowing a sufficient discount for the assistance provided by the applicant, and in not making any allowance for the absence of remissions within the NSW Criminal Justice System when setting the non-parole period. 
       
       
      HELD 
       (allowing the application): 
       
       
      (1)  
      Involvement at any level of drug importation must attract a significant sentence, in the interests of deterrence. 
       
        
       
      (2)  
      However in this case the assistance given by the applicant was of such a high order as to attract a significant discount. The statements provided by the applicant were full and frank, and his assistance, both in relation to investigations and his undertaking to give evidence against his co-accused, was of real value.

      (1989) 17 NSWLR 243, followed. 
       
        
       
      (3)  
      There is no fixed tariff for the reduction that should be given for assistance: it has ranged between 20 and 50 per cent. However the end result must not be so far out of touch with the circumstances of the case, as to constitute an affront to the community;

      (4)  
      In this case a 25 per cent discount was insufficient. A discount of 50 per cent more appropriately reflected the genuine co-operation of the applicant, and the value of his assistance. 
       
        
       
      (5)  
      His Honour also erred in not extending the discount given for the absence of remissions in this State to the non-parole period. The period set for non-parole is usually between 60 and 66 per cent of the head sentence, although there is no fixed rule and it will depend on the particular circumstances of the prisoner. However in this case the non-parole period was 83 per cent of the head sentence, which was far too high.

     JUDGMENT 
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence comprising a term of six years with a non-parole period of five years imposed on him by Judge Kirkham in the District Court.2 This sentence followed his plea of guilty to an offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity of heroin, contrary to s 233B (1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901. The quantity of pure heroin involved was 2495.6gms, having a street value in the vicinity of $3.5m.3 The role of the applicant in the importation was that of a courier. His specific task was to collect and sign for the heroin, which had been packaged within ten hollowed out computer instruction books, once it arrived in Sydney from Bangkok and then to deliver it to an intermediary. He had been recruited for this role in Kuala Lumpar and he was to receive 15,000 Malaysian ringitt, together with the costs of air fares for himself and his wife and their expenses.4 The planned importation had been discovered in Bangkok and, unbeknown to any of the conspirators involved, became the subject of an authorised and controlled importation involving Thai Police and the Australian Federal Police. Electronic and physical surveillance was established in respect of several suspects, including, Alan Sui Lun Li, John Giang Diou Kook, Wei Fen Mei and others. After the arrival of the heroin in Sydney, substitute blocks were delivered to an address in Summer Hill. The applicant signed for and received the consignment and, in accordance with instructions from Kook, he effected the delivery. Surveillance officers lost contact at this point, but monitoring of several telephone services reveals the frustration experienced by those higher up in the importation/distribution chain once they discovered that the commodity they received was not, in fact, heroin.5 The prisoner was arrested as he was about to leave the country. He initially denied any involvement in any offence and declined to assist police. Later that day his attitude changed and he agreed to assist the police with covert inquiries. Apart from the active assistance that he provided in the investigations that followed, he has also signed an undertaking to give evidence in proceedings against Li, Kook, Mei and another person.6 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour accepted that his role was towards the lower end of the chain of culpability; That he had expressed contrition through his plea of guilty and offer of assistance; that he had no prior convictions; that the business he conducted in Malaysia had collapsed since his arrest with consequent hardship to his family; that by reason of his youth, he had favourable prospects of rehabilitation; that he would serve a sentence in protective custody and in a country which was foreign to him and that his assistance was genuine and extensive. Not all of these considerations justify much by way of leniency in the case of those involved in organised drug importation syndicates. For example, a claim to prior good character in cases of this kind is of limited value: Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A CrimR 231 at 238; as is the fact that the prisoner may be separated from his family in a country that is not his own: Bushell CCA NSW 17 July 1998 unreported. Moreover, involvement at any level in a drug importation offence must necessarily attract a significant sentence, otherwise the interests of general deterrence are not served.7 The objective and subjective circumstances taken into account by his Honour were correctly and sufficiently identified, both so far as that is required at general law, and by the Crimes Act (Commonwealth) s 16A. No relevant factor has been identified as having been overlooked.8 The sentence has been challenged upon the basis that his Honour erred in not allowing a sufficient discount for the assistance provided by the applicant, and in not making any allowance for the absence of remissions within the NSW Criminal Justice System, when setting the non-parole period.9 In coming to the sentence imposed, his Honour expressly stated in accordance with Gallagher (1991) 53 ACrimR 248 at 257 and s 21E of the Crimes Act 1912 (Commonwealth) that, but for the applicant's assistance, he would have imposed a head sentence of ten years and a non-parole period of seven years. By reason of the applicant's co-operation, that sentence was then reduced by two years to a head sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of five years. His Honour next applied s 16G of the Crimes Act to that adjusted head sentence to account for the non-availability of remissions within the New South Wales Criminal Justice System. The effect was to reduce the head sentence by a further 25 percent to one of six years imprisonment. The non-parole period was not reduced and in percentage terms amounts to 83 percent of the head sentence.10 In my view, the application has been made good, both in relation to the extent of the discount given for assistance and in relation to the failure to pass on the discount when fixing a non-parole period.11 The case is one where the assistance was of a very high order and such as to attract a significant discount. The applicant has been described by the Australian Federal Police as being of considerable, if not crucial, importance for the pending committal of Kook and Li, for any application that may be made for extradition of a co-offender, and for the prosecution of Mei who has recently been charged and is presently awaiting committal. 12 Upon the basis of the assessment that the statements provided by the applicant were full and frank, and that his assistance is of real value, both potentially and in actual fact, he clearly was entitled to a significant reduction on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed:  Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 253. 13 There is no fixed tariff for the reduction that should be given for assistance, and so far no guideline judgment has been delivered in this area. However, the discount customarily given in this State for assistance, has ranged between 20 and 50 percent of the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed:  Chu CCA NSW 16 October 1998 unreported and Behar CCA NSW 14 October 1998 unreported. 14 In Raz CCA NSW 17 December 1992 unreported this court by majority extended a discount of 55 percent in re-sentencing a courier who had assisted the authorities and given evidence against other offenders. In Perrier and Richardson (1990) 59 A CrimR 164 McGarvie J went so far as to suggest a discount of 66 2/3 percent may be appropriate to provide the necessary incentive for couriers to implicate their co-offenders. 15 Whatever discount is given, the imperative remains that the end result must not be so far out of touch with the circumstances of the particular offence, and of the particular offender so as to constitute an affront to community standards:  Gallagher at 260.16 In the present case I am persuaded a discount of 25 percent was insufficient to reflect the genuine co-operation of the applicant and the benefits that have flowed, and will potentially flow from his assistance. Rather, the case was appropriate, in my view, for a discount of 50 percent.17 I am also of the view his Honour erred in not extending a flow on to the non-parole period for the allowance which was made in respect of the head sentence by reason of the absence of remissions in this State. Although in its terms s 16G of the Crimes Act requires the court to take the absence of remissions into account ""in determining the length of the sentence"" and the adjust then sentence accordingly:  Paull (1990) 20 NSWLR 427 at 433 it has been held appropriate for the adjustment to flow on to the non-parole period:  El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 and Robertson CCA NSW 6 November1998 unreported. The non-parole period has normally been set between 60 and 66 percent of the head sentence:  Behar at 13 and Bernier CCA NSW 19.5.98 unreported, although there is no fixed rule in that regard. In any given case it will depend upon the subjective circumstances of the prisoner and the benefits or otherwise, of offering the possibility of release on parole.18 I am unaware of any reason in the present case for fixing a non-parole period that was as high as 83 percent of the head sentence. That proportion is in excess of the figure of 75 percent that was said by this court in Drazkiewicz CCA NSW 12.11.93 unreported, to be appropriate only for very serious cases. This is a very serious case but the proportion, in my view, was far too high. Accordingly, it becomes necessary to allow the application and to re-sentence the applicant.19 The starting point of a head sentence for ten years with a non-parole period of seven years after allowance for the absence of remissions, but without allowance for assistance would, in my view, be appropriate. Applying a 50 percent discount for assistance that sentence should, in my view, be reduced to one of five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years.20 I accordingly propose that the application be allowed, the sentence below be quashed and that in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of three years. For the purposes of s 21E of the Crimes Act I would further state that had there been no assistance, the appropriate sentence imposed would have been one of ten years imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven years. Had that assistance been confined to the provision of information alone without any undertaking to give evidence against the co-accused it would have, in my view, been appropriate for the sentence to be one of imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of five years.21 MEAGHER JA: I agree.22 BARR J: I also agree23 MEAGHER JA: The orders will be as proposed by Wood CJ at CL. There is some statutory obligation to explain to your client what has happened or to cause somebody else to explain.24 BUDDIN: Yes, I know what is going to come from your Honour and I am happy to take up the burden of that suggestion.  **********

     REGINA v ARTHUR EDWARD WHITMORE 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 MASON P: I will ask Grove J to deliver the first judgment.2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed in the Supreme Court sitting at Newcastle by Newman J following a trial in which the applicant was convicted of murder. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of 25 years penal servitude specifying a minimum term component of 15 years dating from 1 May 1996 when the applicant was taken into custody.3 The applicant was born on 5 March 1931 and hence was aged 66 years when the murder was committed which was on the same day as he was arrested. The learned sentencing judge found the following facts. The victim Colleen Edith Sharpe was aged 53 years and resided at Katoomba with her husband. About 7 months before the killing she met the applicant who was then residing in the Blue Mountains area. They commenced a sexual association, meeting at the applicant’s home and that of the victim and her husband. Subsequently the applicant moved to the Central Coast area but they continued to meet at Katoomba. Until a few days before the death Mr Sharpe was unaware of the association, indeed he was unaware of the existence of the applicant. 4 On 25 April 1996 Mrs Sharpe flew to Brisbane to visit a relative. By arrangement the applicant also went to Brisbane. They returned and on 29 April Mrs Sharpe telephoned her husband at his work in Katoomba and told him of the affair. When he arrived home he found Mrs Sharpe packing her clothes. Shortly thereafter the applicant arrived and he and the victim left. 5 On the afternoon of the following day Mrs Sharpe rang her husband saying that she wished to come home. A few moments later the applicant rang him and said that Mrs Sharpe would not be returning home, although on the telephone he could hear his wife saying that she would be returning to Katoomba and the applicant in an argumentative tone saying that she would not. 6 On that evening the applicant rang Mr Sharpe again and later his wife rang saying that she would not be coming home that evening. 7 Shortly before 8 o’clock the next morning Mrs Sharpe rang her husband and told him that when she came back to Katoomba she would be staying with Grace Rogers after which the telephone connection terminated. Mr Sharpe correctly interpreted this as a coded message. Grace Rogers had been a fellow employee of Mr and Mrs Sharpe who was murdered about six years previously. Mr Sharpe went to the police station and reported the matter. Upon his return home shortly before 10 am he received another telephone call from the applicant who told him that he had shot Colleen Sharpe and that she was dead. That call obviously ended and a few minutes later the applicant rang again inviting Mr Sharpe to come and collect the body. His Honour commented that that was as callous a remark as one could imagine. I agree. 8 The applicant was lawfully in possession of a pistol being a member of an appropriate club. Mrs Sharpe had been shot between the eyes at point blank range. 9 The prisoner telephoned his sister after he had committed the murder and complained that after “all he had done” to have a pension arranged for Mrs Sharpe and her to move into his house she had threatened to leave and accordingly he had shot her. 10 After his arrest the applicant told police that he had been assaulted by the deceased and that she had demanded money from him for sex. 11 The lastmentioned acquires some significance in the context that in 1968 the applicant had been convicted by a jury of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon his then wife. At the time of his arrest for that offence he had complained of the aggression of his wife towards him in relation to sexual matters. Indeed in an unsworn statement to the jury at his trial he continued to complain that his wife had victimized him in her demands for sexual attention. 12 His Honour was assisted in analysis of these matters by Dr John Strum a consultant psychiatrist who had reported on his examination of the applicant which took place shortly before trial. 13 The first challenge by the applicant relates to the lastmentioned matters and his Honour’s finding that the material indicated a dangerous propensity in the applicant to attack women with whom he has formed a relationship when problems arose in it. It was contended that three matters had been relied upon in reaching that conclusion first, the conviction in 1968, second an observation by Dr Strum concerning a propensity to violence against women with whom the applicant has a relationship and third a further observation by Dr Strum concerning violent reaction and response by the applicant which might be expected if he encountered difficulty in a relationship. 14 As is clear from Dr Strum’s report he was quite conscious of the long time gap since the previous offence and he particularly observed the difficulty in predicting that such an event would not be repeated because of history in the case of the applicant. The submission has been couched in an attack upon his Honour’s finding that there was a propensity to attack women but as was pointed out in submission by the Crown his Honour’s finding related specifically to danger to women with whom the applicant had formed a relationship when problems arise in that relationship. Dr Strum had thought that given the age now attained by the applicant his chances of getting into another relationship would be remote and his observation that the applicant represented no danger to the community was related to that remark and was very much qualified by his following observation: “If, however, (the applicant) were to form another relationship and fall in love with somebody who used him and left him then the pattern may well emerge again.”14 I find no error in his Honour’s conclusion and it was appropriate to take into account this dangerous propensity on the sentence. The passage which he cited from Veen v The Queen (No 2) 1977 164 CLR 465 cannot be understood to refer only to dangerous propensity to the community in general and there was powerful evidence suggesting that if the applicant formed a relationship with any woman then if problems arose that woman would be in acute danger.15 The second matter urged on behalf of the applicant was that his Honour erred in not giving sufficient weight to the applicant’s age. We were referred to observations in this Court in R v Holyoake 1995 82 A Crim R 502 and in Victoria in R v Yates 1985 VR 41. His Honour made express reference to the statistical life expectancy of the applicant and it cannot be suggested that he was not conscious of the applicant’s advanced years. The nature of such statistics is of course that as one lives beyond any point at which an observation of statistical expectancy is made, the age at which death might be expected advances. There was little to be said in favour of the applicant. His Honour noted that he gave earnest consideration to the maximum penalty and it was in my view appropriate for him so to do. His finding that the applicant intended to kill as distinct from harbouring an intention to do grievous bodily harm is important. The circumstances of the offence and the surrounding behaviour of the applicant give no grounds for any expectation on his part for lenience. It was appropriate that his Honour include a significant element of personal and general deterrence in the sentence which he imposed. The applicant was found to have killed simply to give vent to rage. The circumstance that the victim was able to give the coded message to her husband is a convincing demonstration that the applicant had in some fashion foreshadowed his intention and the passion to which he gave way was not therefore entirely sudden or immediate but had an element of premeditation. Obtaining his pistol and shooting the victim directly between the eyes is further confirmation of preparation and determination. He was found to be without remorse. His Honour found that the applicant’s age should be taken into account in extending the additional term element of the sentence in order that the applicant might have some possible opportunity for release on parole. As is obvious from his remarks he was conscious of any grant of parole being affected by the duty of the Board particularly as specified in s 17 of the Sentencing Act. The contention is essentially that his Honour erred in not giving sufficient weight to the applicant’s age. That is effectively a challenge to an exercise of discretion. I see no basis upon which this Court should intervene to upset his Honour’s exercise.16 The third and final submission advanced on behalf of the applicant was that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Reference was made to what was claimed to be a class of “ordinary domestic murder”. For my part I would reject the implication that there is some such specific classification. It has been observed that killings within a domestic situation occur very often when there has been a build up of tension between killer and victim over a period of years, and some account may need to be given to the frequent circumstance that the offender has acted whilst affected by stresses and tensions within a relationship. That is not to say that existence of such is necessarily a mitigating circumstance and each case needs to be assessed in the light of its own facts but it is often the case that some mitigation can be found in such circumstances. That does not establish some less serious category of “domestic murder” or any category under similar label.17 This case is far distant from that. The applicant and the victim had been having an affair but subject to the brief excursion to Brisbane, they had been together in anything approaching a domestic type situation for less than two days. His Honour found and he has not been shown to have erred, that the killing was the direct result of enragement on the part of the applicant because Mrs Sharpe decided to leave and not go on with what was apparently proposed. 18 It was claimed that this was not a case where there was evidence of planning or long premeditation. As I have pointed out there was some evidence of premeditation and the contention that it was not long does not in my view, carry any significance in the circumstances of this case. 19 I am unable to detect any error in his Honour’s findings or approach. The sentence imposed and the orders made were within the range of the sound exercise of his discretion.20 I propose that application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal dismissed and the sentence confirmed.21 MASON P: I agree.22 JAMES J: I also agree.23 MASON P: The orders of the Court will be as proposed.

     JUDGMENT 
    1 THE COURT: These Reasons relate to an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed by His Honour Judge Mitchelmore on charges of:- 1. Being knowingly concerned in the importation of N-methyl-1 (3-4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-butanamine (known as “MBDB” or “Eden”) a drug analogue of 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (known as “MDMA” or “Ecstasy”) being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to MDMA, and  2. Supplying a prohibited drug being part of the same MBDB in an amount not less than a large commercial quantity.2 At the conclusion of the hearing of the application on 13 November, last the Court made orders that:- 1. That leave to appeal be granted. 2. That the appeal be allowed. 3. That the sentence imposed by Judge Mitchelmore be quashed. 4. That in lieu thereof, the Applicant be sentenced to a total term of 8 years imprisonment dating from his arrest on 13 August 1996 with a non-parole period of 5 years also dating from 13 August 1996. 5. That this court records for the purposes of Section 21E of the Crimes Act (Cth.) that but for the further assistance to the Crown to which Judge Mitchelmore made reference and which has been referred to in the hearing of this appeal, the sentence imposed would be 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years both terms dating from 13 August 1996.3 The offence, the subject of the first charge is a breach of Section 233B (1)(d) of the Customs Act, that the subject of the second count offends Section 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Both offences carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.4 The sentence imposed on the first count was of 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. The sentence imposed on the second count was a fixed term of 4½ years, running concurrently. Judge Mitchelmore indicated for the purposes of Section 21E of the Crimes Act (Cth) that, but for future assistance which was promised, he would have imposed a sentence of 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. The commencing date of the terms was 13 August 1996, the date when the Applicant was first arrested. This gave him the benefit of 2½ months when he was on bail, albeit on very strict conditions.5 The quantity involved was 1214gms. Under the Customs Act the trafficable quantity of MDMA and of any drug analogue thereof is .5 of a gram and the commercial quantity is 500gms. Pursuant to Section 235 the maximum penalty for the importation of a commercial quantity is imprisonment for life and for the importation of a trafficable quantity, imprisonment for 25 years and a fine not exceeding $100,000. Sacrificing some accuracy for brevity, where a person has previously been convicted of an offence under Section 233B involving a trafficable quantity, the maximum penalty for a conviction involving a second trafficable quantity is life imprisonment.6 Under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act there are more categories. It is sufficient to mention two. They and the maximum penalties prescribed are:- Commercial quantity 0.125kg 20 years + $350,000 Large commercial quantity 0.5kg Life + $500,000.7 An agreed statement of facts indicated that while statistics were not available for the period July to September 1996 when the Applicant’s offences occurred, on the basis of the prices prevailing in the preceding three months the drugs were worth between $120,000 and $200,000 (wholesale) and $380,000 (street) - approximately. On the basis of prices in the three months after September, the street value was between about $160,000 and $400,000.8 The operation with which the Applicant was involved included an organiser or perhaps principal in the Netherlands and at least another three persons who travelled to Australia in connection with it. One of these would seem to have been an overseer or treasurer. The sentencing Judge’s remarks concerning the Applicant and his role included the following:- “I am satisfied to the requisite degree that the offender’s involvement was not at the lower end of the importation. I am satisfied that the Prisoner’s activities showed considerable professionalism. I am further satisfied the Prisoner had significant authority so far as the distribution of the illicit substance was concerned… It is clear that the prisoner’s involvement… was greater than that of a mere courier. Phone taps indicate the prisoner had a significant and important role relating to the distribution of the tablets. For example, the prisoner was involved in the releasing of tablets so that the drug could be tested by prospective purchasers. Sums of money discussed in the phone taps relate to large amounts… From that conversation it is clear that the prisoner was active in arrangements concerning the narcotics at a very early stage… In this conversation the obtaining of false bottom suitcases was also discussed, amounts of money and quantities were discussed… (Referring to other recordings) These two conversations demonstrate the offender was involved in the dealing and the price assessment of the drugs… This further confirms that the prisoner was far from being peripherally involved in the criminality. In fact, the Prisoner was deeply and significantly involved in the importation and the matters surrounding it.”9 However His Honour did record that the Applicant was not the Australian distributor.10 On 12 August, 1996 the Appellant’s car was stopped by police purportedly conducting a random breath test. The car was searched and a back pack he was earlier seen to have carried from a block of apartments in which an apparent accomplice was residing, was found. That back pack containing over 2,000 tablets, the net bulk of MBDB contained therein being about 680gms and part of that in respect of which the importation charge was laid. On interview the Applicant denied any knowledge of the tablets. He was released on bail.11 Shortly thereafter he was telephoned from the Netherlands and in the course of that conversation the Applicant made mention of his arrest and gave further advice in furtherance of the operation including advice that a meeting should occur and a minimum of $10,000 be provided. There were other calls by the Applicant the contents of which the sentencing Judge described as “damage control” and “harm minimisation”. The Applicant is aged 31 years. He came to Australia from Macedonia in 1992 and he is married and has two children. He is not addicted to any illicit substances or alcohol. He has no prior record and some good references were tendered on his behalf. The Judge said he took good character into account. The sentencing Judge said that he gave weight to the Applicant’s plea of guilty for pragmatic reasons and that he regarded the plea as an expression of contrition. 12 Although we do not rely on it, in that respect it appears that in that finding His Honour was unduly favourable to the Applicant. The plea was entered on the first day set down for a 2 to 3 week trial albeit after some reduction in the indictment. His Honour observed it was a comparatively strong Crown case although apparently the other participants in the criminality had escaped conviction and the Judge observed that convictions in long trials are far from inevitable. Significant also to the topic of contrition is what the Applicant told a criminologist whose report was tendered shortly before the Applicant came to be sentenced. Such reports commonly consist of pure hearsay and untested evidence favourable to an offender and are of no weight or assistance although in this case, part of the document is unfavourable to the Applicant and any suggestion of contrition. The report records:- “(The Applicant) says that he was not the distributor in the operation but beyond that his role seems to be somewhat unclear. He certainly expresses regret for his implication and on his advice, he received no payment for any of his illegal activities. (The Applicant) claims that he was not aware of the extent of the operation and although he appeared to be attempting to diminish his own culpability in the offence, it was difficult to draw any clear conclusions as the crime was incomplete as far as the role of (the applicant) was concerned.”13 As we have indicated, the sentencing Judge reduced the head sentence and non-parole period he would otherwise have imposed by 4 years and 3 years respectively for further assistance which the Applicant has undertaken to provide. That assistance relates to a murder in jail witnessed by the Applicant. Fairly promptly he provided assistance by way of identification of the offenders in circumstances which can only be described as courageous. He has given undertakings to give evidence relating to the matter. During his incarceration prior to sentence he elected not to go into protective custody - an event calculated to inform the rest of the prison population that he has done something which they would judge contrary to their interests and justifying such custody. However, the sentencing judge recognised that protective custody would almost certainly occur in the future. On the hearing of the appeal, the Court was informed without challenge that the Applicant was now in extreme protection.14 By reference to past decisions, counsel appearing for the Applicant submitted that the commencing point of 13 years the Judge had used in the determination of the sentence to be imposed was manifestly excessive. Certainly the court was not referred to a sentence imposed for MDMA or MBDB after the introduction of Part 1B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act which was higher than 13 years and the court was referred to a number of decisions where the sentence imposed was significantly lower. Thus in Hauser (unreported, CCA, 11 December 1997) a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3½ years was reduced by this court to one of 4½ years with a non parole period of 2½ years. In that case 6,000 tablets weighing 2 kgs with a street value of between $420,000 and $620,000 were involved. Reference to the Court file shows that the pure weight was 521 grams of MDMA and 80 grams of MDEA. Hauser, who pleaded guilty only on arraignment, was previously of good character and was regarded as a junior partner in the enterprise. The sentencing judge had, with perhaps undue generosity, taken 2 years off the sentence he would have otherwise imposed for Hauser’s plea and limited co-operation with the authorities. This court’s reduction of a sentence it described as “well within the range of a proper sentencing discretion” was based on grounds of parity.15 In Moore and Weibe (unreported, CCA, 11 August 1992) the quantity of MDMA involved was some 632 grams pure, enough to produce over 6,000 tablets having a retail value of approximately $240,000. Weibe was sentenced to a minimum term of 3 years and an additional term of 1 year on a charge of supply under Section 26(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. He was 36 years, a Canadian with no previous convictions and a person of excellent prior character. He was regarded as a courier and had pleaded guilty at an early stage and was regarded as showing contrition. He received a reduction of 50% of the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed for co-operation with the authorities. This court was not satisfied that the sentence imposed was outside the proper sentencing discretion although the court clearly had reservations concerning the sentencing judge’s allowance of the reduction for co-operation with the authorities.16 Moore had been sentenced on a charge of conspiracy to supply the drug and was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of 3 years and 6 months and an additional term of 1 year and 2 months. He also was a courier, had pleaded guilty and his criminality was not regarded as much different to that of Weibe but he was not entitled to the same credit for assistance. The sentencing judge had attempted to reflect differences between the two in his sentence and a Crown appeal against the result was dismissed although, as we read the remarks on sentence, on discretionary grounds rather than by way of any endorsement of the sentence imposed.17 On the other hand there are a number of cases not as favourable to the Applicant’s argument. In Bowers (1997) 97 A Crim R 461 the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of importing not less than a commercial quantity of MDMA. The number of tablets involved was some 7,000 the value of which was estimated to range between $105,000 and $700,000 depending upon the level in the chain of distribution at which the assessment was made. The report does not disclose the quantity involved but reference to the court file shows it was 719.2 grams. The applicant was a courier. He had no prior convictions and had been unemployed for some period. He pleaded guilty at an early stage although the weight to be given to this was low as he had been apprehended at the airport with the tablets strapped to his body. This court recognised that there had been errors - operating in opposite directions - in the sentencing process but declined to interfere with a sentence imposed of 8½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4½ years. Ireland J described the sentence as proper. Hunt CJ at CL, with whose observations Levine J agreed, said that he would not impose any shorter sentence and that the correct range was much higher than a number of decisions of the District Court to which reference had been made indicated.18 In Soonius (unreported, CCA 29 May 1998) where the quantity involved was 3.34 kgs estimated to have a wholesale value of about $400,000 and an absolute maximum retail value of $2.063M, this court reduced a sentence of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years to one of 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5¼ years. The applicant had been a courier but had pleaded not guilty and was not regarded as exhibiting remorse. The sentencing judge had discounted the head sentence he would otherwise have imposed by 2 years for assistance furnished to the authorities. A feature distinguishing that case from many others was Soonius’ psychiatric condition, to which Wood J in Budiman (unreported, CCA 8 September 1998) referred as “powerful and unusual subjective circumstances”.19 In Budiman the applicant was convicted of being knowingly concerned in the importation of 8,095 tablets containing 591gms pure of ecstasy. He was regarded as a courier and had a previously unblemished character. Having maintained his innocence at the trial and subsequently he did not have the benefit of any finding of contrition. This court refused to interfere with the sentence imposed of 8 years and 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months observing that the sentence was “one which His Honour was perfectly able to reach”.20 In Carey (1997) 97 A Crim R 552 the applicant pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of ecstasy. The amount involved was about 2 kgs pure, the street value of which was said to be more than $1M. The applicant was apprehended at the airport and thereafter participated in a controlled delivery of the drugs. In consequence a number of persons were arrested and in the court’s view much valuable information passed on to the police in the United Kingdom whence the applicant had come. The applicant had undertaken to give evidence on behalf of the Authorities. As facts operating in the applicant’s favour, the sentencing Judge took cognisance of the following:- (i) that the applicant’s offending was isolated to this occasion; (ii) that, as a courier, the applicant was low in the hierarchy of the enterprise; (iii) the applicant’s early plea of guilty; (iv) the deprived and disadvantaged lifestyle of the applicant; (v) the demonstration by the applicant of his will to rehabilitate himself; (vi) his co-operation with authorities in the past. 21 The “deprived and disadvantaged lifestyle” of the applicant merits explanation. He was 25 years of age. He had lived in Liverpool all this life and his situation was described as follows:- “You were living a life of bare existence, close to the poverty line, in Liverpool. You have only rudimentary education. You have no skills. Not surprising therefore you had little or no work. You have lived in sub-standard accommodation. You had an alcohol problem. Life for you was miserable with no prospect of improvement in your lot.”22 The sentencing judge held that but for the reduction to be allowed for future assistance pursuant to Section 21E of the Crimes Act, the appropriate sentence was one of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8½ years. The allowance which he made pursuant to Section 21E was 4 years and 3 years for the head sentence and non-parole period respectively.23 Taking the view that the applicant’s miserable and cheerless existence played a significant part in his succumbing to an offer of role of courier in return for a paid flight to Australia, the promise of a 2 week “holiday” and $10,000, the Victorian Court of Appeal said that 12 years was excessive, reduced it to 10 years ultimately imposing, once the Section 21E discount was taken into account, a sentence of 6 years with a minimum term of 3½ years. It appears from the report that Section 16G required adjustments to be made in Victoria as it does in New South Wales. The Court also made an examination of a number of previous decisions saying it disagreed with remarks in Bowers to the effect that a sentencing range or pattern had been emerging for the offence of importing a commercial quantity of ecstasy. However, it is unnecessary for us to pursue either of these aspects of that case. 24 In Behar (unreported, CCA, 14 October 1998) the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of importing 1.231 kgs of MDMA. He was regarded as a courier. The view was expressed that in the working out of the appropriate sentence for an offence of the character under consideration, a starting point of 10 years was too low unless it were reached after the discount required by Section 16G of the Crimes Act (Cth) was allowed, and even then it might be at the lower end of the appropriate range. In Behar substantial discount was allowed for co-operation but it is not necessary to pursue that aspect.25 When one has regard to the decisions and circumstances in Bowers, Budiman, Soonius and Carey, and the remarks in Behar, it is not possible to conclude that His Honour’s starting point of 13 years is out of the range of sentences reasonably available to him. Accepting that the Applicant here was not a principal, the difference in criminality between that of a courier and that of the Applicant is nevertheless substantial. Nor was the Applicant’s criminality lessened by his actions after first arrest. This difference in criminality and the difference in quantities is sufficient to explain the difference between 13 years and the head sentence imposed on Budiman. Bowers also was a courier who made early admissions, pleaded guilty and was contrite. Soonius was a courier and his psychiatric condition entitled him to some leniency for which this Applicant does not qualify. Against this is the fact that the quantity in Soonius’ case was almost three times as great and he pleaded not guilty.26 If 10 years was an appropriate starting point in Carey, once one has regard to the matters tabulated soon after we commenced reference to Carey, the Applicant was perhaps fortunate that Judge Mitchelmore in this case did not start off with a period higher than 13 years.27 Neither must sight be lost of the terms of the legislation. The maximum penalty for the offence for which His Honour thought 13 years appropriate was life imprisonment. Furthermore the effect of the legislation is also that a person who is a first offender in respect of a trafficable quantity of ecstasy under but reasonably close to 500gms is, in a worst case within that category, liable for imprisonment for 25 years in those States where remissions still apply and, having regard to the terms of Section 16G of the Crimes Act and the reduction of about one-third commonly given on that account - see El Karhini (1991) 51 A Crim R 123, Doan (unreported, CCA, 27 September 1996), Li (1998) 1 VR 637 at 641-2 - about 16½ to 17 years in New South Wales. The applicant’s criminality was high and the quantity involved was 2½ times the 500gms dividing line between trafficable and commercial quantities. We are not unconscious of the fact that in a number of decisions - see e.g. Budiman and Bushell (unreported, CCA, 7 August 1998) - ecstasy has been described as a middle range drug and regarded as creating less harm than e.g. heroin but the fact remains that Parliament has legislated as we have indicated, selecting the quantities which in its view were appropriate to fall into the categories of trafficable and commercial and for which the maximum penalties stated are prescribed.28 We turn then to the discount His Honour allowed on account of the Applicant’s promise of further co-operation. Discounts of 4 years from 13 years and 3 years from 9 years are by no means insubstantial. On the other hand, once it is recognised that the Applicant and, as His Honour seems to have found, his family, are now at risk and the Applicant will almost certainly have to serve his time in the significantly more onerous situation of protective custody, the value of the discounts is substantially lessened. There is no formula by which such discounts are to be determined and given that their determination is to a significant extent a matter of impression and subjective judgment an appellate court should be slow to interfere. However, when regard is had to the consequences, adverse to the Applicant, which we have mentioned, consequent upon his agreement for future co-operation with the authorities, the conclusion at which we have arrived is that His Honour, on this topic, erred. He should in our view have granted the Applicant a discount significantly greater than he in fact did and allowed 5 years rather than 4 years off the head sentence, making a somewhat similar adjustment to the non-parole period. 29 It was for these reasons that the Court made the orders set forth above.

     NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION v BARRY FRANCIS CROTTY & ANOR 
      
    Proceedings under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 were brought by the New South Wales Crime Commission (“the Commission”) against the defendant, in connection with his conviction of the offence of supply a prohibited drug under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The Commission sought a proceeds assessment order against the defendant, and an assets forfeiture order in respect of residential premises jointly owned by him and his wife.HELD (finding for the Commission):(1) On the face of the defendant’s conviction, and of recorded conversations made by an undercover police operative pursuant to warrants, the Commission has established an overwhelming case for the orders sought, according to the standard of proof required by the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. The conviction is a matter of record; and the conversations contain clear and unambiguous admissions by the defendant as to his importation and subsequent sale of heroin during the period specified by the Act. The defendant has made no attempt to explain this material, and the conversations are corroborated by other evidence relating to his travel records.  (2) It follows that an assets forfeiture order must be made in relation to the residential property. (3) However leave should be granted to the defendant, under the circumstances, to apply for an exclusion order on grounds of hardship to dependants or spouses pursuant to s 25(4) of the Act.  (4) In order to make a proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act:(i) regard must be had to matters specified in s 28(1) of the Act, including “moneys acquired” and the market value of the drugs. Section 28(4) precludes the taking into account of any expenses or outgoings incurred in relation to the illegal activities. Money “derived” or “acquired” is the amount which passes through the hands of the offender;(ii) a “broad brush” approach needs to be taken to the assessment, as there will rarely be records from which a precise calculation of the proceeds of crime can be made. Fagher (1989) 16 NSWLR 67; Pepin (1996) 86 A Crim R 327, considered; New South Wales Crime Commission v Yenice (Supreme Court of NSW, 5 November 1997, unreported), followed. (5) There is no reason to make any reduction on account of the possibility that the defendant had a partner, as the role of that person was not detailed in the conversations, and there is ample evidence to show that the defendant played the pivotal role in the importation and sale of the drugs.

     NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION v BARRY FRANCIS CROTTY & ANOR 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1 HIS HONOUR: The New South Wales Crime Commission brings these proceedings under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 for a proceeds assessment order against Barry Francis Crotty and for an assets forfeiture order in respect of premises situated at 5 Makim Street, North Curl Curl, being lot 18 in Deposited Plan 12515 and being the whole of the land in Certificate of Title Folio Identifier 18/12515 of which Mr Crotty and his wife, Jennifer Margaret Crotty, are joint registered proprietors. 2 The orders are sought pursuant to a summons filed in this Court on 15 December 1994, which was served on 4 January 1995 upon Mr and Mrs Crotty, together with a copy of an affidavit of Robyn Gray and a sealed copy of a minute of orders made by Spender AJ on the same day as that which the summons bears.3 The six year limitation period for the claims which are brought under sections 22 and 27 of the Act dates back accordingly to 15 December 1988.4 When the application came on for hearing yesterday, Mr Crotty renewed the request for an adjournment that had been made before Barr J and refused on the preceding day. After that renewed application was refused by me, he and his wife, who was present in the Court, declined to participate any further in the proceedings and then withdrew. The matter proceeded ex parte.5 The evidence tendered before me shows that Mr Crotty became the subject of an operation by the Drug Enforcement Agency, in the course of which an undercover buy was made from him, on 14 June 1994, of a quantity of cocaine. He was arrested and charged in relation to that transaction with the offence of supply a prohibited drug under section 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He was convicted of that offence on 16 December 1998 following entry of a plea of guilty on 17 March 1998. 6 The quantity of heroin sold exceeded the indictable quantity of five grams, and as a consequence Mr Crotty has been shown to have been involved in a serious crime-related activity, involving an indictable offence, within the meaning of section 6(2)(b) and 3(c) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, so as to attract the jurisdiction of this Court to make the orders sought.7 The restraining order made by Spender AJ on 15 December 1994 remains in force, as appears from the affidavit of Robert John Davis sworn 9 February 1995 and read in these proceedings.8 So far as the supply of cocaine is concerned, the evidence reveals that, on 2 May 1994, Mr Crotty met an undercover police operative at Wentworth Park, Glebe, and supplied him with a sample of 0.59 grams of cocaine and 1.5 grams of cannabis leaf. 9 At subsequent meetings, Mr Crotty discussed arrangements for the supply of further quantities of cocaine, as well as the supply of heroin, and made mention of prior importations by himself of heroin that he had purchased in Thailand. Some of those conversations were recorded pursuant to warrants.10 On 13 May, Mr Crotty said:  ""Too bad you weren't around a couple of months ago. I had three kilograms brought in myself. I can tell you now because I can't be busted for it now. I got rid of it through a guy at 85 an ounce.""11 The reference to ""85 an ounce"" may be taken to be $8,500 per ounce. The current price, he went on to say in this conversation, was 75 ($7,500) an ounce, although three years ago he said he was getting 10 ($10,000) an ounce.12 During the conversations on 19 May, 8 June and 10 June that were recorded, Mr Crotty explained to the undercover operative his modus operandi for bringing heroin into the country. He said that he had used a specially-designed harness worn around the groin area to carry the drugs. Additionally, he said that in order to avoid attracting attention he carried a briefcase; described himself in the PAX cards as a company director; avoided carrying or wearing silver or coins; used Tiger Balm to deter drug-sniffer dogs; and adopted the strategy of flying to Bangkok, where he stayed overnight and purchased the heroin, before flying on to the United Kingdom, where he spent a few days before returning to Sydney by a flight which permitted him to pass through Bangkok or Singapore in transit without leaving the aircraft, thereby escaping the need for any further entry being made in his passport which might show that his last destination had been in a country where drugs might have been acquired.13 During the course of these conversations, Mr Crotty encouraged the undercover operative to join him in one such trip. In this regard, he described the precautions that they might take, including booking through separate travel agencies, being seated separately on the aircraft, staying at different hotels, and avoiding waiting around the luggage carousel. Additionally, he encouraged the undercover operative to have a haircut and to remove his moustache. 14 He stated that he had usually acquired three quarters of a kilogram or one kilogram, on his earlier trips, and made mention of having sold them for prices between $8,000 and $10,000 per ounce, with a net return of roughly $200,000. At one point he said that the planned trip with the undercover operative would be his fifth and last trip. Enquiries of Immigration confirmed that Mr Crotty had in fact made four trips of the kind which he described, as follows: Depart Sydney Flight Arrival at Sydney Flight 17/11/91 QF1 23/11/91 QF10 24/06/92 QF1 02/07/92 QF2 06/04/93 QF5 13/04/93 QF2 10/08/93 QF1 19/08/93 QF1015 The evidence revealed additionally that in the PAX Cards for these flights, Mr Crotty described himself either as a ""P/Officer"" or as a company director. He was neither.16 On 10 June 1994, Mr Crotty met the undercover operative and was given $AUD3,000 to purchase an airline ticket for a further flight. Armed with this sum he attended a travel agent and purchased a return airline ticket in his name that was routed Sydney/Bangkok/London/Sydney leaving Sydney on 29 June 1994.17 On 14 June 1994 the buy of the cocaine was made in two instalments, the first in an amount of 29.1 grams, for which $4,300 was paid, and the second in an amount of 56.9 grams for which $9,000 was paid.18 Another person, Gary Raymond Hanley, was suspected by surveillance police to be assisting Mr Crotty in this deal, in the sense that it was to his premises that Mr Crotty was seen to return on more than one occasion while the transaction was going down. Each man was apprehended and of the marked buy money, $1,000 was recovered from Mr Crotty, and $8,600 was recovered from Mr Hanley, who also was found to be in possession of 10 grams of cocaine.19 The evidence otherwise shows that between 1989 and 1992, Mr Crotty had lodged income tax returns in which he variously described himself as a ""credit officer"" and ""building consultant"" and in which he disclosed gross annual income from employment, and social security benefits, not exceeding $25,000. 20 The evidence further showed that his wife was an unemployed housewife and that, in December 1994, they had four children, two of whom were aged under eighteen years, and the elder two of whom were then aged eighteen and twenty-one years.21 Further, it appeared that the home in North Curl Curl, the subject of the restraining orders, was purchased on 20 December 1991 for $210,000, that purchase being financed in part through a loan of $124,000 from the St George Bank Ltd.22 Finally, there was evidence from Detective Inspector Drury to the effect that, during the period November 1991 to August 1993, a conservative wholesale price for three kilograms of cocaine, that is roughly four importations of 750 grams each, was in the order of $630,000, calculated at $6,000 per ounce. That this is a conservative estimate is confirmed by the references, by Mr Crotty, in the recorded conversations, to the fact that he had sold the heroin he had imported at prices varying between $8,000 and $10,000 an ounce.23 In my view, the Crime Commission has established, on the face of the conviction of Mr Crotty, and the recorded conversations, an overwhelming case for the orders sought. The fact of his plea and subsequent conviction, during the relevant period, for an offence of supply involving an indictable quantity of cocaine, is a matter of record. Within the recorded conversations there are clear and unambiguous admissions by Mr Crotty, as to his importation and subsequent sale of heroin, on at least four occasions, also occurring during the period specified by the Act. 24 Mr Crotty has made no attempt to answer or explain any of this material - I can see no reason why the conversations recorded should not be taken at face value, particularly having regard to the considerable detail supplied. Moreover the account he gave in those conversations was corroborated by the PAX Cards completed in his hand, by the travel records over the relevant period, by the purchase of an air ticket routed in the very same way he had described, and by the fact that no apparent reason exists, by reference to any legitimate business activity or employment disclosed in his income tax returns, for him undertaking the several overseas trips involved. Further, the limited duration of those trips is consistent with the admissions made in those conversations. 25 I am accordingly satisfied that the relevant ingredients which would entitle the Crime Commission to the orders sought have been established, according to the standard of proof required by the Act.26 So far as section 22(2) of the Act is concerned, I find that the person (Mr Crotty) whose suspected serious crime-related activity formed the basis of the restraining order was, during the relevant period, engaged in a serious crime-related activity of the prescribed kind. 27 It follows that an assets forfeiture order must be made in relation to the residential property at North Curl Curl, the subject of that restraining order. I so order.28 In view of the course that the proceedings have taken, however, I consider it appropriate, should Mr and Mrs Crotty so request it, that leave be granted to them to apply for an exclusion order pursuant to section 25(4) of the Act. 29 For similar reasons, I am satisfied that the case is one where I am required to make a proceeds assessment order under section 27(2) of the Act. For the purpose of making the assessment, I am required to have regard to the matters specified in section 28(1) of the Act, including ""the moneys acquired"" by Mr Crotty because of his illegal activities, as well as the market value of the drugs involved in his illegal activities, which encompass both the cocaine supply and also the importation and supply within this country of heroin. I am not to take into account any expenses or outgoings incurred in relation to those activities (section 28(4)).30 The present case is not one based upon asset betterment principles. Rather, the claim is pursued upon the basis of the wholesale price received for the heroin, and the difference between the buy moneys of $13,300 for the cocaine and the sum of $9,600 recovered, namely $3,700.31 Reference has been made, in decisions concerning proceedings brought under similar legislation, to the inevitable broad brush approach that needs to be brought to the assessment of the value of the benefits or moneys received from illegal activities: See Fagher (1989) 16 NSWLR 67 and Pepin (1996) 86 A Crim R 327. This is in recognition of the circumstance that those involved in such criminal activities rarely, if ever, keep books of account or other documents from which any precise calculation of the proceeds of crime can be made. 32 The need for a broad brush approach to the present Act was confirmed by Callaway AJ in New South Wales Crime Commission v. Yenice, Supreme Court New South Wales, 5 November 1997, unreported. I see no reason to depart from that approach.33 As I have recounted earlier, Mr Crotty has, in recorded conversations, fixed the price he received for the heroin at prices ranging between $7,500 and $10,000 per ounce. Detective Inspector Drury placed a more conservative figure upon the commodity of $6,000 per ounce. In my view, a figure of $7,000 per ounce may properly be adopted, in this case, as a conservative estimate, allowing for some possible exaggeration by Mr Crotty in order to attract the interest of the undercover operative in joining in or financing a further importation. 34 Taking a similarly conservative approach in assuming that the four importations admitted were each of three quarters of a kilogram, approximating a quantity of three kilograms which Mr Crotty referred to in the recorded conversations as being an amount that he had brought in by himself, the proceeds or benefit acquired would be calculated as follows: 4 x 26 ounces x $7,000 = $728,000.35 Some reference was made, in the recorded conversation, on 19 May 1994 to Mr Crotty having had a partner at some stage in the importation and sale of heroin. The role of that person, if such a person existed, is not detailed in the conversations, nor is it made clear when it was that such person made the last of the trips mentioned. 36 What is clear, however, is that Mr Crotty was the driving force in effecting the purchase of the heroin, in carrying the drugs, in clearing them through Customs, and in arranging for their resale. There is nothing in the conversations to suggest that the co-offender Hanley, in relation to the cocaine supply offence, had anything to do with the heroin dealings, or that he was the partner referred to.37 Moreover, there is the admission earlier mentioned that Mr Crotty brought in three kilograms of heroin by himself.38 So far as he made reference to borrowing moneys or securing funding and expenses from elsewhere, those costs are required to be excluded. Moreover, the terms of section 27(1), as well as section 28(1) and (4), state that it is the amount of money that is ""derived"" or ""acquired"", ie the amount which passes through the hands of the offender, - that is to be assessed as the proceeds in respect of which an order under section 27 is to be made.39 Accordingly, I see no reason to make any reduction on account of the possibility that Mr Crotty had a partner, or that he derived any portion of the proceeds of his illegitimate activities, as an agent for, or otherwise on behalf of some other person. To the sum of $720,000 assessed in the manner previously explained, I add the sum of $3,700, being the difference between the sum received by Mr Crotty for the controlled buy of the cocaine and the sum later recovered.40 While, theoretically, a claim could have been made for the full amount of the buy, the Crime Commission has fairly confined its claim, in this regard, to that portion of the buy moneys which were received by Mr Crotty but not recovered. Accordingly, I will make a proceeds assessment order in the sum of $731,700.41 I note that Mr Crotty does seek leave in relation to exclusion of the premises from the forfeiture order. In order to give effect to that application and otherwise to give effect to these reasons, I will make orders in accordance with the short minutes prepared by counsel for the Crime Commission, which I have signed and will date today.42 I formally make an order that the defendants pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.43 That order is to include any reserved costs.

     REGINA v. ANDREW ROSS LAWLER 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    GREG JAMES, J:1 The appellant Andrew Ross Lawler stood trial before Judge Shillington, QC. at Queanbeyan District Court on 3 August 1998 on one count under s.61I of the Crimes Act 1900, that is, a charge that he, on 25 December 1996, at Yass did have sexual intercourse with a woman named in that indictment without her consent knowing that she was not consenting thereto. The appellant had pleaded not guilty.2 His Honour, at the conclusion of the trial, returned a verdict of guilty.3 On 23 October 1998, the appellant was sentenced to four years penal servitude comprising a minimum term of 18 months and an additional term of two years and six months.4 By notice of appeal dated 4 November 1998 signed by the appellant’s barrister, the appellant launched an appeal against conviction only contending that his Honour had erred in law concerning the lack of consent.5 On 12 February 1999, by letter, notice was given of grounds of appeal setting out some 10 grounds, ground one of which complained that his Honour erred in finding there was no consent by the complainant. The balance of the grounds are as follows:- ""2. His Honour misdirected himself and was significantly influenced in his decision regarding the 'hysterical' nature of the complainant. 3. His Honour misdirected himself when he referred to the evidence of Miss Wall. 4. His Honour exculpated the complainant's evidence re lack of complaint by referring to her 'hysterical' nature in an unfair fashion favourable only to the Crown which was not available on the evidence. 5. There is a perceived personal bias or prejudice by his Honour in favour of the complainant regarding the evidence of menstruation. 6. His Honour failed to adequately address the evidence of intoxication of the complainant. 7. His Honour placed an unfair/moral inference on evidence that Mr. Lawler was unaware which girl was in the room. 8. His Honour failed to consider on a Jones v. Dunkell factor why a number of Crown witnesses were not called to give evidence. 9. His Honour failed to take into account the possibilities of the complainant’s evidence being tainted by Ms. Fitzgerald. 10. The verdict was in all the circumstances unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 6 In support of the appeal, we have been provided with written submissions on behalf of the appellant providing the argument in support of the various grounds. The last ground, pleaded as it is, notwithstanding the decision of the High Court in Fleming v. The Queen [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 158 ALR 379; (1998) 73 ALJR 1 and that of this court in Regina v. Maxwell (unreported 23 December 1998) does not, in the light of the written submissions, raise any mere failure, expressly, to enunciate in the judgment any particular matter but is directed to the effect of the cumulative effect of the other grounds, all of which, on analysis, seek to highlight particular matters in evidence as the focus of attacks.7 Although there is limited reference in the papers to a belief on the appellant’s part in the existence of consent (his Honour found against such belief), the trial was conducted and the submissions to this court postulated upon the basis that there was no issue in controversy at the trial except that of consent. Thus the complainant’s credibility, or truthfulness and reliability when assessed in the light of all the evidence, was critical. His Honour was plainly alive to this.8 No issue arises in this case to examine the applicability of any legal expansion of the concept of lack of consent as might have been affected by s.61R since what is referred to in this case is an alleged express consent by the appellant and a lack of it by the prosecution. The defence asserted a positive consent. The prosecution asserted a complete absence of consent and a denial of consent was given in evidence by the complainant. Indeed the prosecution case accepted by his Honour and based upon matters expressed in evidence by the complainant was that there were circumstances of significance to her which were reasons why she would not have consented. There was additional, circumstantial evidence, particularly her demeanour tending to confirm her denial of consent.9 Shortly, his Honour found the following and I set out the passage in his Honour’s reasons. Since an order for suppression had been made, I delete the name of the complainant where appearing in that passage:- ""The facts are that [the complainant] and the accused were among a group of young people who attended among other places the Australia Hotel at Yass on Christmas Eve and the early hours of the morning of Christmas Day 1996. The hotel was open until about 3.00 am and the group left either at closing time or some of them at some earlier stage. The complainant occupied a flat which was near the hotel in Comur Street, Yass. She shared it with two girls, Christie Blundell and Kelly Wall. The three occupants of the flat apparently went back, probably a little earlier than a group of other young people who arrived. Those other young people included the accused and among others Jason Yates, a friend of the accused. [The complainant’s] account is that she was very drunk, she had been drinking for a considerable time during the night and went straight to her room. She says that she fell on her bed fully clothed and was lying across the bed. Her friend, Jennifer McGann, came in and sat down for a short time in a seat in the room and Christie Blundell one of the other flatmates came in also. It was the evidence of both the girls that they left and at that stage, the complainant appeared to be asleep. The lights were turned off and the doors closed. The next event in the recollection of the complainant according to her account, was that she was aware of someone in the room on the bed having intercourse with her. She said that her jeans and pants were partly down and it is of significance at the time she said, that she was having her periods and that she had a pad in her pants. She was aware next, of the lights being turned on and hearing male voices. The lights were then turned off. She said that the person who was on the bed appeared to be again attempting to have vaginal intercourse with her. She said that she struggled, kicked and called out but at the time she was lying - as she had been earlier - on her stomach. The room was still in darkness. She said that the males who were in the room apparently left, she pulled her pants up and then proceeded to leave the room in an hysterical state going towards the bathroom. She said that she passed the loungeroom, seeing the accused and Jason Yates in that room, looked at them and said, 'dirty bastards, what were you doing to me in the room, what did you do to me?'. She said that at no time did she consent to any sexual relations with the person in the room, she spoke to other flatmates in the flat, she was described by those other people as being in an hysterical condition. It is certainly true that she made no statement that she had intercourse with a male in the room but that is a fact which is not in any event in dispute. It must also be borne in mind that at the time, she was quite hysterical. I accepted that was the situation, one of the witnesses said that she was hyperventilating at one stage. She asked to have her father called and shortly afterwards as a result of Christie Blundell ringing the parents’ home, they came and took her off.""10 His Honour based his decision on those findings:- ""My conclusion is that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the account given as to what happened in the bedroom by the complainant was a truthful one. I am satisfied that she was certainly deeply asleep when the two girls left the room as I have already outlined, I bear in mind that the accused said that he was not aware of who was in the room, he claims nevertheless that the girl consented to have intercourse with him in clear terms yet quite clearly again she violently objected very shortly afterwards and on the account by the accused for no apparent reason."" As I have said, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was an act of sexual intercourse as outlined. I am satisfied that there was no consent by [the complainant], certainly not in terms of words or by implication, I bear in mind that the evidence of [the complainant] is that she was having her periods at the time. I am satisfied that when intercourse commenced, that the girl was asleep and that the accused knew that to be the situation and for that reason that he must have realised that she was not consenting and I am satisfied that she did not consent. For these reasons I conclude that the elements of the charge have been made out, I therefore return a verdict of guilty on the charge on the indictment.""11 His Honour specifically referred to the absence of a complaint particularly specifying non-consensual intercourse not only here but later in his judgment when reviewing the evidence of other persons present in the flat who would have observed the complainant’s demeanour when she rushed from the bedroom.12 His Honour found the appellant’s account to be as follows (again, dealing with the complainant’s name in the fashion I have already described):- “The accused’s account which was given in evidence before me and also was substantially in accordance with the interview between he and the arresting police, was that on the night in question having been to various hotels in Yass and having consumed between 10 and 15 schooners of beer and some spirits but nevertheless being aware of what he was doing he says, that he went to the flat with others and apparently waited outside for a little while and then the group went up into the flat itself which is up on the first level. He says that he was in the loungeroom when Jason Yates and another young man Aaron Symons he said that he felt tired, he had a considerable amount to drink and decided that he would go home. He said that he then got up and went into the corridor outside the loungeroom where he and the other two young men were and there he saw Aaron Symons, he pointed towards the door in which it turned out [the complainant] was at that time. He said he did not know whose room it was, he had been to the house on previous occasions and at least on one occasion had slept overnight but he did not believe it was that particular room. He said he entered the room, it was then dark, he was aware that there was a girl lying on the bed, he said that that girl in fact was lying parallel to the bed itself and not across the bed and that he then lay down on the bed and shortly afterwards, Jason Yates came in and lay on the floor. He said that he was aware of the girl, he did not know who she was but assumed that it was one of the occupants of the flat, put her arm across his chest. He then reacted and asked whether she would have sex with him. He still did not know, he said, who it was. The girl asked who he was and he said ‘Drew’, he said he asked again if she would have sex with him and that she said ‘yes’. He then, he said, her having undone the top button of her jeans and she having to pull her clothing down, commenced to have sexual intercourse with her. He said that she suddenly started to scream and he became scared and apprehensive and then left the room and went to the loungeroom and that Yates followed shortly afterwards. He had no recollection of the girl who passed and went down to the toilet saying words to the effect of dirty bastards or dirty bastard. He said that he believed that the girl had consented to have intercourse with him because he had asked her on two occasions and she had affirmatively said yes and that therefore she was having consentual (sic) intercourse and that he therefore also believed that she was consenting to what happened. He said that he spoke to someone when he was in the loungeroom after the two men had left and girl’s bedroom, that would be either being Kelly or Christie, 'that nothing happened that she did not want to happen'."" 13 His Honour continued:- ""As I have said, when the accused was interviewed by Constable O’Dea - Detective O’Dea as he then was and Constable Olsen, he gave an account which was substantially in accordance with the evidence which he gave here today.""14 His Honour specifically gave the appellant the benefit of good character but rejected his evidence.15 His Honour’s findings of fact and his reasoning are challenged but this is not an appeal by way of rehearing.  Regina v. Kurtic (1996) 85 A. Crim. R. 57; nor has leave been sought to appeal on fact:  Regina v. Ion (1996) 89 A. Crim. R. 81. To paraphrase the remark made in Regina v. Cable (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 183 at 185, s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act (1912) is ""not intended to substitute for trial by [one judge] who [has] seen and heard the witnesses, trial by three judges who have not"". The grounds of appeal appear to be drafted from a perspective which fails to distinguish between his Honour’s role as fact finder and his role as judge of the law and which fails to give proper regard to the role of this court and the requirements of s.5 of the Criminal Appeal Act.16 Questions of credibility are peculiarly for the primary tribunal of fact. They are rarely open to review in such an appeal as this:  Chidiac v. The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 432;  M v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487.17 In the absence of some such matter as would cast doubt on the reasonableness of the verdict (it was plainly supported by the evidence), as would show error or law or otherwise raise a possible miscarriage of justice, the verdict must stand: Fleming (supra) and Maxwell (supra).18 This said, notwithstanding that certain of the grounds appear at most to raise questions of fact something should be said about each of them particularly since one of the submissions as to the safety of the conviction is concerned with the cumulative effect of other grounds.19 I shall defer for the moment the examination of the matters raised by Grounds 1 and 10 since both raise the ultimate issue in the circumstances of this case, ie. the question of consent, and since the other grounds to an extent bear on them.20 Grounds 2 and 4 complain that his Honour impermissibly deprived, what was asserted to be the unexplained absence of relevant complaint, of its significance for the complainant’s credibility when his Honour noted reasons why the complainant may not have so complained thus providing a basis that her credibility not be for that reason adversely affected. His Honour expressly referred to the lack of complaint. The matter he referred to as a possible explanation and the significance of that explanation were matters appropriately considered by the tribunal of fact: see s.405B of the Crimes Act 1900;  Regina v. Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12;  Crofts v. The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427;  Regina v. Lemura (CCA, unreported 18 December 1998).21 What is complained of is not a misdirection of law but that his Honour as fact finder accepted evidence and gave it weight in accepting the complainant’s account. There was clearly evidence to support his Honour’s finding and that finding was not unreasonable. These grounds should be rejected.22 Ground 3 raises a matter of fact from the evidence of one of the minor prosecution witnesses. His Honour’s finding complained of is not unsupported by the evidence or unreasonable and could only have played at most a minor part in his final conclusion. His Honour’s reference to the matter indicates he was alive to the change in evidence which was, if anything, to the benefit of the appellant. This ground should be rejected.23 As to Ground 5, there is no evidence of any such bias. The tests are reviewed in Gibson v O’Keefe (Einstein, J., unreported 2 June 1998); Rogers v. Wentworth, (Handley JA., unreported 9 October 1998); Maxwell (supra), applying Webb & Hayes v. The Queen (1993-94) 181 CLR 41.24 No reasonable apprehension of bias or prejudice could be entertained on such a basis. All his Honour did was to enunciate a not improbable basis given by the complainant to support her assertion that she would not have consented to intercourse at that time. His Honour was noting that she regarded the matter, personal to her, as significant in that context and that there was evidence of the relevant facts.25 Similarly, there was no basis for Ground 7. His Honour was plainly entitled to have regard to a matter indicating the somewhat cavalier approach by the appellant to the identity of a sexual partner. Such was relevant to the defence contention of a specific express invitation to sexual intercourse.26 I wish to add to the arguments advanced on these last two grounds as to his Honour’s observations in his judgment, so far as they are said to indicate some improper influence or bias in his Honour rejecting the submissions of the appellant or otherwise indicating a view of the evidence adverse to the appellant were entirely inappropriate. In particular the reliance on those observations as inappropriate judicial comment tending to overbear the fact finding tribunal; Regina v. D (1997) 68 SASR 571 and Regina v. Machin (1996) 68 SASR 536, was completely misplaced. His Honour was the fact finding tribunal and was exposing his own reasons. The exposure of those reasons should not have attracted the attack on bias or prejudice grounds as made here. There was no legal ground for challenge to that process.27 There is nothing whatsoever to support the contention advanced in Ground 6. The submissions concede his Honour’s specific reference to intoxication. Insofar as this may have gone to a lack of memory by the complainant of a given consent and thus may have detracted from the credibility of her denial of having consented, this matter was plainly before his Honour as fact finder.28 Grounds 8 and 9 raise nothing but vague speculation. His Honour referred to the absent witnesses. The submission put to him by defence counsel raised the matter in the context that explanations had been given for the absence of some of the witnesses. The remaining witnesses would seem only to be relevant to complaint. Defence counsel had the benefit of the submission that the evidence of the witnesses whose absence was unexplained would not assist the Crown. The lack of complaint to all, not merely the parents, was clearly before his Honour and noted by him. In the case of the witness Fitzgerald, by reason of her absence counsel was able to raise unrebutted and unqualified a suggestion that she assisted the complainant to attend the police and complained to them for her. On this it was sought to build a conclusion that somehow that meant that all the evidence of the complainant was in some unexpressed, unreasoned fashion, tainted. Such a suggestion has no reasonable basis.29 The “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground, as it was once referred to (see Fleming (supra)), asserted as a basis for acquittal by reason of the contention the jury should have acquitted, requires this court to make its own independent assessment of the evidence and in particular to have regard to any defects or inconsistency. I refer to the passages in the Crown submissions which adequately summarise the position:- ""64. The test to be applied by this court in approaching a ground such as this was set out in the majority decision of the High Court in M. v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 in the following terms:- 'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.' (vid. Also Jones v. The Queen (1997) 72 ALJR 478 at 85). 65. The test was also considered in Regina v. McKnoulty (1995) 77 A. Crim. R. 333 at 339 per Hunt, CJ. At CL:- ‘It is also important to emphasise that the High court in M has not stated that the mere existence of discrepancies or inconsistencies in the evidence is sufficient to lead to the verdict being held to be unsafe or unsatisfactory. If they exist, they must be of such a nature as to persuade this court that there is a 'significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted'.' ... 69. The same test is applicable to a judge sitting alone pursuant to s.32(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act: R. v. Kurtic (1996) 85 A. Crim. R. 57 at 60.” 30 Turning then to the grounds which directly raise the real, indeed almost the only issue of the trial. As to Ground 1, it is submitted that the appellant gave evidence directly claiming express consent and that was the only acceptable evidence on the topic because, the complainant in cross-examination, when various propositions foreshadowing the evidence given by the appellant were put to her, answered in terms denying any memory of such.31 It is submitted that these answers should be understood as meaning that she conceded she could not dispute the relevant occurrence because she had no or insufficient memory. In this regard, her admitted intoxication is also relied upon to support such a reading. I do not accept such an interpretation. I do not see such a reading of the evidence does justice to her replies. I would read them as denials of the assertions. I would not consider it unreasonable of the trial judge to accept the answers as confirming the complainant’s account in chief or at the least not detracting from it. I consider there was direct evidence from her and both from her and from others, powerful circumstantial evidence of lack of consent such as entitled the trial judge reasonably to reject the appellant’s contention.32 Having assessed the whole of the evidence and taking into account the submissions put on this and on the other grounds, I do not see any matter in the evidence dealing directly or remotely with the issue of consent to cause me to have a doubt, ie. to apprehend an innocent person might have been convicted or to conceive, putting it another way, that his Honour should have had a reasonable doubt. I see no basis to review his Honour’s finding on this issue.33 Therefore I would also reject Grounds 1 and 10.34 I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.35 GROVE, J: I agree with Justice Greg James and the orders which he proposes for the reasons which he has given.36 DUNFORD, J: I also agree.37 GROVE, J: The order of the court will therefore be as proposed by Justice Greg James.

      Application of Pt 13A to Federal offences: 
        
       
       (a) It is not correct, as a matter of statutory interpretation of Part 13A of the Crimes Act, when considered in conjunction with s 68 of the  
      Judiciary Act 
      ,  
       that Federal offences are excluded from that Part.

      Whether power is an administrative power: 
       
      (a)  
      An inquiry directed pursuant to s 474E(1)(a) “by a prescribed person”, following application under s474D(1), is not judicial in nature (it is a power to inquire and to report, not to decide or determine the application); and consideration of an application to direct such an inquiry is not incidental to the exercise of judicial power.

      (b) Consideration of an application, referred under Section 474E(1)(b), by the Court of Criminal Appeal and dealt with as an appeal, does involve the exercise of a judicial power, and consideration of an application for referral under such provision may properly be regarded as incidental to the exercise of judicial power; and hence it is picked up by s 68 of the  
      Judiciary Act 
      . 
       
       
      (4) Although s 68 of the  
      Judiciary Act 
       picks up s 474(1)(b) and not s 474(1)(a), this does not give an “altered meaning” to the State legislation so as to render the application of s 68 inappropriate.

       APPLICATION OF NEIL HAROLD PEARSON 
       
       
      The applicants, convicted of various offences under s 234 of the  
      Customs Act 1901 (Cth) 
      , brought an application for an inquiry into their conviction under Pt 13A, s 474D of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      . They sought an order referring the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The respondents argued that (a) Pt 13A did not apply to summary offences; (b) Pt 13A did not apply to Federal offences; and (c) power exercised under s 474E(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       is an administrative power, and thus not exercisable by a State Court in respect of a Federal offence. 
       
       
      HELD 
       (allowing the application): 
       
       
      (1)  
      Application of Pt 13A to summary offences: 
       while it may be somewhat excessive for there to be an independent right to review under Pt 13A of the  
      Crimes Act 
       in relation to summary offences, the general wording in s 3 and the Second Schedule, to the effect that Pt 13A “shall be in force with respect to all offences, and in whatsoever court tried”, cannot be disregarded.

      (2)  
      Application of Pt 13A to Federal offences: 
        
       
       (a) It is not correct, on a matter of statutory interpretation of s 68 of the 
       Judiciary Act 
       (which provides for State courts’ jurisdiction over federal offences), to find that Federal offences are excluded from Pt 13A.

       (b) However, an inquiry under Pt 13A does not fall easily within the “hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith” in ss 68(1)(d) and 68(2) of the  
      Judiciary Act. 
       Nevertheless, when read with s 3 of the  
      Judiciary Act 
       (which defines “appeal” as including “any proceeding to review or call in question the proceedings decision or jurisdiction of any court or judge”), prima facie a Pt 13A inquiry would fall within the provisions of the  
      Judiciary Act 
      , as “proceeding” is a term of wide application.

      (a) The determination pursuant to s 474E(1)(a) whether to “direct that an inquiry be conducted by a prescribed person”, in respect of an application under s474D(1), is not judicial in nature (it is a power to inquire and to report, not to decide or determine the application); nor is it incidental to exercise of judicial power.

     APPLICATION OF NEIL HAROLD PEARSON 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: A preliminary point has arisen in this matter, going to the jurisdiction of the Court to consider an application made under Part 13A Crimes Act 1900, for an inquiry into a conviction for an offence arising under federal law. BACKGROUND2 The matter has a long and chequered history. The Applicants, Neil Pearson and Neil Pearson & Company Pty Limited, are importers of commercial laundry washer-extractors. A dispute concerning the appropriate customs tariff classification, and the rate of customs duty, applicable to the machines imported by them, came before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and was determined on 1st August 1989. This was followed by an information, charging the applicants with various offences under S234 of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), that was laid in the Local Court.3 Before that matter came on for hearing, appeals to the Federal Court, and to the Full Federal Court, from the decision in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, were heard and determined on 27 June 1990, and 8 March 1991,respectively.4 The information came on for hearing, before Magistrate Gould, in August/September 1991. The applicants were convicted, in respect of fourteen charges, on 11 September 1991, and pecuniary penalties were imposed. They then appealed to the District Court, pursuant to s122 of the Justices Act.5 The de novo appeal came before Hosking DCJ, and was heard by him, over several days, during August 1993 and March 1994. In June 1994, Hosking DCJ was requested to state a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. On 1 December 1995, the decision of that Court was handed down.6 The proceedings came back before Hosking DCJ on 2 February 1996. On that occasion, after declining applications by Mr. Pearson and his company, to reopen their case, and then to state a further case for the Court of Criminal Appeal, his Honour found the offences proved and confirmed the convictions that had been recorded in the Local Court.7 On 3 May 1996, an application, in the nature of a certiorari, came before the Court of Appeal in respect of the rulings made by Hosking DCJ. On 12 July 1996, that application was dismissed. A subsequent application to the High Court for special leave to appeal was refused.8 It may be taken that in dealing with the offences, the Local Court, and the District Court, were exercising Federal jurisdiction conferred pursuant to SS 39(2) and 68(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).9 The applicants have now brought an application to this Court pursuant to S 474D of the Crimes Act 1900, for an inquiry into their conviction. The order they seek is that the Court refer the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (S474E(1)(b) and S474 L).10 The Attorney General for New South Wales and the Collector of Customs were notified of the application. Each foreshadowed an objection, upon the ground that the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain an application of this kind, where it is brought by a person convicted of an offence arising under Commonwealth law. I determined that it was appropriate to hear argument upon that point,, before embarking upon any consideration of the application upon its merits. By following this course, I do not regard any of the parties to have submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court, or to have otherwise waived any right to argue the matter, on the merits, should it be held that this Court does have jurisdiction to entertain the application. As the jurisdictional question involved a matter arising under the Constitution, notice has been given to all other States and Territories under S 78B of the Judiciary Act. No other State or Territory has sought leave to intervene.11 The question which arises for determination is whether a person convicted and sentenced in New South Wales, in respect of a summary offence under Federal law, can bring an application for an inquiry into such conviction or sentence, under Division 3 of Part 13A of the Crimes Act.12 Relevantly, Division 3 of Part 13A contains the following provisions: “474D (1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person. (2) …  474E (1) After considering an application under section 474D or on its own motion: (a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a prescribed person into the conviction or sentence, or (b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. (2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case. (3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if: (a) it appears that the matter: (i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or (ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the repealed provisions, and (b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action. (3A) … (4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application. (5) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).13 The procedure for, and the action to be taken upon completion of any inquiry conducted following a direction made under S 474E (1)(a), (or under S 474C, for those cases that fall within Division 2 of Part 13A, following presentation of a Petition to the Governor), is prescribed in Division 4 of Part 13A, which relevantly provides: 474G (1) An inquiry under this Division is to be conducted by: (a) a prescribed person appointed by the Governor, if the conduct of an inquiry was directed by the Governor; or (b) a prescribed person appointed by the Chief Justice, if the conduct of an inquiry was directed by the Supreme Court. (2) The prescribed person conducting the inquiry has: (a) the powers, authorities, protections and immunities conferred on a Commissioner by Division 1 of Part 2 of the Royal Commissions Act 1923; and (b) in the case of a person who is a Judge of the Supreme Court or whose instrument of appointment under this section expressly so provides, the powers and authorities conferred on a Commissioner by Division 2 of Part 2 of the Royal Commissions Act 1923 (except for section 17). (3) … (4) … 474H (1) On completing an inquiry under this Division, the prescribed person must cause a report on the results of the inquiry (incorporating a transcript of the depositions given in the course of the inquiry) to be sent to: (a) the Governor, in the case of an inquiry held on the direction of the Governor; or (b) the Chief Justice, in the case of an inquiry held on the direction of the Supreme Court. (2) The prescribed person may also refer the matter (together with a copy of the report) to the Court of Criminal Appeal: (a) for consideration of the question whether the conviction should be quashed (in any case in which the prescribed person is of the opinion that there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the convicted person), or (b) for review of the sentence imposed on the convicted person (in any case in which the prescribed person is of the opinion that there is a reasonable doubt as to any matter that may have affected the nature or severity of the sentence). (3) After considering a report furnished to the Chief Justice under this section, the Supreme Court must cause its own report on the matter (together with a copy of the prescribed person’s report) to be sent to the Governor. (4) The Governor may then dispose of the matter in such manner as to the Governor appears just.”14 In addition, Division 5 of Part 13A makes provision in relation to matters referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, as follows: “474L On receiving a reference under S 474C(1)(b) or 474E (1)(b), the Court is to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and the Act applies accordingly.”15 In summary, the points sought to be argued on behalf of the Collector for Customs, (who took up the matter on behalf of the Commonwealth), and the State of New South Wales, are as follows:(a) As a matter of statutory interpretation, the power to refer a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal under S 474 E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act is confined to matters in respect of which an appeal would otherwise lie to that Court, and hence is not applicable to a case of the present kind where the applicants were convicted of a summary offence;(b) As a matter of statutory interpretation, Division 3 of Part 13A Crimes Act 1900 applies only to persons convicted under State laws, and not to Federal offenders.(c) The power exercised under S 474E(1) of the Crimes Act is not a judicial power, or a power incidental or ancillary to such a power, and hence is not available to be exercised by a State Court, in respect of a Federal offence, by reason of the Boilermakers Case (R v Kirby: ex parte Boilermakers Society of Australia (1956) 94 CLR 254).16 I shall deal with these points in turn, noting before I do that the Commonwealth does not have a statutory scheme for inquiring into convictions or sentences for Federal offences. Part VII C of the Crimes Act (Cth) which deals with pardons, the quashing of convictions and spent convictions, does not provide any analogous mechanism for inquiry into convictions for federal offences, or any right to seek a review post conviction. APPLICATION OF DIVISON 3 OF PART 13A OF CRIMES ACT 1900 TO OFFENCES DEALT WITH SUMMARILY17 It was submitted that, by reason of the existence of the power under Part 13A (both under S 474C(1)(b) and S 474E(1)(b)), to refer a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal “to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912”, it was implicit that the Part can only have application to persons convicted on indictment, in the District Court or in the Supreme Court. This submission was based on the circumstance that an appeal does not lie to the Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of convictions for summary offences dealt with by Magistrates, or by Judges of the District Court on appeal from Magistrates, (S 146 Justices Act 1902) (NSW).18 Attention was drawn additionally, to the existence of a mechanism, under Part 4A of the Justices Act 1902, whereby, after inquiry, the Local Court is now given jurisdiction to annul convictions, penalties and orders in summary proceedings, upon application by a person, (S 100D) or upon referral by the Minister, where the holder of that office is “satisfied that a question or doubt has arisen as to the guilt of the person or the person’s liability for a penalty.” (S100 G). The existence of such a jurisdiction, it was submitted, is inconsistent with any legislative intent that Part 13A Crimes Act should extend to permit an inquiry into convictions for summary offences, whether entered in the Local Court or in the District Court, after a hearing de novo following appeal to that Court.19 In reply, the applicants submitted that there was no warrant for reading down Part 13A in this fashion. In advancing this proposition, it was pointed out that S3 of the Crimes Act, states that the Sections mentioned in the Second Schedule, which include the provisions of Part 13A, “so far as their provisions can be applied, shall be in force with respect to all offences … and in whatsoever Court tried”. Had there been a legislative intent to limit the application of Part 13A, in the manner contended, then so it was submitted, it might have been expected that in the definition section to that Part, (S 474A) or otherwise, the Act would have so provided.20 This submission was said to derive support from the legislative history, which in 1992 saw an amendment made to the forerunner to Part 13A (S475 Crimes Act 1900), which had replaced the procedure for post conviction inquiries introduced by the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1883 (ss 383 and 384), so as to insert the words “in any Court” into S 475(1). It then read “whenever, after the conviction in any Court of any person, any doubt or question arises as to his guilt…”. The explanatory note to the amending provision stated in part: “The proposed amendments will enable the Supreme Court to give such a direction or application by or on behalf of any convicted person, making it clear that such a direction may be given in respect of a conviction in any Court and enable such a direction to be given to any judicial officer.”21 When S 475 was itself replaced by Part 13A upon enactment of the Crimes Legislation (Review of Convictions) Amendment Act 1993, it was submitted, there was no manifestation of any intention to do anything other than to broaden (and not to narrow) the review procedure: See the Explanatory note to the Bill and the Second Reading Speech, Hansard, Legislative Council, 27 October 1993 pp 4487-4488). 22 This Act, it may be noted, amended the Crimes Act and the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, with the effect of, inter alia, broadening the powers of the person conducting the inquiry, and of enabling that person to refer a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, for review by it, if that person was of the opinion that there was a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused person. 23 The 1993 Act, it may be also noted, was further amended by the Crimes Amendment (Review of Convictions and Sentences) Act 1996, which amended S 474E (1) to provide that, after considering an application for an Inquiry into a conviction, the Court could refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal, and to extend the Section to sentences, as well as to the proceedings giving rise to conviction and sentence. Its obvious purpose was to clarify and improve the procedure for review (see the Second Reading Speech, Hansard, Legislative Council 12 September 1996, pp 4095-4096).24 In relation to the existence of the review mechanism under the Justices Act 1902, it was submitted, that those provisions had no application where the conviction was entered in the District Court, following a rehearing, since the Part was prescribed as applicable to “review procedures for convictions, penalties and orders made by magistrates in summary proceedings.” (S 100A of the Justices Act) 25 Even if this Part could apply to permit a magistrate to review a conviction for a summary offence, confirmed in the District Court, then it was submitted, this would not necessarily bar review by the Supreme Court under Part 13A. Being a remedial provision, it was argued, Part 13A should be interpreted beneficially (Varley v Attorney General (1987) 24 A CrimR 413 at 428) so as to afford the utmost relief which the fair meaning of its language would allow: see also The Pieve Superiore: Giovanni Dapueto v Wyllie & Co (1874) L.R. 5 P.C. 482 at 492; cited with approval by Street CJ in Fleming v White (1981) 2 NSWLR 719 at 722, where his Honour also observed, relevantly for the submission earlier noted, that “a Court of Petty Sessions is in every sense a Court: Justices Act 1902, S 5” (ibid)26 In the Application of Mathews (Supreme Court of New South Wales 10 June 1994, unreported) Abadee J, did in fact entertain an application under S 474D of the Crimes Act, in relation to a summary conviction in the Local Court upon a charge of offensive conduct. No question as to jurisdiction was raised, the application being dismissed upon the basis that no doubt or question as to jurisdiction was raised.27 The extension of jurisdiction to summary offences was not the subject of express discussion in the explanatory notes, or in the Parliamentary debates, at the time of the various amendments, save so far as the width of the expressions variously employed might suggest that the legislature intended to include those offences in the review procedure. The point at issue is a significant one, since if the applicant’s submission is correct then the reach of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Part 13A is exceedingly wide.28 That it was intended to be so wide is by no means clear. By reason of the nature of the right of appeal to the District Court, conferred in relation to summary offences (Division 4 of Part 5 Justices Act and see also S 132C), and the limitations upon removal of such matters to, or intervention by, the Supreme Court (see Divisions 1 to 3 of Part 5, of the Justices Act, and also S 146 of that Act) it is at least questionable whether Part 13A should be constructed so as to apply to summary offences, thereby permitting an additional means of review by a Court, which clearly was not intended to act as a court of criminal review for summary matters, save to a limited extent.29 The discretion to refer a matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal, exercisable by the Minister in response to a petition made to the Governor (S 474C (1)(b) and (c)), by a Supreme Court Justice ( S 474E(1)(b), and by a prescribed person following inquiry under Division 4 (S 474H (2)), is a central element of Part 13A. The fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has no independent jurisdiction to entertain appeals from convictions or sentences in summary matters, or to intervene in relation to such matters save upon a limited basis, might tend to suggest that the Part was intended to be confined to convictions and sentences entered upon indictment, which are amenable to appeal in that Court, and if appropriate, to an order that any such conviction or sentence be quashed or varied. Upon that basis, it might well be said that the relevant provisions “can(not) be applied” in relation to summary offences (S3 of the Crimes Act).30 Further it is certainly well arguable that the introduction of a specific regime for the review of convictions, penalties and orders by magistrates in summary proceedings (Part 4A Justices Act) is consistent with a legislative understanding and intention that Part 13A Crimes Act does not apply to summary offences. In this regard it may be noted that S 100P of the Justices Act provides: “An application may not be made by a person under (Part 4A) if an appeal or an application for leave to appeal has been made by the person under this Act to the Supreme Court, the District Court or the Land and Environment Court”.31 It may also be noted that S 111 of the Justices Act provides: “(1) Any person who appeals under the provisions of this Division against any determination of a Justice or Justices from which he might appeal to the District Court or the Land and Environment Court shall be taken to have abandoned such last mentioned right of appeal.The reference to an appeal “under the provisions of this Division” is a reference to an appeal by way of case stated to the Supreme Court.32 Section 111 continues: (2) Nothing herein shall in any way interfere with, curtail or limit the powers of any person to apply for an order of prohibition against the determination of any Justice or Justices.”33 Where a conviction is recorded following an appeal to, and hearing de novo in, the District Court, such Court has power, inter alia, “by its order” to “confirm … the conviction, order, sentence or adjudication appealed against” (S 125 Justices Act) Additionally, S 130 Justices Act provides: “Where any such appeal has been decided in favour of the respondent any Justice may issue his warrant of commitment as if no appeal has been brought”.34 These provisions provide some support for the proposition that, in relation to summary offences, the Legislature intended to limit the extent of potential review post conviction, and in particular to provide those aggrieved by a conviction, with a choice between an application to the Supreme Court by way of a Stated Case (S 101) or by way of statutory prohibition (S 112); or application to the District Court by way of a hearing de novo (S 122); or application for a review by a Local Court (S 100D or 100G). This would be consistent with a legislative intention that Part 13A of the Crimes Act was not to apply to convictions or sentences in respect to summary offences, whether recorded or passed in the Local Court or confirmed on appeal in the District Court.35 Additionally, it is arguable that S 474E(1)(b) can be invoked only in relation to those cases which, from the outset, were capable of being taken to the Court of Criminal Appeal. As I have observed, no right of appeal lies under the Justices Act, to the Court of Criminal Appeal, from a summary conviction that has been entered in the Local Court, or confirmed on appeal by the District Court;nor does any such right arise under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Section 5 of that Act, which provides for a general right of appeal, confines such right to persons convicted “on indictment”. So far as the Act permits appeal in relation to cases decided by Courts in “their summary jurisdiction”, that right is confined to matters heard in the Supreme Court (S 5AA), the Land and Environment Court (S 5AB), or the Court of Coal Mines Regulation (S 5AC). Otherwise the Act extends an appeal right for summary offences only where they were dealt with as matters “related to” an indictable offence in the Supreme Court or in the District Court (S 5AD). 36 A matter of the kind the subject of the present application is not a matter that could ordinarily be dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal, “as an appeal”, as contemplated by S 474E(1)(b). By its nature it is not justiciable in the Court of Criminal Appeal, and any appeal to that Court would have to be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. 37 On the other hand, S 3 of the Crimes Act in conjunction with the Second Schedule does make it clear that the provisions of Part 13A “So far as these provisions can be applied, shall be in force with respect to all offences … and in  whatsoever Court tried”. S 474L is capable of being read as empowering, and directing, the Court of Criminal Appeal to deal with a matter referred to it “in the same way” as if it were an appeal that was justiciable in that Court. In that sense it can be regarded as a source of jurisdiction, enlivened once a matter is referred under the Part.38 Having regard to the matters outlined, it may be somewhat burdensome, if not excessive, for there to be an additional and independent right to seek review under Part 13A of the Crimes Act, in relation to summary offences. I am not , however, persuaded that the words of general ambit in S 3 and in the Second Schedule to the Crimes Act, can be lightly disregarded, or that this ground of objection to jurisdiction has been made good.  APPLICATION of PART 13A to FEDERAL OFFENCES39 There has been some precedent for the review under legislation analogous to Part 13A of the Crimes Act, of convictions returned, upon indictment, for federal offences, eg The Queen v Collie (Court of Appeal, Victoria, 18 December 1992 unreported, and Perrier v Kerr, Ryan J, Federal Court of Australia, 19 August 1997 unreported.40 These decisions were, however, concerned with applications for referral, based upon petitions for mercy presented under S 584 of the Crimes Act (Vic) 1958, which provides: “Nothing in this Part shall effect the prerogative of mercy, but the Attorney General on the consideration of any petition for the exercise of Her Majesty’s mercy, having reference to the conviction of a person on indictment or to the sentence passed on a person so convicted, may, if he thinks fit, at any time either - (a) refer the whole case to the Full Court and the case shall then be heard and determined by that Court as in the case of an appeal by a person convicted; or (b) if he desires the assistance of the judges of the Supreme Court on any point arising in the case with a view to the determination of the petition, refer that point to such judges for their opinion thereon, and such judges or any three of them shall consider the point so referred and furnish the Attorney-General with their opinion thereon accordingly.”41 In Perrier v Kerr the Court was concerned with the question whether the refusal of the Minister, to refer the applicant’s petition for mercy to the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, was reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Ryan J, there observed, at p 3 - 4: “It was the submission of Counsel for the applicant and not by Counsel for the respondent, that the effect of s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act is to vest in the Commonwealth Attorney-General the power referred to in s584(a) of the Crimes Act. Counsel relied upon the decision in Peel v The Queen (1971) 125 CLR 447 where a majority of the High Court, departing from the reasoning in Williams v The King (No 2) 50 CLR 551, held that s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act operated upon s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) so as to enable the Commonwealth Attorney-General to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a sentence imposed by the Supreme Court or a Court of Quarter Sessions. I agree with Counsel for the applicant that s 585(a) of the Crimes Act when read in conjunction with s68(2) of the Judiciary Act operates to vest the corresponding equivalent discretionary power in the Commonwealth Attorney-General. For examples of subsequent application of the reasoning ofthe majority in Peel v The Queen see Rhode v Director of Public Prosecutions (1986) 161 CLR and Lamb v Moss (1983) 49 ALR 633 at 560.42 In Collie the applicant’s petition for mercy was referred by the Attorney General (Commonwealth) to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to S 584. In the judgment of that Court it was noted that: “Counsel for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (who adopted the role of respondent upon the hearing of the referred petition) expressly conceded that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the reference of the Commonwealth Attorney-General: Judiciary Act S 68(2)”In Saxon (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 21 April 1998 unreported) the Commonwealth conceded that, subject to referral by the Minister, the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales could entertain a matter, involving a conviction upon indictment for a federal offence, initiated under Division 2 of Part 13A, at least so far as S 474C(1)(a) and (b) were concerned.43 By reason of the concession made in these cases, and by reason of the difference in the basis upon which the jurisdiction was sought to be enlivened, they provide only limited assistance in relation to the present case, and in particular in relation to the question whether Division 3 of Part 13A should be read down as confined to convictions arising under State law.44 The submission in this regard was expressly confined to Division 3 of Part 13A, since the exercise of the administrative power, that is required preparatory for a reference under Division 2 of Part 13A, is vested in an individual, and not in a Court or Judicial Officer (S 474C(1)).45 Reference was made to the decision of Barr J, in the Application of James William Shepherd (New South Wales Supreme Court, 13 September 1996 unreported). The application in that case was for an inquiry into a sentence. It failed for two reasons: first, by reason of his Honour’s conclusion that, as a matter of construction, Division 3 as it was then enacted, before the 1996 amendments), was concerned only with inquiries into convictions and not into sentences; and secondly, by reason of the conclusion that the “scheme set forth in Part 13A (was) intended to enable applicants to apply only in respect of Sate convictions”. 46 In dealing with this second ground, his Honour said,  at pp 6-7: ""S 12(1)(b) of the Interpretation Act 1987 provides that in any Act reference to a locality, jurisdiction or other matter or thing is a reference to such locality, jurisdiction or other matter or thing in and of New South Wales. The intention of s 12(1)(b) is to provide the natural limit of legislation so that it applies in its subject matter to those situations which have a nexus with New South Wales: O’Connor v Healey (1967) 69 SR (NSW) 110 per Jacobs J at 114 (where his Honour was discussing s 17, Interpretation Act, 1897, an earlier version of the rule). Pt13A lacks any specific indication of an intention to apply to a conviction for a Commonwealth offence and that in my view is sufficient to lead to the conclusion that it does not so apply: Grollo v Bates (1994) 53 FCR 218 at 242. It seems to me therefore that the word ‘conviction’ as used ins 474D must mean conviction for a New South Wales offence. This construction seems consistent with the scheme of Pt 13A which, like its predecessors, operates as a statutory means open to a convicted person to apply to the Crown for the exercise of the prerogative of mercy. See White v The King; Varley v Attorney General (1987) 8 NSWLR 30. It is the Governor who has power to receive reports and consider whether to pardon - see s 474H(3), (4). By s 4(1) of the Crimes Act “Governor” means, except in respect of the exercise of the pardoning power, the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council. See also Interpretation Act s 14. It does not appear why it should be any business of the Governor of New South Wales to be pardoning offences other than New South Wales offences. S 474E(4) provides that this Court might consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application. By s13(b) of the Interpretation Act this means the Crown in the right of New South Wales, not of the Commonwealth of Australia. For these reasons it seems to me that the scheme set forth in Pt 13A is intended to enable applicants to apply only in respect of State convictions.”47 The reasons so expressed were embraced by the objectors in this case. Additionally, Counsel argued that the reference to “the Minister,” in S 474E(5), was to be read as a reference to the Minister administering the Act, namely the relevant State Minister - S 15(2)(a) Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW). 48 Reliance was also placed upon the fact that in the Crimes Act S 4(1), and in the Interpretation Act (NSW) (S14), the “Governor” was defined as “the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council”, which Council is itself defined by s 21 of the Interpretation Act, to mean “the Executive Council of New South Wales”. 49 The question whether Part 13A of the Crimes Act (NSW) was made applicable to federal offences, by reason of s 68 Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), was expressly not considered in Shepherd, having regard to the first basis upon which the application was found to be not justiciable. Accordingly, it does not stand as an authority in the way of the applicants.50 Section 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 provides (so far as relevant): (1) The laws of a State or Territory respecting the arrest and custody of offenders or persons charged with offences, and the procedure for: (a) their summary conviction; and (b) their examination and commitment for trial on indictment; and (c) their trial and conviction on indictment; and (d) the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith; and for holding accused persons to bail, shall, subject to this section, apply and be applied so far as they are applicable to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of whom jurisdiction is conferred on the several Courts of that State or Territory by this section. (2) The several Courts of a State or Territory exercising jurisdiction with respect to: (a) the summary conviction; or (b) the examination and commitment for trial on indictment; or (c) the trial and conviction on indictment; of offenders or persons charged with offences against the laws of the State or Territory, and with respect to the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith, shall, subject to this section and to section 80 of the Constitution, have the like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth.51 It was submitted by the applicants that the provisions of Part 13A of the Crimes Act concern “the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any … conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith” (s 68(1)(d) and hence constitute a “law of a State” as contemplated by s 68(1) of the Judiciary Act. It was further submitted that reference to the New South Wales Interpretation Act was of no assistance in determining the applicability of Part 13A to federal offenders, since the relevant legislative intent was that of the Commonwealth Parliament. The real question, so it was submitted, was whether Part 13A was one of the statutory laws of a State that was contemplated, as being taken up by s 68 of the Judiciary Act.52 In response to the submission that found favour in Shepherd, it was argued by the applicants that it was appropriate to adapt, analogously, the relevant State law to the context of a Commonwealth offence, since to do otherwise would be to deprive s 68 of any meaning. So it was that in Peel (1971) 125 CLR 447, the reference in S 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), to the “Attorney General,” was read as embracing the Attorney General in the right of New South Wales, and also the Commonwealth Attorney General: see also Rohde v DPP (Cth) (1986) 60 ALJR 627 and Carngham (1978) 140 CLR 487. 53 In Peel Gibbs J said, at 468 to 469: “The third question is whether the right of appeal which s 68(2) confers is given to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth. As Jordan CJ pointed in R v Williams; R v Somme,, if s 68(2): ‘… is read as meaning that the jurisdiction is to be restricted to hearing appeals by persons designated by the State Act, it becomes nugatory, because neither persons convicted on New South Wales indictments nor the Attorney General of New South Wales could have any concern with appeals arising out of trials or convictions for offences against the laws of the Commonwealth’ This provides a sound reason for concluding that in the application of s 68(2) ‘the adoption of State law must proceed by analogy’ (Williams v The King [No.2] (1934) 50 CLR at 561) Section 5 of Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) gives a right of appeal to a person convicted upon indictment under State law and s 68(2) in its operation on s 5 gives a right of appeal to persons convicted upon indictment under the law of the Commonwealth. Section 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act gives the Attorney General of the State a right of appeal because he is the proper officer to represent the State; s 68 (2) in its operation on s 5D gives a right of appeal to the Attorney of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth as to the proper officer to represent the Commonwealth. The functions exercised by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth are like functions to those of the Attorney of the State and the jurisdiction exercised by the Court of Criminal Appeal in hearing and determining an appeal by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth against a sentence imposed for an offence against Commonwealth law is a like jurisdiction to that exercised by the Court of Criminal Appeal by the Attorney-General of the State against a sentence imposed for an offence against the law of the State.”54 Peel was applied in Rohde (by Gibbs CJ, Mason and Wilson JJ at 629, and by Brennan J at 630) in holding that in the application of S 68(2) of the Judiciary Act, in relation to S 567A of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic), the adoption of the State law proceeded by analogy. In the absence of an express power conferred on the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions with respect to appeals, the appropriate analogy to the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions was held to be the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. The right to appeal under S 567A(1) of the Crimes Act (Vic) 1958 was accordingly invested in the holder of that office, and indirectly in the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (through S 9(7) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth)). 55 The reasoning in these cases is, in my view, applicable to the present case and leads to the conclusion that, subject to the argument next examined, it is not correct, as a matter of statutory interpretation, to find that federal offences are excluded from Part 13A of the Crimes Act. 3. HAS DIVISION 3 OF PART 13A BEEN ‘PICKED UP’ BY S 68 OF THE JUDICIARY ACT56 The purpose of S 68 is not in dispute. It was enacted pursuant to the power, conferred by S 77(iii) of the Constitution, to make laws investing any Court of a State with federal jurisdiction, with respect to any of the nine matters mentioned in SS 75 and 76, of the Constitution. These include matters arising under any law made by the Parliament S 76(ii): Murphy v The Queen (1985) 158 CLR 596, at 613, where at 617, the High Court said that S 68:  “fulfils an important role in ensuring the federal criminal law is administered in each state upon the same footing as State law and avoids the establishment of two independent systems of Justice.” See also  R v Loewenthal; Ex parte Blacklock (1974) 131 CLR 338 at 345, and Williams v The King (No 2) (1934) 50 CLR 551 at 560.57 It was conceded by the applicants that, in order to make good the claim to jurisdiction, it was necessary for them to show that the jurisdiction to conduct an inquiry, under Division 3 of Part 13A, falls within the expression “the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith”, as that expression appears in S 68(1)(d) and S 68(2) of the Judiciary Act. It was accepted that the remaining paragraphs (a) to (c)of S 68(1) were of no assistance.58 An inquiry under this Part, or more specifically an application for an Inquiry, does not comfortably fall within the relevant expression. Such an inquiry or application would not, in normal usage of the language, involve a “hearing or determination of an appeal” arising out of any … trial or conviction, or out of any proceedings connected therewith”. 59 The question which arises, however, is whether for the purposes of the present exercise, the extended definition of “appeal” contained in S3 of the Judiciary Act, makes a difference. By that Section, “appeal” is defined to include:  “an application for a new trial and any proceeding to review or call in question the proceedings decision or jurisdiction of any Court or Judge.” 60 This calls for consideration of the meaning of the expression “proceeding to review or call in question …”, and in particular whether in the definition Section, the Legislature had in mind an application of the kind now before the Court. The expression “proceeding” has been given a wide meaning to include for example any step in an action (Pryor v City Office Co (1883) 10 QBD 504 at 507-508 per Brett MR), or a method permitted by law for moving a Court or Judicial Officer to some authorised act (Cheney v Spooner (1929) 41 CLR 532 per Isaacs and Gavan Duffy JJ at 536-537). 61 In Federated Amalgamated Government Railway and Tramway Service Association v New South Wales Railway Traffic Employees Association (1906) 4 CLR 488 Griffith CJ said at 494 : “The word ‘proceeding’ is a term of very wide appreciation. In my opinion the term ‘proceeding before the Court’ (as used in S 31(2) of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904) includes every matter brought before the president in the exercise of the Judicial functions conferred upon him by the Act.”62 In Colpitts v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1986) 70 ALR 554 Burchett J, at 565-566, interpreted the expression ‘review’ as involving as an integral element the power to alter the result. 63 The initial consideration of an application under S 474D by a Supreme Court Justice does not include the exercise of any such power to alter the result. Such consideration is of a preliminary kind, and is designed to sieve out those applications that should be refused and those that should be moved forward. However, upon reference to it, the Court of Criminal Appeal would have such power. Additionally, it could legitimately be said that the purpose of an application under Division 3, Part 13A is to “call in question” the relevant decision. This brings me to the constitutional question.64 The objectors submitted that, as a matter of constitutional law, S 68 of the Judiciary Act cannot pick up Division 3, of Part 13A, because the nature of the power or function conferred by that Division is one of an administrative rather than a judicial kind. The applicant’s response was that the power under S 474E involves a power “incidental to a judicial function”, and hence its adoption was not beyond power.65 It is clear that no power other than a judicial power, or a power or function incidental to it, may be lawfully conferred by the Commonwealth Parliament on State Courts: British Medical Association v The Commonwealth  (1949) 79 CLR 201 at 236; Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital v Thornton (1953) 87 CLR 144 at 151-152; Hilton v Wells (1985) 157 CLR 57 at 68; Murphy v The Queen (1985) 158 CLR 596 at 614; Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1996) 189 CLR 51 at 66, 103, 115 and 135; and Gould v Brown (1988) 72 ALJR 375.66 The question whether or not a function is “incidental to” the exercise of the Judicial power of the Commonwealth, has been held to depend upon considerations such as whether the suggested incidental function has a “sufficient relation to the principal or judicial function or purpose to which it may be thought to be accessory”: R v Kirby; ex parte Boilermakers Society of Australia (1956) 94 CLR 243 at 278; and “whether the incidental function is ‘inconsistent with the co-existence of judicial power’”: R v Federal Court of Bankruptcy; ex parte Lowenstein (1938) 59 CLR 556 at 567.67 The line is not easy to draw. In The Queen v Davison (1954) 90 CLR 353, where it was held that the making, by a Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy, of voluntary sequestration orders was an impermissible exercise of judicial power, Dixon CJ and McTiernan J, in a joint judgment, observed (at 368-369): “The legislature may commit some functions to courts falling within Chapter III although much the same function might be performed administratively. In the judgment of this Court in Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital v Thornton (1953) 87 CLR 144, the observation occurs: ‘Many functions perhaps may be committed to a court which are not themselves exclusively judicial, that is to say which considered independently might belong to an administrator. But that is because they are not independent functions but form incidents in the exercise of strictly judicial powers.’ It is this double aspect which some acts or functions may bear that makes it so difficult to define the judicial power.”68 In the present case, it is important that S 474E(4) expressly provides that “proceedings under this Section are not judicial proceedings”: see also Varley v Attorney General (NSW) 1987 8 NSWLR 30 at 49 and Rendell (1987) 32 A CrimR 243 at 244, where the administrative nature of a post conviction review was affirmed. The applicants accepted that the power arising under S 474(1)(a) is not a judicial power, or one which is incidental to such a power. Any inquiry ordered under that sub section is of an administrative nature. 69 This because the power of a “prescribed person” conducting an inquiry is one to inquire (S 474G), and to report (S 474H) into doubts concerning the convicted person’s guilt: New South Wales v Canellis (1994) 181 CLR 309 at 330. The prescribed person conducting the inquiry has no power to decide or determine the application, a power that has been regarded as the hallmark of judicial power: Lockwood v The Commonwealth (1954) 90 CLR 177 at 180.70 The determination whether to “direct that an inquiry be conducted by a prescribed person”, in respect of an application brought under S 474D(1) accordingly does not involve the exercise of a power incidental to a judicial power. It follows, as was conceded by the applicants, that the Supreme Court would be precluded from directing an inquiry under S 474E(1)(a) in the present case. 71 The question which remains is whether S 474E(1)(b) may yet be validly picked up by S 68 of the Judiciary Act. It may be accepted, as I have observed earlier, that the power exercised by the Court of Criminal Appeal to deal with a case referred to it “as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912” does involve the exercise of judicial power. Does it follow that the determination whether to refer an application, brought under S 474D to that Court (pursuant to S 474E(1)(b)) may properly be regarded as involving the exercise of a power incidental to a judicial power, and hence picked up. 72 The exercise to be undertaken by the Supreme Court, in relation to an application, made under S 474D involves three possible outcomes: (i) a direction for an inquiry by a prescribed person (S 474E (1)(a); (ii) a reference of the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal “to be dealt with as an appeal” (S 474E (1)(b); or (iii) a refusal to consider or to otherwise deal with the application (S 474E(3).73 By analogy with the principles established in relation to S 79 of the Judiciary Act, it would be inappropriate to apply S 68 so as to pick up some, but not all of the otherwise applicable terms, of Division 3 of Part 13A if to do so would be to give an altered meaning to the State legislation: The Commonwealth v Mewett (1997) 71 ALJR 1102 at 1141 per Gummow and Kirby JJ; citing Maguire v Simpson (1977) 139 CLR 362 at 376.74 It was submitted by the objectors, in this regard, that the Supreme Court either has jurisdiction or not, and that the constitutional validity of the application of Division 3 of Part 13A could not depend upon the fact that, after examining the application, the Justice considers it appropriate to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal. To find constitutional validity upon so narrow a basis, for what is in essence a preliminary consideration of an application, without authority to consider, or to exercise the remaining option was, it was argued, contrary to principle. 75 I am not persuaded that to pick up S 474(1)(b) but not S 474E(1)(a), in the present context is to give the State legislation an “altered meaning”. Section 68(1) of the Judiciary Act permits the application of State laws “so far as they are applicable.” Additionally, the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) requires that New South Wales legislation be “construed as operating to the full extent of but not so as to exceed, the legislative power of Parliament” (S31(1)). It further requires that, where a provision of an Act, or the application of any such provision, would be construed as being in excess of the legislative power of Parliament, then it is to be treated as “a valid provision to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power,” and the remainder of the Act, and the application of the provision “shall not be affected,” (S 31(2)).76 I finally observe in this context, that the decisions in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230, Brown v R (1986) 160 CLR 171 and Cheatle v R (1993) 177 CLR 541 provide examples of the partial picking up of State laws. 77 In Kesavarajah, a question arose as to the fitness of an accused to be tried for a Commonwealth offence. The Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) contains provisions concerning the disposition of an accused who had been found unfit to be tried, but no provision as to the procedure by which the issue of fitness was to be tried. It was held that the State law regulating the method of determining that issue was picked up by S 68, but the consequences remained to be determined by Commonwealth law. There was an inconsistency between the State and Commonwealth laws concerning that aspect, so that the latter prevailed. Otherwise the procedural provisions that were lacking under Commonwealth law were made applicable through Sections 68 and 79 of the Judiciary Act. 78 In Brown the Court was concerned with the election that an accused had under State law (S7 of the Juries Act 1927 (SA)) to trial by Judge alone. By reason of S 80 of the Constitution it was held by a majority (Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ; Gibbs CJ and Wilson J dissenting) that the State Supreme Court must sit with a jury when it exercised federal jurisdiction. To that extent, only part of the State legislation was lifted by an application of S 68 of the Judiciary Act, and there was a difference in the mode of trial potentially available for State and federal offenders respectively. 79 Cheatle is to like effect so far as it was held by the High Court that the provisions of a State Act could not, consistently with S 80 of the Constitution, operate to authorise the conviction of the appellants by majority jury verdict, in a trial on indictment for an offence against a Commonwealth law. The effect of the decision was that the relevant State law (S 57(1) Juries act 1927 (SA) did not apply in relation to the trial of Commonwealth offences. The Court expressed its conclusion in the following terms: “… history, principle and authority combine to compel the conclusion that s 80’s guarantee of trial by jury precludes a verdict of guilty being returned in a trial upon indictment of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth otherwise than by the agreement or consensus of all the jurors. That being so, S 57 of the Juries Act 1927 (SA) cannot, consistently with s 80, operate to authorise the conviction of either of the appellants by a majority verdict. Their convictions were unconstitutional and must be set aside. The conclusion that s 57 cannot validly apply to authorise the return of a majority verdict of guilty in the trial on indictment of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth does not mean that the South Australian Courts lack jurisdiction to entertain such trials. Section 22a(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1915 (SA) requires that every provision of every Act of the Parliament of South Australia “be construed so as not to exceed the legislative power of the State”. In compliance with that directive, the provisions of s 57 must be read down so as not to purport to apply, of their own force, to the trial on indictment of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth. The guarantee of trial by jury contained in s 80 of the Constitution does not preclude the relevant provisions of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) from otherwise operating to vest jurisdiction in respect of trials on indictment of offences against laws of the Commonwealth and the South Australian Supreme and District Criminal Courts constituted by a judge and jury.80 This decision provides a further example of portion only of a power or procedure of a State Supreme Court being picked up when dealing with a federal offence, compared with its power when dealing with a State offence.81 In my view, similar considerations apply in the present case, and that picking up S 474(1)(b), without S 474(1)(a) does not give any altered meaning or application to the State legislation. The only difference lies in the fact that, if the Court determines that an application is suitable for an inquiry, then, in the case of a conviction or sentence arising under federal law, the way in which it is to be determined is limited to that provided in S 474E(1)(b). Parliament may be taken to have adopted, in this regard, one of the modes for determination of the remedy or procedure, which State law provides, for its analogous jurisdiction concerning convictions under State law. To that extent the difference is procedural, and not unlike that seen in Brown and Cheatle, where the State legislation was taken up, but with restrictions as to the mode of trial, precluding majority verdicts and trial by judge alone. In the present case, if the Court considers that an application merits review, then one of the two ways prescribed for its determination is taken up.82 A further question that arises is whether S 68(2) Judiciary Act should be read down in this case, so as to avoid a construction that would empower the Commonwealth to impose upon a State Supreme Court an obligation to conduct a function, on its behalf, without the legislative consent of the State in accordance with the principles discussed in R v Humby; Ex parte Rooney (1973) 129 CLR 231 at 239 per McTiernan J, and at 240 per Gibbs J, and at 245-246 per Stephen J. 83 It may be recognised that a function or power to consider and conduct a post conviction inquiry, other than by way of appeal, does constitute an additional burden for a State Court. Such a function or power has no equivalent in the Common Law of pardon (Varley at 414); it does not fall within any inherent jurisdiction; and it depends upon a statutory grant of power. Although this point was not fully argued, I am not persuaded that, in accepting federal jurisdiction in relation to criminal prosecutions, and appeals generally, Legislative consent has not also been extended to review of the kind here under consideration.84 In this regard, I observe that some precedent already exists which assumes the acceptance by State Supreme Courts of jurisdiction in respect of matters referred by the Minister under Division 2 of Part 13A, (R v Lloyd Saxon, Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 1 April 1998 unreported) or under analogous provisions in other States. (see paras 41 and 42 above). The concession made in Saxon also accepted the partial picking up of S 474C of the Crimes Act (S 474C(1)(a) and (b) but not (c)).85 For these reasons, I am not persuaded that the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the application made by the applicants under S 474D (1) of the Crimes Act 1900. I shall hear the parties in relation to any order that may be sought for costs, or for any deferral of further consideration by me of the question whether the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, pending appeal from this judgment.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 60698/97 GROVE J LEVINE J DOWD J  Friday 5 March 1999 
     
     REGINA v ALLA KASSOUA 
    JUDGMENT1 GROVE J : The appellant was convicted on counts of shooting with intent to murder (Crimes Act s 29) and robbery being armed with a dangerous weapon (Crimes Act s 97(1)) after a trial before Graham DCJ and a jury at Parramatta. He was sentenced for each offence to concurrent penal servitude for seven years divided into minimum and additional terms of four and three years respectively.2 On the night of 10-11 June 1996 two men disguised in balaclavas held up the staff of a nightclub known as Lucky Lil’s and escaped with cash of about $10,000. A member of staff chased the offenders as they left and a gun was discharged at him by, on the Crown case, an accomplice of the appellant. We were informed that no person has been identified or charged as such accomplice.3 Five grounds of appeal were filed as follows: “1. The evidence of identification of the appellant by Steven Cloke and David Atalifo should not have been admitted in the trial proceedings. 2. The directions given by the learned trial judge on the evidence of identification were inadequate. 3. Evidence of statements said to have been made by the appellant to Detective Parsons should not have been admitted.  4. There is fresh evidence available from the proceedings of the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service which is relevant to the assessment of the weight to be given to the evidence of Detective Parsons. 5. The verdicts of guilty of shoot at with intent to murder and guilty of armed robbery are unsafe and unsatisfactory.”An additional ground to which I will later refer was argued at the hearing of the appeal.4 The principal thrust of the appellant’s argument was directed towards ground 1. Although described as identification evidence the material was also classifiable in a more discrete category namely recognition evidence. It was conceded by senior counsel for the appellant (who did not appear at trial) that the evidence was not technically inadmissible but he contended that it ought to have been excluded in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion. 5 Lucky Lil’s was a basement bar accessible by stairs leading down from the street. Although usual hours extended to 3 am, on the night in question and in the absence of customers the manager decided to close at midnight. Two staff Aaron McMillan and David Atalifo commenced to clean the bar whilst the manager Mr Cloke started counting the takings in an office. During this time no one else was observed in the premises. After conclusion of the cleaning Mr Cloke and Mr Atalifo commenced talking to each other in the office and during this time Mr McMillan departed. The conversation in the office was not interrupted by either of the men going to lock the door behind Mr McMillan. About five or ten minutes later on a video monitor they noticed someone crouching inside the front door and appearing to lock it. On another monitor they saw two men disguised in balaclavas heading down the stairs. Mr Atalifo attempted to slam the outer office door shut but an intruder forced it and sprayed something in his face. Although this caused his eyes to water he did not lose vision and he saw that the man was armed with a gun. The second man stood behind the armed intruder and said “give us your money”.6 Mr Atalifo recognized the voice of the appellant whom he knew as “Alla”, a frequent customer of the bar to whom he had spoken on many occasions.7 Both offenders entered the office and the armed man continued to menace. In the course of these events Mr Atalifo said “don’t do it Alla, we know it is you”. The appellant said “shut up Dave, or we’ll shoot you”. As noted, Mr Atalifo’s first name was David. The appellant also said, presumably intending to address his accomplice “shoot them, shoot them”. 8 Mr Cloke prepared to hand over the money box but Mr Atalifo intervened saying “don’t give it, because it’s only Alla”. Mr Cloke responded by saying “don’t be silly, just give it”.9 The appellant acquired the money and placed it in a bag and the two intruders decamped. Mr Atalifo chased them. Mr Cloke telephoned the police. He then watched the monitors upon which he saw the two men unlocking the door when Mr Atalifo came running around a corner whereupon the armed man turned, pointed the gun at him and fired. Mr Atalifo had apparently seen the action preparatory to discharge and successfully jumped back thus avoiding the line of fire. 10 Mr Cloke knew the appellant as a customer of the bar and even as disguised upon entry he thought (at least to the threshold of probability) that the appellant was one of the offenders (not the one carrying the gun). When the appellant spoke, Mr Cloke became certain of his identity.11 The challenge argued in respect of ground 1 was that the evidence of recognition of the appellant given by Messrs Cloke and Atalifo should have been withdrawn from the jury on the broadly stated basis that by reason of its poor quality its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect: Alexander v The Queen 1981 145 CLR 395; R v The Queen 1991 171 CLR 207; 1989 18 NSWLR 74; R v Tugaga 1994 74 A Crim R 190.12 Evidence by two witnesses of actual recognition of an offender does not suggest poor quality but such was said to be derived from behaviour of the witnesses variously described by counsel for the appellant as remarkable, mysterious and inconceivable. That behaviour was said to be centred upon a continuing failure to tell police that they knew the offender and give his name.13 Police responded promptly to Mr Cloke’s telephone call. It was submitted that although both members of the bar staff most directly involved in the armed robbery claimed to have recognized the appellant as one of the robbers during the course of the commission of the robbery and also claimed to have actually spoken to him by that name whilst the robbery was in progress, neither nominated the appellant as one of the men responsible for the armed robbery when initially asked by the police to give a description of the offenders.14 Concessions in cross examination relating to the non passing of the name by Mr Cloke and Mr Atalifo were referenced. However as Mr Berman of counsel for the Crown pointed out, the submission overlooked the evidence of Constable Rowe who, together with Senior Constable Baulkham, were the first uniformed police on the scene. His evidence included: “Q. Did you hear one of the employees say something as to the identity of someone? A. He did, I don’t recall the exact words he used, but he mentioned that he knew one of the fellows who had held up the hotel. As they had a conversation, they called each other by their names and he recognized him as a regular. I don’t recall the exact words he said but I do recall he said that, that he recognized him as a regular from the hotel.”15 These police were on the scene within minutes of the offences. Constable Rowe was affected by a burning sensation when he entered the office and the evidence of discharge of sprays by the intruders is congruent with this. In these moments there were arrivals of ambulance officers and further police including uniformed and detective branch personnel. It was for the jury to assess whether these circumstances were potential of confusion and whether any discrepancies in recollection and recounting of the details of events were significant.16 The police response had been rapid enough to make an area observation for the offenders practical even if hot pursuit had been foreclosed. As the submission recognizes and the evidence shows, the potential witnesses were asked for descriptions. A name would have been of remote assistance to anyone in a position to undertake search and surveillance whereas description was capable of providing a meaningful target. Both Mr Cloke and Mr Atalifo supplied descriptions.17 In determining that the evidence of recognition be admitted, the discretion of the learned trial judge did not miscarry. Indeed the evidence of Constable Rowe fortifies the correctness of his decision.18 Whether expressed (as some submissions were) by incanting the often awkward terminology of the Evidence Act or in terms of miscarriage of discretion I would reject the contention that any error on his Honour’s part has been shown.19 For completeness I refer to argument concerning the circumstance that the security cameras at Lucky Lil’s were equipped with video tapes. About ten minutes prior to the robbery the image of the appellant appears upon one of the tapes demonstrating conclusively that he was in the vicinity at that time. It was put to Mr Cloke and Mr Atalifo that they identified the appellant after being shown those tapes. That suggestion must, it was conceded have implied that those witnesses had fabricated the conversations in the office in which the names Alla and Dave were used. I am unable to discern anything other than a credibility issue rightly left for determination by the jury. 20 In written and oral submissions the appellant introduced a further ground of appeal asserting that evidence of a separate incident at the nightclub on 2 June 1996 should not have been admitted. 21 It emerged that various witnesses had seen the appellant on the night of 2 June leave the nightclub premises by the fire doors and leave them open. Thereafter he was seen to be attempting to enter the front door of the premises but it had been locked in the meantime and there was evidence that staff detected a following attempt to gain entry through the fire door by two men but it had also by that time been locked by the staff. 22 The intention to adduce this evidence had been foreshadowed and was the subject of a voir dire hearing and separate ruling by the trial judge. On the voir dire evidence his Honour ruled that the Crown could argue as available inferences that from that evidence the accused was manifesting the intention to participate in a robbery or similar attack on 2 June and that, in the light of that, was more likely to have committed the offence on 10 June in the sense that the evidence would assist in excluding any possibility of mistake in identification of the appellant as a perpetrator on the latter occasion.23 As his Honour’s judgment makes plain the matter was argued before him seeking exclusion pursuant to the broadly expressed discretions vested by ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act whereas on appeal this ground was sought to be argued on the basis that the evidence ought not to have been admitted “in accordance with the principles established in ss 97-101”. Those provisions import special requirements where tendency or coincidence evidence is sought to be relied upon. This was not the evinced intention of the Crown at trial. The Crown suggested that the “successful” crime on 10 June was related to the actions on 2 June in the sense that the earlier activity was capable of being assessed as failed attempt at what was later achieved. Such evidence does not in my opinion specifically fall into the category of tendency or coincidence and is in the category pertinent to occasions where evidence of failed attempt has been admitted as part of the continuity of circumstances which led to a later completed crime: cf King v The Queen 1986 161 CLR 423; R v Kalazjich & Orrock 1989 39 A Crim R 415.24 In charging the jury his Honour left the matter consistently with his ruling. Inter alia, he directed them that the evidence that the appellant had departed through the fire escape door was, if they were satisfied if that was what happened, significant in the sense that “the accused left in that fashion and that you would draw the inference that he was doing so in connection with the subsequent attempt to try and get into the premises”. In summarizing the Crown allegation and its reliance upon this evidence he told the jury that the Crown relied upon the episode as “evidence that the accused had an intention as early as that Sunday night of taking part in a robbery at the premises”.25 Shortly thereafter he said in further summary: “The Crown says all of those aspects of the accused’s conduct add up to one thing, and one thing only and that is a conclusion that he was acting that way because he was evidencing an intention on his part to participate in an armed robbery on that night. The plan was thwarted and the Crown says that intention continued through until the next week……….”26 A specific complaint is made that there was and could be no evidence supporting an intention to commit an armed robbery (as distinct from robbery) on that night. The complaint is valid. 27 After further reminding the jury of the evidence about the matter his Honour returned to the observation that it was the Crown case that this was evidence from which the jury was being invited to “draw the inference that he intended to take part in a robbery of the premises on that night but it was foiled”.28 No objection was specifically taken to the apparent slip when his Honour described the earlier activity as evincing an intention to commit an armed robbery. I am persuaded that no jury would have come to any different conclusion by reason of the use of that inaccurate expression on that one occasion in that context and that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred thereby. Although his Honour’s use of the adjective on the one occasion was erroneous I would apply the proviso to s 6 (1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 29 As to the first argument in support of the ground, it is dependent in effect upon a reclassification of evidence on the basis upon which it was debated and determined at trial. For obvious reason there was no explanation offered on behalf of the prosecution as to whether there should be any dispensation from the requirements of notice or the like when the issue had not been even raised. 30 The issue was fairly litigated between the parties and the jury were appropriately left to weigh the evidence in accordance with the manner in which it had been argued. I would not uphold this added ground.31 The next ground challenged the adequacy of the directions on identification given by the trial judge. It was conceded by senior counsel that the directions actually given by his Honour were beyond criticism but he claimed that they did not reach the standard established by cases such as Domican v The Queen 1992 173 CLR 555 in the sense that it was contended that his Honour failed to put the weight of his judicial office into alerting the jury of weaknesses in the identification evidence. As already observed this was a case in a discrete category of recognition and it was for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence of recognition was correct. The evidence of recognition was the subject of attack not on the basis of mistake but on the basis that the witnesses were fabricating, possibly as a result of becoming convinced of the identity of the appellant by reason of having seen him on the security video. The submission was advanced in terms that “it was inherently unbelievable that on five separate occasions the appellant had been suspected of criminal conduct, knowingly suspected of criminal conduct, to the extent that police had interviewed witnesses but not once had any of them mentioned his name”. This was said to be inherently unbelievable and if his Honour had not, in accordance with what was argued in respect of ground 1 been in error in withdrawing the evidence from the jury, he should have drawn this to attention as a weakness. As already mentioned there was a factual flaw in the submission in that the evidence of Constable Rowe contradicted its terms. 32 The submission that the situation was inherently unbelievable implied that there were not possible reasonable explanations for reticence of the witnesses in nominating or renominating an offender who is known to them. To the contrary, when it was put to Mr Atalifo that he “stood there mute” he responded by remarking that he knew (the appellant) and he never thought he would do something like that “especially to a friend”. At another point of his lengthy evidence he explained that he thought at first it was (or might have been) a joke. Far from being inherently unbelievable other factors come to mind which may have led to the reticence. There may be sympathy for the anticipated fate of an acquaintance for doing something which was foolish as well as seriously criminal; there may have been hesitation to contemplate whether the offender might have some unfathomed explanation for his behaviour, there is even the extreme contemplation that the knowledge may be capable of being used by the witnesses against the offender in the future. I emphasize that there is not the slightest evidence of the lastmentioned but I mention these speculations merely to demonstrate the invalidity of the proposition that what occurred was “inherently” unbelievable. The assessment of conduct and behaviour by humans is a matter peculiarly suited to the joint judgment of twelve citizens constituting a jury. 33 Despite the relatively narrow compass of the central issue, the learned trial judge gave extensive precautions to the jury concerning identification evidence. He reminded them that it was possible that a tentative view or suspicion may have been converted into a certainty in the mind of one or other of the witnesses by events and he reminded them to assess the risks. He pointed out that the faces were disguised and spent a considerable time canvassing the evidence of the initial descriptions given by the witnesses and the significance of them. 34 I would uphold the Crown submission that the direction should be described as powerfully relevant and specifically directed to the dangers in the circumstances of recognition evidence and I agree that it is altogether unsurprising that counsel at trial did not seek further directions.35 I would reject this ground.36 The next ground seeks the rejection of evidence of a conversation between the appellant and Detective Parsons, the substance of which was related to a response attributed to the appellant concerning his knowledge of the robbery. Detective Parsons testified that the appellant said “I don’t know”. The appellant said that his response was more complete namely “I don’t know what you’re talking about”. A second aspect raised in respect of the ground related to a visit to the casino by the appellant on 12 June with a friend whom it was claimed he identified as John. In fact he went to the casino with a man called Anthony Papaluca but he used a car to get there belonging to a man called John.37 The response of the appellant “I don’t know” was not put to the jury as amounting to any admission on his part. Counsel in the appeal argued that the evidence was likely to cause significant prejudice to the accused notwithstanding the Crown concession at trial that it was not an admission of any sort. In the light of the testimony of the appellant I consider it likely that a jury might have thought that the hearer of what the appellant said either did not receive, forgot or ignored the addition “What you’re talking about”. 38 As counsel proposed, it borders upon the absurd to say “I don’t know” if asked whether one was involved in a robbery, but not so if the response is “I don’t know what you’re talking about”. The appellant’s version was indirectly supported by a police officer to whom he had spoken before Detective Parsons and that police officer testified that the appellant then asserted that he did not know what that officer was talking about. Be that as it may the evidence was not left to the jury as capable of inculpating the appellant as an admission and I am unable to attribute any real significance to these matters. I understand that they are ingredients which the appellant would seek to accumulate into assessment of the satisfactoriness of the verdict. 39 Another matter raised for the first time on appeal was the contention that the evidence of the conversations between the appellant and police (concerning the response “I don’t know” and going to the casino with “John”) should have been excluded pursuant to s424A of the Crimes Act. There was no objection at trial to this evidence being received. The issue of why a tape recording was not made pursuant to the statute at the time of the questions and answers was never pursued by anybody although there was cross examination as to why a record was not made in a notebook. It follows of course that the evidence was also entirely silent as to whether or not there might be dispensation from using a tape recorder pursuant to s424A(2)(b) or (c). Insofar as any discretionary issue might have arisen, his Honour was simply never asked to exercise it. 40 The Crown argued that the content of the conversations should not be classified as admissions in any event but the material was tendered in adverse interest to the appellant. The submission cannot be upheld particularly having regard to the liberal interpretation of the expression “admission” in the evidential context as manifest in cases such as R v Horton CCA unreported 2 November 1998 and  R v Esposito CCA unreported 20 November 1998. However, in the light of the issues of this trial and the basis upon which the jury were instructed to approach this evidence there was no perceptible miscarriage and I would again apply the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 41 The next ground asserted that there was fresh evidence available from the proceedings of the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service which was relevant to the assessment of the weight to be given to the evidence of Detective Sergeant Parsons. That ground was sought to be supported by extracts from the transcript of that Commission exhibited to the affidavit of David Philip Barrow sworn 6 August 1998. The substance of the material suggests that a former police officer gave evidence to the Royal Commission that the detective had received money from criminals involved in the distribution of drugs in the Kings Cross area and had involved himself in taking and receiving money in connection with police investigation into drug offenders. In written submission it was acknowledged on behalf of the appellant that there was material provided by the Police Integrity Commission disclosing that Detective Sergeant Parsons has denied being involved in any form of criminal activity or corruption including specifically that testified to by the former police officer.42 This ground was not elaborated in oral submission. The test in relation to such material is whether there was a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant if the new evidence had been before them. The onus lay upon the appellant to demonstrate the miscarriage of justice from that evidence. 43 The relevant testimony emanating from Detective Parsons has been discussed in relation to an earlier ground. As observed, his evidence concerning the response attributed to the appellant “I don’t know” was not left to the jury on the basis that it could inculpate the appellant by way of admission and I have also already commented upon the appellant’s version of the seemingly more credible response more fully “I don’t know what you are talking about”. 44 The other matter concerns the identity of the person with whom the appellant went to the casino. Examination of the transcript does not suggest that there was any issue at trial as to the credibility of Detective Parsons on this aspect except in the sense that he had got mixed up in that the appellant borrowed the car from “John” but in fact went to the casino with “Anthony”. 45 This ground is not sustained.46 The final ground was in terms that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. Further use of this expression as a ground of appeal is precluded: Fleming v The Queen 1998 73 ALJR 1; R v Maxwell CCA unreported 23 December 1998. In relation to this ground the appellant relied principally upon submissions concerning the allegedly inherent improbabilities concerning the non disclosure of the name of the known offender by the Crown witnesses at early or appropriate opportunities and the accumulative effect of matters canvassed in respect of the other grounds.47 I am far from persuaded that a reasonable jury ought to have a doubt about the guilt of the appellant. The critical issue was acceptance to the requisite standard of the evidence of recognition. There was substantial evidence that both the witnesses Mr Cloke and Mr Atalifo knew the appellant very well and, given that circumstance, the identification evidence would prima facie be very strong. It is unnecessary to delineate all the other matters which might fortify a conclusion that their evidence of identification and recognition should be accepted but it should not be overlooked that the appellant was in the vicinity as captured on the video monitor shortly before midnight; there was evidence that he had significant money on the day after the robbery at the casino and it was for the jury to assess whether his explanation and that of his family as to his possession of that money for the purchase of a vehicle was credible; and of course, if the jury were convinced of the truth of the content of the exchange at the time of the robbery the use of names (Alla and Dave) would add assurance to the correctness of a conclusion that the appellant had been recognized.48 I am conscious that in respect of two matters technical legal error has been shown but I have concluded that no miscarriage has occurred and the proviso should be applied. Restraint is appropriate to that application but the two matters emerge after a “toothcombing” analysis of the trial record and both concern the periphery of the evidence and, as I have indicated, such errors could detract from the proposition that a jury acting upon admissible evidence only would have inevitably reached the same verdict. 49 No argument was addressed in relation to application for leave to appeal against sentence.50 I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the convictions and sentences. 51 LEVINE J: I agree with Grove J52 DOWD J: I have seen the reasons and proposed orders of Grove J.

     JUDGMENT 
    1 THE COURT: The appellant was tried before his Honour Judge Naughton, QC and a jury of twelve on an indictment which alleged four counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, in contravention of S 61J of the Crimes Act, 1900. 2  Count 1 alleged an offence on or about 21 July, 1995; count 2 alleged an offence on or about 4 August, 1995; counts 3 and 4 alleged offences between 4 August, 1995 and 21 October, 1995. 3  The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count. He was found guilty on counts 1, 2 and 3. A verdict of not guilty was entered on the trial judge’s direction with regard to count 4.  The Crown case:4 The Crown alleged that each offence was against the same female complainant, who was born on 1 October, 1982, and was accordingly aged 12 years and 9 months on 21 July, 1995.  5 The appellant lived in a caravan at the back of a house, which was occupied by his parents, his sister and her small child. Behind that house was situated the house in which the complainant lived with her father and her siblings. The complainant’s mother died on 1 July, 1995. 6 About three weeks after the death of her mother, the complainant visited the appellant’s parents’ home sometime in the afternoon of Friday, 21 July, 1995. The appellant’s parents were present, as was his sister and the appellant. 7 The complainant was a regular caller at the home of the appellant’s parents and routinely returned to her own home by climbing on top of a barbecue and jumping over the fence which separated the two properties. The barbecue was about ten metres from the appellant’s caravan. 8 When the complainant was about to jump the fence on 21 July, 1995 she heard the appellant call out to her and tell her that he had her chocolate. This was a reference to a prior agreement between the appellant and the complainant when the complainant had lent him $2 and suggested they settle the loan by him giving her a chocolate bar. 9 The complainant entered the appellant’s caravan and the appellant locked the door. He removed condoms from a drawer. The complainant said that she felt scared. She tried to open the door, but was unsuccessful. The appellant told her to get on the bed, and he pushed her onto it. The complainant said that she did not have the sense to scream. She was frightened of being hurt. The appellant pulled down her shorts to her ankles, placed her hands behind her head and pulled her T-shirt over her head so she could not see. The appellant placed a condom on his penis and spread the complainant’s legs. She felt his penis in her vagina for about ten minutes. The appellant also licked her chest. During this time, the complainant tried to kick and punch the appellant. Afterwards he told her, “If you tell your dad I’ll kill you and your dad”. The complainant replied that she would “Get him back”. The appellant told her to get out and told her how she could open the door. The complainant had a shower at her house and did not tell anybody what happened because she felt scared. These events were the subject of count 1 on the indictment. 10 In cross-examination, the complainant agreed that in her statement to police she had stated that the appellant had not used a condom and that she thought she was pregnant. In evidence, she claimed this to be an error and said that even though a condom had been used, she was still afraid of falling pregnant. 11 Some two weeks later, on a Friday night, the complainant was having dinner at the appellant’s house with his mother. She agreed that the date was 4 August, 1995. 12 At about 6 pm or 7 pm, the complainant when about to jump the fence into her father’s house, had been grabbed by the appellant, who twisted her arm behind her back. He walked her to his caravan. She struggled and started to cry, but she did not scream out even though she agreed in cross-examination that the appellant’s parents and his sister would have heard her scream, and that her father would also have heard her scream. 13 The appellant locked the door of the caravan and pushed the complainant onto the bed. She tried to hit him, but “… it wouldn’t work” (T.16.01). She said that she knew then that he was going to “do it again”. She could not get up because when taking off his clothes, the appellant was “right at the foot of my knees when he was getting undressed”. When ordered to pull her pants down she refused. The appellant pulled her pants down and placed the complainant’s arms behind her back. He placed his penis in her vagina for about five to ten minutes. 14 On this occasion the complainant thought that the appellant had again said that he would kill her and her father. Her vagina was sore and painful and was “all red” after these events. The complainant went home, had a shower and went to bed. She did not tell anyone what had happened because she felt scared. These events were the subject of count 2 on the indictment. 15 The complainant gave evidence that she had not been in the appellant’s caravan since 4 August, 1995, but had nevertheless visited the appellant’s parents’ home saying that she felt safe because she was not alone with the appellant, being in the presence of his family and siblings. 16 On Saturday, 9 September, 1995 a barbecue was held at the complainant’s home from about 6 pm. The appellant was also present.  17 After about one hour, the complainant’s father asked her to go to the shops for beer, milk and bread. The appellant was to go with her. The complainant told her father that she did not wish to go, but did not explain the reason for this. She said that she was still fearful of the threats made by the appellant. Nevertheless the complainant did walk with the appellant to the shops, which were a ten minute walk away. 18 On the way back, the appellant and the complainant walked through Mary McKillop School, which was a short cut to the complainant’s house. The appellant was carrying the beer which he put down at one point. The complainant then started running away from him, but he caught up to her. He took her underneath one of the classroom buildings. The complainant recalled seeing a brown drum. The appellant told her to take off her clothes, but she refused. She was wearing shorts and a T-shirt and the appellant took them off. He also removed his clothes. The complainant saw him place a condom on his penis, which he placed in her vagina for about five to ten minutes. During this time, the complainant was endeavouring to get him off her. Afterwards the appellant left the condom there. This was the subject of count 3 on the indictment. 19 The complainant’s evidence was that she could not recall an incident involving her anus, which was the subject of count 4 on the indictment. She could not remember if she had changed position, but agreed that in her police statement she had said that the appellant had told her to roll over onto her stomach and that he had then placed his penis into her anus.  20 At one point in her cross-examination, she said that he had done this, but at a later stage gave evidence to the contrary. She also gave evidence that she had not told the police the appellant had placed his penis in her anus, only that he had placed his penis in her vagina. This evidence resulted in a verdict by direction in relation to count 4. 21 The evidence of the complainant was that there were two gardeners at the school grounds on Saturday, 9 September, 1995 when the school ground incident occurred. She said that they were one or two blocks away from herself and the appellant. She had not called out to them and in cross-examination said that when she had initially run away from the appellant, after he had placed the beer down, she ran in a direction which was away from the gardeners. Following the events in the school ground, she ran home and did not tell anyone what had happened because of the threats the appellant had made. 22 The complainant gave evidence that the appellant had once told her that he loved her. She had responded by telling him that he was an idiot. In cross-examination, the complainant said that the appellant told her that he loved her on 21 July, 1995 and that on 4 August, 1995 the appellant had told her that he wanted to be her boyfriend. 23 The complainant gave evidence of having told a school friend, Rachel Davies, that she had been raped. She alleged that on the Monday following each of the events of 21 July, 4 August and 9 September, 1995 she had complained to Davies at school about being raped. Although Rachel Davies kept suggesting that the complainant speak with Rachel Davies’ mother, Mrs Margaret Mikolajczyk, the complainant felt scared and refused. She did, however, eventually speak to Rachel Davies’ mother, who then informed the complainant’s father. 24 The complainant gave evidence of having told Rachel Davies’ mother that she had been raped by “a guy named Murray”, who was a friend of her father and a neighbour. She also said that it had occurred on three occasions. Mrs Mikolajczyk did not ask when those occasions were, and the complainant said that she had not said when the events had taken place. 25 After being contacted by Mrs Mikolajczyk, the complainant’s father had driven the complainant to the appellant’s parents’ home where, together with the appellant’s sister, the complainant’s father confronted him about the matter. Afterwards the complainant was driven to the police station. 26 It was the evidence of the complainant’s father that several weeks after the death of his wife he had had a barbecue at his house which began some time between 5.30 and 6 pm in the afternoon. He recalled asking the complainant to go to the shops and that the complainant had gone with the appellant, who also wanted to buy something. The complainant had not wanted to go. 27 The complainant’s father gave evidence that it was dark when the complainant and the appellant returned from the shopping trip to the house. He had noticed the back of the complainant’s white jumper was covered in dirt. He asked the complainant what had happened, and she replied that she had fallen over. He said that the complainant had then cleaned herself up and continued to mingle at the barbecue. 28 The complainant’s father gave evidence that having been contacted by Mrs Mikolajczyk, he had gone to the school where he saw a condom. He gave evidence that the appellant had disclosed to him the appellant’s infatuation for the complainant. In his evidence, the complainant’s father said that he believed he had told the police of the appellant saying to him that he had this infatuation, but conceded that this did not appear in his police statement. 29 The complainant’s father gave evidence of having bought the caravan in question from the appellant’s family and explained that it could be difficult to unlock the door once it was locked.  30 Margaret Mikolajczyk gave evidence that on 21 October, 1995 she spoke with the complainant following a conversation she had had with her daughter Rachel Davies. The complainant told her that she had been raped. Mrs Mikolajczyk asked her if she was joking and the complainant said “no”. She asked the complainant whom it was had raped her, and received the answer “A guy named Murray who was a friend of her father’s and a neighbour”. The complainant was asked if she had told anyone and the complainant said “No”. The complainant informed Mrs Mikolajczyk that she knew where the appellant had thrown the condom and gave evidence of the complainant having “just said it happened every two weeks or it was about twice it happened”. 31 In cross-examination, Mrs Mikolajczyk agreed that in her police statement she had said that when she asked the complainant when it had happened, she received the response “two weeks ago”. She also agreed that when she asked the complainant if that was the first time, the complainant had replied “No, he raped me every two weeks, once in the caravan”. 32 Rachel Davies gave evidence of the complainant having stayed over at her house in October, 1995 and of having told her that she had been raped by the appellant in the caravan at the back of the appellant’s parents’ house. The complainant had said that the appellant had called her over and asked her if she wanted chocolate. When she went into the caravan, he slammed the door and pushed her onto the bed. The complainant told Davies that the appellant then told her to take off her clothes, that she had refused, and that he had then raped her. Davies said in her evidence that she was told by the complainant that she had screamed for help. Davies said that the complainant had not mentioned any other incident. In particular, she denied having been told by the complainant at school in July, August and September that she had been raped. 33 Dr Patricia Brennan gave evidence of performing a genital examination of the complainant on 21 October, 1995. Her findings were that there was a split in the mucosa, a swollen circular hymen with sticky grey fluid, and a small split in the hymeneal rim. This, she said, was consistent with the complainant’s vagina having been penetrated by a penis on 21 July, 1995, 4 August, 1995 and 9 September, 1995. Dr Brennan could not say when the hymen had split. She could not recall the claimant having requested a pregnancy test.  34 Mr Paul Kitley, who was on 21 October, 1995 a sergeant of police, gave evidence of having attended a Catholic school with the complainant’s father and located a used condom underneath a demountable building. He arranged for photographs to be taken, some of which depicted a brown drum. He could not remember if the drum was underneath the building where the condom was located. He agreed that the space underneath the building was confined and that it would be impossible for a person to stand up. He also agreed that it would be impossible for an adult male to kneel without striking his head on the flooring timbers.  35 Sergeant Michael Priest gave evidence of having spoken to the complainant and the appellant on 1 November, 1995 and of the appellant having said to him “I’ve got nothing to hide”. 36 The appellant agreed to an ERISP. He denied the allegations made by the complainant and told police that the complainant had been in his caravan on two occasions to watch “Police Academy” and “The Lion King”. The first movie had been watched on 29 July, 1995 and the second in late September. He purchased the video “The Lion King” on 28 September, 1995. The appellant told police that he kept condoms in the top dresser drawer of his caravan and said also that the caravan does not lock. 37 Mr Robert John Goetz, a forensic biologist, gave evidence that in December, 1995 he received a condom and blood samples taken from the complainant and the appellant. 38 The tests conducted detected semen on the condom. He was unable to specify when the sperm was deposited into the condom, however, his evidence was that complete degradation of the sperm had not taken place and that the life of a sperm is longer in a condom than in a vagina. 39 The findings of Mr Goetz were that the appellant could not be excluded as a source of the DNA in the condom. Approximately one person in every 1.4 million people have the combination of DNA which was detected. Taking into account the margin of error, that is to say a confidence interval of 95% accuracy, the chances that the DNA tested from the inside of the condom was that of the accused was between 880,00:1 and 2.3 million:1. (T.116.05) 40 The DNA taken from the outside of the condom contained a mixture which could have been DNA from the accused plus some other DNA. The complainant could not be excluded as a source of the other DNA. (T.116.50) One in 160,000 people in the general population could have contributed the DNA on the outside of the condom. (T.116.57) 41 Although Mr Goetz was able to say that the DNA on the outside of the condom was a mixture, that is to say derived from more than one person, it was not possible to tell whether it was derived from two people, or more than two people. (T.122.20) 42 Of the combinations of DNA on the outside of the condom, one matched the complainant, but the others did not.   The Appellant’s Case: 43 The appellant gave evidence in which he confirmed that his answers given during the ERISP were true. 44 The appellant said that in June, 1995 he had known the complainant and her family for eight years. He denied ever having sexual intercourse with her and said that she was seeking attention as a result of the death of her mother. 45 Following receipt of various documents from the Crown in relation to the charges, he endeavoured to make enquiries as to his movements on the relevant date. The evidence was in the nature of alibi evidence. He said that he had gone shopping with his mother between 5 pm and 6 pm on 21 July, 1995; had returned home some time prior to 7 pm and spent the evening in the company of his parents watching television. The appellant’s step-father had died on 26 January, 1996. He gave evidence that on 29 July, 1995 he was watching television in the caravan at about 8.30 pm, when the complainant entered the caravan and they watched a film called “Police Academy”. He denied that sexual intercourse had occurred on that occasion. 46 The appellant denied having the complainant in his caravan on 4 August and said that on that date he had withdrawn money from his bank and visited friends at Bankstown. He knew the names of those friends, but no longer knew where they were to be found. 47 The appellant’s evidence was that on that day he watched the movie “Batman Forever” at 4 pm at the Hoyts Cinema and later ate a meal at McDonalds before watching the film “Casper” at about 6 pm or 6.30 pm. He agreed that the Daily Telegraph advertisement for Bankstown Hoyts Cinema on 4 August indicated that “Casper” was only playing at 10.30 am. The appellant returned home at 10.30 pm and told his mother he had seen a couple of movies. 48 The appellant claimed that he was able to be precise about his movements on 21 July and 4 August, 1995 because on those dates he had been in receipt of unemployment benefits and his bank statement indicated that he had made withdrawals of $300 on each of those dates. The statement did not indicate the time at which the withdrawals were made. 49 The appellant recalled an occasion when he walked with the complainant to the local shops to buy beer. The complainant had bought bread and milk. He could not recall the date, but knew that it was day time and that it had happened only once. 50 The appellant’s Visa card statement indicated purchases at the Dynamic Liquor Store on 11 October and 17 October, 1995, but he agreed in cross-examination that on 9 September of that year, he did not have a Visa card and any purchase he would have made would have been for cash. He denied sexually assaulting the complainant underneath a school building and after receiving the Crown brief on 11 December, 1995 he took photographs of the demountable buildings of the school and gave evidence that he could not stand or kneel upright underneath the building. 51 The appellant gave evidence of having had a conversation with the complainant in which she informed him that she was dumping her boyfriend and had said “You could be my boyfriend”. His response was to say to her “You are under aged, and if you turn to an age and I’m still single we’ll see what happens”. He said the complainant gave him a “quick peck” on the lips, but he did not read anything into it. 52 The appellant agreed in cross-examination that during the ERISP, when the police put to him that he had told the complainant “I like you and I want to be your boyfriend” he had replied “That was on 29 July”. His explanation in evidence was that he misinterpreted what the police were saying and did not realise that the police were actually putting to him that he was the one who had used those words. 53 The appellant gave evidence that on an occasion after 7 October, 1995, when he was at the complainant’s house playing pool, his mother called out to him around 4 o’clock to come and cook dinner. He and his mother then saw his caravan door swing open. The complainant was inside and said she had cleaned the caravan. This was denied by the complainant in her evidence. The appellant was confronted by the complainant and her father, in the presence of his sister, on 21 October, 1995 in relation to the accusations of the complainant. He told the complainant’s father “It’s not my fault, your daughter has an infatuation with me”. He said that his sister may not have been present when this conversation took place. The appellant gave evidence of having had a single incident of sexual intercourse with a woman named Bianca about one month after 14 August, 1995. He had used a condom and afterwards placed it in his garbage bin (which he did not have a habit of cleaning out). He said that he noticed the garbage bin had been cleaned out on 8 October, 1995. He said this was the only time he had had sexual intercourse in the caravan. He had accompanied Bianca to her home in Mount Pleasant by taxi and had never seen her again. He had not sought confirmation of his evidence in relation to Bianca because he had not known the date of the complainant’s third allegation until two days before he gave evidence. However, in cross examination he agreed that when the complainant’s father spoke to him on 21 October, 1995 he had been informed about the existence of a condom. 54 The appellant’s mother, Aniela Lynch, gave evidence of having gone shopping with the appellant on 21 July, 1995, some time after 5 pm. She said they had remained at the shopping centre until about 7 pm and had dropped the appellant off a block away from her house so he could visit a friend. She agreed that in her police statement she had not mentioned dropping the appellant off to visit a friend. Mrs Lynch gave evidence that the appellant that evening had gone out with his brother and had not returned until about 12.30 am. 55 Mrs Lynch said that the appellant returned home on 4 August, 1995 at about 10.30 pm, having visited friends and having been to the movies at Bankstown. He recounted to her having watched the movie “Batman”, but she could not recall if he also said that he had watched “Casper”. 56 Mrs Lynch recalled the complainant having stayed over at her house on 29 July, 1995 and recalled that she was not in the house for about an hour. She and the appellant came into the house later and the appellant explained that they had been watching a movie. The complainant did not appear to be upset or frightened. Mrs Lynch also recalled that on 8 October, 1995 the appellant was playing pool with the complainant’s father. She had called him home to cook dinner. She gave evidence that the complainant had appeared from the appellant’s caravan and said that she had cleaned it up. 57 Mrs Lynch gave evidence of the appellant having spoken to her on 22 October, 1995 and told her of the complainant having spoken of dropping her boyfriend and asking him to be her boyfriend and of his response to the effect that if she was available in a few years when she was older, they would see what happened. 58 Mrs Lynch gave evidence of certain diary entries, which she had made concerning the various dates in question, some of which were confirmatory of matters told to her by her son the appellant. She said that she had made entries in her diary whenever she recalled various occasions after the relevant dates. She had not received this diary until July, 1995. Not all the matters of which she gave evidence were supported by diary entries. 59 The appellant’s sister, Trisha Lynch, gave evidence of being present when the complainant’s father spoke to the appellant in relation to the complainant’s allegations. She recalled the appellant telling the father that the complainant had an infatuation with him, but was unable to recall if the appellant said that he was infatuated with the complainant.  The Appeal60 A number of grounds of appeal were argued. Some were directed to the conduct of the trial and the adequacy of the trial judge’s directions to the jury. However, it was also submitted that the verdicts are unsafe in the sense that they are unreasonable: see now Fleming -v- The Queen (1998) 158 ALR 379 at paras 7-1l. This ground is not made out. 61 The difficulties and inconsistencies in the prosecution evidence are apparent from our summary of it, and it is true that the appellant denied his guilt to the police and in sworn evidence. He called evidence in support of his denials, although that evidence was not entirely satisfactory. However, the complainant’s credibility was vital to the jury’s decision and, on that question, we must acknowledge the undoubted advantage the jury had of seeing and hearing her. Moreover, there was some corroboration of the complainant’s evidence, particularly as to the third count.62 Viewed as a whole, the evidence was such as to entitle a jury, acting reasonably, to return verdicts of guilty on each count. We are not persuaded, as to any of those counts, that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted: M -v- The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. 63 A number of the other grounds of appeal, however, do raise matters of concern and their combined effect leads us to the conclusion that the trial miscarried. It is not necessary to deal with all of them to demonstrate that there must be a new trial. Complaint (Grounds 1,2,& 3)64 These grounds relate to the adequacy of his Honour’s directions about the evidence of complaint. What his Honour said was this:- “Evidence of the complaints was admitted to assist you in deciding whether the complainant’s conduct in complaining was consistent with what she said had happened and to answer any argument that the absence of complaint would suggest that the alleged offences did not take place. The accused submits that the complainant did not complain until 21 October 1995 and that that delay is inconsistent with what the complainant alleges occurred between herself and the accused. He submits that if her allegations were true she would have complained earlier.” (S/U pp4-5)65 His Honour then gave a warning in terms of s405B of the Crimes Act, and continued:- “There may, of course, be good reasons for delay in complaining or for not complaining at all. For example, fear of revenge by the accused, personal embarrassment, the perceived ordeal of police enquiry and court proceedings or fear of adverse reaction of the father. The question for you to consider is whether, in this case, the complaints and the circumstances in which they were made (whatever your finding about those complaints is a matter for you) are consistent with the complainant’s allegations against the accused or whether they throw doubt upon those allegations.” (S/U p5)66 In so far as those directions dealt with delay in, or absence of, complaint and its bearing on the complainant’s credibility, they might have been adequate if the evidence of complaint had been consistent. It was not. If the complainant were to be believed, she complained to Rachel Davies promptly after each of the three incidents. However, if Rachel Davies were to be accepted, the complainant first spoke to her in October 1995 and only described the incident the subject of the first count. The effect of the evidence of Mrs Mikolajczyk is that the complainant told her of the incident the subject of the third count, saying that it had occurred two weeks previously and adding that the appellant had raped her every two weeks, including one occasion in the caravan.67 We put to one side the effect which this inconsistency of itself might have had upon the complainant’s credibility. Counsel for the appellant also argued that the relevance of that inconsistency was not confined to the complainant’s credibility, relying upon the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 142-3. We also put that argument aside, particularly in the light of the decision of the High Court in Graham -v- The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 1491. 68 The fact remains that the jury’s assessment of the significance of the evidence of complaint depended upon which version of it (if any) they accepted. On the complainant’s own evidence, she made prompt complaint after each of the three incidents. On the evidence of Miss Davies, she made a delayed complaint about the first incident and no complaint at all about the other two. On the evidence of Mrs Mikolajczyk, she made a delayed complaint about the third incident and it is very doubtful whether what she then said could be characterised as a complaint about both or either of the other two. 69 Immediately before giving these directions, his Honour referred to the evidence of complaint given by the complainant herself. He then continued:-  “You will recall that Rachel said that the complainant complained once to her and that that was on Saturday 21 October. You will recall also that Rachel’s mother, Mrs Mikolajczyk, said that the complainant complained once to her and that that was on Saturday 21 October 1995.” (S/U p4)70 That was all his Honour said about the evidence of those two witnesses at that point (although he did summarise their evidence later in the summing up). His Honour did not then refer to the inconsistency between the evidence of the complainant and of the other two witnesses about the terms of the complaint itself. In our view, that was essential to ensure that the jury understood the significance of his directions about delay in, or absence of, complaint. In the unusual circumstances of this case, particularly careful directions were called for and we do not consider those which were given to be adequate. Corroboration (Ground 4)71 His Honour gave the jury directions about corroboration, and these were the subject of several complaints in the appeal. Only one of them concerns us. It is necessary to set out his Honour’s final direction to the jury, after an application for redirections by the Crown prosecutor, about the evidence capable of amounting to corroboration:- “The three matters relied upon by the Crown as corroboration are first, the evidence of Mr Richardson as to his conversation with the accused on 21 October 1995 in which the accused indicated, according to his evidence, that he was infatuated with Julie Richardson. So that was the evidence of Mr Richardson that the accused had said to him on 21 October 1995 that he, the accused, was infatuated with Mr Richardson’s daughter, the complainant. The second matter that is relied upon by the Crown as corroboration is Mr Richardson’s evidence that Julie returned to the barbecue with dirt on the back of her clothing. The third matter is the evidence of Mr Goetz in relation to his comparison of the DNA extracted from the condom with that of the accused and the complainant.” (S/U p37) 72 His Honour failed to explain to the jury that the evidence of the complainant’s father about dirt on the back of her clothing and the DNA evidence were capable of corroborating only the third count. We have no doubt that the jury would have understood that evidence to be related directly to the third count. Whether they would have understood that they could not use it in corroboration of the complainant’s evidence of the other counts is quite another matter. 73 Early in the summing up, his Honour directed the jury that they must consider each count separately in these terms:- “Each of the three charges must be considered separately by you and a separate verdict given in respect of each charge. You do not have to come to the same verdict in respect of each charge unless you find each one of them to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.” (S/U p3)74 That direction is correct as far as it went. However, it fell well short of conveying to the jury that the fact that the complainant’s evidence about one of the counts was corroborated could not be used in support of her evidence about the other counts. That is a legal principle, the logic of which might not be immediately apparent to those who are not legally trained. Indeed, it is in this very type of case that there is a particular danger of the jury assessing the complainant’s evidence globally, without a critical examination of each of her allegations. Again, in the circumstances of this case, careful directions were called for and the directions given do not meet the standard required. The evidence of Dr Brennan (Ground 8)75 This ground arises from what is said to be impermissible questioning of Dr Brennan by the trial judge. To understand its significance it is necessary to examine briefly the course of events in the trial. The complainant was the first witness. We have summarised her evidence about the allegation of anal intercourse, the subject of the fourth count, and it is apparent that by the end of her evidence a directed verdict on that count was inevitable. At the close of the Crown case the Crown prosecutor did not oppose that direction.76 That being so, it was probably unnecessary for counsel for the appellant at the trial to elicit from Dr Brennan, in cross-examination, that the history she obtained from the complainant did not include an allegation of anal intercourse. Nevertheless, it is understandable that he did so. In the course of that cross-examination, in an unresponsive answer, the doctor said this:-  “I don’t think a child always tells what has happened to them, particularly anal assault in our experience or other sorts of sexual things a child doesn’t always tell the doctor at the time all that happened.” (T.131-2)77 It may well have been this answer which led to the line of questioning by the trial judge which is the subject of this ground of appeal. Without objection from counsel for the appellant at the trial, his Honour elicited from Dr Brennan her interest in the psychological condition of children whom she examined after alleged sexual abuse. In that context, she agreed that she had experience of children “denying aspects of what occurred” and giving “conflicting versions of what happened”. She spoke of children taking time, perhaps over several consultations, to reveal all that had happened to them, “so that they can progressively disclose and they can progressively contradict themselves”. (T.135-6)78 There then followed this exchange:-  “Q. If a child for example, said that she’d been anally interfered with, there had been anal sexual intercourse and then denied that and then came back to it and accepted it and then denied it several occasions, would that be the sort of thing you regularly experience? A. Particularly anal. Particularly anal intercourse.“79 Asked why this was so, the doctor said that anal intercourse is “more repulsive to children” than vaginal intercourse. She added, “…they’re offended at the notion of that having happened to them and so I find that much more likely they won’t be clear about anal intercourse… ”. (T.136)80 As we have said, the complainant’s evidence was such that the fourth count had to be taken from the jury as they could not lawfully have convicted the appellant of it: R -v- R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74, Doney -v- The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207. Evidence, however compelling or authoritative, that children in her position might be unwilling to speak of anal intercourse could not have changed the situation. Nothing Dr Brennan could have said, based upon her experience of examining children believed to have been sexually abused, could have contributed to the resolution of the matter. 81 We cannot accept the submission of the Crown prosecutor in this Court that his Honour’s questioning of the doctor was appropriate, with a view to resolving any doubt he might have had about whether the fourth count should be left to the jury. Accordingly, the evidence was irrelevant.82 That is not the only reason why it was inadmissible. Whether Dr Brennan had the necessary expertise to express the views she did is debatable: cf F (1995) 83 A Crim R 502. However that may be, her evidence was of opinions about the behaviour of children generally and was not related specifically to the complainant: F at 507-9.83 It is no answer to this ground to say that there could have been no miscarriage of justice because the jury were directed to acquit the appellant of the fourth count. Given the irrelevant evidence of Dr Brennan about this matter, they may well have done so in the belief that the complainant could have given evidence of anal intercourse but could not bring herself to articulate it. They may have taken the view, unfairly prejudicial to the appellant, that his acquittal of that count was an undeserved windfall. 84 However, the matter does not end there. In the course of dealing with corroboration in the summing up, the trial judge said:- “Remember in respect of the evidence of the complainant that it is common for children to have difficulty when being interviewed about sexual abuse to be consistent and accurate. They may have been traumatised by the alleged events and frightened and psychologically under considerable pressure. Compare the evidence of Dr Brennan as to that.” (S/U pp7-8)85 Those observations about children who have undergone sexual abuse may be matters of common experience: F (supra)at 507, but they were not the proper subject of the evidence of Dr Brennan. Rule 486 It may be that each of these matters, standing alone, would not lead to the conclusion that the trial miscarried. However, the combination of them does and their cumulative effect is such that leave should be granted to argue them, notwithstanding that they were not raised at the trial.87 We received an affidavit by counsel for the appellant at the trial. As to his Honour’s questioning of Dr Brennan, counsel acknowledged that “with the benefit of hindsight… some objection should have been taken…”. That is so, although it is understandable that he might have been reticent about objecting to questions asked by the trial judge. As to the fact that certain evidence was corroborative only of the third count, counsel frankly conceded that he did not apply his mind to whether that evidence “was generally available as corroboration in relation to all counts or was relevant to any particular count”. As to the directions on complaint, we are unmoved by counsel’s assertion that he did not consider it necessary to seek further directions. He did add that he “felt at the time that the trial judge could have expressed the significance of any delayed complaint as it was relevant to the complainant’s credibility somewhat better…”. He is right. 88 Trials of this kind are difficult and sensitive, and there is often a high risk of a miscarriage of justice. R -v- Johnston (CCA unreported, 1 July 1998) is one of a number of recent cases in which appeals have been allowed despite the failure of counsel at trial to raise the matter argued in the appeal. In our view, this is such a case. 89 The appeal should be allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial ordered.

     JUDGMENT 
    1 MEAGHER JA: I agree with Dunford J.2 GROVE J: I agree with Dunford J.3 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by James Anthony Dwyer against his conviction in the District Court at Sydney on 8 May 1998 following his trial before Judge Phegan and a jury on three counts of sexual assault on a person under the age of sixteen years contrary to s 61E Crimes Act 1900, three counts of indecent assault on a person under the age of sixteen years contrary to s 61E(1A)(a) and one count of attempted sexual intercourse with a person under the age of sixteen years. 4 The complainant was born on 25 March 1975 and as a young child lived at Hebersham with her mother, FG, and three sisters D, B and K. In late 1981 or early 1982 her mother started dating the appellant and subsequently the appellant commenced staying at the complainant's house on occasional weekends. Eventually he commenced residing with the complainant's family and the children called him ""Dad"". During this relationship, the complainant's family and the appellant, visited Byron Bay for various holidays, and stayed at the house of the appellant's parents.5 The Crown case related to four separate incidents; in about 1981 or 1982 at Hebersham (counts 1 and 2), during the Christmas school holidays in December 1983 - January 1984 at Byron Bay (counts 2 and 3), about Easter time 1984, also at Byron Bay (counts 5 and 6) and in 1985 at Doonside (count 7). The first three incidents alleged the appellant rubbed the complainant on the outside of her vagina (counts 2, 4 and 6) followed by digital penetration (counts 1, 3 and 5), whilst the 7th count alleged attempted fellatio.6 Dr Rapson (a general practitioner) gave evidence that the complainant attended his surgery with her mother on 9 April 1984 for symptoms of wheezing, and was treated for asthma. Two days later she returned for a further check up. There was mention made of vaginal discharge, possibly blood, and the complainant was asked to obtain a urine sample, which she did not. Dr Rapson was asked in evidence if this type of discharge was consistent with digital penetration of the vagina. He responded that it was not necessarily the case, however that type of rubbing could cause discharge through abrasion. There was other evidence that in 1984 the Easter weekend was 20 - 23 April.7 The complainant gave evidence that in 1990 she saw a video at school on sexual abuse and realised that it had been happening to her. She told her sister, D, about the incidents which had occurred with the appellant and became very depressed. She said she told D that ""Jim used to touch me and finger me . . . I didn't know how to put it, I was ashamed of myself."" She said this was the first time she had told anyone about what had happened.8 Around 1991, when she was about fifteen or sixteen years old, she started going out with one Robert Carro. Six months after they commenced going out she told him that she had been sexually abused. Carro gave evidence that as their relationship developed she told him more. He suggested she report the matters to the Police, but she was too scared.9 Around 1993, after the birth of her daughter, the complainant told her mother about the sexual abuse and in 1996 she told her other sister, B, about what the appellant had done, but told B not to tell anyone.10 Robert Carro gave evidence that on 10 September 1996 he visited the complainant at her house, the telephone rang and the complainant answered; she became very upset and threw the phone down. Carro picked the phone up but there was no-one there whereupon the complainant told Carro that it was the appellant. The following day Carro visited the appellant and asked him if he had sexually abused the complainant. There was an altercation, Carro hit the appellant, he was charged and subsequently pleaded guilty to assault, for which he was fined. A couple of weeks later, that is whilst Carro was on remand, the complainant reported the matter to the Police. The appellant was first interviewed on 29 December 1996.11 In his recorded interview with the Police and in his sworn evidence at the trial the appellant gave evidence that he had at no time sexually or indecently assaulted the complainant. He said that he had met the complainant's mother in around February 1981 when the complainant was about six years old. Shortly afterwards the relationship became intimate and he moved in with the complainant's family. They resided at Hebersham until 1984 and then all moved to Doonside. 12 He said that he met his current partner, Robyn Ann Robertson, in about 1984, the relationship developed intimately and he began living with her. In August 1988 they moved to Airlie Beach where they purchased a house and resided there until 1990 although he did not sell his Sydney residence or business. 13 Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2 were as follows: 
     
      
      1. The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury as to the evidence given by the complainant and the appellant that the jury's fundamental task was to choose between the two competing versions. 
       
      2. In the circumstances of the present case the learned trial judge ought to have directed the jury that they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the account given by the complainant. 
       
      Attention was drawn to two passages in the summing up (pages 28 and 29) as follows: 
       
        
      ""There are only two people who were witnesses to those events if they occurred at all, that is the complainant, Leanne Griffiths, and the accused. They have, in their evidence, consistently and in each case without any reservations given accounts which are directly and diametrically at odds. You cannot believe them both.  
      The fundamental task, therefore, which you have to undertake is to decide which of those two versions of what happened, if it happened at all, you believe. 
      "" 
       
      and later, 
       
        
      But for essential purposes in this case, it is a case of your having to make a choice between two accounts, diametrically opposed, from the complainant on the one hand, and the accused on the other."" 
       (emphasis added) 
      
    14 It was submitted that this invitation to the jury to ""choose"" between the two competing counts was a fundamental error justifying the appellant to a new trial, and further that at no stage did the trial judge direct the jury that in the context of this particular trial they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the account given by the complainant. If the passages quoted above from the written submissions were all that had been said on this subject, that is, if it had been left on the basis of a ""mere choice"" between the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of the appellant, the summing-up would have been defective and a new trial justified: Liberato and Others -v- The Queen, (1985) 159 CLR 507 at 515, 519 per Brennan J and Deane J; although the majority in that case held that, although the summing-up was defective, the proviso should be applied. See also R -v- E (1995) 89 A Crim R 325, The Queen -v- Calides (1983) 34 SASR 355; but, they were cases where the jury were told in effect that it was merely a case of choosing between the two versions and the jury could have been misled about the onus of proof.15 On the other hand, a reference to there being two diametrically opposed versions given by the complainant and the appellant, and even the reference to the jury having to ""choose"" between the two versions, will not necessarily be fatal provided it is made clear to the jury that it is not ""merely"" a ""choice"" between the two versions, but that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at least in its essential ingredients the version given by the complainant is true: R -v- Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 528-9, R -v- PAH (unreported - CCA - 18 December 1998) at 8 - 10. 16 Immediately following the passage the first quoted above, his Honour went on: ""And in coming to that conclusion, again, and I emphasise this only because of its overriding importance in the conduct of any criminal trial, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the acts that make up each of the various charges. If you are going to come to such a conclusion, you have to believe the complainant."" (emphasis added)  
     
      
      And then following the second passage quoted in the appellant's written submissions, after referring to the fact that generally neither a complainant nor an accused is able to produce anyone to support their version of what happened went on to say (at p 30): 
       
        
      ""But over and above that issue which, in a sense, both of the parties share in common, is the fact that this is a criminal trial and I cannot emphasise this too much, it is a criminal trial where the onus and burden of proof rests squarely on the prosecution. You therefore, in choosing between the evidence of the complainant and the accused, not only must be persuaded that the complainant is to be believed,  
      but in believing the complainant, you must further be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence as a whole,  
      of the various matters which I have already explained to you, make up the ingredients of the charges in question. 
        
      There is no onus at any stage on any matter on the accused. The accused does not have to prove anything. The prosecution bears the total burden in that regard."" (emphasis added)  
      
    17 Then following the short morning adjournment, and no doubt conscious of the dictum in R -v- Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19 that when a case against an accused depends on the evidence of one witness the jury should be warned to scrutinise the evidence of that witness carefully, his Honour went on at p 33: "". . . [I]f I can just very briefly recapitulate the particular point that I was making at the conclusion of the first stage of my summing-up, and that is that the Crown case essentially depends, in the end, on the evidence of the complainant. It is vital therefore that you scrutinise her version of events particularly closely in order to determine whether, in your mind, she has provided a reliable account of what occurred. In doing that, as of course you must do with all of the witnesses, you have to take note of the evidence which she gave and the way in which she gave it, and if after that, having carefully considered whether you found her a generally reliable witness, and therefore one who gave you an essentially truthful version of events, you are able to rely on her in determining the question of whether the Crown has proved its case, as it must, beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand it (sic) you're not persuaded that she has given you a reliable account, then you clearly cannot be satisfied that the accused is guilty with regard to each of the charges beyond reasonable doubt and he must be acquitted."" (emphasis added)18 In this case, although the passages quoted in the written submissions if taken in isolation may have been misleading, and although it would have been preferable to give a direction based on the passage in the judgment of Brennan J in Liberato at 515, I am satisfied that when the relevant part of the summing-up is read in context and as a whole, the jury were clearly warned that they should carefully scrutinise her evidence and could only convict if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant's evidence was reliable and true, and that at no stage was there any onus on the accused to prove anything. 19 Moreover, contrary to one of the submissions made on behalf of the appellant, it is not correct to say that the jury needed to be told in express words that they could only convict if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the complainant's evidence. In R -v- Williams [1999] NSWCCA 9, Wood CJ at CL with whom the other members of the Court agreed, at p 15 said: ""It is not customary, contrary to the submission advanced, to give a direction that the complainant's ""evidence"" must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Such a direction would tend to confuse. What must be proved beyond reasonable doubt are the elements of the offence charged.""20 In my opinion there was in the present case no chance of the jury been left in any doubt that the onus was, and remained, on the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and that they could only be so satisfied if after carefully scrutinising the evidence of the complainant they were satisfied that the substance of her evidence was truthful and reliable. In my view neither of these grounds of appeal are made good.21 Ground 3 was: 
     
      
      3. None of the ""complaints"" made by the complainant could properly be described as ""fresh"" and evidence of them ought not to have been admitted at the trial. 
        
      
    22 I have already summarised the evidence given by the complainant as to the occasions when she told members of her family or her boyfriend about what she claimed the appellant had done to her. There was also evidence from her mother that the complainant had mentioned the matter to her in 1988, although the complainant said the first time she told anyone was when she told her sister, D, in 1990. She said that when it first happened she was very young and did not realise the significance of it, and it was only after she saw the video on sexual abuse at school when she was in year seven, that is in 1987, that she realised that what happened to her was wrong. 23 At no stage was it objected that the evidence of these complaints was inadmissible either on common law principles or under the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act). The only reference to the Act in relation to the evidence of complaints was at the conclusion of the summing-up when the Crown raised the question whether a warning that the evidence may be unreliable should be given because it was hearsay evidence: s 165(1)(a). The judge said he had considered it but he was reluctant to do so because further directions on the point might confuse the jury, and counsel then appearing for the appellant said he did not want a direction under s 165 that the evidence may be unreliable but a direction in accordance with Murray that the jury should carefully scrutinise the evidence of the complainant; and it was pointed out that such a direction had already been given; but the judge did subsequently give further directions to the effect that a delay in complaining was relevant on the issue of the credibility of the complainant. 24 The evidence of complaint was hearsay and therefore inadmissible (s 59) unless it came within one of the exceptions. It did not come within the exception provided for in s 66 because it was not ""fresh"": Graham -v- The Queen (1998) 157 ALR 404, R -v- Gillard [1999] NSWCCA 21, and although it may have been admissible under s 108(3) as an exception to the credibility rule if the leave of the Court had been obtained, that leave was neither obtained nor sought. 25 As I say no objection was taken to the admissibility of this evidence at the trial, although the appellant was defended by competent and experienced counsel. Generally, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted, particularly as to what questions may or may not be asked, what points to press, what points to abandon and what evidence to object to: R -v- Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683; and because a particular approach has been adopted at the trial, leave to argue a point not taken at the trial will not normally be granted simply because the approach taken at the trial has not been successful and evidence not objected to which could have been objected to. 26 There may have been good tactical reasons to not object to this evidence because counsel for the appellant was then able to challenge the complainant's credibility by cross-examining her on the failure to complain promptly after the alleged event, the failure to complain promptly after she saw the video in year seven at High School and the failure to report the matter to Police after she spoke to her sisters and subsequently to her boyfriend. Moreover, although the complainant said that the complaint to D was her first complaint, there was the evidence from her mother that she had previously complained to her, and this was an inconsistency which was open to defence counsel to exploit, and presumably he did so.27 However, prior to the coming into force of the Evidence Act, evidence of late complaints was often admitted, although for myself I am not entirely clear on what basis this was so. This trial was held in May 1998 and the judgment in Graham was not delivered until September 1998. A similar situation arose in Gillard, where the trial had been heard before the decision in Graham, and this Court considered that in all the circumstances there was sufficient reason for granting leave to argue the point even though objection had not been taken at the trial. In my view, the Court should adopt a similar approach in this case; and the evidence being inadmissible I would grant leave to argue the point notwithstanding Rule 4, and I would uphold the appeal on this ground. 28 In the light of Graham, it will in future be the responsibility of Crown Prosecutors, where the evidence of complaint is not ""fresh"" in the sense discussed in that case or in cases of doubt, to ensure (if appropriate) that an application for leave to adduce the evidence is made pursuant to s 108(3). Likewise it will be the responsibility of defence counsel when objecting to evidence of complaint, or any other evidence for that matter, to relate their objections to the relevant provisions of the Act.29 Although in view of my finding in relation to the admissibility of the evidence of complaint, it is not necessary to consider a number of other grounds in any detail, suffice to say that ground 5 (that the trial judge erred when during his summing-up he proffered an explanation to the jury as to why the complainant might have shut out from her mind the earlier complaint that she had made to her mother) gives me cause for concern, as I can see no evidence to support the suggestion and it appears to be an invitation to the jury to speculate.30 The evidence of Dr Rapson (grounds 6, 7 and 8) appears to me to have been inadmissible. In my view it did not establish anything; the evidence went no further than that the vaginal discharge which may, but which was not established to have been blood, may have been consistent with rubbing of the vaginal area as alleged by the complainant, nevertheless there was no evidence that it was, and there was ample scope for it being consistent with a number of other conditions not related to any alleged conduct of the appellant. 31 Likewise the evidence of the complainant undergoing counselling during her early secondary school years (ground 12); she only went to counselling twice, and there was no evidence that the counselling was in any way related to any sexual abuse of her. As with the evidence of Dr Rapson, this evidence was not objected to but in my view it should have been; and although in accordance with what was said in Birks, this Court is reluctant to interfere with trial counsel's conduct of the trial, it seems to me that the accumulation of these matters not objected to, gives one an uneasy feeling concerning the trial as a whole. 32 I also have concern about the admission of the Crown case in reply (grounds 9 and 11). This was expressly agreed to by counsel then appearing for the appellant (who was not counsel who appeared for him on the appeal) but this agreement appears to have been based on a misconception, namely the issue of when the relationship between the complainant's mother and the appellant ceased (or when her relationship with her now husband commenced), whereas this matter had in fact been raised by cross-examination in the Crown case. It is difficult to see how the case in reply should have been permitted: Killick -v- The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 565, The Queen -v- Chin (1985) 157 CLR 671.33 The only other outstanding issue is whether the appeal should be disposed of by verdicts of acquittal, or an order for a new trial, and in this regard ground 13 is relevant. That ground is expressed as being that:  
     
      
        
      The verdicts are unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
      That is not the correct way to express the relevant ground which is that: 
       
        
      The convictions are unreasonable and/or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: 
       
      see  
      Fleming 
        
      -v- The Queen  
      (1998) 158 ALR 379,  
      R -v- Maxwell 
       (CCA - unreported - 23 December 1998) at 21-2. Nevertheless the principles on which this Court should determine such grounds remain as set out in  
      M -v- The Queen  
      (1994) 181 CLR 487. Having regard to the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied that a jury properly instructed and acting reasonably, and with the advantage of seeing the witnesses, could have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant provided that they believed the complainant. For these reasons this ground fails and the appropriate order is for a new trial.  
      
    34 I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       1. Appeal upheld; 
       
       2. Convictions and sentences quashed; 
       
       3. New trial ordered.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Hulme DCJ at Sydney District Court. On the day scheduled for commencement of trial, the applicant pleaded guilty to a single count of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported controlled drug. The substance consisted of tablets of methlylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) commonly called ecstasy. A prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for life is available for such an offence. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 17 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 11 years. 
     
      
    2 The facts found by the learned sentencing judge are not in dispute and, given the limited challenge in the ground of appeal to which I will turn, an abbreviated summary extracted from the remarks on sentence will suffice for present purposes. 
     
      
    3 On 5 June 2006 a container arrived in Melbourne from Canada containing cardboard boxes labelled as ink or toner. Secreted within a large number of the boxes were 2,572 vacuum sealed bags each containing about 100 ecstasy tablets, in all some 257,200 tablets. Police seized these and substituted inert replacements. An estimated street value of the drug of $40 million was made. 
     
      
    4 The boxes were moved from storage eventually unpacking being commenced at premises in Yagoona in New South Wales. 
     
      
    5 The applicant arrived in Australia on 21 June 2006. He was born in China and had become a Canadian citizen and travelled on a Canadian passport. Police were monitoring activity concerning the boxes by visual surveillance and authorized use of listening devices and telephone interception. The applicant made calls concerning the removal of the boxes from storage and their relocation. In other calls he spoke of needing a rest, of a preference that the boxes be left untouched noting an expectation that it would make a big difference if he were found with the packages after they had been opened and a request that someone else perform the task of opening, in response to which the applicant was reminded that he was committed to the enterprise. Nevertheless he was told that another person was being sought and he was to keep watch on “the stuff”. The applicant complained about the paucity of payment which he had received up to that time. In terms of the hierarchy his Honour found that the applicant was not a principal but equivalent to something like a middle manager. 
     
      
    6 In the event the applicant was arrested at the Yagoona premises on 29 June 2006 where the consignment was being unpacked. On that morning the applicant had been on the telephone about the number of packages and was expressing concern about a perceived shortfall. He received instructions to make a complete record. 
     
      
    7 The sole ground of appeal is that “his Honour failed to give the applicant an appropriate discount for assistance”.  
     
      
    8 The applicant pleaded guilty on 18 June 2007. Dated 9 November 2007 the applicant and his counsel signed an undertaking pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 in the usual form promising to cooperate with law enforcement agencies including by the giving of evidence against co-offenders. His Honour referred to this aspect in his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender signed an undertaking to give evidence in proceedings against any of his co-offenders. That has not of course been necessary in the cases of Zeng and Au. The Crown may possibly call him to give evidence in proceedings against two others who have been charged and perhaps two others who have not as yet been charged. He has provided three statements to police. His assistance has been rated by the Australian Federal Police as ‘high’. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender is being held in protective custody at the Special Purpose Centre at Long Bay. I was not provided with any evidence as to any restrictions or deprivations that might be involved in such an arrangement. I accept, however, that the custodial authorities will be limited in the options they have as to classification and transfer of the offender whilst he is serving his sentence. If the level of perceived threat to his safety remains as it is at present he will likely serve the entirety of his sentence where he presently is. On the basis of this assistance I propose to discount the sentence to be imposed upon the offender by twenty per cent. Half of that is for assistance to date and half is for the promised future assistance.” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour recorded that but for the applicant’s plea of guilty and past and future assistance he would have assessed a sentence of 25 years imprisonment. It follows that, arithmetically, he applied an overall discount of thirty percent made up of ten percent for the plea, and ten percent each for past and future assistance. 
     
      
    10 In a succinctly stated written submission on behalf of the applicant counsel submitted that the discount customarily given in New South Wales for assistance lay in the range of twenty to fifty percent. It was stated that this was recently acknowledged in SZ v Regina [2007] 168 A Crim R 249 and that there was no explanation why his Honour applied a discount which “appears so low” having regard to a police rating of the value of assistance as high and the detail contained in confidential evidence about assistance which was placed in a sealed envelope in accordance with the usual practice. We have been able to read the contents. It confirms the rating estimate, which no doubt had taken into account the number of alleged co-offenders about whom the applicant provided information. 
     
      
    11 It is the Crown submission that the applicant’s contention is based upon an erroneous understanding of the judgments in SZ. The error is in the isolation of the stated discount so as to represent assistance only whereas, properly understood the stated range included any discount for a plea of guilty. The Crown submission is correct. The judges in SZ (Buddin J, Howie J in agreement with additional comments and Simpson J in agreement with both) endorsed what had earlier been observed by Howie J in R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162: 
     
      
       
        
        “Prior to  
        R v Thomson 
         (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 it was the almost invariable practice for a sentencing judge to indicate that a single discount was being given for both the plea and the assistance. 
        
       
       
        
        ….. 
        
       
       
        
        The guideline judgment in  
        Thomson 
         was not intended to change the established practice in that regard.” 
        
       
      
    12 The endorsement in SZ expressly recognized some mistaken references in El Hani to some other cases and no detraction from the endorsement emerges therefrom. 
     
      
    13 As the passage from his Honour’s remarks on sentence above quoted reveals, there was no evidence of any restrictions or deprivations being suffered by the applicant as a result of his being kept in protection. 
     
      
    14 In SZ the observations of Howie J in R v Sukkar [2006] 172 A Crim R 151 were noted. (Although reported in an earlier volume, SZ was decided on 11 January 2007 whereas Sukkar had been decided on 30 March 2006). 
     
      
    15 His Honour said (at 153): 
     
      
       
        
        “However, it is no longer inevitable that an offender who has provided assistance will serve the sentence in more difficult conditions. As was pointed out in  
        R v Mostyn 
         [2004] 145 A Crim R 304 the experience of this Court at least has been that prisoners who have provided assistance are not serving their sentences, or even a significant part of their sentences, in any more onerous conditions than prisoners in the general prison population.” 
        
       
      
    16 Thus the combined discount received by the applicant has been, as above stated, calculated as thirty percent. The plea of guilty was by no means an early plea and no specific complaint has been made at an assessment of its value represented by the equivalent of ten percent. 
     
      
    17 In my view it cannot be said that a combined discount of thirty percent is so low that no reasonable assessment could be made at that level by a judge in the sound exercise of discretion. The ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    18 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    19 GILES JA: I agree. 
     
      
    20 HALL J: I also agree.

       Daniel Eduardo VIGO v R 
       
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: Following trial between 15 and 18 August 2005 before Berman DCJ and a jury at Sydney District Court the applicant, Daniel Eduardo Vigo, was convicted upon indictment charging that between 1 January 1997 and 24 September 2001 he supplied not less than a large commercial quantity of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a total term of 16 years specifying a non-parole period of 12 years commencing on 17 August 2005. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against severity of that sentence on two grounds, first, that his Honour erred in finding that the applicant had supplied in excess of 40 kilogrammes of amphetamine and, second, that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    2 The applicant requires an extension of time for bringing this application. The grant of an extension is not opposed by the Crown. It is supported by affidavits of the applicant sworn 21 November 2008 and by Gregory Willis, solicitor, sworn 27 March 2009. There is no need to recapitulate the circumstances described therein which detail various reasons for non-compliance with time limits, and, without comment upon the cogency or otherwise of the explanation, I would, having regard to the stance of the Crown grant the necessary extension. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was one of the offenders arrested and charged following the detection by police of a large scale drug distribution operation conducted in the Newcastle area. Other offenders, including one Richard Walsh and his de facto wife Melinda Love, acquired pure methylamphetamine from various sources. Love would then cut it, repackage it and sell it to others. Those purchasers would usually on-sell the drugs to end users. The applicant was one of those who bought significant quantities of drugs from Walsh and Love for the purpose of sale to drug users. His Honour’s findings to the above effects which are, of course, consistent with the jury verdict are not challenged. 
     
      
    4 In the terms of the indictment, the guilt of the applicant of supplying at least a large commercial quantity which is specified in legislation to be at least one kilogramme was established by the verdict. As his Honour stated in his remarks on sentence, it became his task to satisfy himself as to the actual extent of the applicant’s activities. Obviously a principal focus had to be the quantity of drug supplied and the learned sentencing judge concluded that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Love had supplied to the applicant, for the purpose of on-supplying by him, drugs in excess of 40 kilogrammes. It is that finding which is the subject of challenge by ground 1. 
     
      
    5 His Honour expressed his reasons for reaching his conclusion appropriately. I will set out the relevant extract of his remarks on sentence. The person mentioned therein, Chapman, was arrested for armed robbery after which he commenced to assist authorities and it seemed that they became aware of the distribution operation as a result of this assistance. 
     
      
    6 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence as to the quantity of drugs supplied to the offender for the purposes of him on-supplying those drugs to drug users came from Mr Chapman and Ms Love. Mr Chapman’s evidence was that on many occasions either he alone or he and Walsh delivered methylamphetamine to the offender. He said that he had delivered quantities as small as half a pound, sometimes one pound and on one occasion as much as two pounds. He also referred to a time after the Indy Grand Prix at the Gold Coast when he delivered 4 ounces of methylamphetamine to the offender. Ms Love said that in mid 1997 the offender began buying half a pound per fortnight but that increased. At one stage he was buying half a pound per week. That also increased until May 2001 when the offender was buying one pound of methylamphetamine from Ms Love every week. Indeed he stopped buying from her at that stage because she was unable to keep up with the quantities he required. In identifying how much the offender actually supplied in the four years in which he was purchasing from Ms Love I have to bear in mind of course, various matters concerning the evidence of Mr Chapman and Ms Love. Their evidence may be unreliable for reasons which I identified when summing up this case to the jury. I therefore have to exercise caution before I accept what they say. Their evidence is also not entirely consistent, both as to the way drugs were delivered to the offender and the quantities he bought. Ms Love gave evidence that she had calculated using conservative figures that the offender purchased about 96 pounds of methylamphetamine from her over the years, that is about forty three and a half kilograms. She based this calculation on an estimate of half a pound a week. She said that this was a conservative estimate of the amount that he purchased from her. Mr Marr who appeared for the offender at trial and on sentence submitted that I would not accept Ms Love’s conservative estimate and instead sentence his client on the basis that he supplied slightly more than one kilogram. His submission was based on the support for Ms Love’s evidence from Mr Chapman and the intercepted telephone calls. He submitted that consistent with the jury’s verdict they established that the offender supplied slightly more than a kilogram but insofar as Ms Love gave evidence of a larger amount, her evidence was entirely unsupported. He also referred me to the evidence of Ms Love as to the profits which she should have been making from her drug supply activities and compared that to the evidence of her actual financial state, including her need to borrow money to buy a relatively modest house and the fact that the house was still the subject of a mortgage some years later. I have re-read the evidence of Ms Love, in particular the cross-examination to which Mr Marr directed me for the purposes of sentencing the offender. At first blush it is surprising that someone earning the amount of money Ms Love said she was earning was not significantly materially better off. However she explained how her husband, who seems to have been somewhat of an irrational man during this period, was responsible for the money in effect being frittered away. I watched Ms Love carefully and even exercising considerable caution I am satisfied that she was accurate and honest insofar as she described her drug dealing activities. Ms Love impressed me as a witness very conscious of the need to tell the truth in court and the consequences for her if she was found to have lied. She also impressed me as a woman who was capable of remembering the quantities her various customers purchased from her, at least where those customers were, as the offender was, regular ones. Her evidence suggests that Mr Vigo was one of her best customers. Indeed as I have mentioned at one stage he was buying so much methylamphetamine from her that she could not keep up with his demand and so he looked elsewhere. I am satisfied therefore that not only was Ms Love being honest in her evidence regarding her recollection as to the quantities she supplied the offender but also that she was accurate. I am therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the quantities supplied by Ms Love to the offender for the purposes of him on-supplying that drug to others was in excess of forty kilos. At one stage the Crown suggested that Ms Love’s evidence revealed even greater quantities of methylamphetamine were supplied to the offender. However, I am prepared to accept in the offender’s favour Ms Love’s lower conservative estimate.” 
        
       
      
    7 The written submission in support of ground 1 in essence sought to re-argue submissions which obviously his Honour did not accept. It was stated that he “accepted the evidence of Love, notwithstanding that most of it was completely uncorroborated”. There was no obligation for any evidence which his Honour was prepared to accept for this purpose to be corroborated. The submission continued that “notwithstanding Love’s evidence as to the quantity supplied to the applicant, the evidence ought to have, at the very least, provided some doubt as to the actual quantity supplied by Love to the applicant”. One might respond by asking, why? The reference to the “evidence” is to isolated facts upon which the applicant sought to rely but upon which the sentencing judge was not prepared to act.  
     
      
    8 No error of fact finding is pointed to in the extract of the reasons relevant to the issue which I have set out above. The power of this Court is invoked where error can be demonstrated. It is not a court of review. It was not suggested, let alone shown, that his Honour took into account some irrelevant matter, failed to take into account some relevant matter, applied any wrong principle or otherwise fell into error of the sort which would attract the intervention of this Court in accordance with the well established guidance in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 449. 
     
      
    9 Ground 1 has not been made out. 
     
      
    10 The maximum penalty faced by the applicant for this offence has been prescribed by Parliament as imprisonment for life. The applicant’s offending was sustained over a significant period of time. His Honour held that he would not assess the prospects of rehabilitation as good. It is not contended that such a finding was not open. No finding in relation to the applicant’s subjective circumstances made by his Honour has been the subject of challenge.  
     
      
    11 His Honour stated that he would reduce the assessment of term to take into account the effect of the applicant’s incarceration upon his children. I do not need for present purposes to recount the details of his marriage, separation from his wife, the arrival of a young child and the attempts by the applicant and his wife at reconciliation. If there was any error on this aspect, it favoured the applicant in ceding to him the benefit that his Honour stated he would have. 
     
      
    12 The sentence lies within discernible pattern of sentences for this offence which, by virtue of the prescription of the maximum available penalty of life imprisonment, must be in a category of most serious instances of drug trafficking.  
     
      
    13 Counsel has specified that ground 2 is relied upon only in the event that ground 1 is upheld, therefore the ground that the sentence was manifestly excessive should also be rejected. 
     
      
    14 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Extension of time for making application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      (2) Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      (3) Appeal dismissed. 
       
      
    15 HOWIE J: I agree. 
     
      
    16 BUDDIN J: I also agree. 
     
      
    17 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an appeal against conviction following trial of the appellant before Solomon DCJ and a jury at Lismore District Court on an indictment charging sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. The date of offence was specified as lying between 21 March 2006 and 13 April 2006. The trial took place between 18 and 27 September 2007. 
     
      
    2 The facts relied upon by the Crown were that the complainant, whose sixth birthday was in March 2006, lived in a caravan park with her family and occasionally visited a woman who resided in another caravan there. The appellant was in a relationship with this woman and frequently stayed with her. As a result, there were encounters between the appellant and the complainant. The complainant told her parents, using the language of a child, that the appellant had digitally penetrated her anus.  
     
      
    3 The appellant relies upon a single ground of appeal namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in allowing the oral testimony of the complainant to go before the jury as there was no material upon which it was open to his Honour to displace the statutory presumption that the complainant was competent to give sworn evidence.” 
        
       
      
    4 The argument in support of the ground can shortly be stated as there having been “no material upon which it was open to his Honour to conclude that the complainant was incapable of understanding that she was under an obligation to give truthful evidence as required by s 13 (1) of the Evidence Act 1995.” Otherwise unreferenced section numbers relate to that statute. It was contended that his Honour appeared to have “presumed such incapability as a product of the complainant’s age.” 
     
      
    5 It should be noted that the Evidence Amendment Act 2007 substituted new provisions in s 13 but these apply to hearings commencing on or after 1 January 2009. What follows is referrable to the now omitted provision which was applicable to the trial of the appellant.  
     
      
    6 That provision was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “13. Competence: lack of capacity 
         
        (1) A person who is incapable of understanding that, in giving evidence, he or she is under an obligation to give truthful evidence is not competent to give sworn evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person who because of subsection (1) is not competent to give sworn evidence is competent to give unsworn evidence if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the court is satisfied that the person understands the difference between the truth and a lie; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court tells the person that it is important to tell the truth; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the person indicates, by responding appropriately when asked, that he or she will not tell lies in the proceeding. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person who is incapable of giving a rational reply to a question about a fact is not competent to give evidence about the fact, but may be competent to give evidence about other facts. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A person is not competent to give evidence about a fact if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person is incapable of hearing or understanding, or of communicating a reply to, a question about the fact; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that incapacity cannot be overcome. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (5) It is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that a person is not incompetent because of this section. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Evidence that has been given by a witness does not become inadmissible merely because, before the witness finishes giving evidence, he or she dies or ceases to be competent to give evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) For the purpose of determining a question arising under this section, the court may inform itself as it thinks fit.” 
         
        
       
      
    7 All persons, including children, are presumed competent to give evidence: s 12. There is no fixed rule, either at common law or by statute, as to an age below which a child will be presumed to be incompetent to give sworn evidence: R v Brooks (1998) 44 NSWLR 121. It would be erroneous to presume incapacity merely because of the tender years of an intended witness: R v JTB [2003] NSWCCA 295.  An accused may only be convicted upon evidence which is admissible, that is to say in the case of oral testimony, on oath or affirmation or pursuant to an alternative lawful sanction. Section 13 provides such an alternative.  
     
      
    8 The issue of testimony from the complainant was raised before the learned trial judge and the Crown Prosecutor correctly informed him that it would be necessary to determine whether the complainant was competent to give sworn evidence, and, if not, whether she could give unsworn evidence as sanctioned by s 13. His Honour was authorized to investigate the matter as he saw fit: s 13 (7). 
     
      
    9 His Honour first listened to an audio recording of an interview of the complainant by police. Near the conclusion of that interview she was asked some questions about “telling lies”, “fibbing” and “telling the truth.” After listening to the recording his Honour then asked a series of questions of the complainant (transcript 18 September 2007 pp 8-10). 
     
      
    10 The material showed that the complainant understood the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie, but it is apparent from the terms of s 13(1) and 13 (2) that there is a difference between being able to discriminate between telling the truth and telling a lie, and understanding the obligation to give truthful evidence. 
     
      
    11 The determination required by s 13 (1) is a matter of judgment and inevitably includes assessment and impression. His Honour was able to listen to the complainant being interviewed and to observe her demeanour as she responded to his questioning. Although, as I have said, it would be erroneous to assume incapacity only by reason of age, it would nevertheless be potentially relevant to make an assessment of maturity. Nowhere did he say that he presumed that she was incapable simply because of her age and there is no reason to infer that he did. It has not been shown that his Honour’s discretionary judgment has miscarried. 
     
      
    12 In his ruling his Honour expressed satisfaction that the complainant was incapable of understanding the obligation described in terms of s 13 (1) and, upon that finding, he turned to the issue of discrimination in s 13 (2) (a). It is not suggested that s 13 (2) (b) and (c) were not complied with appropriately. 
     
      
    13 The procedure and approach adopted by his Honour cannot be criticized and was entirely compatible with the expressions in R v RAG  [2006] NSWCCA 343 to which he was referred. 
     
      
    14 For completeness, I note that his Honour overruled an objection to the playing of the audio interview of the complainant pursuant to s 9 (1) of the Evidence (Children) Act 1997 (now repealed and replaced by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Vulnerable Persons) Act  2007 with effect from 12 October 2007). References therein to a child giving evidence should be understood to include not only statements verified by oath or affirmation but admitted pursuant to lawful alternative such as authorized by s 13. It is not submitted that his Honour erred in overruling that objection. 
     
      
    15 The ground of appeal has not been sustained. 
     
      
    16 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.

    18 BUDDIN J: I also agree with Grove J.

      14332/09 The State of New South Wales v Timothy HORDERN 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 His Honour: This is an application pursuant to s 6 of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 for an extended supervision order. That is ultimately what is sought in the summons that has been filed in the proceedings but today the plaintiff seeks certain interim orders. 
     
      
    2 S 6(1) provides that the State of New South Wales may apply to the Supreme Court for an extended supervision order against a sex offender who, when the application is made, is in custody or under supervision. 
     
      
    3 In this case I am satisfied that the defendant is a “sex offender”. The definitions in s 4 and s 5 of the Act provide, in effect, that a sex offender is a person who has at any time been sentenced to imprisonment following conviction for a serious sex offence. In this case the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for an offence of indecent assault on a child under the age of ten years, (s 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900, an offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for ten years. Such an offence is, under the definition in s 5(1)(a)(i), a “serious sex offence”. The defendant was in custody serving the sentence for that offence at the time the application was made. The summons in these proceedings was filed on 7 September 2009 and today an amended summons has been filed in court. The defendant remains in custody and will do so until his sentence expires on 27 September 2009. 
     
      
    4 S 6(2) provides that the application not be made until the last six months of the defendant’s current custody or supervision. From what I said a moment ago that prohibition does not apply. 
     
      
    5 S 6(3) provides that the application must be supported by certain documentation. I am satisfied that those requirements have been fulfilled. 
     
      
    6 S 6(4) is to the effect that the application may indicate the kinds of conditions considered to be appropriate for inclusion in an extended supervision order. The summons and the amended summons in this case does so by annexing a schedule of conditions. 
     
      
    7 S 7 of the Act makes various provisions for pretrial procedures. Subsections (1), (2) and (3) provide for the timing and service of the application upon the defendant, disclosure to the defendant of the documents et cetera to be relied upon and the timing of the matter being heard. There is nothing of significance to be noted in relation to any of those matters. 
     
      
    8 Ss (4) of s 7 provides that if the court is satisfied: “That the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order” the Supreme Court must make orders appointing two qualified psychiatrists (or the like) to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and furnish reports of the results and directing the defendant to attend on those examinations. Ss (5) provides that if the Court is not satisfied of the matters in ss (4) the Court is to dismiss the application. 
     
      
    9 In the State of New South Wales v Manners [2008] NSWSC 1242 at [9] per Johnson J, the purpose of a preliminary hearing such as in occurring today is to filter out unmeritorious applications at an early stage. His Honour also noted that it was to give the Court the benefit of expert opinion of two independent witnesses before making that final decision. 
     
      
    10 It is s 8 that makes provision for the Court to make interim supervision orders. S 8(1) provides the Court may make an interim supervision order if the current custody will expire before the proceedings are finalised and that the matters alleged in the supporting documents would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order. 
     
      
    11 In this case, as I have said, the defendant’s current custody will expire on 27 September and so I am satisfied that the first part of that provision has been established. As to the second part, the Court is required to proceed on the basis that the material in the supporting documentation is proved, which has been held to be similar to the requirement for a prima facie case consideration at committal proceedings: Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Hayter [2007] NSWSC 983 at [6] per Price J. It does not involve the weighing of the material or predicting the outcome: Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at [98]. 
     
      
    12 Whether the material would justify the making of an extended supervision order requires consideration of the requirements of s 6 and s 9. I have already considered the provisions of s 6. As to the requirements of s 9 the question is whether the material filed in support of the application is capable of establishing: “To a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision”: see s 9(2). The “high degree of probability” has been held to be a standard higher than the civil standard but lower than the criminal standard: Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWSC 605 at [27] per Bell J. “Likely to commit a further serious sex offence” has been held to require a degree of probability at the upper end of the scale but not necessarily exceeding 50 percent: see Tillman v Attorney General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327 at [89] per Giles & Ipp JJA. I note their Honours were there speaking in the context of s 17(3) of the Act but there is no reason to take any different approach to 9(2). 
     
      
    13 S 9(3) provides that in determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order the Court must have regard to the matters listed within that subsection in addition to any other matters it considers relevant. In this matter, the State of New South Wales has drawn my specific attention to six key factors which arise from the documentation that has been filed. They are set out in the very helpful written submissions of Mr Kell and I will quote the relevant portion: 
     
      
       
        
        1) the defendant is diagnosed as suffering from paedophilia (being paraphilic disorder) which has been assessed as chronic, intense and recurrent. 
        
       
       
        
        2) the defendant is considered to have outstanding treatment needs in terms of psychological intervention to address his sexual offending. 
        
       
       
        
        3) the defendant is assessed as being in the high risk category for sexual offending having regards to both actuarial and dynamic risk factors. 
        
       
       
        
        4) the defendant has a history of sexual offending against young girls. 
        
       
       
        
        5) the defendant’s most recent sexual offence was committed whilst he was subject to a good behaviour bond imposed following a conviction for a previous sexual offence. 
        
       
       
        
        6) the defendant’s most recent response to supervision was unsatisfactory in that his parole was revoked following unauthorised contact with a young girl in breach of a formal direction given by his supervising parole officer. 
        
       
      
    14 In addition to those matters, which, as I have said I am satisfied are made out in the material that has been filed, I note also that in the chronology that I have been provided with by Mr Kell this morning there is disclosed that when the defendant was under parole supervision following his release on parole on 22 March 2009, in a conversation with his supervising officer on 13 April 2009 concerning him being refused permission to attend his grandmother’s house at which a 15 year old girl might be present, he told that officer: 
     
      
       
        
        “I know you have got a job to do and all, but that is not how I work, for want of a better word. I go for really young (girls) so they don’t know any better and 6 and seven-year olds. I can bribe them, but once they get to 8 or 9 they know what is going on … She is fifteen years old. She’d be on to me straight away, not that I am interest in that any way”. 
        
       
      
    15 I note further, in the report of Carollyne Youssef, a forensic psychologist, or 2 April 2009, that the defendant was assessed as being in the high risk category relevant to other male sexual offenders on the STATIC 99 actuarial risk assessment instrument. Then, after considering a number of static and variable factors relevant to the defendant’s risk of recidivism, Ms Youssef stated that the defendant appeared to fall in the “high range for sexual offending.” She also said his symptoms were consistent with the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for paedophilia. She recommended psychological treatment and a psychiatric assessment for suitability for anti-libidinal medication. I interpolate I have been informed by Mr Thiering, who appears for the defendant, that the defendant is now on such medication and has been so for the past 8 weeks. Ms Youssef, rather bluntly, stated that the defendant should have no unsupervised access to children under 16. 
     
      
    16 In a joint report of Marcelo Rodriguez, senior forensic clinician and Dr Andrew Ellis, consultant forensic psychiatrist both of the Community Forensic Mental Health Service, Sexual Behaviours Clinic of Justice Health dated 8 July 2009, the clinicians expressed the opinion that the defendant demonstrated a chronic, intense and recurrent paraphilic disorder, namely paedophilia, mostly against girls but inclusive of young boys. The defendant reported sexual arousal to the age group of 8 to 10 as well as much younger girls. The authors of that report were also of the opinion that the defendant would likely benefit from anti-androgen medication. They, similarly to Ms Youssef, were of the opinion that he would require psychological intervention, psychoeducation and possible further assessment of his social difficulties. 
     
      
    17 Then there is a very comprehensive report of Katherine Sahm, therapeutic manager, Forensic Psychology Services of the 13 August 2009. That report also indicates that the defendant is assessed as: “High risk category for sexual re offending.” She described the defendant as having a paraphilic disorder, namely paedophilia with current deviant sexual fantasies and preoccupations towards female children as young as two years old. It was noted on the positive side of things that the defendant appeared to genuinely wish to not re offend and was motivated to change. Various recommendations were made by Ms Sahm in the event that the defendant is released in the community. They include that he attend a sex offender treatment programme, that he continue in psyhchiatric care so that he may benefit from psycho pharmacological intervention to control his sexual arousal to children, that he be stabilised on medication prior to release and finally that he not be left in the company of children under the age of 18 unaccompanied. 
     
      
    18 In conclusion I am satisfied to the standard required, as explained in the authorities I have earlier mentioned, that the material filed by the plaintiff establish matters which would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order. Given that his current custody will expire before the proceedings are determined, it is appropriate that an interim supervision order be made. 
     
      
    19 Accordingly, I make the orders set out in the document headed: “Orders” which was handed up in court today being orders 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. I have initialled the document and dated it today.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 BASTEN JA: I agree with the reasons given by Latham J and the order her Honour proposes. 
     
      
    2 In the course of argument, reference was made by counsel for the Director to the decision of this Court in McCall v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 174. That case involved an application for leave to appeal, in relation to a verdict returned on 17 September 2007 and a sentence imposed on 16 November 2007. An application for an extension of time to appeal was filed on 23 December 2009. McClellan CJ at CL (Hislop and Latham JJ agreeing) quoted (at [5]) a remark from R v Lawrence (1980) 1 NSWLR 122 at 148 where the Court (constituted by Nagle CJ at CL and Yeldham J) stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Certainly, where any considerable delay has occurred, exceptional circumstances will be required before the appeal is permitted to proceed.” 
        
       
       
      3 Section 10 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
       provides for a notice of intention to appeal (or for leave to appeal) to be given within 28 days after the conviction or sentence. The appeal (or application for leave to appeal) is to be made in accordance with the Rules of the Court: s 10(1)(c). Pursuant to r 3B, the notice must be given within the period during which the notice of intention has effect, being three months unless the period is extended by the Court:  
      Criminal Appeal Rules 
      , r 3B(1) and (2). A notice of application for extension of time may be made under r 28.  
       
      
    4 The power of the Court to extend time is discretionary, but is unfettered. The statement in Lawrence should be understood as operating where “any considerable delay has occurred” and should be understood as a warning to those who delay not to expect any automatic grant of an indulgence. In McCall, the Chief Judge noted that leave would not be granted in the absence of any satisfactory explanation for the delay and where no merit had been demonstrated in the proposed grounds: at [7]. 
     
      
    5 Those are undoubtedly two critical factors in this case, as in most cases. Reference to “exceptional circumstances” will usually be undesirable, as it suggests the imposition of a fetter on the exercise of discretion which is not to be found in the statutory scheme. 
     
      
    6 As Latham J has explained, the explanation advanced in the present case is not satisfactory, nor has the merit of the proposed appeal been demonstrated. In these circumstances the appropriate course is to refuse the application for an extension of time. 
     
      
    7 HALL J : I also agree with the reasons of Latham J and the order proposed by her. 
     
      
    8 LATHAM J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him by Judge Finnane QC DCJ (the Judge) on 20 June 2008. The applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated robbery pursuant to s 95 (1) of the Crimes Act 1900, each carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, and to one count of Knowingly Drive a Stolen Vehicle pursuant to s154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. A further count of drive recklessly or furiously in a manner dangerous was dealt with by the Judge under a s 166 certificate. In respect of that matter, the applicant was sentenced to a wholly concurrent fixed term of 12 months imprisonment. All of these offences were committed in early March 2007.  
     
      
    9 The aggregate head sentence was six years, to date from 1 April 2007, with an aggregate non parole period of four years, expiring 31 March 2011. The applicant was referred for assessment to the Drug Court pursuant to s 18B of the Drug Court Act 1998. As a result, the applicant was ordered to attend the Compulsory Drug Treatment Programme at the Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre. 
     
      
    10 According to an affidavit affirmed by the applicant on 23 July 2010, a Notice of Intention to apply for leave to appeal was filed in the Court of Criminal Appeal on 17 July 2008. That notice was filed through the applicant's then legal representatives, namely John B Hajje and Associates. It appears from the applicant’s evidence before this Court that he also gave a Notice of Intention to appeal to a prison officer on the understanding that it would be filed. In any event, the notice filed by the applicant’s solicitors expired on 17 January 2009. The applicant maintains in his affidavit that he was incorrectly informed by another inmate that the Court would write to advise the applicant of a hearing date and that it did not therefore occur to him to make any direct enquiries with the Court. That explanation does not take account of the fact that the applicant was legally represented for at least three weeks after 17 July 2008 and that reliable information was available from his solicitor. 
     
      
    11 The applicant escaped from the Compulsory Drug Treatment Programme on 7 October 2009 but returned to the programme two days later. On 19 October, the Compulsory Drug Treatment Order was revoked. The applicant's then legal representatives, Khalid Kheir and Associates, advised the applicant to pursue the sentence appeal.  
     
      
    12 On 15 December 2009, the applicant was sentenced for the offence of escape from lawful custody. He received a term of six months and one day imprisonment commencing 31 March 2011, expiring on 1 October 2011. A non-parole period of three months imposed on that offence expires on 30 June 2011. 
     
      
    13 An application by the applicant for legal aid was received by the Legal Aid Commission on 17 February 2010. The relevant officer in the Legal Aid Commission erroneously assumed that the Notice of Intention to appeal expired on 17 January 2010, not 17 January 2009. The Legal Aid Commission sought an extension of time for the filing of the Notice of Appeal, which was granted to 30 June 2010, on the basis of the misunderstanding on the part of the Legal Aid Commission. On 23 June 2010, the Legal Aid Commission filed a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal on the applicant's behalf. On 18 July 2010, the Registrar of the Court advised the Legal Aid Commission that her power to extend time for a Notice of Intention to appeal which had expired 18 months previously was doubtful. 
     
      
    14 Accordingly, the applicant requires the leave of the Court in circumstances where no satisfactory explanation is provided for the lapse of the Notice of Intention to appeal and no satisfactory explanation is provided for the delay between October 2009 and February 2010 in filing a further notice. A period of three and a half years has elapsed since the offences were committed. The aggregate non parole period of the sentences the subject of the application to appeal is due to expire in 7 months time. 
     
      
    15 The only ground of the appeal that asserts error is that the Judge failed to take account of the applicant’s guilty pleas. Whilst it is conceded by the Crown that there is no reference to pleas of guilty in the course of the remarks on sentence, both the Crown and the applicant refer in their submissions to an exchange that occurred between the Judge and counsel shortly before sentence was pronounced. That exchange explicitly included mention of R v Henry & Ors. [1999] NSWCCA 111 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 in the context of its relevance to the applicant’s case because of his pleas of guilty, amongst other factors.  
     
      
    16 I am not persuaded that the Judge failed to take the applicant's guilty pleas into account, notwithstanding the applicant's reliance on other decisions of this Court where a failure to refer to a plea of guilty was held to constitute error in the circumstances of those cases ; see R v Heilpern [2006] NSWCCA 311; R v Lao [2003] NSWCCA 315. The Judge's reference to the decision of Henry cannot be construed as anything other than an acknowledgement of the applicant's pleas, particularly where the sentences imposed for two separate offences of aggravated robbery (a 5 year head sentence with a 3 year non-parole period) were consistent with the Henry guideline, which is based upon a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    17 Assuming that error is established, I am not persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted. The applicant used a fraudulent drivers license to hire a utility on 6 March 2007. He robbed two convenience stores very late on the evenings of 7 March and 8 March 2007. On each occasion he caused the counter attendant to leave the cashier area, punched the victim and threatened further violence. On the first occasion he fled with $700 in cash, whilst on the second occasion he left with an unknown amount of money from the till and a computer hard drive. Approximately 15 minutes after the commission of the second offence, the applicant was engaged in a high-speed pursuit with police (the subject of the traffic offence) and made good his escape. He was arrested on 1 April 2007 in Queensland and extradited to New South Wales. 
     
      
    18 These offences were committed one day after the expiry of a 12 month bond imposed for the offence of drive whilst disqualified. His criminal history, which consists largely of traffic offences and minor drug offences, largely reflects the applicant’s substance abuse, which commenced at the age of 17 and escalated over the next 6 years, resulting in the commission of the robbery offences to fund the applicant's addictions. 
     
      
    19 However the sentences for the individual offences were structured, the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non parole period were entirely appropriate to the totality of the applicant's criminality. In my view, there is no merit in the appeal. 
     
      
    20 For all of these reasons, but particularly in view of the inordinate delay, I would refuse the application to extend the time within which to appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Marien DCJ at Parramatta District Court on 18 October 2007. Pleas of guilty were entered to two charges of supplying a prohibited drug (counts 1 and 2) and one charge of an ongoing supply of prohibited drug (count 3). His Honour was asked to take into account on a Form 1 a further charge of supplying a prohibited drug. In each instance the drug was that commonly referred to as ecstasy.  
     
      
    2 On counts 1 and 2 the applicant was sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment to be served concurrently with each other of 18 months imprisonment commencing on 15 February 2007 and expiring on 14 August 2008. Those sentences have been served and are now expired. On count 3, taking into account the Form 1 offence, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 15 August 2007 and expiring on 14 August 2009 with a balance term of 2 years. 
     
      
    3 The effective sentence thus consisted of minimum custody of 2 years 6 months with a parole period of 2 years. 
     
      
    4 The offences were committed between 1 September 2006 and 8 February 2007 at which time the applicant was aged eighteen years. His Honour observed that, apart from traffic offences, the applicant had no prior convictions and he stated that he would approach sentence on the basis that the applicant was of prior good character. The considerable delay in bringing the application on for hearing was suggested to be attributable to difficulty in obtaining transcript of Remarks on Sentence relating to other offenders. The applicant has been in custody for over two years and, as above appears, he is eligible for consideration for release on parole on 14 August next, that is in less than four months time. 
     
      
    5 No challenge has been made to the facts as found by the learned sentencing judge. For present purposes a brief summary extracted from his remarks will suffice.  
     
      
    6 On 16 September 2006, in a tavern, an undercover police officer (UCO) approached the applicant and another named Gaddie and asked for pills. The applicant said, “You are in luck, my man, he and I look after the Castle Hill Tavern.” He spoke of having a busy night and mentioned that, “Everyone comes to us for pills”. He said they only had three left and Gaddie handed them to the UCO in return for $90. Both the applicant and Gaddie gave their mobile telephone numbers to UCOs. This offence is that acknowledged by the applicant on the Form 1. 
     
      
    7 Following several contacts, on 21 September 2006 two UCOs attended the Castle Hill Tavern to purchase fifty ecstasy tablets. The applicant telephoned a co-offender, Ellabban and ultimately the applicant directed the UCOs to a car park where Ellabban supplied that amount of drug for $810. The applicant’s participation in this conduct was charged in count 1. 
     
      
    8 On 23 November 2006 an UCO met the applicant at the Red Rooster Restaurant in Mt Druitt seeking a further fifty tablets of ecstasy. Another co-offender, Muschulu, arrived by car. The applicant introduced him to the UCO and a supply for $1,100 was discussed. The applicant and Muschulu left the car park at the restaurant and later returned, after which the applicant supplied the UCO with the requested tablets of ecstasy. This action constituted count 2.  
     
      
    9 On 11 January 2007 the applicant met an UCO near the Castle Hill Tavern. While waiting he said that he received $100 for “organizing every transaction.” Co-offenders Chadwick and Durrington arrived by vehicle and the applicant obtained fifty ecstasy tablets from them which he passed to the UCO for $1,100. 
     
      
    10 A similar arrangement was made on 25 January 2007 when Gaddie was again also present. Chadwick arrived and the applicant conducted an exchange with him after which he supplied the UCO with fifty tablets of ecstasy for $1,100. 
     
      
    11 On 1 February 2007, in the absence of Gaddie, an identical transaction again took place by the applicant supplying fifty tablets of ecstasy obtained from Chadwick to a UCO. 
     
      
    12 On 8 February 2007 an UCO contacted a co-offender named Fox by telephone. Fox handed the phone to the applicant who arranged to meet the UCO near the Castle Hill Tavern. The applicant and Gaddie met him there as arranged. Later Chadwick arrived and the applicant obtained fifty one tablets of ecstasy from him which he supplied to the UCO for $1,100. 
     
      
    13 The applicant’s participation in those supplies between 11 January 2007 and 8 February 2007 constituted the ongoing supply charged in count 3. 
     
      
    14 On the last occasion Chadwick left in his vehicle alone but was stopped by police. He was found to be in possession of forty three blue tablets known as “rolling stones”, about 1.6 grammes of cocaine, some powder and other tablets together with $900 which was identifiable as part of the $1,100 which had been paid by the UCO to the applicant for the fifty one tablets of ecstasy. 
     
      
    15 On 15 February 2007 the applicant was arrested. He has been in continuous custody since then. He was interviewed by police upon arrest and made full admissions regarding the offences. He told police, and gave evidence to his Honour to the same effect, that his reward for arranging the supply was $200 which he obtained by making deductions, as it were, at each end from the UCO and from the source. He obtained some tablets for himself as well. His Honour characterised him as a “user/dealer at the lower end of the drug hierarchy.” 
     
      
    16 Of particular significance was the giving of an undertaking to assist authority including the giving of evidence against co-offenders if required. A senior police officer confirmed the applicant’s assistance which was rated as valuable. He had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and his Honour determined that to reflect that, and assistance, he would reduce sentence “by a figure in the order of 40 percent.” Counsel have agreed that, given the impositions, his Honour must have commenced with a notional starting point of 7 years 6 months imprisonment. 
     
      
    17 His Honour made a number of findings relating to the applicant’s subjective case, all of which were favourable to him.  
     
      
    18 The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      (1) The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentences imposed upon him and his co-accused. 
       
       
      (2) The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    19 It is convenient to deal first with ground 2.  
     
      
    20 As above noted, his Honour assessed the objective level of criminality of the applicant’s offences as at the lower end of the “drug hierarchy.” Balanced against that relatively low level were cumulating subjective factors, including the applicant’s age (he was only a few months older than would have seen him dealt with as a juvenile); prior good character, genuine remorse and favourable prospects of rehabilitation. All of these things were found and it is difficult to perceive that they have received the reflection which they ought to have contributed when it can be calculated that a starting point of 7 years 6 months has been assessed.  
     
      
    21 Whilst, as counsel for the applicant candidly acknowledged, statistics are a blunt tool, a survey revealed that of fifty nine cases of offenders sentencing for ongoing supply of prohibited drugs between 2001 and 2007, only three attracted a greater imposition than that received by the applicant and only one other received the same imposition. The maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament of twenty years is of course significant but the pattern of sentencing revealed in the survey strongly suggests that it would be inconceivable that this applicant, just beyond juvenile years, remorseful, rehabilitative and without prior offence should be sentenced in the upper range of that pattern.  
     
      
    22 I would uphold ground 2. 
     
      
    23 The principles upon the application of which this Court should proceed when a complaint about disparity with treatment of co-offenders is made are well established and do not require re-statement. 
     
      
    24 As the facts above summarized show, there were a number of persons involved in the drug supply activity particularly in and about the Castle Hill Tavern and surrounds. It is the Crown submission that, with the exception of Muschulu, co-offenders stood for sentence for single offences, or offences different from those charged against the applicant, or offences involving fewer tablets or lesser weight of drug. Reference can be made to this variety and where appropriate I will indicate parenthetically where an offence is coordinate with a count charged against the applicant. 
     
      
    25 It can be noted that Ellabban (count 1) has been found unfit to plead by reason of mental condition. 
     
      
    26 Muschulu (count 2) was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance term of 1 year, however, he was also sentenced for supplies which he had made on 14 and 19 December 2006 which did not involve the applicant but in which he supplied quantities of 1,000 and 2,000 ecstasy tablets. Ultimately he received an effective sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance term of 4 years. 
     
      
    27 Chadwick (count 3) was dealt with for ongoing supply and supply of prohibited drug. Allowing for orders for concurrency, he received an effective sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 15 months and a balance term of 21 months, the custodial element of which was ordered to be served in a juvenile detention centre. 
     
      
    28 Corby (count 3) drove Chadwick to a “sale point” as did Fox (count 3) on another occasion, each of them receiving good behaviour bonds for knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug and concealing a serious indictable offence respectively. 
     
      
    29 On 7 December 2006 Gaddie supplied prohibited drugs on three separate occasions to an UCO. Each supply consisted of two tablets of ecstasy, a total of six tablets. The offence in which he was involved with the applicant (supplying three tablets of ecstasy on 16 September 2006) was, similarly to him, taken into account on a Form 1. After remand on a bond, he received a nine months suspended sentence.  
     
      
    30 Durrington (count 3) was given a bond to be of good behaviour for 3 years for knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug.  
     
      
    31 Count 3 was of course a charge of ongoing supply by the applicant and the co-offenders were engaged in the constituent activity to the extent mentioned in the summary of facts which I have related above. 
     
      
    32 The foregoing record of dealing with co-offenders amply demonstrates why they were dealt with differently from the applicant. The discrimination contended by the Crown is evident and the applicant has not shown that he can harbour a justifiable sense of grievance by comparing how he was treated with the treatment of the co-offenders. 
     
      
    33 I would reject ground 1. 
     
      
    34 However, having regard to my conclusion that ground 2 should be sustained I turn to the issue of resentence. An affidavit by the applicant’s solicitor shows from that which is exhibited thereto that the applicant has made good use of his time in custody.  
     
      
    35 I would adopt without repetition the favourable subjective findings made by Marien DCJ and his findings of special circumstances. The imminence of the eligibility date for consideration for release of the applicant to parole in accordance with the current imposition injects some practical implications into the issue of resentence. As earlier stated, the sentences on counts 1 and 2 have expired and there is no reason now for intervention in respect of them but the partial cumulation of the sentence on count 3 to those sentences should not be overlooked.  
     
      
    36 In those circumstances I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      (2) Appeal allowed in part. 
       
      (3) Sentence imposed on count 3 quashed. 
       
      (4) In lieu thereof, taking into account the offence on Form 1, the applicant sentenced on count 3 to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months commencing on 15 August 2007 and expiring on 14 May 2009 with a balance term of 1 year 3 months. 
       
      (5) Order his release to parole on 14 May 2009. 
       
      
    37 HOWIE J: I agree. 
     
      
    38 HULME J: I agree. 
     
      
    39 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

    Judgment 
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The Court is unanimously of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The applicant pleaded guilty on 2 March 2009 on the day on which his trial was to commence for an offence of indecent assault. He requested that the Court take into account on a form 1 another count of indecent assault against the same victim. The offences are contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 which prescribes a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. I will relate in a moment the facts which indicate that the two matters were part of the same incident. 
     
      
    2 The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 15% for the applicant’s plea of guilty and made a finding of special circumstances which resulted in the non-parole period being equivalent to approximately 60% of the term of the sentence. That sentence was a non-parole period of two years commencing on 22 May 2009 with a balance of term of one year four months and twenty-four days. The balance of term appears to be arrived by an application of the discount to the sentence which her Honour otherwise would have imposed. It would be preferable, as this court has said on previous occasions that a sentence be rounded to some appropriate period of months rather than to descend to a matter of days. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was employed as a bus driver. He met the complainant, a twenty year old woman with some intellectual disability, some days prior to the offence. On that occasion they had spoken and the applicant asked the complainant for her telephone number which she gave to him. On 28 February the complainant was waiting at a bus stop in Castle Hill after finishing her adult education class. The applicant was driving a bus which he stopped at the bus stop and asked the complainant where she was going. The applicant said he would take the complainant home so she boarded the bus and sat behind him. 
     
      
    4 The bus was driven along its usual route which terminated at the Blacktown terminal. After all of the passengers had alighted the applicant told the complainant to stay on the bus. He then drove a short distance so that he could use a toilet and then drove and parked near the local park. He closed and locked the bus doors. He started eating a meal and asked the complainant to sit next to him. When he finished the meal he told her that he had stitches in his leg and would show them to her. He pulled down his pants and underpants. She could see his penis. He showed her an area on his inner left thigh where she saw an area of red scarring. He pulled up his pants and said they should move to the front of the bus because there were too many people around. Near the front of the bus he sat on the floor and asked the complainant to sit with him but she declined. He took hold of her wrist, pulled her to the floor and said, “kiss me, baby, kiss me, honey”. She did not want to and said she did not know how to kiss. He said he would teach her and tried to kiss her but she kept moving away. He put his hand under shirt and bra and touched her breasts. She said, “Stop, I don’t want to do this, I’m scared.” He told her not to be scared, that he loved her and she loved him. She pushed him away. He then took out his penis and masturbated until he ejaculated. 
     
      
    5 The applicant then untied the drawstring to the victim’s pants and put his hand inside her pants and her underpants. He touched her vaginal area until she grabbed his hand and forced it out of her pants and underpants. He put his hand back inside her pants and she again grabbed his arm and moved his hand out of her pants. He pulled her pants down slightly, put his face against her vaginal area and kissed her there a number of times. She told him to stop and that she did not want to do that. He told her that it was all right, that he loved her and she loved him. She asked him when he had to go back to work and he said “soon”. He got up, kissed her on the cheek and went to the driver’s seat. He asked her where she wanted to go and she said to Blacktown station. The applicant then drove her to the station. She subsequently complained and reported the incident.  
     
      
    6 There was a report tendered at the sentencing hearing which indicated that the complainant had a level of intellectual functioning in the moderate range of intellectual disability. The evidence indicates that the offence has had an adverse effect upon the complainant. 
     
      
    7 The applicant has filed a notice of appeal in which he seeks to raise six grounds. Apart from a ground in which leave is sought to adduce what is said to be fresh evidence the grounds effectively argue that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. I will come back to those in a moment. In relation to ground 3, the fresh evidence ground, the applicant seeks to tender a report of Dr Andrew Frukacz, a consultant psychiatrist, which has been obtained since the sentencing hearing. In my opinion this Court must reject that report. The applicant was assessed before he was sentenced and advised in relation to his rights with respect to seeking medical advice in relation to any psychiatric problems which he had and the opportunity for a report to be placed before the sentencing court. 
     
      
    8 The applicant in fact appears to have had some degree of mental problems before committing the offence but chose not to seek to bring psychiatric evidence before the Court on his sentencing hearing. The position is that the applicant had disclosed to the author of his pre-sentence report that he had feelings of depression and suicidal thoughts. Those comments were reported to the sentencing judge. It included the fact that the applicant had taken some antidepressant medication, for a short period of time but found that it provided no difference to his mood and consequently he ceased taking it. 
     
      
    9 The principles in relation to the admission by this Court of fresh evidence have been discussed in a number of decisions including Iglesias v R (2006) NSWCCA 261 and Springer v R [2007] NSWCCA 289, 117 A Crim R 13. The material proffered to this Court is not material which falls within the principles defined in those cases and must be rejected. 
     
      
    10 With respect to the sentence itself it is plain that her Honour in sentencing concluded that the objective factors in relation to the offence put it at a high level of seriousness. Her Honour said that the offence fell “well above the mid range of objective seriousness”. That expression is appropriate when a judge is sentencing for an offence which carries a standard non-parole period. Otherwise, the use of that language carries with it a significant risk that the sentencing judge will breach the principles laid down in Markarian (2005) 228 CLR 367. In that case the High Court was concerned to emphasise that sentencing is not a two stage process, rather a sentencing judge is required to identify the facts which inform the circumstances of the offence, sometimes called objective matters, and also the matters personal to the offender, the subjective matters. Having identified all of those matters the judge is required to determine the appropriate sentence. Of course, with the introduction of standard non-parole periods a slightly different task is required and the sentencing judge is by the statute required to define the objective seriousness of the offence before considering, having regard to other matters, the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    11 In the present case although her Honour’s use of the language appropriate when sentencing for offences which carry a standard non-parole period was inappropriate there can be no doubt that this was a serious offence. When consideration is also given to the matter on the form 1 a sentence towards the upper level of the maximum provided by the legislature was, unless there were particularly significant subjective matters, inevitable. 
     
      
    12 The subjective matters were considered by the sentencing judge and in my opinion her Honour was correct in forming the view that there was not evidence which would justify a sentence less than the sentence which her Honour ultimately imposed.  
     
      
    13 A separate ground, ground four, which the applicant seeks to raise, is concerned with the impact of the sentence upon the applicant’s wife and children. To my mind there is nothing in those circumstances which would justify the sentencing court taking the exceptional course of providing a lesser sentence because of the circumstances of the applicant’s relatives. It was suggested in ground five that her Honour failed to property consider the alternatives to full time custody. Her Honour expressly referred to this matter and in my view was correct to decide that there was no possibility of avoiding a sentence of full time custody in the present case. The other ground sought to be raised is that her Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the prior good character of the applicant given the circumstances of the offence and of the offender. To my mind the applicant’s previous good record was of little moment in the sentencing for these particular offences. I am of the view that her Honour in imposing the sentence which she did imposed a sentence which was entirely within her sentencing discretion. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

    1 GROVE J: I agree with R A Hulme J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.3 R A HULME J: The applicant was sentenced on the 21 November 2008 by Woods ADCJ in the District Court at Dubbo for two offences of supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. These are offences against s 25(1) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units.4 The applicant had been convicted after jury trial in respect of the offence committed first in time but had pleaded guilty to the second offence.5 The sentences imposed were imprisonment for 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months dating from 3 September 2008 (for the second offence) and imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years dating from 3 September 2010 (for the first offence). The overall sentence was one of 8 years with an effective non-parole period of 6 years. The applicant is eligible for release on parole on 2 September 2014.Facts6 The sentencing judge recounted the facts relating to the offences as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The offender was a truck driver and on 10 August 2006 he was seen by police leaving a house in Dubbo which had been under police surveillance. The police followed his vehicle, a prime mover and when he stopped at the Ampol Service Station they spoke to him and searched his truck and found quantities of the drug which was later sent to the analytical laboratories and certified to be methylamphetamine with a total quantity of 51.26 grams. The total amount was found in different amounts and packaging. 
           
           
          The police also found other items, including a supply of clear plastic bags, a set of scales and also in the briefcase with the drugs was an amount of $2000 in cash, in $50 notes all nearly bundled. 
           
           
          At the time he stated to police that all the drugs were for his own use and that he had not had time to split up the amount of drugs into small convenient lots for use when needed. He also said that it was common for truck drivers to purchase a large amount of the drugs because of the cost and then to split it up into the smaller needs. This defence was also presented to the jury in the trial and it included his comments that because of the heavy demands on truck drivers and to keep the schedules and to keep their job they had to work long hours to keep their jobs and, therefore, most truck drivers used drugs to stay awake for the long hours needed on the road. 
           
           
          Following the trial the jury found him guilty of the supply of prohibited drugs and for this purpose they considered the deeming provision for the supply of drugs in section 29 of the act. 
           
           
          The further facts are that seven weeks after the first apprehension already noted above, on 29 September 2006, while he was on bail, thus conditional liberty for the earlier offence, the offender was again stopped by police, this time whilst driving a utility motor vehicle in Baird Street, Dubbo and when the police searched the offender and the vehicle they found various quantities and packaging of drugs which was later sent to the analytical laboratories and certified to be methylamphetamine with a total quantity of 67 grams. There was also found on that occasion a quantity of clear resealable plastic bags and scales. 
           
           
          On this occasion he said to the police that the amount of the drugs was partly for his own use but also for a couple of other drivers who had given him the money to obtain drugs for them. He pleaded guilty to this count when the matter came before the court for trial on 27 September 2007 and the matter for sentence was then adjourned pending the trial on the other count”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    Subjective features7 The applicant was born in September 1971 so at the time of the offences he was aged 34 - 35 and at the time of sentence he was aged 37.8 He has a criminal history but it is confined to traffic offences committed in 1990 and 1991 for which fines and relatively short periods of disqualification were imposed.9 He was raised and educated in the Quirindi area and upon leaving school he completed a motor mechanics apprenticeship. He then moved to Dubbo where he became married. The marriage produced three children but subsequently broke down.10 The applicant spent most of his working life as a long distance truck driver. He described to Mr Philip Nolan, psychologist, that the work was highly demanding and he drove long hours but it was financially rewarding.11 After his arrest for the second offence the applicant was remanded in custody until he was granted bail on 16 November 2006. It was a condition of the bail that he reside with his parents in Quirindi and not engage in employment in the truck driving industry. The applicant secured employment as a mechanic at a feedlot in the Quirindi area and, although he experienced a significant reduction in his income, he told Mr Nolan that he was happy in that employment and saw it as an opportunity to rebuild his life.12 The applicant had a history of amphetamine use. He claimed that this commenced because of the scheduling demands placed upon him in his work. He had three serious accidents driving trucks, one in 2002 near Dirranbandi, another in 2003 near Gatton and a further accident near Goondiwindi in 2004. In relation to the latter he had fallen asleep at the wheel of his truck and rolled the vehicle. He was off work for a period of 18 months as a result of his injuries. He continued, however, to use amphetamines during that period. On returning to work in 2006 he undertook shorter journeys for a time and stopped using drugs but upon resumption of long haul routes he re-commenced using amphetamines because of his fear of falling asleep and experiencing another accident.13 He told Mr Nolan that since the 2004 accident he had experienced recurrent nightmares and flashbacks. He also had symptoms of anxiety and depression which were confirmed in testing conducted by Mr Nolan in March and May 2007.14 It is pertinent to note the following in Mr Nolan’s report of 16 July 2007 in relation to the applicant’s drug use: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the information Mr Quayle has given me, his drug use was mostly situational. He does not apparently have a past history of drug use. He admitted that he continued to use amphetamines while he was off work during 2005. This appears to be the only period he has been involved in substance abuse outside his work as a driver. Mr Quayle’s main justification for the drug use was to function when driving. Using drugs while off work is inconsistent with this rationalisation. In my opinion, the fact that he used drugs during the period he was off work suggests he may have been either psychologically or physically dependent on them at the time. Stresses at the time arose from his work injuries and marital stress. Since his being charged with the current matters he has not used any illegal substances. He smokes and drinks alcohol occasionally.” 
        
       
      
    15 Mr Nolan continued by expressing the opinion that there was a minimal risk that the applicant would return to drug use in any situation other than long distance driving. He said that the applicant’s history suggested that drug use was associated only with that employment and that his current lifestyle gave no suggestion of addiction or dependency problems in any aspect of his life.16 The psychometric tests administered by Mr Nolan in conjunction with his clinical evaluation yielded a diagnosis that the applicant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and that, given the symptoms had a duration in excess of three months, the condition was classified as chronic. Mr Nolan observed, however, that the symptom level and degree of debilitation indicated that this was in the “mild to moderate” rather than “severe” range. Mr Nolan added that the applicant had shown improvement as at the date of his report and that, with support, should continue to do so.17 Mr Nolan was not engaged initially for the purpose of preparing a report for use in the sentencing proceedings. The applicant had sought him out by himself and there was a subsequent referral by his general practitioner under a mental health plan for ongoing psychological treatment.18 There was other evidence before the sentencing judge which confirmed the applicant’s abstention from drug use since his second arrest. A Probation and Parole Officer who prepared a Pre Sentence Report in March 2007 stated that enquiries of an alcohol and other drugs worker had indicated that the applicant had attended eight sessions of counselling which were directed to establishing strategies to address relapse prevention. He also reported that the applicant’s then current employer and the applicant’s partner had observed no indications of continued drug use.19 As part of that Probation and Parole Officer’s conclusions he indicated that he saw little need for intervention by his Service given that the applicant had no significant record, that he had removed himself from the employment that brought about his involvement with drugs, and that he had already sought relevant counselling.20 A second Pre Sentence Report of November 2008 included that the applicant claimed that he had continued to avoid drug use, had been attending drug and alcohol counselling in Tamworth and that regular urinalysis sampling had not detected any drugs in his system. The author of that report expressed concern that the applicant had minimised his involvement in the supply of drugs, claiming that the drugs were primarily for his own use but also to “help out some friends”. It was that officer’s opinion that the applicant was suitable for a “medium” level of intervention by his Service and that supervision would involve addressing drug relapse prevention and monitoring illicit drug usage through urinalysis testing.21 Pathology reports were before the judge which indicated that in respect of tests conducted in July and November 2007 and January, February and July 2008, no prohibited drugs were detected.22 Also before the judge were a number of testimonials which attested to the high regard with which the applicant was held both in his employment and generally within the Quirindi community.23 The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. He confirmed that he had not used drugs since his second arrest in September 2006. He also confirmed that he had no intention of returning to long distance truck driving. In that regard he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No way in the world. I’ve had three accidents, a divorce, a gaol term and it has turned me right off that industry whatsoever. I just don’t want to have nothing to do with them.” 
        
       
      
    24 The applicant also confirmed that since returning to live at Quirindi, although he was not doing as well financially, he was happier because of the improvement in his quality of life, having weekends off, being home every night, and being able to spend time with his family and his children.25 The applicant’s mother gave evidence in which she confirmed that the applicant had “changed dramatically with the help of the counsellors, the psychologists” and that undertaking the counselling program with the local health service had been something carried out at the applicant’s own initiative.26 The applicant’s current partner and the manager of the feedlot also gave evidence that supported the case made for the applicant concerning his rehabilitation.27 None of the evidence led or produced on behalf of the applicant was the subject of any contest by the Crown. Indeed it was submitted on behalf of the Crown immediately after the conclusion of the oral evidence that: 
     
      
       
        
        “I might say now, to assist I might say, there is authority to say where there is demonstrated rehabilitation, even in drug matters, where to imprison someone full-time would nullify that rehabilitation, that is exceptional circumstances. The Crown doesn’t cavil with the evidence this man led.” 
        
       
      
    Sentencing remarks28 The case advanced on behalf of the applicant in the District Court was to the effect that he had undergone such a significant degree of rehabilitation in the two years prior to sentence that the case should be regarded as exceptional and that although a sentence of imprisonment had to be imposed it should be ordered to be served by way of periodic detention. 29 The Crown’s response was neutral. At the conclusion of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant the Crown representative made further reference to the need for there to be exceptional circumstances in order to justify a sentence other than full-time imprisonment. There was reference to cases which were said to be authority for a proposition that there could be exceptional circumstances if there was a demonstrated process of rehabilitation that would be nullified by the imposition of a full-time custodial sentence. However the judge’s attention was also drawn to the fact that before him were two discrete offences and that the applicant had been supplying to other truck drivers who were on the road for lengthy hours thereby putting other road users at risk.30 Immediately following his survey of the facts the sentencing judge made reference to the judgment of Howie J, with whom Grove and Simpson JJ agreed, in Regina v Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104 in which his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “27 …There has been a consistent line of authority in this Court that has made it quite clear that, unless there are truly exceptional circumstances present, a full-time custodial sentence ought to be imposed wherever the offender has been substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs; see  
        R v Blanco 
         (NSWCCA, unreported, 22 October 1987). It applies whether or not the offender has made a profit from the supply of drugs and a profit is an aggravating circumstance:  
        R v Clarke 
         (NSWCCA, unreported, 15 March 1990). Efforts at reform and rehabilitation since the offending will not generally be regarded as amounting to exceptional circumstances:  
        R v Thompson 
         (NSWCCA, unreported, 4 April 1994). The policy behind this line of authority has been held to be a rule to which sentencing judges must give serious consideration:  
        R v Cacciola 
         (1998) 104 A Crim R 178. It has been most recently referred to by Hulme J in  
        R v Harmouche 
         [2005] NSWCCA 398. 
        
       
      
    31 The judge made reference to the harm to the community that drugs cause. He said that the applicant being “able to access such a large amount of drugs of such high quality does suggest a degree of planning”. He “noted” the efforts that the applicant had made in respect of rehabilitation, and referred to some of the evidence on that topic, but concluded that the circumstances were not so exceptional as to permit anything other than a full-time custodial sentence being imposed. That finding has not been challenged in these proceedings.32 The judge reiterated the need for general deterrence and also stated that a custodial sentence was required as a deterrent to the applicant himself. He also concluded that the two offences were quite separate and distinct which warranted a degree of accumulation. 33 The judge made reference to the applicant’s expression of regret for his actions but said that this appeared to be more regret for the predicament that the applicant found himself in and the effect it had upon his family rather than a regret concerning the effect “generally on society that the supply of drugs may cause”. 34 The only matter of mitigation about which the judge made a definitive finding was the applicant’s plea of guilty in respect of the second offence. He concluded that the utilitarian value of that plea warranted a reduction of the sentence for that offence of 25 per cent.35 Statistics in relation to sentencing for this offence maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales were placed before the judge. In respect of these the judge stated that “statistics are a blunt tool” and that in his view they could not determine the appropriate sentence in a particular case. He noted the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years and then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “(T)he tariffs of sentences ordered range generally between one and four years which, considering how destructive these drugs can be within society, do seem to be very low tariffs”.  
        
       
      
    36 The judge did not make any direct finding as to the objective seriousness of the offences apart from observing that each was a case of possession deemed to be for the purpose of supply and “cannot be seen as at the top end of seriousness”. 37 The applicant was remanded in custody at the conclusion of the trial in respect of the first of the offences on 16 October 2008. The judge noted that he had previously spent some time in custody prior to being released on bail which he referred to as a period of 44 days. In fact, the applicant had gone into custody following his arrest on 29 September 2006 and was released on bail on 16 November 2006, a period of 49 days. Accordingly there was an error in backdating the sentence to 3 September 2008. The first sentence should have been ordered to date from 29 August 2008.The appeal38 In a notice of intention to appeal filed on 30 September 2009 the following grounds of appeal are notified: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1 
        : The learned sentencing judge did not take into account, or did not properly or sufficiently take into account, some matters which amounted to “special circumstances” under section 44(2) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999 
         
         
        Ground 2 
        : The learned sentencing judge sentenced the applicant by first setting the total sentence for each offence, and then determining the non-parole period, in beach of section 44(1) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999 
         
         
        Ground 3 
        : The learned sentencing judge commenced his assessment of the appropriate penalty for each offence with the same starting point of a six year total term, when in fact the criminality involved in each offence was different 
         
         
        Ground 4 
        : The learned sentencing judge did not take into account, when determining the length of the non-parole period and the period on parole that the applicant was suffering from a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder 
         
         
        Ground 5 
        : The learned sentencing judge wrongly took into account, as an aggravating feature under section 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        , that there was “a degree of planning” in the offences 
         
         
        Ground 6 
        : The learned sentencing judge failed to assess the evidence in the trial and reach his own view of the facts upon which he would sentence the applicant 
         
         
        Ground 7 
        : The learned sentencing judge failed to take into account the fact that there had been a significant delay (more than two years) between the commission of the offences and the time of sentence, coupled with significant rehabilitation by the applicant 
         
         
        Ground 8 
        : The learned sentencing judge did not take into account, or did not sufficiently take into account, the fact that the applicant had been required to abide by onerous bail conditions up until his conviction 
         
         
        Ground 9 
        : The learned sentencing judge did not adequately take into account the applicant’s remorse and acceptance of responsibility 
         
         
        Ground 10 
        : The sentences were too severe 
        
       
      
    39 I propose to deal only briefly with grounds one to nine, as my conclusion is that the sentences are manifestly excessive.40 The essence of the complaint under Ground 1 is that there was material capable of amounting to “special circumstances” and that the judge should have made such a finding and reduced the proportion of the sentences represented by the non-parole period. The matters alluded to were the applicant’s rehabilitation in the two years preceding sentence; his need for an extended period of supervision on parole; the fact that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder; and the accumulation of the two sentences. Clearly the judge found special circumstances, although he did not use that term, in respect of the accumulation of sentences because he made an adjustment to the non-parole period in respect of the second sentence so that the overall sentence conformed with the statutory ratio. The judge did not at any stage make reference in terms to special circumstances. Indeed it was not submitted on the applicant’s behalf that such a finding should be made. The primary submission made before the judge on behalf of the applicant was that he should order that a sentence of imprisonment be served by way of periodic detention. However, that did not preclude a submission being made that special circumstances should be found.41 It is difficult to say that a judge was in error for not doing something that he or she was not asked to do. A finding that there are, or are not, special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact: see R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25 per Howie J at [103]. In a case in which there are compelling circumstances for making such a finding, and the judge is in fact asked to do so, one might expect that if the judge declines to do so he or she would provide reasons: R v Novakovic [2004] NSWCCA 437 at [39] per Sully J. Cf R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 2001 53 NSWLR 704 Spigelman CJ at [86]-[88]. It is unnecessary to express a concluded view about this ground because of the conclusion I have reached in relation to the total sentences themselves.42 There is no merit in Ground 2. Section 44(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the Court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).” 
        
       
      
    43 Whilst the judge referred to the total terms of imprisonment that he was going to impose when giving reasons for the partial accumulation that he had in mind and the reduction for the plea of guilty for the second of the offences, when he came to announce the sentences he announced them in accordance with the legislative requirement.44 In relation to Ground 3 it was submitted that the second offence had an aggravating feature (the applicant was on conditional liberty) that was not present in relation to the first offence. It was submitted that as a consequence by assessing the starting point at six years for both offences the starting point for the first offence must have been too high. True it is that the second offence had that aggravating feature and a distinction might well have been made for that reason. Apart from the conditional liberty aspect the circumstances of the two offences were largely indistinguishable.45 In respect of Ground 4 it was contended that the fact that the applicant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder should have led to a reduction of the total term in respect of both of the offences. It was submitted that the fact that the applicant was suffering from “a mental disorder was relevant and potentially significant” and that accordingly the judge was “obliged to take it into account”. I have earlier referred to the opinion of the psychologist that the symptom level and degree of debilitation caused to the applicant by the post-traumatic stress disorder was in the “mild to moderate rather than severe range”. There was no material upon which it could be concluded that the applicant’s post-traumatic stress disorder was relevant in any of the ways referred to in the authorities, see for example R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]. Moreover there was no submission made to the judge that he should take into account this factor in the way now asserted. Indeed the relevance of this factor was confined to the issue of the rehabilitation of the applicant.46 Ground 5 asserts that the judge erred in taking into account as an aggravating feature under s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that there was “a degree of planning in the offences.” This assertion overstates the position. As I have earlier indicated, the judge referred to an aspect that “suggested” a degree of planning. Aside from that observation he did not make a finding beyond reasonable doubt that “the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity” (s 21A(2)(n)). I am not satisfied that error is disclosed.47 In relation to Ground 6 the complaint is that the judge did not make a definitive finding as to the applicant’s motivation and role in regard to the supply of the drugs in question. The judge did make reference to the applicant having told the police that the drugs that were in his possession on the first occasion were all for his own use and to him telling the police on the second occasion that the drugs were partly for his own use and partly for provision to other truck drivers. Clearly, in respect of the applicant’s explanation in respect of the first offence the jury were not satisfied on the balance of probabilities. Whilst the judge did not purport to make any explicit finding of fact as to the applicant’s role in the supply of drugs, the clear inference is that he sentenced in respect of both offences on the basis of the explanation given by the applicant on the second occasion, that is that the drugs were partly for his own use and partly for provision to other drivers. There is no suggestion of the judge finding that the applicant was involved for motives of financial gain. Indeed in the course of the judge’s reference to s 21A he made no reference to 21A(2)(o) (“the offence was committed for financial gain”).48 Ground 7 complains that the judge failed to take into account the delay of in excess of two years between the offences and the time of sentence and the rehabilitation the applicant had undergone in that period. It is not so much the delay that was noteworthy in this case but rather the significant progress in terms of rehabilitation that the applicant had made in the intervening period. This is something that the judge “noted” in the context of considering whether there were exceptional circumstances for imposing something other than a full-time custodial sentence. He referred to it in no other context. In my view it was a matter of particular significance in the assessment of sentence.49 Ground 8 complains that the judge did not take into account that the applicant had been required to abide by “onerous bail conditions” up until his conviction. A submission was made to the judge concerning the process of rehabilitation that the applicant had undergone and in that context reference was made to the applicant having been on bail for “quite a long period of time”. It was not submitted to the judge that this should be taken into account in the terms for which the applicant now contends. There is no evidence that would support a finding that the bail conditions were particularly onerous. Indeed, the applicant gave evidence that he had been happy in the lifestyle that he had been able to lead whilst he was on bail in terms of his work, his ability to see his children on a regular basis, and in terms of his current relationship. There is no merit in this ground.50 The final specific error raised in the grounds of appeal is that the judge did not adequately take into account the applicant’s remorse and acceptance of responsibility. The judge said that whilst the applicant had expressed regret for his actions, it appeared to be more regret for what he had got himself into and how it had affected his family. This was a finding of fact which was well open to his Honour to have made. The applicant’s evidence that he regretted being a supplier of drugs did not necessarily establish that he had accepted responsibility for his actions and had acknowledged the harm that his actions had caused (s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). Moreover the judge had the advantage of having seen the applicant give evidence both at the trial and in the sentence proceedings and so he was well equipped to determine whether the applicant was genuinely remorseful.51 I indicated earlier my view that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. My reasons for that conclusion are as follows.52 At the time of sentence the applicant was 37 years old. He had no record of previous convictions of any significance. It was open on the evidence before the judge to find, although he did not find, that the applicant was a person of good character, was unlikely to re-offend, and had good prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(e)(f)(g) and (h)). A powerful case of rehabilitation was made out by the applicant and it is of considerable significance that he had been self-motivated in seeking out the psychological counselling that had assisted him in overcoming a drug dependence of some years standing. He had found worthwhile productive employment, was in a committed relationship and had strong family support.53 Against those matters, however, it has to be recognised that the offences themselves were of significant seriousness in that on the first occasion the applicant was in possession for the purpose of supply of 51.26g of methylamphetamine and, on the second occasion, 67g of that drug. As the judge correctly noted, the trafficable quantity for methylamphetamine is 3.0g and the commercial quantity is 0.25kg. It is a matter of some significance in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence that the applicant was a user of drugs himself and that there was no evidence upon which it could be concluded beyond reasonable doubt that there was supply for commercial or financial gain.54 It was open to the sentencing judge to allow a reduction of 25 per cent for the applicant’s plea of guilty to the second offence. Against that, however, was the fact that this offence was committed whilst he was on bail for the first offence.55 I have not arrived at my conclusion concerning the severity of the sentences by a review of other cases and the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics but they have confirmed it.56 Cases such as R v Fathers, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal NSW, 31 August 1994; R v Langdon, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 November 1996; R v Brown [1999] NSWCCA 349; R v Kenny [2000] NSWCCA 92; R v Busuttil [2000] NSWCCA 383; R v Groat [2001] NSWCCA 452; R v Holden [2002] NSWCCA 397; R v Galati [2003] NSWCCA 148; R v Emanuel [2004] NSWCCA 267; and R v Garner [2009] NSWCCA 79; clearly demonstrate that the sentences imposed in the present case were out of all proportion to the gravity of the offences even without a consideration of the powerful subjective case advanced on behalf of the applicant. I do not propose to review the details of each of these cases but will cite two examples. 57 In R v Kenny the offender was found in possession of 58g of methylamphetamine. He admitted having dealt in the drug in the past. He was characterised as a “user/dealer”. He pleaded guilty and had no previous convictions. A sentence of 2 years with a non-parole period of 12 months was reduced on appeal to 18 months with a non-parole period of 6 months.58 In R v Galati the offender was found to be in possession of 22.75g of methylamphetamine and 19.04g of ecstasy. He was also in possession of other drugs and a number of weapons which were the basis of offences listed on a Form 1. Whilst on bail in respect of those offences he was found to be in possession of 36.88g of methylamphetamine. He was on conditional liberty at the time of all of the offences. It was found that he had been running a business selling drugs. He had a history of drug and alcohol addiction and previous convictions for a variety of offences including 14 drug offences. He had been previously imprisoned. The aggregate sentence imposed was one of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years.59 The sentencing statistics that were placed before the judge and were referred to again in this Court indicate that the individual sentences imposed upon the applicant were at the upper end of the range of sentences that have been imposed in a period of approximately seven years prior to the date of sentence. The statistical database is large enough (805 cases) for these statistics to be significance even whilst acknowledging the well recognised limitations: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [59] and R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 per Spigelman CJ at 739.60 The statistics indicate that of the 47 per cent of offenders who received a sentence of full-time imprisonment, the median sentence was 2 years 6 months; 80 per cent of offenders received a sentence between 18 months and 4 years; and a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years is in the top 3 per cent of all sentences imposed. Where there was a plea of guilty, a sentence of 4 years 6 months is in the top 6 per cent.61 The conclusion I have reached is that the sentences should be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced.  
     
      
    62 Annexed to an affidavit of the applicant’s solicitor there is a report of Ms Claire Wood, psychologist, which was filed for consideration in the event the Court came to re-sentence. It confirms much of the material that was before the District Court but also that the applicant has continued in his progress towards rehabilitation since being sentenced. He has complied with correctional centre discipline, has participated in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation group and has “reconnected” with the values instilled in him during his formative years by regularly attending church and bible studies. Ms Wood reports, however, that the applicant is still experiencing various symptoms of the post traumatic stress disorder that had been diagnosed by Mr Nolan. He also exhibits mild anxiety and moderate levels of depression. Ms Wood notes that whilst treatment is available in the correctional centre environment it is not as consistent as it might be within the community. Her opinion is to the effect that a longer period in the community under parole supervision would assist and accelerate the applicant’s recovery.63 I propose a degree of partial accumulation of the sentences to reflect the fact that they were distinct occasions of offending seven weeks apart.  
     
      
    64 I propose that the starting point for the sentence for the offence of 29 September 2009 be more than for the offence of 10 August 2009 to reflect the fact that is was committed whilst the applicant was on bail. However I am also of the view that the reduction of in the order of twenty-five per cent for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea to that offence should be maintained. 65 There are special circumstances for reducing the proportion of the overall sentence represented by the non-parole period. Not only is this because of the partial accumulation but also for the reasons advanced by Ms Wood.Orders66 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2. Allow the appeal. 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and re-sentence as follows: 
       
       
        
        For the offence of 29 September 2008, sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 12 months. That sentence is to commence on 29 August 2008. The non-parole period expires 28 February 2010. The total term will expire 28 February 2011. 
         
         
        For the offence of 10 August 2008, sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 18 months. That sentence is to date from 29 November 2008. I direct the release of the applicant on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 28 May 2010. Parole is to be subject to the supervision prescribed by the regulations under the  
        Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 
         1999. The total sentence will expire on 28 November 2011.

   THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONCRIMINAL LISTADAMS JFRIDAY 6 JUNE 20082008/01 - Regina v Shaun Troy SLATERSENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The accused is charged with the murder of Rodney Graham Smith on 23 March 2007. To that charge he has pleaded not guilty. There is no doubt, and the accused has from the beginning admitted, that he killed Mr Smith intending to do so. The question is whether he is not guilty by virtue of his mental illness. 
     
      
    2 Psychiatric evidence has been led in the form of reports by both the Crown and the defence. The doctors, all of whom are experienced forensic psychiatrists, well-aware of the elements of the defence, have concluded with certainty that at the time he killed Mr Smith the accused was mentally ill in the sense that he was unable to understand that his actions were wrong. It is necessary to refer briefly to the facts and to the medical opinions but the question is not susceptible of doubt: the facts tragically reflect that Mr Smith was killed when and because the accused was gravely mentally disturbed, suffering from delusions including paranoia and a psychotic state which completely prevented him from having any rational understanding of the moral quality of what he was doing. This does not mean that he was altogether devoid of reason; for example, he was aware that his acts would have the effect of killing Mr Smith; he was aware after Mr Smith's death that he should contact the police; he was aware that it would be distressing for Mr Smith's young son, who was at school at the time, to come home and see his father's body. But the awareness of these things existed in what in lay terms I might say was a mad world created by his illness and linked only tenuously to the reality of what he had done. 
     
      
    3 The killing was discovered by police following a telephone call at 9.15am on 23 March 2007 made by the accused from the deceased's home. That conversation is in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “Accused: 'I have just killed someone at 51 King Creek Road, Wauchope. I will wait for the police.'  
         
         
        Bryant: 'What is your name?'  
         
         
        Accused: 'Shaun Slater.'  
         
         
        Bryant: 'What's happened?' 
         
         
        Accused: 'A knife has gone into his heart and he is not breathing.' 
         
         
        Bryant: 'I will send an ambulance. Who is he?' 
         
         
        Accused: 'Rod Smith.'

        Accused: '65861861.'  
         
         
        Bryant: 'Is anyone else there?' 
         
         
        Accused: 'No, I want you here before his kid comes home from school and sees him.' 
         
         
        Bryant: 'How did this happen?' 
         
         
        Accused: 'Just get here. I will wait.'""  
        
       
      
      
    4 Police and ambulances were immediately sent to the house. When they arrived the accused was on the verandah drinking tea. He said later that he wanted to show the police that he did not wish to be violent towards them.  
     
      
    5 In the ensuing interview with police, despite the apparent rationality of the telephone conversation, it very quickly emerged that the accused was still floridly psychotic. Indeed, his condition was so bad that there was little significant improvement even after he was incarcerated and given psychiatric help for some weeks.  
     
      
    6 The accused had a history of mental illness which appeared to be controlled by medication. About eight months before the killing he ceased to take it, saying that he felt just the same when he took the medication as when he did not and that the medication caused him to lose his clarity of thinking. By clarity he meant that he was unable to hear clearly the voices of the three persons, whom he believed to be Buddhist angels who habitually spoke to him, though they were invisible to others, and he was also unable to think clearly about understanding his important status in the universe in the fight for good.  
     
      
    7 The accused came to believe that Mr Smith was drugging him and he told the police that he believed that he had put the drug into his coffee. I take up what can only be loosely described as a narrative:  
     
      
       
        
        “And then just the other day I came in, I got, got half a bottle of coke out of the frig and not so bad because he must have been running out of it [the drug] or something because it didn't affect me in the same way and that was the only two occasions that happened and I thought well, what do you do if you are laying in bed and you are drugged and why am I even drugged? Because I don't take them any more and if you test my blood supply you will probably see that it's not really in me any more, that stuff, because I haven't taken it for eight or nine months and you, you may even be able to test the coffee that I - I tipped most of it out and I just kept using it but you may have, vapours of it may have gone through into the coffee in the frig. I don't know. I am not a forensic scientist.  
         
         
        Q. Mr Slater did you kill Rod Smith this morning? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. How did you kill him?  
         
        A. Knife. 
         
         
        Q. Tell me what you did?  
         
        A. I walked up to him. I said 'Why didn't you speak to me about my father calling me, you know?', and he starts playing all these games with me and then I just went 'That's enough' and then we had a tussle on the floor and I tried to, well I wasn't really trying to kill him, I just, just got him around the throat and just pulled on him hard. I thought is that scaring you, you bastard, and, and anyway he is like, he wasn't begging for his life or anything and he was sort of quite lucid in many ways and because I was reasonably calm, I have never done this before, but but then calm. I mean how do you explain what calm is and, and yeah, and then I left him and then he played dead, like as a joke, you know, and then he is like totally motionless, so I walk, walked away and, and I walked away from him and I, yeah, that's right, I was brushing my teeth, so I got rid of the stuff out of me mouth and then I came back and he was starting to, he just did two little nods with his head to see if I was - I went, oh yeah, you done two little nods of your head, have you, and and so then I strangled him around the throat again. You know I thought well, that doesn't make him die, bastard, so then I went and got the kitchen knife because he, his main joke was stabbing Shaun with it every day, you know? That was his - he didn't say it but whenever he used it he would seductively suggest as he, you know, did work with the knife in the presence of another person and so that was the knife I used on him but you know I walked, I went and sat down, I had a chat with him about, about what I had noticed about how he used to look at his son because his son used to piss him off. He used to test him a fair bit. I mean this is all, I mean someone could say this is hearsay, but as far as I am concerned it's not hearsay at all, because if a man plans you know taking his kid and chucking him on a tree and then laying the bike there and going well, fuck, he has gone sort of thing, because his father had a shoot out years ago, right, and he had a big head about these guys ripping off his door, so the kid grew up you know - they were Christian kind, full contact boys and so they also had this fascination about being a man and not being afraid of death and facing all this stuff and all that and probably not being afraid to enact all these little different things and and, so yeah, that was one of his little things about his son and he probably would never have done it, I don't think he would've ever done it but I didn't, I actually didn't like the way he looked at his son. I mean who would?  
         
         
        Q. Tell me Mr Slater about how you stabbed Mr Smith this morning? 
         
        A. Well I stabbed him in the leg because he was being a cheeky prick. I went well, look at that, and I was looking at his mind and listening to him and he was talking, you know, about this and that and I'm looking at the darkness in his eyes and I'm saying I'm not really hearing you loving me. I guess I was judging his character in an extreme circumstance. I don't know how to be much more extreme than that and I found him quite lacking as a person in that conversation I had with him.” 
        
       
      
      
       
      There is much else along the same lines. I refer to one other small passage:  
       
       
        
        [After the second choking] ""We just started talking. I started discussing a few things that I really didn't really want to talk about. 
         
         
        Q. Okay, did he say anything, like are you able to tell me what he said? You were talking about these things - was Mr Smith talking as well? Well what, can you tell me what he was saying?  
         
        A. He said the band aid statement and...he said a couple of other things. I am not quite; he, he started talking. I remember saying 'You probably think I'm listening to you but I am not' like, like it's, I am using your time up with me talking - that was his joke and, and I thought well I've only got time. 
         
         
        Q. When you stabbed Mr Smith in the leg did he react like, like did he call out, did he scream out or-- 
         
        A. He didn't. He didn't become hysterical or he didn't - he looked callous and the darkness in his eyes, I mentioned that. I said 'Oh you have got the darkness in your eyes looking at me, haven't you?', and I said 'I am not hearing the love speaking...'.""  
        
       
      
    8 Without going into detail, it is evident that Mr Smith befriended the accused and that the accused lived with him for some time as a boarder paying rent it may be, but I think it is obvious that Mr Smith acted largely out of charity. That adds an additional layer of sadness to the circumstances here.  
     
      
    9 I have mentioned that the accused had been mentally ill for some years and that his illness had largely been controlled by medication. In the few months before this event it became increasingly obvious to those who had communication with the accused that he was becoming more and more detached from reality, and fears were held both by his father and a female acquaintance for his increasingly unsettled mental state. It appears that his father in the weeks before this event sought to get help for him from the medical resources available for the treatment of mentally ill people but his pleas were ignored. Had the situation of the accused been earlier understood and his medication been resumed this terrible thing may well not have happened.  
     
      
    10 The autopsy showed that Mr Smith died from the combined effect of the neck compression and a stab wound to the chest. These findings confirmed the accuracy of the admissions made by the accused to police as to how he had killed Mr Smith. 
     
      
    11 I have said that the doctors are agreed as to the state of mental ill health of the accused at the time of the killing. It is convenient for present purposes to cite the opinion of Dr Westmore, given after he examined the accused on 22 February 2008. This account is consistent with the opinions of the other doctors. After a brief account of the upbringing of the accused, which is unremarkable, Dr Westmore said as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Slater became mentally ill about approximately seven years ago. The treating psychiatrist, Dr Parsonage, diagnosed him as suffering an acute psychosis in 2002 and 2003 and he also had a history of depression. He had been treated with an antipsychotic and an antidepressant medication but about eight months prior to the matters now before the court he apparently stopped taking his medication.  
        
       
       
        
        The history is consistent with his mental health declining. The deceased was concerned about his mental health and his probable non-compliance with medication. The deceased asked him to leave the home which they shared. Mr Slater described delusional beliefs he had towards the deceased. He thought he was evil and he thought the deceased was placing a substance into his coffee, a white powder. He also believed the deceased had stolen money from him but he indicated that that money was rent Mr Slater owed the deceased.  
        
       
       
        
        Mr Slater indicated his actions towards the deceased were 'a spur of the moment thing'. They had argued earlier that day about Mr Slater's concerns that the deceased was not sending messages to Mr Slater from Mr Slater's father.  
        
       
       
        
        The justice health file confirmed that Mr Slater was mentally ill at the time he was incarcerated. He has fortunately responded to medication and  
        acute 
         symptoms of an auditory perceptual type and ideas of reference have now ceased [emphasis added]. He also has  
        increasing 
         insight into the wrongness of his actions when he killed the deceased [emphasis added].  
        
       
       
        
        Mr Slater has a mental illness defence available to him. He was suffering from a disease of the mind (acute psychosis of a schizophrenic type) which would have totally deprived him of his capacity to know that he ought not to act as he did towards the deceased. He had a defect of reasoning which arose from his mental illness.  
        
       
       
        
        As noted by Dr Nielssen he would by default also be eligible for the defence of substantial impairment but the correct defence in this case is, in my view, that of a mental illness because that is what he was suffering from at the time of the homicide.” 
        
       
      
      
    12 The defence of mental illness provided for in s38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 is a reflection of the common law which says, with some considerable good sense, as I think all thinking people acknowledge, that it is one thing when a crime is committed because a person is bad and another when it is committed because he or she is ill. Where persons do an act when they are suffering from a disease of the mind that causes them not to know the nature and quality of the act or that it is wrong, then they do not commit a crime. Here the tragic incidence of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, suffered by the accused for many years, which came about because of no fault of his and which has warped his life and his relationships, his abilities to communicate in a normal way with other people, and which led him increasingly to live in the mad universe of his own mind, a universe in which it became imperative for him to kill the deceased, demonstrates to my mind not only that the legal result from the defence of mental illness, namely, a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is inevitable but also that it is just..  13 Of course, I understand this can be no comfort whatever to the parents, the family and friends of the deceased who was killed because he did a kind and generous thing by the man towards whom he had been kind and generous. Nevertheless, it is perhaps something to know that he was not killed out of an act of wickedness but out of an act of madness. 14 Accordingly, I find the accused not guilty by virtue of mental illness. 15 I now turn to the appropriate order. Where a verdict of not guilty by virtue of mental illness is returned, s 39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 provides –  
     
      
       
        
        “39 Effect of finding and declaration of mental illness 
        
       
       
        
        (1) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the Court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the Court considers appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person’s release. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) As soon as practicable after the making of an order under this section, the Registrar of the Court is to notify the Minister for Health and the Tribunal of the terms of the order.” 
        
       
      
      
    16 It will be seen that an order under s 39(2) can only be made where the Court ""is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release"".  17 I think it fair to say that if Mr Slater remains in his present mental state he probably would be neither a danger to anyone else nor a danger to himself but the question of the stability of his present mental state is one that needs very careful attention.  18 When Mr Slater was seen by Dr Delaforce in March 2008, just over a year after the crime, he made some troubling comments indicating that at some significant level of his consciousness he still was deluded as to the reasons that led him to kill Mr Smith, although he did have by that time some insight into the wrongness of what he had done and indicated some remorse. I think that there were troubling signs of a conflict in this regard. Dr Delaforce made what is an obvious observation to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “His much improved mental health in about the past year results in his increasing insight into his schizophrenic basis for his defective thinking and related actions that included the death of Mr Smith.  
        
       
      
      
        
       
        
        He must permanently have his mental health monitored and permanently take psychiatric medication to reduce the risk of a relapse to positive symptoms of schizophrenia and therefore the risk of a serious act of violence to another.” 
        
       
       
      
    19 I think it is material to take note, and this is true of all the doctors, of their view that his understanding of what happened is ""increasing"". I think there are matters given in the history to the doctors and particularly Dr Delaforce, who pressed him somewhat more I think than the others in this respect, that indicate that Mr Slater's mind is still not altogether clear about why he did what he did and whether what he did was wrong. It is plain that he was very ill indeed at the time of the killing but I think that, to a degree that is concerning, he has made far from a complete recovery to sanity.  
     
      
    20 It seems to me that it is necessary is that Mr Slater must be continuously reviewed in the way provided by the legislation and, of course if he should reach the stage of being safe he must be released. He is not a criminal, although he has done a terrible thing. It is a matter of concern, I think, to all thinking people that we deal with people like Mr Slater as though they were criminals and we put them in prisons with criminals who commit or who have committed terrible things whilst completely sane. That this should happen in a civilised community is a disgrace.  
     
      
    21 As regrettable as it is, it is simply not safe to release Mr Slater at this time. It is obvious therefore that it would not be appropriate for me to make an order for his release under s 39(2) and the appropriate order is that Mr Slater be detained in such place and in such manner as is provided by law until he is fit to be released. 
     
      
    22 For what it is worth the Court extends its condolences to the family and friends of the deceased. It must be just a terrible nightmare for you.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Campbell JA: The Court is in a position to determine this matter and I will ask Howie J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: This is an appeal by the Crown in respect of sentences imposed in the District Court by Puckeridge DCJ (the Judge). The respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two offences of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act 1900 and an offence of assault contrary to s 61 of that Act. The maximum penalty prescribed for a s 35 offence is imprisonment for 7 years and, for a s 61 offence, imprisonment for two years. The Judge ordered the respondent to enter into a good behaviour bond for 5 years under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in respect of each of the s 35 offences. In respect of the assault offence the Judge convicted the respondent but imposed no sentence in accordance with s 10A of that Act. 
     
      
    3 The sentences were imposed upon the respondent on 27 October 2008. The appeal was lodged on 4 November 2008. 
     
      
    4 The respondent was the father of the victim of each of the offences, a son born on 14 March 2007. The offences each occurred sometime between 15 May 2007 and 4 July 2007. The child had been born 9 weeks prematurely and remained in hospital in Wagga Wagga until 20 April 2007. He was then returned to the care of his parents. The respondent and his partner had another child, a son who was born when the respondent was aged 17. Two different medical practitioners saw the child on 24 April and 15 May 2007 and no abnormalities were noted. 
     
      
    5 On 4 July 2007 the mother took the child to a general practitioner because the child had been unwell and had vomited over the last few days. The doctor became immediately concerned about the health of the child and had him removed to the local hospital. Tests revealed that the child was suffering from a bilateral subdural haematoma and multiple rib fractures. The child was taken by air to the children’s hospital at Randwick the next day. Subsequent tests confirmed that the child suffered from two subdural haemorrhages of different ages and 17 fractures of the ribs. The treating doctor formed the opinion that the injuries were occasioned by squeezing the child’s chest and “significant rotational acceleration/deceleration, such as might occur with shaking”. 
     
      
    6 Both parents were interviewed. The mother denied any misconduct with the child but stated that the respondent had picked up the child roughly on one occasion. The respondent admitted that he might have been responsible because he had picked up the child roughly twice but denied shaking the child. However, conversations between the respondent and other persons were lawfully recorded by the police during which the respondent admitted shaking the child twice as well as roughly handling him. The mother was reinterviewed by police and confirmed that the respondent had admitted shaking the child. Further medical evidence confirmed that the injuries to the child occurred when he was shaken. 
     
      
    7 The two charges under s 35 related to the injuries caused on the two occasions that the child was shaken. The assault related to an occasion when the child was picked up by his leg and thrown across the shoulder of the respondent causing the child to cry. The medical evidence was that no injury had occurred on that occasion. 
     
      
    8 The respondent was born on 12 October 1987. He has no criminal record. At the time of the offence he was employed at a restaurant as an apprenticed chef and attending TAFE. There is nothing in his early upbringing of relevance except that his parents divorced when the respondent was aged 15. He told the officer preparing a pre-sentence report that at the time of the offence he had been trying to calm the baby who had been crying. He squeezed it and heard the ribs crack. He said that he did not realise that children were so fragile, although he accepted that he should have been aware of this fact because of his large extended family and his other child. 
     
      
    9 There was a report from a psychologist. The respondent told him that he used alcohol and cannabis to cope with his domestic situation and his work as an apprentice. The psychologist described the respondent as being “an unsophisticated and simplistic individual” and being somewhat emotionally immature. He thought that the respondent was not coping with his split shifts, single low wage and the demands of very young children. The respondent reported that his relationship with his partner was dysfunctional and the psychologist described it as “riddled with adolescent type conflict and a disregard for the true responsibility of parenthood”. The psychologist expressed a lack of surprise that the offences were committed given the respondent’s description “of the escalating crisis in his domestic life”. He wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is evidence that substance abuse has been a precipitator in [the respondent’s] inability to self regulate his pre-existing and minimally submerged anger. No doubt, [the respondent’s] anger has become unleashed at his son, in a misdirected manner in response to the frustration and resentment he felt toward his partner and general poor life circumstances. 
         
        
       
      
    10 There was a reference from the respondent’s employer of three years in which it was stated that over the period the respondent “had grown incalculably from a young boy to a talented matured and well respected member of our staff”. There were references from members of the public and letters from the respondent’s father, mother and sister. The latter two persons sought to put much of the blame upon the respondent’s wife and painted her as selfish and an uncaring mother. Since September 2007 the respondent had been receiving counselling for anxiety and depression and a report indicated that he was making good progress. 
     
      
    11 The respondent wrote a letter to the sentencing court in which he set out the circumstances of the offending much as he had told the psychologist. He indicated his regret for, and the feelings of guilt arising from, his actions. He had undertaken a course in parenting. He expressed the view that gaol would not do him any good and pointed out that his mother had been a chef at the gaol at Junee. The respondent gave evidence as to the accuracy of the contents of this letter, as did his father and mother. The respondent had no contact with either of his children after he separated from their mother following his arrest. The child was eventually placed into the care of the maternal grandmother. 
     
      
    12 The respondent was not suitable for a community service order or for periodic detention. In the former case the nature of the offending and the lack of an agency prepared to offer him community work disqualified him. In the latter case it was thought that, because of the nature of his offending and his mother’s former employment at Junee Correctional Institution, his safety could not be guaranteed at the detention centre. 
     
      
    13 The Judge accepted that there were aggravating features present in the offences, being that the respondent was in a position of trust and the vulnerability of the child because of his very young age. However he found mitigation in that the conduct was not premeditated, the respondent was of good character and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. The Judge thought that rehabilitation depended upon the respondent remaining in his apprenticeship. 
     
      
    14 His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The charges involving a young child are serious offences, and the Crown has submitted that a custodial sentence is required to reflect the seriousness of the offence and to indicate the need for public deterrence of offences of this nature. There is no doubt that the charges are serious charges, but before imposing a sentence of imprisonment the court is required to consider whether any other sentence is available. 
        
       
       
      The Judge then referred to the inability of the respondent to perform community service or serve a sentence by periodic detention. 
       
      
    15 The Judge ultimately concluded that there was an alternative to a prison sentence by requiring the respondent to enter into two bonds under s 9. 
     
      
    16 The Crown submitted that the sentences were manifestly inadequate as a result of, what were described as, two “appealable errors”. The first was that too little weight was given to the objective seriousness of the offences, there being two separate instances of the child being shaken. The Crown stressed that this Court has on a number of occasions stated the importance of general deterrence when sentencing for offences of this nature. The Crown submits that the Judge must have given too much weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances over the need to denounce and deter such conduct. 
     
      
    17 The second error attributed to the Judge by the Crown was that he tailored the sentence to meet the situation that there was no other alternative than full-time custody and yet this is the sentence that the offences required. 
     
      
    18 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the sentence imposed was within his Honour’s discretion and that the reality of the sentence is that by the time the sentence expired the child would be more that 6½ years of age. It was submitted that the sentence recognised the child’s interests and that of the community for a young father to encourage and assist him to care for the child and his rehabilitation in the long term. 
     
      
    19 The Court was reminded of the principles attaching to Crown’s appeals and it was submitted that the Court would not be justified in intervening in this sentence. 
     
      
    20 In my opinion the sentences imposed by the Judge were unreasonably lenient so as to be manifestly wrong. I come to this conclusion reluctantly because of the respect that ought to be paid to the exercise of discretion by a sentencing judge and the allowance for the flexibility of approach to the particular circumstances of the offence and offender: see Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [27]. But it was not reasonably open to the Judge to conclude that the seriousness of the offending and the purposes of punishment, other than the rehabilitation of the offender, could be reflected in a non-custodial sentence of any kind let alone good behaviour bonds. 
     
      
    21 As the Judge realised, there were two aggravating factors: the respondent was in a position of trust and the vulnerability of the child. The second of those aggravating factors was very marked in this case as the child was only two months old. The injuries were not as serious as they might have been and are at the lower end of the type of injuries that amount to grievous bodily harm. It may well be the case that the child had a predisposition to subdural haemorrhaging and therefore the injuries were inflicted when they might not have been in the case of another child. But as against this, there were two injuries inflicted upon the child in two separate instances. 
     
      
    22 The Judge seemed to have relied very strongly on the psychology report as he quoted from it at length throughout his sentencing remarks. In my opinion there was nothing in that report that could possibly justify reducing the culpability of the respondent by the degree that could make a non-custodial sentence appropriate. The respondent may have been below the average range of intellectual functioning, as the psychologist found, but that was of little, if any, relevance to the respondent’s criminality in twice shaking the child in frustration with his domestic situation. It should be noted that this was the second child and it could not be the case that the respondent had no, or insufficient, understanding of the proper conduct toward a child of that very tender age. The respondent’s explanation that he did not realise how fragile a child of that age was should be rejected in light of the very young age of the child. 
     
      
    23 The psychologist expressed the view that it was not unknown for this type of behaviour to occur in young couples “with a social and emotional maturity of teenagers”. But this fact alone indicates the importance of general deterrence. Persons, however young, who take on the responsibility of parenthood should understand that they cannot abandon that responsibility just because of peevishness with their partners or frustration with the limitations imposed upon their life required by the care of infants. I find it of concern that, as if by way of justification for the respondent’s actions, the psychologist should express his lack of surprise that the respondent would assault the child given the “crisis in his domestic life”. This was simply a case where the respondent took out his frustrations on a defenceless and vulnerable child instead of protecting him from harm. Again it is significant to note that there were three separate assaults on the child charged against the respondent. Further the respondent admitted to being aware that he had fractured the child’s ribs yet did nothing about getting him assistance but rather hid that fact from his partner and the child’s grandparents. 
     
      
    24 Nor can the fact that the respondent’s conduct might have been influenced by his use of alcohol and cannabis lead to any mitigation as the psychologist seemed to think. The repetition of the offences would deprive the respondent of any mitigation that might have arisen had his normal tolerance to his frustrations been diminished by the influence of alcohol. There is rarely any mitigation arising from the use of illegal substances. In any event there is no evidence that the respondent was under the influence of any substance at the time of the assaults. 
     
      
    25 The respondent’s remorse has been somewhat limited. As I have already indicated, he did not seek any assistance to ensure the child’s welfare after he knew he had fractured his ribs. Although he admitted to some “rough handling” of the child, he never admitted shaking him to the doctors or the police when they were interviewing him. That conduct was discovered through private conversations that the police recorded. The respondent in none of the material ever refers to the fact that he shook the child. In his letter to the court he refers to the charges as “an incident”, as does his father. In the probation report the account is given of a “single incident” in which he “lost it” and he “just wanted to squeeze him (the baby) to settle him, type of love reaction”. The quotations are contained in the report and are clearly intended to reflect the actual words used by the respondent. It seems plain that the respondent does not appreciate the seriousness of his conduct as reflected in the three charges to which he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    26 The Judge accepted that he must sentence the respondent for inflicting subdural haemorrhages as a result of shaking the child twice as well as “picking him up roughly over a period of time”. Although he apparently accepted the submission from the prosecutor that the sentence must reflect the seriousness of the offending and general deterrence, he nowhere indicates how two bonds could possibly fulfil those sentencing objectives in light of the conduct for which he was sentencing the respondent and the injuries inflicted upon the child. 
     
      
    27 Concerns about the safety of the respondent were raised in the context of the periodic detention centre and its staffing limitations. There are many custodial institutions that provide protected environments without making imprisonment more difficult for the inmate. If a gaol sentence is the only punishment that can reasonably be imposed upon an offender, it will be a very rare case indeed where that sentence can be avoided simply because of concerns for the offender’s safety. This was certainly not such a case. 
     
      
    28 Although determining the appropriate weight to give the subjective circumstances of an offender as against the objective seriousness of the criminal conduct is principally a matter for the sentencing judge, and accepting that minds might reasonably differ as to how those matters might be balanced, in the present case the Judge must have given too much weight to the former in order to derive the sentences he did. I believe he placed far too much weight on the material in the psychologist report and on the fact that there was no alternative to full-time custody available to the respondent that might be seen as some form of significant punishment. But given the seriousness of this conduct neither community service nor a sentence by way of periodic detention would have been an adequate response. The only sentence that his Honour could reasonably have imposed was full-time imprisonment. 
     
      
    29 The sentences are manifestly inadequate to a very substantial degree. They are so inadequate that in my view the Court must intervene notwithstanding the principles that apply to Crown appeals, as to which see R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70], and the recognition that it will be a rare case where this Court will intervene even though the Crown can point to no specific sentencing error, as to which see R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85. I appreciate that the respondent will be sorely disappointed that he is now to serve a sentence of imprisonment notwithstanding that the sentencing Judge gave him the benefit of the bonds. This is once more a case where an obviously inadequate sentence has been imposed in a situation where it did the respondent no favour by building up in him hopes that were bound to be dashed once the Crown appealed. 
     
      
    30 There is before the Court an affidavit by the respondent as to events that have occurred since sentencing. He is being counselled by the psychologist who wrote the report and has received from him an anger management kit. He is still in a relationship with the mother of the child but has no contact with the children. He has been attending the probation officer as required. He states that he now considers that he should have asked for help in coping from his parents or his partner’s mother. 
     
      
    31 There is nothing in my opinion that can justify this Court refusing to intervene notwithstanding that the sentence is inadequate. The subjective matters, including the respondent’s young age at the time of the offending, and the disappointment no doubt experienced by the respondent can be taken into account by the imposition of a sentence that is at the very bottom of the range that was legitimately open to the sentencing Judge. The sentence should be backdated to the date of sentence to acknowledge the fact that the respondent has been on the bonds since that date. 
     
      
    32 There should be some accumulation between the sentences imposed upon the two charges under s 35 as they were discrete and separate attacks upon the child: see Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]. The respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court and should be given a discount of 25 per cent. There are special circumstances by reason of the need for the respondent to have a longer term of supervision and assistance than would result from the statutory relationship between the parole period and the balance of term. The overall sentence is to be one of 1 year 10 months with an overall non-parole period of 12 months and will date from 27 October 2008. This is in my opinion the very least sentence that could be imposed upon the respondent and yet not be manifestly inadequate. The respondent will be released to parole on 26 October 2009. 
     
      
    33 I propose that the Crown appeal be allowed and the sentences imposed in the District Court be quashed. In lieu the following sentences should be imposed upon the respondent: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. In respect of the first charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm the respondent be sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 9 months and a balance of term of 9 months to date from 27 October 2008. The non–parole period expires on 26 July 2009. 
         
         
        2. In respect of the second charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm the respondent be sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 months and a balance of term of 10 months to date from 26 April 2009. The non–parole period expires on 25 October 2009. The respondent is to be released to parole on that date. 
         
         
        3. In respect of the assault a sentence of 2 months to date from 27 October 2008 and that expires on 26 December 2008.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 from an interlocutory judgment of Sweeney DCJ. Her Honour made an order staying criminal proceedings against the respondent “until the Crown consents to Mr Jamal’s trial proceeding by judge alone”. 
     
      
    2 The respondent is charged with maliciously discharging a loaded firearm with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 33A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. There is an alternative count of firing a firearm with reckless disregard for the safety of another person contrary to s 93GA(1) of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    3 The particular incident involved a group of persons undertaking a scheme by which some of them fired a number of bullets at Lakemba Police Station which was then occupied by police officers. The Crown case is that the respondent participated in a joint criminal enterprise by driving a vehicle in the course of the getaway of the persons who did the shooting.  
     
      
    4 The matter was listed for trial on 6 February 2008. Her Honour made the order of a stay on 8 February 2008. 
     
      
    5 Her Honour had before her details of publicity about the respondent including, but not limited to, the shooting at Lakemba Police Station. Various allegations were made in the media about the respondent including allegations of being a terrorist, the latest of which was published in December 2007. Many of the media reports are available on websites capable of being accessed and which would reveal many past publications upon the respondent’s name being searched. 
     
      
    6 Section 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides for a trial by judge alone in criminal proceedings. However, subs (3) of that section requires that: “An election may be made only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions”.  
     
      
    7 It has been held that a refusal to grant such consent is not subject to judicial review. (See M v Director of Public Prosecutions (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Dunford J, 6 March 1996, unreported).) 
     
      
    8 It appears that her Honour was referred to only two relevant cases, The Queen v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 and R v K [2003] NSWCCA 403; (2003) 59 NSWLR 431. They are the only such authorities referred to in her judgment. 
     
      
    9 During the course of judgment her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I am of the view that the sustained, repeated and accumulated nature of the reporting, the subject matter of the reports and its terms, often intemperate, sometimes quite florid, over the time period from May 2004 to December 2007, with material still now available on the internet, means that what is being considered here is of more significance than the material considered in  
        Glennon 
         or in  
        Re K 
         [sic]. 
        
       
       
        
        I must proceed on the basis that a jury would be directed to not make any inquiries about the accused on the internet and to ignore any prior media publicity. Juries are presumed to follow directions given to them and I have to proceed on that basis. 
        
       
       
        
        However, I am concerned that because of the sheer volume of the material, its availability on the internet, and the nature and terms of some of it, that there is a risk of the material becoming known to jurors and having an impact which is prejudicial to the accused having a fair trial. Due to, at least in part, media demonisation, the allegation of ‘terrorism’ carries with it in the community emotive and prejudicial weight. I appreciate that the High Court in  
        Glennon  
        said I must not conjecture or speculate that that would occur, but I do have a concern that there is that real risk. 
        
       
       
        
        Are there measures available to ameliorate the risk? That is an issue I must consider. The lapse of time to date has not been sufficient since the last reporting in December 2007. Nor am I of the view that a further short adjournment would change that position.” 
        
       
      
    10 Her Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not think a permanent stay is required, based on the test in  
        Jago 
        , 
          
        because in my view there is a course available which would meet the risk of potential prejudicial effect on jurors by the material exhibited on this application. Mr Jamal sought a judge alone trial but the Crown did not consent. The Crown’s consent is required under the provisions of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act  
        which provide for a judge alone trial. 
        
       
       
        
        Having heard submissions on this application and indicated by preliminary views along the lines of the judgment I have just given, I gave the Crown an opportunity to further consider its position on that issue. Mr Crown has informed me this morning that the Director will not consent to a judge alone trial. 
        
       
       
        
        Therefore it is my view, adopting the tests in the cases to which I have been referred, that at present Mr Jamal cannot receive a fair jury trial due to the prejudicial material put before me on this application, and therefore the only course available to me is to stay the trial temporarily until the Crown consents to a judge alone trial. As I understand the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
        , I cannot force the Crown or order the Crown to consent to a judge alone trial, but it seems to me that the interests of justice and the interests of a fair trial require that I make that order. 
        
       
       
        
        Therefore, I make the order that the proceedings are stayed until the Crown consents to Mr Jamal’s trial proceeding by judge alone.” 
        
       
      
    11 Several aspects of her Honour’s reasoning have been highlighted in the Crown’s submissions in this Court. In particular, it was submitted that her Honour’s reference to “the only course available to me is to stay the trial temporarily until the Crown consents” was an error of principle because her Honour had an alternative available, namely an adjournment. This Crown submission is only partially accurate. Her Honour stated earlier in her judgment that she did not believe that “a further short adjournment would change” the position with respect to a fair trial.  
     
      
    12 It is not clear what her Honour had in mind by a “short adjournment”. However, it does appear that her Honour did not have regard to the possibility of a longer adjournment. In this regard, the Crown submission, that her Honour erred by characterising her conditional stay as “the only course available”, should be upheld. As the Crown submitted, she could have ordered a stay for a “limited period”, being a period that was not “short”. 
     
      
    13 There were good reasons for considering a longer adjournment in the present case.  
     
      
    14 First, the respondent had been convicted of an unrelated shooting and had been sentenced to nine years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years and six months commencing on 17 August 2007. The recent publicity was directed to this trial or occurred in the context of this trial. A stay for a lengthy period will often raise questions about unfairness to the accused particularly, when he could not be released on bail. This is not such a case. The respondent will remain in gaol for a lengthy period in any event. 
     
      
    15 Secondly, the attack on Lakemba Police Station occurred on 1 November 1998. The case has been delayed for a number of reasons including a trial being aborted because of the respondent’s ill health and, then, by the respondent absconding overseas. He was not extradited until September 2006. The adverse effects of lengthy delay on a criminal trial have already occurred. A further delay would not significantly add to those effects. 
     
      
    16 This Court has had occasion to assess adverse pre-trial publicity in a number of cases, being publicity of a character, of a duration and of an intensity which was at least equal, in many cases, to the publicity in the present case. Applications for a permanent stay have failed in the most sensational of cases: Anita Cobby, Ivan Milat, Phillip Bell, the Childers Backpacker Hostel fire, Lucy Dudko, William D’Arcy, Bruce Burrell. (See Murphy v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 94; R v Milat (Court of Criminal Appeal, 26 February 1998, unreported); R v Bell (Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 October 1998, unreported); Long v R [2002] QSC 54; (2002) 128 A Crim R 11; affirmed on appeal [2003] QCA 77; (2003) 138 A Crim R 103; R v Dudko [2002] NSWCCA 336; (2002) 132 A Crim R 371; R v D’Arcy [2003] QCA 124; (2003) 140 A Crim R 303; R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 185.) 
     
      
    17 I have had occasion to summarise the relevant case law in the following manner, applicable to the present case, in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344: 
     
      
       
        
        “[103] There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity, indeed publicity much more sensational and sustained than anything that occurred here. Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted, again and again, that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take, that they listen to the directions that they are given and implement them. In particular that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them.” 
        
       
      
    18 There are now numerous judicial statements as to the validity of such an approach. 
     
      
    19 Going back, for example, as Gleeson CJ said in R v VPH (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 March 1994, unreported) at 7:  
     
      
       
        
        “The jury will be given appropriate directions to confine their attention to the evidence that is put before them. Our entire system of the administration of criminal justice depends upon the assumption that jurors understand and comply with directions of that character.”  
        
       
      
    20 Furthermore, as McHugh JA said in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at 425: 
     
      
       
        
        “[31] … Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.” 
        
       
      
    21 The perspective that jurors properly perform their task, are true to their oaths and comply with a trial judge’s directions has repeatedly been applied in appellate courts over recent years. (See R v Milat; R v Bell; Long v R; R v Richards [1999] NSWCCA 114; (1999) 107 A Crim R 318; R v Dudko; R v D’Arcy; R v Burrell supra.) 
     
      
    22 The issue in the present case is slightly different in the sense that what is sought is not a permanent stay but an order to stay until such time as the Director grants his consent.  
     
      
    23 In my opinion, an order interfering with a statutory discretion of this character is not an appropriate exercise of a court’s jurisdiction to prevent an abuse of its own processes. (See Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23.) The Parliament has deliberately excluded the court from the determination of the mode of trial. The court should not circumvent this legislative choice, particularly as that choice reflects the long established separation of powers with respect to the institution of criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    24 The central significance of the jury in the administration of criminal justice in Australia is such that the courts should be, on any view, exceptionally reluctant to insist that the system be bypassed, even when seeking to implement the principle of a fair trial. For serious crimes a fair trial in our system of criminal justice is a trial by jury, subject to statutory exception. The community has a right to participate in the administration of criminal justice, and public confidence in that system turns to a significant degree upon that participation. Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that a fair trial is not only a trial fair for the accused, it is also a trial fair to the community represented by the prosecution. 
     
      
    25 The determination of the mode of trial – often made in the decision to present an indictment or to proceed summarily – is an executive function. Indeed, if such a power were conferred on a court, in a Commonwealth constitutional context it could well give rise to a separation of powers issue. A question would arise as to the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.  
     
      
    26 As Gaudron and Gummow JJ said in such a context in Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 534 (citations omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        “It ought now be accepted, in our view, that certain decisions involved in the prosecution process are, of their nature, insusceptible of judicial review. They include decisions whether or not to prosecute, to enter a nolle prosequi, to proceed ex officio, whether or not to present evidence and, which is usually an aspect of one or other of those decisions, decisions as to the particular charge to be laid or prosecuted. The integrity of the judicial process – particularly, its independence and impartiality and the public perception thereof – would be compromised if the courts were to decide or were to be in any way concerned with decisions as to who is to be prosecuted and for what.” 
        
       
      
    27 Although this Court has not heard full argument on the matter, particularly with reference to the separation of powers in the State system, I am of the view that the reasoning of Gaudron and Gummow JJ is applicable to the mode of trial. What, one may ask, would happen if the present order were to stand but the Director refused to give his consent? The stay would remain in effect, but would an accused be entitled to be released on bail and, if so, when and what conditions? Such interaction between the judiciary and the executive, including on occasions leading to a standoff, may affect the integrity of the judicial process. 
     
      
    28 Mr P Byrne SC, who appeared for the respondent, accepted that this stay would operate subject to any subsequent application that it be lifted, assuming that the Director’s consent was not forthcoming. In my opinion the court should not make an order which imposes a condition which the executive can ignore.  
     
      
    29 It may be that all her Honour had in mind in the order she actually made was to create a situation in which, if the Crown wished to proceed immediately or in the short term, it could only do so by judge alone. However, in the absence of any consent being forthcoming or indicated to her Honour at that stage, an order in the form it was made ought not have been made. What ought to have been done, if the Director maintained his position that no consent would be forthcoming, is that her Honour should have exercised her power, on the factual findings she made, to stay the proceedings for a defined period. In the circumstances to which I have referred that period did not have to be a short period. 
     
      
    30 Looking at the matter which her Honour took into account, clearly access to information on the internet is of a more permanent character and remains accessible, so that a long period of stay does not necessarily avert the possibility of juror access to such information. However, since the decision of R v K, to which her Honour referred, the practice of directing juries not to access the internet has become standard and, indeed, it has been reinforced by legislation making it a criminal offence for a juror to do so. Juries are regularly instructed that this is the case. Indeed, Sweeney DCJ herself recognised that the possibility of internet access was not determinative in the present case. 
     
      
    31 If a power to make such a discretionary order existed contrary to the above reasoning, it would be a judgment of a character with which, as Mr Byrne properly submitted, the Court is reluctant to intervene. However, even on this basis, in my opinion, her Honour made an error by failing to consider the possibility of a lengthier adjournment. The fact that the respondent will remain in prison for a lengthy period meant that her Honour should not have confined her analysis to merely a “short adjournment”, as the only alternative to the order she made. A lengthier adjournment should have received consideration and, in my opinion, should have been given determinative weight.  
     
      
    32 Even if this option were open, accordingly, in my opinion, it would not have been an appropriate exercise of the discretion to make the particular order in a case such as the present, where the accused will be in gaol for a lengthy period and there has already been a long period of delay, for reasons to which I have referred. Such further delay as is appropriate to reduce the effect of recent publicity can readily be accommodated on the facts of the present case. 
     
      
    33 Accordingly, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and the order made by her Honour should be set aside. 
     
      
    34 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    35 PRICE J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    36 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as I have indicated.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application for a stay of the trial of the accused on two counts of murder. The trial is listed to commence on the first day of the second week of the new term next year, that is, 4 February 2008. The matter has quite an extraordinary history that is set out in the judgment that I delivered refusing a permanent stay to the applicant on 21 March this year. 
     
      
    2 As a result of my refusing to grant a permanent stay the applicant appealed under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The matter was before that court on 21 August. Judgment was delivered on 26 November 2007. The Court had been specially constituted by the five justices, including the Chief Justice and the Chief Judge of the Common Law Division, such was the significance of the case by reason of the matters that were raised on behalf of the applicant both before me and before that court. 
     
      
    3 Briefly, the Crown, by ex-officio indictment, filed in this court charges the applicant with the murder of his two parents as a result of an incident arising in August 1993 in which his parents and brother were killed. The history of the matter very briefly is that the applicant was charged only with the murder of his brother. The police have never charged the applicant with the murder of his parents. Ultimately on 5 April 1995 the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter of his brother and the Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of the indictment alleging that he murdered his brother. He was dealt with in the Supreme Court by Abadee J for that offence and was placed on a good behaviour bond. 
     
      
    4 There was then a hiatus in the further prosecution of any person as a result of the incidents that left dead the applicant's parents and brother. Although there were a number of occasions when the matter was considered either by the police or by the Director of Public Prosecutions, including the applicant being charged with the murder of his parents by his uncle. 
     
      
    5 On the application before me, the applicant sought a stay on what were effectively three bases. The first was that the further prosecution of the applicant in relation to incidents arising from the death of his parents was an abuse of process in that it was oppressive in light of the history of the matter, in particular the fact that the accused had been dealt with for the manslaughter of his brother leaving him with a reasonable belief that he was no longer in jeopardy in relation to any criminal charge arising from the death of his parents. 
     
      
    6 The second matter relied upon was that any trial of the accused would necessarily be unfair by reason of the fact that the police had lost most, if not all, of the exhibits after the prosecution of the applicant for the murder of his brother, depriving the applicant of the opportunity to have further tests and to obtain further scientific evidence in relation to the exhibits which might indicate that he was not guilty of the murder of his parents. 
     
      
    7 The third, and perhaps most difficult, matter was a contention that the prosecution was, in effect, an abuse of process because of the application of the principles of double jeopardy in light of the fact that the applicant had been charged with and dealt with in the court for the manslaughter of his brother. In effect, the argument was that the conviction of manslaughter resulted in an acquittal of his brother's murder and that an allegation that he had murdered his parents was inconsistent with that acquittal. 
     
      
    8 Before me the applicant was not successful on any argument and therefore the stay was refused. Before the Court of Criminal Appeal leave to appeal was refused in respect of the first two bases for the stay, that is, on the basis that the further prosecution was oppressive or that any further trial would necessarily be unfair. However, on the first two grounds, which relate to the issue of double jeopardy and the fact that the applicant had been acquitted of the murder of his brother, leave was granted even though ultimately the appeal was dismissed. It is in respect of that decision that the applicant now seeks special leave to appeal to the High Court. 
     
      
    9 One of the difficulties for the applicant is that the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal was not delivered until 26 November 2007, that is about three weeks before the end of term, and the trial is listed to commence in the second week of the new term. This puts the applicant in a difficult position in pursuing either a special leave application before the High Court or even in seeking expedition.  
     
      
    10 The Crown has submitted that I should not entertain any application for a stay and ought not to vacate the trial date on the basis that there is a line of authority in the High Court which indicates that it is only in exceptional circumstances that the High Court will entertain a special leave application from an interlocutory judgment. This being an interlocutory judgment, albeit of a bench of five in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Crown contends that the applicant has little, or no, prospect of obtaining special leave from the High Court and therefore any stay will be futile. 
     
      
    11 It seems to me that there is merit in the Crown's argument simply on the basis of previous decisions of the High Court concerned with applications for special leave from interlocutory judgments, and in particular cases in the High Court concerning stay applications based upon the prospect of obtaining special leave.  
     
      
    12 It must be said that the matter is an unusual one in its factual basis. On one view the decision of this Court, both before me and before the Court of Criminal Appeal, was based upon the application of principles obtained from a number of High Court judgments upon a consideration of the principles of double jeopardy and stays of indictment generally and was merely an application of those principles to the particular and peculiar facts of this case. However, it is a highly unusual case that extends the boundaries of double jeopardy to probably their furthest limit and is one that has been of such significance that it was thought appropriate to sit a Bench of five justices in the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
    13 Without dealing completely with the application for the stay, it became apparent that the present timetable of the trial might not, in effect, deprive the applicant of an opportunity to approach the High Court, firstly, for expedition, and secondly and perhaps more importantly, to obtain a stay of the trial based upon a High Court Judge's assessment of the likelihood of special leave being granted in this particular case. The current timetable is that there would be a week of pre-trial determinations before any jury would be empanelled to hear the trial of the accused. The present information placed before the Court is that there are two days on which special leave applications are being considered in the High Court before 11 February 2008, which is the date on which it is projected that a jury would be empanelled. The first date is on 14 December 2007 and the applicant probably, realistically, does not expect to find himself in the special leave applications list for that day. The next special leave day is 8 February 2008.  
     
      
    14 I indicated during the course of argument that I would undertake, if it were necessary to do so, to the applicant, and to any other court, that I would not empanel a jury before 11 February 2008. Realistically that is unlikely to occur by reason of the week of pre-trial determinations. The matter has been determined without a stay being sought on the basis that both the applicant and the Crown accept that this court will not empanel a jury before 11 February 2008 on the basis that this will give the applicant an opportunity to seek expedition in the High Court in relation to the special leave application being lodged and, more particularly, to approach a High Court Judge to seek a stay of the trial before 11 February.  
     
      
    15 On that basis the application has been withdrawn and on that basis I have not determined to stay the trial. It should be perfectly clear, however, that no jury would be empanelled before 11 February 2008. If the applicant requires a stay after that time, then in my view the applicant should seek that stay from the High Court.

     Stephen Clyde HAMMOND v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Spigelman CJ: I agree with Justice McCallum and add the following brief observations.  
     
      
    2 Not only was there no evidence of a causal relationship between the applicant’s psychiatric condition and the offence but there was no submission by counsel appearing in the sentencing proceedings to that effect. As Mr Hunt who appears on this appeal acknowledged, those submissions were directed to the subjective circumstances of the applicant rather than to the objective circumstances. 
     
      
    3 It is understandable in the light of the absence of a submission, and in the absence of evidence directly linking the psychiatric condition and the offence, that his Honour would not make express reference to it.  
     
      
    4 The position taken by counsel for the applicant at the sentence hearing can be justified on the basis that the only evidence directed to this issue is in fact to the contrary of the inference Mr Hunt urged on this court. Ms Robilliard in her report said, referring to the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        “He maintained that for some weeks leading up to his offence he was not adhering to his anti psychotic treatment regime. However, Stephen did not describe any thoughts or beliefs of a psychotic nature that might have had relevance to his aggressive treatment of Jeanette at the time.” 
        
       
      
      
       
      This does suggest not only an absence of evidence relating to the link, but evidence of a character suggesting that there was no such link.  
       
      
    5 In any event, the whole of the body of evidence justified the position taken by counsel appearing for the applicant and his Honour’s reasons, which similarly did not take this matter into account with respect to the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    6 I agree with the orders proposed by Justice McCallum.7 Price J: I agree with the orders proposed by Justice McCallum and with the additional remarks of the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    8 McCallum J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 14 May 2007 when he appeared for sentence after pleading guilty to a charge of aggravated kidnapping in contravention of s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The person detained was the applicant's wife. The circumstance of aggravation was the occasioning of actual bodily harm. 
     
      
    9 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 86(2)(b) is imprisonment for twenty years. It is not an offence that attracts a standard non parole period under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    10 The sentencing judge did not make an express finding as to where the offence fell within the range of objective seriousness, having regard to the absence of a standard non parole period. His Honour noted the statutory maximum penalty of twenty years and expressed the view that the court must consider a starting point in the level of seriousness in the instant case of at least ten years. His Honour allowed a twenty five per cent reduction in sentence for the utilitarian value of an early plea, giving a term of seven and a half years. His Honour then determined that a period of actual custody of around five years would properly reflect the objective seriousness of the offence.11 His Honour expressed reluctance to make a finding of special circumstances but noted that a non parole period of five years with a further term of two and a half years in effect provided a variation of the ratio required by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour identified that variation as an allowance for the applicant's psychological, mental and alcohol problems and to ensure an appropriate period for supervision and rehabilitation. 
     
      
    12 His Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of five years and a total term of seven and a half years to date from 20 August 2006 which was the date on which the applicant was arrested. 
     
      
    13 A concurrent fixed term of twelve months imprisonment was imposed in respect of a related offence of larceny arising out of the applicant's theft of his wife’s credit card during the evening of the kidnapping. The applicant makes no complaint in respect of that sentence. 
     
      
    14 The circumstances of the offence are not in dispute. The applicant and his wife had been in a domestic relationship for over twenty two years and had been married for about eleven years. They had six children together. The relationship had been marred by domestic violence at the hands of the applicant. Mrs Hammond ended the relationship in 2003 for that reason, stating that the applicant beat her on a regular basis. 
     
      
    15 At the time of the offence the applicant had only recently been released from prison having served a number of sentences for offences of dishonesty, resisting police, using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence and other matters. The applicant had originally been released to parole on 12 January 2006 but that parole order was revoked on 2 February 2006 and he then served the balance of term of six months. 
     
      
    16 Although the applicant and his wife had been separated since 2003, she permitted him to stay with her following his release from prison on 2 August 2006. 
     
      
    17 On the day on which the offence was committed, the applicant drank six large bottles of beer and most of a large bottle of bourbon whiskey. He also smoked about a quarter of an ounce of marijuana. At that time he was taking prescribed anti depressant medication. He had also been prescribed anti psychotic medication but had stopped accepting that medication a few weeks earlier. 
     
      
    18 The applicant began drinking at around midday. In the evening he and his wife went to visit one of their adult daughters. They left there at around 8pm when the applicant began arguing with the daughter. When they returned home an argument developed between them, apparently as a result of the applicant's perception that Mrs Hammond had not defended him when he was arguing with their daughter. He punched her and then grabbed her hair with both hands and dragged her onto the floor by the hair repeatedly saying to her, “you’re nothing but a filthy slut”. He dragged her across the floor to the lounge where he sat down and put his foot on the back of her head pushing her face into the carpet. He kept her in that position for about ten minutes. 
     
      
    19 Mrs Hammond pleaded with the applicant to stop. Eventually he took his foot off her neck and then punched her again and kicked her several times. The applicant then said to Mrs Hammond, “Just get up and go before I kill you” but when she made to leave, he grabbed her by the throat and dragged her back down towards the lounge. There he held her head in his lap and squeezed her throat until she blacked out. When she regained consciousness, she was still in that position and his hands were still around her throat. The applicant then told Mrs Hammond to lie down with him which she did, out of fear. After he had fallen asleep, she left and contacted police. 
     
      
    20 Mrs Hammond suffered bruising around the eye, bruising to both sides of the chest, bruising around the base of her neck and a lump on the head consistent with blunt trauma to the head. The treating doctor made a clinical diagnosis of a cracked rib but no x-ray was undertaken to confirm that diagnosis. 
     
      
    21 The grounds of appeal relied on by the applicant are that the head sentence and the non parole period are manifestly excessive and that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the mental health condition of the applicant. 
     
      
    22 It is convenient to deal with the second ground first. The evidence before the sentencing judge suggested the existence of a diagnosis of schizophrenia in respect of the applicant but there was no direct evidence of that fact from any psychiatrist who made the diagnosis. The evidence came before the sentencing judge in the form of a report from a psychologist who had not seen any medical reports, the notes of Justice Health in respect of the applicant, the pre-sentence report and the sworn evidence of the applicant at the sentence hearing. 
     
      
    23 The psychologist, Ms Anna Robilliard recorded the history given to her by the applicant who told her that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and that at around the time of the offence he was meant to be on anti psychotic medication but had ceased accepting that medication. She stated, however, that the applicant did not describe any thoughts or beliefs of a psychotic nature that might have had relevance to his aggressive treatment of Mrs Hammond at the time of the offence.24 The psychologist also noted a history of head injury when the applicant was in his mid 20s. She stated that she had attempted to conduct psychometric testing but that this was discontinued as the applicant was not able to focus and attend sufficiently to those tests. 
     
      
    25 The notes from Justice Health refer to a diagnosis of schizophrenia by Dr Willem Van Lill at Bourke District Hospital. Those notes are dated 5 February 2006 but do not identify the date of the diagnosis. The presentence report records that the applicant stated he was diagnosed as schizophrenic in 2004. However, that report also notes that an earlier report to the parole board contained no record of the applicant suffering from or receiving treatment for any mental health condition until his return to custody on 4 February 2006. 
     
      
    26 The author of the presentence report confirmed with Bourke District Hospital that the applicant has been prescribed anti psychotic medication but the date of that prescription is not recorded in the report. Taken in combination, that information appears to suggest that the diagnosis of schizophrenia was made at Bourke District Hospital between the period when the applicant was first released to parole on 12 January 2006 and his return to custody on 4 February 2006. The Justice Health notes record a further diagnosis of schizophrenia by a different psychiatrist while the applicant was in custody on 12 September 2006.27 At the sentence hearing the applicant confirmed his understanding that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia by psychiatrists both in Bourke District Hospital and in gaol. He also gave evidence of suffering head injuries when he was assaulted in 1994. 
     
      
    28 Importantly, there was no evidence before the sentencing judge as to whether the diagnosis of schizophrenia was causally related to the commission of the offence. In his remarks on sentence, Woods ADCJ recited the fact that the Justice Health reports referred to schizophrenia. He also recited the history given to the psychologist that the applicant had been on anti psychotic medication whilst in custody in 2006 but that apparently at the suggestion of his partner he had stopped taking that medication because it was making him “like a zombie”. 
     
      
    29 His Honour did not specifically refer to the schizophrenia diagnosis in the context of the consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence. His Honour referred to the applicant's mental health in two contexts. First, in his consideration of the aggravating and mitigating factors required to be taken into account pursuant to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The health and psychological assessments suggest that his prospects of rehabilitation are problematic given his history.” 
        
       
      
      
       
       
      Secondly, as already noted, after reaching a total term of seven and a half years and determining that the appropriate period of actual custody was around five years, his Honour expressed his reluctance to find special circumstances but said that he was in effect providing a variation of the normal ratio to allow for the applicant’s “psychological and mental problems and alcohol problems and to ensure that there is appropriate time period and appropriate supervision to ensure a fuller attempt at rehabilitation and resolving his anger management and alcohol problems after he is released.” 
       
      
    30 Mr Hunt, who appeared for the applicant, submitted that the sentencing judge was required to take the mental health issues into account in his analysis of the objective seriousness of the offence, citing R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 16 at 86 and also citing s 21A(3)(j). He relied on the decision of Justice Sperling J in R v Hemsley (2004) NSWCCA 228 where his Honour identified mental illness as being relevant in the following ways: first, where it contributes to the commission of an offence in a material way, it is relevant to the offender’s moral culpability. Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and so moderate that consideration. Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person. Finally, a countervailing consideration may arise, namely the level of danger which the offender presents to the community which may sound in special deterrence. 
     
      
    31 Mr Hunt submitted that to some degree the applicant falls into each of the first three categories outlined by Justice Sperling. The issue, however, is whether the sentencing judge fell into error in not proceeding on that basis, particularly having regard to the paucity of evidence as to the applicant's mental health, which was acknowledged by Mr Hunt. 
     
      
    32 In Hemsley, Sperling J referred to the situation where the mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way. In order for mental illness to be relevant to the assessment of culpability, it must be shown to have contributed to the offence. The unchallenged evidence in Hemsley was that due to a borderline personality disorder and depressive illness, the applicant there would not have been in a position to exercise rational and sound judgment with regard to participating in the offence. 
     
      
    33 The evidence before the sentencing judge in the present case did not address that issue. As already noted, the applicant had ingested a large amount of alcohol and cannabis over a period of many hours before committing the offence. He gave evidence at the sentence hearing that when he is drinking, marijuana sends him crazy. Accordingly, even if there had been direct evidence from an appropriate expert of a diagnosis of schizophrenia and of any consequent impairment to good judgment, the question of the extent to which that may have contributed to the offence was complex. In any event, there was no such evidence. 
     
      
    34 Mr Hunt submitted that the necessary connection could be drawn by way of inference. He submitted that the obligation falls to the sentencing judge to find such facts. I do not accept that submission. In my view on the evidence before the sentencing judge it would have been speculative for his Honour to conclude that the applicant's mental health issues were casually related to the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    35 Further, as noted in the written submissions of the Crown, it would be wrong to approach the matter as though an automatic consequence followed from the presence of a particular fact: see R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68. In particular, the existence of a causal relationship between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence. 
     
      
    36 In my view, the remarks on sentence of the sentencing judge to which I have already referred disclose that his Honour did take the applicant's mental health into account when sentencing the applicant, to the extent that it was relevant. That is reflected in the discussion of the adjustment to the usual ratio to which I have already referred. In my view, no specific error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    37 It remains to consider the first ground of appeal, that the head sentence and the non parole period were manifestly excessive. The question to be determined is whether the result embodied in the order is unreasonable or plainly unjust: see Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]. 
     
      
    38 Mr Hunt submitted that the case was quite different from the circumstances in R v Newell (2004) NSWCCA 183. A comparison of those circumstances with those obtaining in the present case does not produce the conclusion that the present sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    39 In my view, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It was a sentence which, whilst it may be regarded as being towards the upper end of the range, was within the sentencing discretion of the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    40 The order I propose is that leave to appeal be allowed but that the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The Court is in a position to give judgment and I will ask Grove J to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: Before the Court is an appeal against conviction by Qin Guan Liang (David) and an appeal by the Crown alleging the manifest inadequacy of the sentence received by him following conviction. To avoid possible confusion I will refer to him as the appellant throughout. 
     
      
    3 The appellant was presented for trial upon an indictment containing four counts, one of which was pleaded in the alternative. Count 1 charged indecent assault and count 2 charged sexual intercourse without consent and count 3 charged indecent assault in the alternative to count 2 and count 4 also charged indecent assault. The offences were all alleged to have occurred on the one occasion on 24 March 2007. This was a Saturday and a State election was being held on that day. 
     
      
    4 A single ground of appeal against conviction is advanced asserting that verdicts of guilty on counts 1 and 2 are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence and a verdict of not guilty on count 4. 
     
      
    5 The complainant (HA) resided in a flat with her boyfriend (GY) and a flatmate (CB). Opposite the flat was an establishment entitled Professional Chinese Acupressure Massage Clinic operated by a Ms Hua Ai (Grace). The appellant was in a relationship with her, held qualifications as a masseur and worked as such in the clinic from time to time.  
     
      
    6 HA was an actor and also participated in the management of a costume shop. In October 2006 she was engaged in cabaret performance which involved a lot of dance and she experienced resultant soreness. She noticed that the clinic had opened and she decided to try their advertised services and “check it out for future use”. The first use was a full body massage administered by Grace. She found this satisfactory and she returned on a number of occasions for various treatments. Some were administered by Grace and others by the appellant.  
     
      
    7 On 24 March 2007 she attended to fulfil an appointment which she had previously made, the payment for which was intended to be made through a gift voucher which had been passed to her. As observed by senior counsel for the appellant there was a good deal of evidence relating to timing, voting, vouchers, the type of massage intended to be performed and visits to the clinic by CB after HA had left, but inconsistencies and disputes about these matters are peripheral and do not bear upon the question whether the convictions on counts 1 and 2 and the acquittal on count 4 can be reconciled. I agree with that observation and it is unnecessary to explore those issues. 
     
      
    8 HA had given evidence at a previous trial which was not completed. As authorized by s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, her earlier evidence was tendered in the subject trial. An edited video recording of the evidence was played to the jury and they were provided with similarly edited transcript to be used during the playing of the video. The jury did not retain either the video or the transcript as exhibits. HA was also called vive voce for further examination in chief and cross examination to a limited extent in accordance with a ruling by the learned trial judge. No complaint is made about the adoption of these procedures. 
     
      
    9 When HA arrived at the clinic both the appellant and Grace were present. In the past it had been her practice to strip to her bra and pants for treatment which was administered as she lay prone on a massage table which had a “face hole” and was situated within a curtained cubicle. If needed, her bra could be undone whilst she was in the forward position and it was not required that she “ever sort of sit up and be naked”. 
     
      
    10 On this occasion, as had happened previously, there was some banter between HA and Grace about modesty. HA said that she felt comfortable with the appellant and Grace as a result of their earlier treatments and she therefore stripped to her underpants and lay on the table. She was aware that thereafter she would, as a matter of routine, be covered with a sheet. 
     
      
    11 The treatment was commenced and administered by the appellant. After about 10 minutes Grace called out that she was going on a bus to the Town Hall in order to cast a vote in the election and she departed. The appellant continued with the massage. 
     
      
    12 The evidence of HA describing what happened thereafter was, not surprisingly, discursive, but extracts identify the material available to be relied upon by the jury in respect of the counts. 
     
      
    13 She testified that she realized the modesty sheet must have come off. She became conscious that the appellant was kneading her bottom cheek and, although she was disturbed by this, she thought she was being “paranoid” and responded to his enquiry that she was fine. She spoke of sensing a fluid motion and that she “felt him getting closer ….to my bottom crack and on the third time he actually went inside and on the fourth time he actually passed over my anus …”. 
     
      
    14 What happened thereafter she described in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “Then he pulled my underpants down to the bottom part of my bottom so that my entire bottom was exposed. And at this point I’m feeling completely exposed, this had never happened before. And he started with each hand, like one on each bottom cheek again massaging. Then he was doing it at the same time and he kind of stopped when his fingers were really close again to my anus or inside my bottom crack and he kind of stopped and then he pulled them – like pulled my bottom cheeks part and kind of held it for two or three seconds then started massaging again. And that happened, I think maybe three times.” 
        
       
      
    15 HA said that she felt completely exposed and like someone was “taking advantage” of her but she “couldn’t do anything about it” and she let him take her underpants off. She was then asked these questions and gave these answers: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Had your underpants ever been taken off on any of your previous massages? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. While I’m asking that question had anything like this that you’ve described so far in relation to touching in your bottom crack near your anus-- 
        
       
       
        
        A. On top of my anus, over my anus. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. ---occurred, on top of your anus, had any of that occurred on previous occasions? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say on top of or over your anus, what do you mean? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He didn’t penetrate into it because it was a fluid motion but his fingers went over my anus.” 
        
       
      
    16 This evidence was available to the jury in support of the allegation in count 1. She was then asked about the continuation of the treatment. She described the appellant massaging to the point of her inner thigh “just before my vagina he again paused and kind of opened me up and paused there for two or three seconds and then continued on the same massage path. And he did this two or three times.” She was asked what happened then and she replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. And then he put his hand again on my left bottom cheek, he’s – I presume he’s left handed, I don’t know. One hand was there, the other hand was still sort of doing massage and touch and he went from my inner thigh up past my vagina, past my – on the inside of my bottom cheek up to kind of just above my bottom on the coccyx area and then back down again. That was the first time. The second time he did it he went up and I felt him touch my pubic hair on the outside of my vagina and he sort of got closer onto to my anus as well and then he came back again. And the third and fourth time he touched the inside of my vagina flaps, he touched my clitoris, my labia, he went right up to where my bottom is, went up through my bottom crack over my anus up to the top bit and came back down again.” 
        
       
      
    17 That evidence was available to support the conviction on count 2. In the light of the finding of guilt on that count, no verdict was taken on the alternative count 3. 
     
      
    18 HA further testified in relation to count 4 and I extract the following from the transcript. The emphases are added. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What’s the next thing you remember happening after that third and fourth occasion that his hand went in the way you’ve described? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yep, then he momentarily stopped. I still felt him next to the table, I still felt him quite close but he stopped and so then I started thinking right it’s over it’s over you can get up and go, and then he put either hand – one hand on each side of my bottom and kind of tilted my pelvis a little bit forward, and the next thing I felt was like a point, a pointy thing at my vagina and I immediately thought that I was about to get raped and I thought it was a penis. The next second though  
        I felt like a pressure in the space of my inner thighs and my vagina 
         in that space between your legs, and I felt like a full pressure and I realised it was his face, and I felt his kind of cheeks and his forehead in that whole area in between my legs. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What made you think it was a person’s first of all skin as opposed to something else? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Because that area was so full of fluid and cream and stuff it kind of stuck, and first he’s got the sort of face that I just felt his cheeks, kind of chubby cheeks, just against my thighs, and the shape of a face was in there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Could you tell anything in terms of sensation as to whether what was touching you felt cold or hot or in between, or you’re not able to say? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No because the second that  
        my subconscious kind of worked out what that pressure was in between my legs 
         that was like the tipping point for me and that was the moment where thank goodness something inside of me just snapped, and it broke me out of that kind of paralysis and I got up and the next thing I knew I was at the end of the table and I was in like a little ball and I covered my breasts up and my privates up and the modesty sheet thing was still there because – all I know is that I had it and I was kind of using that to cover me with this hand, and I had this hand out in like a defensive thing, and that was – and I - 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re indicating over your left arm with your elbow bent holding your fingers -- 
        
       
       
        
        A. Out like -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. --palm out splayed? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah, just – and that was the point where I kind of took the control back, and I, and he knew that too. It was the moment when he didn’t have the control any more. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where was David the accused at that point when you jumped into the ball, curled into the ball? 
        
       
       
        
        A. So after that happened it was pretty quick that I got up and I still had my kind of back to him but I sensed, I don’t know whether he was on the table or he was still next to me,  
        I don’t know what happened when his face was there 
        , but he kind of came back to the side again, and that’s the next thing I know is that he was right at the side of my again….” 
        
       
      
    19 HA gave evidence that following this the appellant made certain inculpatory statements, she donned some of her clothing and fled across the road to her flat where she complained to CB. She also spoke by telephone to others including GY who was out of the city at the time but returned after speaking to her and the happening was reported to police. In the meantime Grace had sent a text message which HA ignored. It is not necessary to advert to these matters for the purpose of determining the ground of appeal.  
     
      
    20 There is ample authority directing the approach to be taken when such a ground is advanced. In MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 in the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ it was stated (at page 367): 
     
      
       
        
        “Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted.  
        R v Wilkinson 
         [1970] Crim LR 176. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury  
        Hayes v The Queen 
         (1973) 47 ALJR 603 at 604-605. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge’s instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt  
        R v Andrews Weatherfoil Ltd 
         (1971) 56 Cr App R 31 at 40.” 
        
       
      
    21 In MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 the High Court of Australia put an end to some debate about the principle delineated in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and the correctness of an understanding of it as revealed in R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82. In the course of so doing it was observed (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ) at page 617: 
     
      
       
        
        “Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury’s decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasized in  
        MacKenzie. 
         They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, ever juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant’s evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant’s evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others.” 
        
       
      
    22 The appellant’s submission was that the verdicts do not pass the test of logic and reasonableness as contemplated in MacKenzie. In respect of all counts convictions could only follow an acceptance of the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant and it was submitted that the most likely explanation for the mixed verdicts was an impermissible compromise. Reference was made to the comment of the trial judge in his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury was given a direction in accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        Markuleski 
        , but nevertheless rejected the complainant’s evidence in respect of the third charge. It is difficult to see how they could have done this while accepting the evidence in respect of the first two charges, as the complainant’s credit was the main issue in respect of all three charges.” 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour made some further observations about the timing of the trial and the imminent holiday (the jury retired and returned their verdict on 19 December 2007) and the possible motives and qualities of witnesses which led him to conclude that there was “a possibility that the verdict may be unsafe and unsatisfactory”. 
     
      
    24 I would respectfully disagree with that conclusion and I am persuaded that an analysis comfortably demonstrates that there was a rational basis for the jury to discriminate and return a verdict of not guilty on count 4 whilst being satisfied to the necessary standard upon AH’s evidence in support of counts 1 and 2. 
     
      
    25 As the extracts of testimony which I have recited show, the touchings which were elemental to counts 1 and 2 were unequivocally described by the complainant. In contrast, her description of the perceptions giving rise to the allegations comprehended in count 4 lacked the same positivity. As can be seen in the expressions to which I have added emphasis, AH spoke of perceiving “like a pressure” and that it was her “subconscious kind of worked out what the pressure was”. 
     
      
    26 The jury had been directed that it was essential that the Crown prove an (unlawful) touching and it can readily be appreciated how a doubt may be entertained as to whether there was in fact any contact when considering this count. 
     
      
    27 Her initial impression when this stage had been reached of a “pointy thing” which she thought was a penis was incorrect, and there was no suggestion that it might have been correct. Insofar as she thought that “the shape of a face was in there” it was an express submission of trial counsel for the appellant that the jury would doubt her certainty about this. The acceptance of that submission would lead to an acquittal on count 4 but would in no way affect any conclusion which the jury may have reached as to guilt on counts 1 and 2.  
     
      
    28 It can further be observed that it was specifically put to AH that in applying massage to the legs the appellant would use his hands and elbow, a proposition which she accepted. She also acknowledged that in those circumstances the appellant, when using his elbow, would consequently have his head near to where he was applying pressure. In the light of the references by the complainant to her subconscious “working out” what was happening, it would be entirely within the scope of rational judgment for the jury to consider that the possibility existed that, although the appellant’s head was in the near vicinity, any feeling which the complainant sensed was caused by contact of the elbow as an incident of the application of legitimate massage thus leading to an acquittal on count 4. 
     
      
    29 That situation is entirely compatible with the complainant being uncertain as to matters of detail, a circumstance expressly contemplated as a possible factor leading to different verdicts in the discussion in MFA. 
     
      
    30 The ground of appeal is not sustained and I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    31 I turn to the Crown appeal against sentence. It was imposed on 27 March 2008. On count 1 the appellant was ordered to enter a bond for a period of 5 years pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 with conditions that he appear if called upon, be of good behaviour and advise the Registrar of the District Court in writing of any change of residential address. On count 2 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 months suspended upon entering a bond upon conditions in the same terms as the bond on count 1 with the addition of a further term that he not work as a masseur either on a paid or unpaid basis in the clinic at which the offence occurred. 
     
      
    32 The restraints which operate against the exercise of power to intervene and increase sentence on Crown appeals are well established and do not require recapitulation. Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295; Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665, Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321. It is also established that the Court has a “lively discretion” not to intervene even if error has been shown: for example R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42. 
     
      
    33 The facts of the offences have sufficiently been summarized in dealing with the conviction appeal. The Crown’s comprehensive submission was that the learned sentencing judge made “several appealable errors and manifestly inadequate sentences were passed as a result”. 
     
      
    34 The first error alleged is that his Honour failed properly to determine and have regard to the objective seriousness of the offence. It is complained that his Honour understated the actual conduct constituting the charge in count 2. The extracts from the testimony of HA above quoted are by no means the entirety of what was said as the witness, understandably, tendered extensive descriptions of what she thought and felt she was experiencing. His Honour, obviously endorsing as his own finding what he stated that the jury must have found, expressed the view that the offence of sexual intercourse without consent fell “almost at the extreme lowest level” of seriousness. As is the case, several categories of sexual penetration are within the statutory definition and his Honour was obliged to consider where the facts in this case lay in the spectrum from the worst to the least serious: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447.  
     
      
    35 In written submissions the Crown referred to his Honour’s finding and contended that “his Honour went on to speak of the minimal degree of physical interference involved”. In fact, before remarking on that aspect and immediately following the finding about the level of seriousness he expressed the qualification “that is not to say that the distress caused to the complainant was not significant”. He referred to her statements about the psychological impact the offences had had on her. 
     
      
    36 It was complained that his Honour determined the level of objective seriousness “before” having regard to the factor of breach of trust which would elevate the seriousness of the offence. As that expression reveals it is not contended that his Honour ignored or overlooked the factor of breach of trust. In his remarks he specified the relationship between masseur and the customer was one of trust and, again in apparent adoption as a finding of his own, he said that the jury must have found that the appellant had abused his position as such a masseur. The mere sequence of his Honour’s remarks leads to no conclusion that he determined the level of seriousness without taking the matter of breach of trust into account. 
     
      
    37 The evidence does not demonstrate that the finding that the seriousness was almost (emphasis added) at the extreme lowest level was wrong and it was a judgment within the ambit of the sound exercise of his Honour’s function. 
     
      
    38 The second submission was that his Honour took into account the possibility of deportation and that this was impermissible. The appellant’s situation was that he has resided in Australia since 1990, has an adult daughter here, and has been in a relationship with Grace for some years. He is 52 years of age. In early 2007 he applied for citizenship and has been informed that the application has been approved. His citizenship has not been granted and the outcome of these proceedings may affect the decision. His Honour referred to cases at some length, in particular The Queen v Shrestha (1991) 173 CLR 48 and R v Mirzaee [2004] NSWCCA 315. Each of those cases, although dealing with different State legislation, was focussed upon not discriminating against potential deportees in setting a minimum custody element of a sentence of imprisonment. I would question the correctness of his Honour’s conclusion that the latter case in particular is authority for proposition that the threat of deportation is a relevant factor “if technically an additional punishment, at least something which increases the seriousness of the consequences of the sentence that is imposed”. Both cases were about not taking potential deportation into account and provided no basis for applying the converse. 
     
      
    39 In R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 Wood CJ at CL (Hislop and Johnson JJ concurring): 
     
      
       
        
        “ It is established principle that the fact of deportation is irrelevant as a sentencing consideration, it being a matter exclusively for the Executive Government:  
        R v Jap  
        NSWCCA 20 July 1998 and  
        R v Latumetan and Murwanto 
         [2003] NSWCCA 70. Moreover the High Court has held that a foreign national should receive the benefit of being eligible for release on parole:  
        Shrestha v The Queen 
         (1991) 173 CLR 48 at 71 per Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ. 
        
       
       
        
        The fact that the Respondent would be or might be deported to Vietnam, was accordingly an immaterial factor in structuring a sentence in this case and error would be demonstrated if it could be established that it became a factor in determining any aspect of the sentence including the selection of an appropriate commencement date.” 
        
       
      
    40 This appeal is not a suitable vehicle for determination of any perceived dispute or doubt about principle. This is because, despite his Honour’s vigorous expressions of views, there is no indication that he took the possibility of deportation into account by reduction of a sentence which he otherwise would have imposed nor that the structure of sentences was affected by such a factor. 
     
      
    41 Next it was submitted that his Honour failed to take into account the appellant’s prior conduct. His record had one entry of a conviction for indecent assault in the Local Court on 25 August 2000 when he was fined and placed on a good behaviour bond for 4 years. However, on 12 December 2000 in the District Court the sentences were quashed and in lieu thereof there was substituted a finding of guilt and without proceeding to conviction. The appellant was required pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for one year. 
     
      
    42 As his Honour noted, he was handicapped by the absence of a transcript of reasons of the Judge in the District Court proceedings, the relevant tapes having apparently been destroyed. It was not contended that what was revealed was a statutory aggravating factor there being no prior conviction: R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285. It was contended that the prior behaviour operated to deprive the appellant of leniency which he might otherwise claim. The Crown observed that it was difficult to see what findings of fact of lower seriousness there might have been other than those of the magistrate. The record of the Local Court described a brief placing of a hand upon the (clothed) breast of a 17 year old customer. 
     
      
    43 His Honour noted that he could not determine from the surviving records whether the appeal to the District Court was “all grounds” or against severity only. It had been a defended trial in the Local Court. The elaboration about this matter was obviously in response to submissions which had been made by the respective counsel, however, the submission by counsel for the appellant that there is nothing in the remarks on sentence or for that matter in the record of proceedings which suggests that his Honour treated the appellant as a first offender or a person of prior unblemished character was correct.  
     
      
    44 Finally it was submitted that his Honour determined to suspend the sentence on count 2 before setting the length of term: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. An examination of his Honour’s remarks discloses expression in this order, that a custodial sentence on count 2 was required, that he would not impose a bond under s 9 as he intended on count 1 by reason of the nature of the offence on count 2, that there need not be a fulltime custodial sentence and that he proposed to direct a sentence but that it should be suspended for its term. 
     
      
    45 Immediately following this statement he imposed a sentence of 10 months imprisonment and made the order for suspension. There was no earlier reference to an extent of term. It is difficult to accept that his Honour had not, in those circumstances, assessed the term before he expressed the actual imposition. There is no basis for conclusion that there was any adjustment of the term in order to enable suspension and I am unpersuaded that the circumstances provoke any intervention by this Court. 
     
      
    46 Counsel for the appellant has pointed to the brevity of the incident, the lack of violence or force, the limited degree of penetration and the nature of it, the level of gravity in the breach of trust, the cessation of behaviour when the complainant resisted. These were needed to be balanced against the elemental conduct involved in the offences and the consequences upon the victim together with matters such as specific and general deterrence. 
     
      
    47 Ultimately, in my opinion it cannot be concluded that the impositions lay outside the sound exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion, and the individual complaints by the Crown have not demonstrated that the sentences are tainted by error which requires substitution of greater sentence. 
     
      
    48 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Appeal by the appellant against conviction dismissed. 
      
     (ii) Crown appeal against sentence dismissed. 
     
      
    49 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove J. With respect to the Crown appeal it is correct the Crown submitted that the complainant was in a vulnerable position and the offence involved a serious breach of trust. Although a more severe penalty may have been appropriate the sentence which his Honour imposed is not such that I am persuaded, having regard to the principles relevant to a Crown appeal, this Court should intervene. 
     
      
    50 BLANCH J: I agree with the remarks of Grove J and the further remarks of McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    51 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly, the orders of the Court are as proposed by Grove J.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused Thiah Ang is charged with the murder of his wife Chui Yuke Ang and wounding Nicholas Ang, his son, then aged 15 years, with intent to murder him. On arraignment on 19 May 2008 he pleaded not guilty to both charges. It is undisputed, indeed indisputable, that at the time of the incidents giving rise to these charges on 3 February 2007 Mr Ang was suffering from a very severe mental illness which may be described in psychiatric language as major depression with psychotic features. 
     
      
    2 The relevant facts and circumstances are not controversial. Indeed, they were set out in a statement of agreed facts signed by Senior Counsel for the Crown and Counsel for the defence. There is no doubt that the accused killed his wife and attempted to kill his son. It cannot be doubted that he attacked them because (in lay language) he was mad. His madness allowed him some level of reasoning. For example, he was aware that in order to kill them he needed implements. He knew where the hammer and knife which he ultimately used were. He knew how to wield them. He was aware of his physical surroundings. However, his depression and psychosis were such that in every relevant sense it may be said that he lived in a world of his own, a world which the lay person finds it almost impossible to conceptualise, a world in which life was so bleak, the future so despairing, and present existence so painful that it led this man who loved his wife and his son, to wish to kill them and take his own life. This is not at all one of those cases where an estranged husband kills his family and himself in an act of extreme defiance and anger. 
     
      
    3 The accused was examined by a number of highly competent and well-respected psychiatrists: on behalf of the Crown by Dr Lisa Brown and Dr Stephen Allnutt and on behalf of the defence by Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr Bruce Westmore. Also called by the Crown was Dr Cook, who in his role as a consultant for Justice Health, treated the accused when he was brought in to prison after he was released from the Prince of Wales Hospital, where he was taken following his attack on his wife and son, and because he had attempted to commit suicide. Other psychological assessments were made to which I do not need to advert.  
     
      
    4 All doctors are agreed that the accused suffered from a disease of the mind which gravely affected his understanding of what he was doing and his ability to reason about what he was doing. There is unanimity of opinion that he was suffering from a substantial impairment of his ability to reason. The issue, however, upon which the doctors called by the Crown differ with those called by the defence is whether he was mentally ill at the time within the meaning of s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 which provides –  
     
      
       
        
        “38( 
        1) If, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) If a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is returned at the trial of a person for an offence, the Court may remand the person in custody until the making of an order under section 39 in respect of the person.” 
         
        
       
      
    5 Crucially, the question here is whether the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from a disease of the mind as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. 
     
      
    6 It is clear that the accused was aware of the quality and nature of what he was doing, namely, killing his wife and attempting to kill his son. The real question is whether he knew that what he was doing was wrong. As I have said, upon this matter the doctors are divided. It is fair to say, however, that both Dr Allnutt and Dr Brown agree that if he did know that what he was doing was wrong the knowledge was marginal and his ability to act on it extremely limited. 
     
      
    7 The issue is very much a matter of fact and degree and, although doctors Allnutt and Brown in the end concluded (because of matters to which I will refer in due course), that the accused did know that what he was doing was wrong, that finding was on a continuum only just separated from the border that carried into the defence of mental illness. If the Crown bore the onus of establishing that the accused was not innocent by reason of mental illness, the evidence would not have permitted a finding in favour of the Crown. However, the onus in this respect is upon the defence. Before such a verdict can be brought in it is necessary that the accused establish on the balance of probabilities that he is not guilty by virtue of his mental illness. I should say at once that I am completely satisfied that the accused is not guilty by virtue of mental illness either of the murder of his wife or the attempted murder of his son. I think I should, in justice, add that I do not only think that probably this is the case, I am quite certain that it is the case. I need to set out some of the facts to show why I have been brought to this conclusion.  
     
      
    8 As I have mentioned, Chui Yuke Ang was the wife of the accused and lived with him and their only child in a suburb of Sydney. The accused at the time of the offence was 52 years of age and had been born and raised in Malaysia. He had met his wife in 1983 and they married two years later. Following 13 years of residence in New Zealand they came to Australia. Their son was born in New Zealand in 1991 and accompanied them here. The accused was educated in Malaysia where he obtained a diploma in accounting and worked as an accountant in New Zealand. He was an accountant in Australia for something over two years when he resigned from his job. He was unemployed and unable to obtain work from that date. He undertook studies whilst unemployed, attending TAFE and obtaining a diploma in property management. He also completed a course at the University of New England and obtained a bachelor degree in training and development, hoping that this would enhance his job prospects.  
     
      
    9 The accused came to believe his attempt to find employment was hopeless and this was one of the major factors in his depression. It is important to note, however, that his depression was not caused by the difficulties that he experienced; rather those difficulties fed into a deep seated illness, known as major depression, the essence of which is that the person is unable to see the world in any hopeful or optimistic way and feels overwhelmed by any difficulties which come his way.  
     
      
    10 The history given by the accused to all the doctors was, broadly speaking, consistent. It is not subject to controversy. The family was an apparently happy one. Although the accused had done well at his studies at first, by the later part of 2006 he noted that his mood was sad, his sleep was not sound, he was more hot tempered, there were arguments with his wife and son. However, his weight was stable, his appetite remained normal and his energy levels and motivation remained adequate, he was performing well at university getting High Distinctions. Things markedly changed for him in September 2006, when he started having problems with his neighbours. He said that they began to make a lot of noise by turning music up loudly and preventing him from concentrating on his studies. He thought they were doing this deliberately to annoy him and interfere with his studies. In November 2006, he began to think they were spying on him through the television because each time he went upstairs or downstairs the music would come on. He concluded that his neighbours had placed a camera in the smoke alarm or the television. He covered the alarm with a piece of paper and started avoiding the TV. He believed that he was being observed through it. He was unable to say what might be his neighbour's motives for harassing him this way, but he certainly believed it to be so. By the end of the year he had only just passed his exams without achieving any distinction. He felt very bad. He believed he was being constantly watched and felt sad. His sleep remained poor but now his energy levels were reduced and he got tired more easily. He argued with his wife frequently about trivial matters. He felt more anxious about being watched all the time.  
     
      
    11 The accused’s paranoia led to the family moving to Mascot in January 2007 to get away from the neighbours but he believed that his new neighbours, again through the television and the windows, were watching him. He installed additional curtains and blinds for privacy but thought he was being watched through the smoke alarms. He continued to feel bad and sad. There was no doubt, I think, that by February his condition had worsened. He was frankly delusional and paranoid; he thought about suicide.  
     
      
    12 On the day in question, when the accused woke up, he had slept poorly and believed he had a cold and felt tired, but had no thought of suicide, or homicide for that matter. He spent the morning lying around the house. He felt miserable. His son returned home at about 3.30pm and he spoke to him for a while. His wife returned home at 6pm and they cooked dinner. The family ate dinner as usual. He did not speak much at dinner but there were no arguments or disagreements. He watched television and a DVD. He felt very tired. He said that at this time although he watched television he was not experiencing being watched by neighbours. His son went to bed at 9pm and he remained on the couch and continued to watch television. The accused and his wife went to bed about 10pm. She asked him to make love to her and they had sex, although he was not in the mood for it. His wife fell asleep. He could not sleep and went back to the lounge to watch television. He felt very sad. He now believed that the neighbours were watching him. He told Dr Brown, ""I feel like life was not worth carrying on, that nothing was working for me"". For the first time that day he had thought of killing himself and thought, if he killed himself, he would leave his wife and son behind feeling very sad. He thought he should take them with him and end it all so they would not have to face the hardship and sadness of life. He never thought of any other options. He said he never thought about whether it was right or wrong. He felt it was the right thing to do. Dr Nielssen said (and this was echoed in evidence by the other doctors) that the accused acted out of a kind of mad altruism. Of course these were feelings that no one in their right mind could possibly have entertained.  
     
      
    13 Having made the decision to kill his wife and son and himself, the accused went to the kitchen and obtained a hammer and a knife. He took the hammer, as he said, to knock his wife and son unconscious as he did not want them to feel any pain when he killed them. This, he said, was because he loved them. He said he first went in to the bedroom where his wife was sleeping, he walked up to the bed and hit her on the head with the hammer. He said he was not really thinking anything at that time but felt bad about what he was doing. Then he stabbed her. She struggled. He said he just wanted to get it over and done with. She stopped moving. The accused was unable to describe his feelings at the time. He then went in to his son's room but his son was awake. He told his son that he had to die because there were evil people after him, and he was doing this it to make life easier. Whether he actually believed at the time that there were bad people outside the house, as he told his son, is uncertain.  
     
      
    14 The nature of the events themselves, the post traumatic stress disorder which the accused suffered following the events, which of course were horrendously violent and which involved what I am persuaded was a very serious attempt at suicide substantially contributed to confusion and unclear recollections of what happened. There may be some confabulation. I think that his accounts, seemingly ordered, are misleadingly so. It is important to remember that, by the time the accused gave those accounts, he had been under treatment and medication for some time. One of the doctors described the need for the healthy mind to order the world and to understand experiences, so that memories then become reconstructed, quite unconsciously. We know this is true in our own experience. I do not doubt that this was also operating in the accused. This means that one must be cautious about attributing to his account a clarity of understanding and recollection which is rather more apparent than real. 
     
      
    15 The accused’s son, after a struggle, took the hammer from him. The accused produced the knife, there was a fight over the knife, he managed to get the hammer back, he stabbed his son and punched him. His son said to him that he did not want to die or that he wanted to live. At this point the accused said that ""I couldn't do it any more"", and he desisted from any further attack. His son said in his statement to police that, at this time, the accused got in to bed with him and lay down beside him. He started to talk, saying –  
     
      
       
        
        “It's okay. I'm sorry. Don't hate me for what I have done. Everything is going to be okay. I am so sorry. Bad people have framed me. Contact your aunties and uncles and mother's boss and tell them what happened. They will take care of you and you need to live your life. Your mother and I have decided it will be better this way. I am going to my room to call an ambulance and write a letter. I am also going to kill myself.” 
        
       
      
     16 I think it is worth observing that, although these words are given by the son in his statement as a narrative, I rather doubt that the utterances occurred in this way. I accept that something very like this was indeed said by the accused to his son, but it is necessary to be cautious about assuming too much about the mode in which these things were said. The context of this conversation shows how bizarre it really is: the accused has badly injured his son, who is bleeding severely; he does nothing to help his son; he does nothing to bind any wound; he lies next to his injured son and has a conversation about how necessary it all is and that he is going to kill himself. There is no sense of urgency about getting an ambulance. The accused tries to explain what has been done to his son by referring to two significant delusions: the first that there were bad people who had framed him, that there were bad people outside; and the second is that he and his wife had decided that it would be better that they should all die than live in the terrible world (which the ill state of his mind created for him). 
     
      
    17 Dr Allnutt and Dr Brown pointed to this conversation as suggesting that the accused knew that what he was doing was wrong. I am unable to accept that explanation. To my mind, there is not a hint of understanding that what he was doing was wrong. He certainly was thinking about what would happen to his son, wanting to explain to his son why he was acting in the way he was, and telling him about the terrible world in which he was (in the event) going to permit his son to live. But this is very far from any knowledge that what he was doing was wrong. To the contrary, I think it shows that he was completely convinced that he had to act as he did and wanted his son to understand the reasons. 
     
      
    18 In all of these circumstances, I do not believe that the accused thought he was doing anything wrong. The fact that he desisted from his attack because, as he said, he could not do it, is due, I think, to the conflict that arose between his undoubtedly deep love for his son on the one hand (a powerful, if not overpowering, emotion) and the painful decision that he had made to kill him. An acknowledgement of this conflict of emotion and understanding is to my mind very far from a moral discourse in which occurred to him that what he was doing might be wrong. He gave his son a hug and said goodbye. I think this was an act of sadness; I suspect it was an act of despairing, it was certainly an act of farewell because he knew he was about to kill himself. I do not see how this statement shows a perception that what he was doing was wrong. On the contrary, I think it reflected a continuation of the decision that he had earlier made and was a confirmation of the rightness of what he was doing. I think, in short, that the accused acted as he did because he was unable by virtue of his illness to perceive that he was doing might be wrong. 
     
      
    19 To continue the narrative. The accused went back to his bedroom and indeed called “000”. He first connected with the Ambulance Service. He gave his address. He did not seek any help for his son or for that matter for himself. Obviously because, in the latter case, he had decided he was going to commit suicide, but also I think because so far as his son was concerned he was unable to think that something should then be done to help him. He asked immediately to be connected to the police. He said to the operator, ""I have just killed my wife and son. I am killing myself"". He was asked, ""You have killed your wife and son?"" He said, ""Yeah, I'm not sure whether he's dead or not but I can't do it any more. I want to die. I do not want to talk any more"". He was not, as it happened, transferred to the police. He was told by the operator the police would be sent.  
     
      
    20 The police came to the premises shortly after. The accused's son answered the door after about ten minutes or so. There was a large amount of blood over his face and the blood was running down his body. The police obviously thought that he might be a suspect for some serious crime and treated him accordingly but not, I think, inappropriately. He was attended eventually by ambulance personnel. The accused and his wife were on adjacent single beds. The accused had a knife in his hand with a severe wound to his neck. He was still alive though semiconscious. The deceased had massive injuries to the neck and was obviously dead. The accused was taken to Prince of Wales Hospital. In the ambulance he said he had hurt his wife and son. He was plainly anaemic from loss of blood by the time he arrived. (I interpolate that one of the reasons Dr Brown gave for thinking that the accused may have had some capacity to know right from wrong was that she thought his suicide attempt was not serious because she thought he was only slightly injured. It is clear that this opinion is mistaken. The neck injury was severe and had only just missed a major blood vessel.) The accused was scheduled as a mentally ill patient and remained at the hospital for some little time after having been operated on in the early hours of the morning of 3 February 2007. He went to Long Bay Prison on 7 February where he was seen by Dr Cook. Dr Cook concluded that he was severely mentally ill at that point. With medication and other assistance he gradually improved. 
     
      
    21 Before attempting to kill himself he had written a note on a used envelope. It read –  
     
      
       
        
        “Police. I have just killed my wife and son who is bleeding with hammer blows and knife wound. My hand is hurt so this is bad writing.”  
        
       
      
    22 He signed it. On the envelope was the marks of fluid and also a thumb print in blood. Next to these the accused had written, ""My saliva as proof of this (right first finger)"". This was not the act of a sane man. 
     
      
    23 The accused's son had suffered bruising and swelling to his right ear, extensive bruising to his scalp and face, lacerations to the scalp and, the right side of the neck, bruising to the right upper arm, marks and bruising to the right arm and wrist, bruising and scratch marks to the left arm, scratches and bruising to the chest and shoulder areas. To my mind these injuries provide eloquent evidence of the ferocious attack made on him by the accused, then in what I am convinced was the throes of an overwhelming mental disturbance. 
     
      
    24 The accused was seen by police and gave a record of interview. It is unnecessary for present purposes for me to refer to the details of it. They are not significantly different from what I have already said were the circumstances as the accused recalled them.  
     
      
    25 I do not intend to analyse the medical evidence in detail. All doctors are agreed as to the severe mental illness suffered by the accused. Doctors Brown and Allnutt pointed to various matters which in their judgment indicated that he had some capacity of moral understanding. In substance, they were the conversation with his son, the farewell to his son, the writing of the suicide note, and his desisting from his attack on his son. I have dealt already with my view of these matters and what facts can reasonably be inferred from them, except for the note. It is sufficient I think to say of the note that it is a flat statement of fact. I do not see that it suggests any understanding by the accused that what he had done was wrong. It was just, I think, a tidying up by someone who had come to the end of his tether, who wanted to be done with the world, and who was passing on, as it were, future responsibility for the circumstances which he had brought about to authorities: he was a law abiding accountant. 
     
      
    26 I am persuaded by the evidence of Dr Nielssen and Dr Westmore that the accused did not have the capacity to understand that what he was doing was wrong. He felt it was right but did not have the means, because of his psychosis and major depression, to come to any other conclusion or to consider any other possibility. Whether it is necessary to go quite so far is not entirely clear. One formulation of the M’Naghten defence proposed first by Sir Owen Dixon, (restated on other occasions) is that the defence is made out ""when the accused cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness as to the moral quality of what he is doing"". By any standard that was this accused. I am satisfied that his condition was far worse than that. 
     
      
    27 For these reasons, I consider that at the time he killed his wife and at the time he attacked his son the accused was not guilty by reason of mental illness of the offences which otherwise may have been committed. Accordingly, I enter a special verdict pursuant to s 38 of the Act. 
     
      
    28 It is necessary now to consider what orders are appropriate under s 39 of the Act and for that purpose I will give appropriate directions for a further hearing. ADJOURNED TO FRIDAY 4 JULY 2008 AT 10AM.

      14521/08 THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES v WINTER 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff filed a summons on 29 August 2008 seeking an order that the defendant, Christopher Paul Winters, be subject to an extended supervision order pursuant to s 9(1)(a) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 for a period of five years. 
     
      
    2 I have previously considered applications by the plaintiff in relation to Mr Winters. The first of those applications sought a continuing detention order which I made last year for a period of 12 months. The 12 month period has now expired and, as I understand it, by reason of Mr Winters’ progress in effective treatment programs, the plaintiff no longer seeks his continued detention. 
     
      
    3 The continuing detention order has now expired and on 9 September 2008 I made an order for his release under supervision on an interim basis pursuant to s 8(1) of the Act. I renewed that order on 7 October 2008. 
     
      
    4 There is agreement between the parties that it is now appropriate for me to make an extended supervision order pursuant to s 9(1)(a) of the Act. To this end, the parties have also agreed to the conditions which should be imposed by the court on that order which have been effectively included in a document headed “Risk Management Plan Applicable to Christopher Paul Winters”. The terms of that plan have been settled in court this morning and the document which carries amendment in my handwriting is the document which now reflects the agreement between the parties. 
     
      
    5 The plaintiff’s application is supported by a considerable volume of affidavit material including evidence from Darelle Williams, Professor David Greenberg, Viviane Fahs, Naomi Malhotra and Adam Simon. The State has also tendered and relies upon reports from Dr Jeremy O’Dea dated 15 October 2008 and Dr Stephen Allnutt dated 9 October 2008, who are psychiatrists appointed by the court under the Act to consult the defendant and provide assistance to the court. 
     
      
    6 The affidavit of Ms Malhotra affirmed on 6 November 2008 also annexes a report from Dr Andrew Ellis of Justice Health dated 4 November 2008 relating to the defendant’s anti-libidinal dosage. 
     
      
    7 The scheme of the legislation has been discussed in many judgments, including my first judgment in relation to the present defendant. The defendant is a serious sex offender within the meaning of the Act and was, at the time the application was made, in custody pursuant to a continuing detention order. 
     
      
    8 The court’s power to make an extended supervision order is provided, as I have indicated, by s 9(1)(a) of the Act. The test which the Act prescribes is in s 9(2) and is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.” 
        
       
      
    9 As I have already indicated, the defendant does not oppose the making of an extended supervision order. This, of course, does not foreclose the court’s consideration of the matter. However, having regard to the evidence, in particular, from the psychologists and psychiatrists who have considered the defendant’s situation, I am satisfied that the statutory test is fulfilled and it is appropriate for me to make the order. In particular, the evidence of Prof David Greenberg and Dr Jeremy O’Dea satisfies me that the test is made out in this case. 
     
      
    10 Professor Greenberg said, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am of the view that Mr Winters is at high risk to commit further serious sexual offences if he is not provided with adequate ongoing maintenance, support, supervision and treatment including adequate dosages of anti-libidinal medication and ongoing psychological treatment.” 
        
       
      
    11 Dr O’Dea has provided the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would appear that Mr Winters’ psychiatric status, and clinical and actuarial risk assessment and risk management issues, have not changed significantly from my assessment detailed in my report dated 9 July 2000 … Mr Winters would still fall in the category of sex offenders with a significantly high risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term.” 
        
       
      
    12 I am also mindful of the evidence of Dr Allnutt in reaching the conclusion which I have. 
     
      
    13 The parties are agreed that the court should make the order for a five year period and I propose to do this. Section 10(1) provides that maximum term for any order is a period of five years, although s 10(3) allows for further orders to be made upon the application of the plaintiff. 
     
      
    14 I should also indicate that the parties have given careful and extensive consideration to the appropriate conditions incorporated into the management plan. I am satisfied that those conditions are appropriate. 
     
      
    15 Accordingly, I make the following order: 
     
      
       
      1. Pursuant to s 9(1)(a) of the  
      Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act  
      2006 I make an extended supervision order in respect of the defendant for a period of five years to commence at 4.00 pm today, 6 November 2008, and pursuant to s 11 of the Act, I direct the defendant to comply with the conditions set out in the schedule which will be attached to my reasons for judgment and which, when the order is taken out, should be attached to the order. 
       
       
      2. I will further order that the interim order which I made on 7 October will terminate at 4.00 pm today when the order which I have made today will take effect.

    JUDGMENT (ex tempore) 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: James Natale Liprini died on 21 January 2005 leaving a Will dated 5 October 2001, probate of which was granted on 2 August 2005 to the defendant Allan Stephen Liprini. According to the inventory of property filed in support of the application for probate, the deceased left assets totalling about $1.18 million, and also had an interest as joint tenant in another real property, presumably with his wife, with whom he also shared, as joint tenants, two bank accounts. By summons filed on 18 July 2006, the plaintiff Kevin Liprini claimed an order under (NSW) Family Provision Act 1982, s 7, for provision for his maintenance and advancement in life out of the estate.  
     
      
    2 The defendant swore and served an affidavit, as required by then Supreme Court Rules, Pt 77 r 59, on 19 October 2006, in which he disclosed that, in accordance with provisions of the Will, sums totalling in excess of $658,000 had been transferred to the deceased's widow, and a real property worth $550,000 had been transferred to the defendant, and that the current value of the undistributed estate was only $30,000. 
     
      
    3 The proceedings were mediated before a Registrar of the Court on 6 December 2007, at which all parties were apparently represented by lawyers. The mediation was conducted in circumstances in which, according to the defendant, he was very ill and unable to comprehend what was proceeding. It is not necessary and would be indeed inappropriate, to determine on this application whether that was so and, if so, what consequences might follow; at this stage, in any event, no application has been made to set aside the orders which were made, by consent, on 6 December following the settlement, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
      (1) Order under s 7 of the  
      Family Provision Act 
       that provision be made in favour of the plaintiff out of the estate of the late James Natale Liprini in the sum of $750,000; 
       
        
       
      (2) That the plaintiff's costs, agreed in the sum of $20,000, be paid out of the estate of the late James Natale Liprini; and, 
       
        
       
      (3) Order that the defendants' costs be paid out of the estate of the deceased on an indemnity basis. 
       
      
    4 The Court also made a notation, which is not relevant for present purposes, as to an agreement on the part of the plaintiff to release a potential claim against another estate.  
     
      
    5 No sum has been paid to the plaintiff as a result of the orders made on 6 December 2007. The plaintiff's solicitors have corresponded with solicitors who then acted for the defendant, pressing for payment, to no avail. 
     
      
    6 On 3 March 2008, the plaintiff filed a motion claiming a declaration that the defendant is in contempt of orders (1) and (2) made on 6 December 2007, and an order that he be dealt with by the Court for contempt. The statement of charge that accompanied the motion was, in substance, that the defendant had failed to comply with the orders of 6 December 2007 in that he had failed to pay the plaintiff the sum of $750,000 required by order (1) and had failed to pay the costs agreed in the sum of $20,000 as required by order (2), and with knowledge of the orders had thereby breached the orders. The plaintiff invoked Supreme Court Rules, Pt 55 – that is, criminal contempt, shortly so called – and not enforcement proceedings for committal under Uniform Civil Procedure Rules, Pt 40, rr 6 and 7.  
     
      
    7 As expressed, the orders of 6 December 2007 do not require the defendant to do anything. They do not purport to be an order against the defendant obliging the defendant to do anything at all. In many types of proceedings, that would of itself be a serious defect which might present serious complications to enforcing the order, particularly by way of contempt. 
     
      
    8 However, such a form of order is not inconsistent with the effect that an order under Family Provision Act has, under s 14 which provides as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        (1) An order made by the Court for provision out of the estate of a deceased person (whether or not an order made in favour of an eligible person) shall, except in so far as the Court otherwise directs, take effect as if the provision had been made: 
         
          
          (a) where the deceased person died leaving a will – in a codicil to the will, or 
          (b) where the deceased person died intestate – in a will of the deceased person. 
          
         
        (2) The Court shall not direct that an order for provision out of the estate of a deceased person shall take effect otherwise than in the manner referred to in subsection (1) unless it is satisfied that compliance with the order will not adversely affect any creditor of the deceased person. 
        
       
      
    9 This provision was considered by Young J (as his Honour the Chief Judge then was) in Wentworth v Wentworth (NSWSC, 4 September 1991, unreported). His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        Section 14 of the  
        Family Provision Act 
         provides that an order under the Act is to take effect as if the order had been a codicil to the Will. The consequence is that for most purposes the way of enforcing an order under the Act is the same as if one had to enforce payment of a bequest under a Will, or a residuary gift. The way to do that is by commencing an administration suit, or in clear cases taking advantage of the summary procedure provided by the  
        Wills Probate and Administration Act 
        . 
        
       
      
    10 His Honour referred to some other cases in which a declining market had resulted in an estate becoming insufficient to meet the amount of the order as well as the legacies under the Will, with which the successful plaintiff ranked equally, those cases suggesting that in such a case, the order made by the Court and the legacies abated equally. His Honour observed that typically in such cases the executor went back to the Court to see if the order could be varied, and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        This indicates the way in which the Court has approached problems of enforcement under this Act. There is no judgment in the true sense of the word within the meaning of the  
        Supreme Court Rules 
        . All there is is an order in the nature of adding a codicil to the testator's Will.  
        
       
      
    11 In Wiblen v Feros (1998) 44 NSWLR 158, Windeyer J referred to the judgment of Russell LJ in In re Jennery [1967] 1 Ch 280 in relation to the proper method of enforcement of an order under (UK) Inheritance (Family Provision) Act 1938, in which his Lordship had said (at 268) that the rights of a successful applicant, when established by an order, had no greater effect than that of making that person the equivalent of a beneficiary under the Will:  
     
      
       
        
        I can find no resemblance, except the most superficial one, between an order made in this form under this Act and any order for payment which can be made the subject of an application for a four-day order. The proper step for a dependent to take is the ordinary step that a beneficiary in an estate has open to him if he or she is unable to get satisfaction from the trustees or personal representatives. But that is not the step that has been taken here… 
        
       
      
    12 Windeyer J observed (at 173): 
     
      
       
        
        In other words it was held that the order for provision was not a judgment or order for the payment of money, which could be enforced in the way such a judgment could be enforced, but was an order which could only be enforced by administration proceedings. That was the view taken by Young J in  
        Wentworth v Wentworth 
         (Young J, 4 September 1991, unreported) when he refused an application by the successful plaintiff in proceedings under the  
        Family Provision Act 
         to issue a writ of execution against the estate of the testator to enforce orders in her favour under that Act made by Bryson J. 
        
       
      
    13 More recently, in Gorman v Gorman; Estate late Jeanette Mary Gorman [2003] NSWSC 647, Young CJ in Eq, considering proceedings after judgment in a Family Provision Act matter, said (at [19]):  
     
      
       
        
        The matter is dealt with in  
        Wiblen v Feros 
         (1998) 44 NSWLR 158, 173, where, following something I had said in  
        Wentworth v Wentworth 
         4 September 1991, unreported, it was said that the way of dealing with the situation, where an order under the  
        Family Provision Act  
        is to be enforced, is to commence an administration suit, or, in clear cases, to take out a summons for payment of a legacy pursuant to s 84. 
        
       
      
    14 The cases which I have referred to make clear, if anything remained to be made clear in light of the terms of s 14, that an order made under the Family Provision Act for provision out of an estate is a unique form of order which in effect is not really a judgment or order of the Court at all. It has effect not as a court order, but as a codicil to the Will; and is to be enforced not as a court order but as a codicil, by the remedies which a beneficiary has against a defaulting executor. Such an order does not bind the executor, who is a defendant to the Family Provision Act proceedings, as an order for payment of money or to do an act or thing, but only in an indirect manner insofar as it imposes a new obligation in the trusts of the Will, to be enforced as such. 
     
      
    15 In my view, such an order binds the executor directly to do nothing. I readily accept that interference with the carrying into effect of a court's order, even indirectly, can in an appropriate case amount to a contempt of court. But that depends fundamentally on the nature of the order in question. I do not see how interference with an order, the effect of which is not a binding command of the Court, but one having the effect of altering a Will, could be such a contempt. Accordingly, I do not see how disobedience to or interference with the performance of such an order could be such a contempt. 
     
      
    16 For those reasons, I regard the present application as entirely misconceived. Even if there were ample funds in the estate with which to satisfy the order, it would still be misconceived.  
     
      
    17 I order that the motion be dismissed with costs.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence following an imposition before Hughes DCJ at the Campbelltown District Court. The applicant was found guilty by a jury of the offences of aggravated sexual assault in company and robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. After conviction his Honour proceeded to sentence, hence this application before the court. 
     
      
    2 It is common ground between the applicant and the Crown that it appears that his Honour and, indeed, everybody else at the relevant time, may have overlooked the circumstance that the applicant was aged but sixteen years at the time of the commission of the offences. Accordingly, it was mandatory for the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 to be brought into play. 
     
      
    3 As it is, to say the least, uncertain as to whether his Honour was alive to that circumstance, the Crown has indicated that it would consent to the orders sought by the applicant, which are that the matter in effect be remitted to his Honour for the purpose of clarification or resentence, if that is thought to be required. In any event, it would be undesirable for this court, if the matters to which I have referred are established, to act as a primary sentencing court and, in my view, the stance of the applicant and the Crown ought be responded to. 
     
      
    4 Accordingly, I propose the following orders:  
     
      
       
      That leave to appeal against sentence be granted. 
       
      That the appeal be allowed and the sentence imposed in the District Court quashed.  
       
      The matter be remitted to the District Court for resentence.  
       
      
    5 KIRBY: I agree. 
     
      
    6 HISLOP J: I also agree. 
     
      
    7 GROVE J: The orders of the court will there be as I have proposed. It is to be observed we did not quash the convictions so he can be retained in custody.

     POWCH, John v R 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: John Powch has been arraigned in the District Court on seven counts. As we understand the position at least two preliminary questions have been argued in respect to the conduct of the trial. 
     
      
    2 The first of those questions related to the admissibility of evidence of the relationship between the applicant and the complainant which the Crown had indicated it proposed to tender at the trial. The second question was whether or not, having regard to the nature of the individual counts, the trial of some of those counts should be separated. 
     
      
    3 The trial judge determined at this preliminary stage of the proceedings that the evidence of the relationship between the applicant and the complainant could be admissible at the trial. Her Honour also declined to grant the application for a separate trial. 
     
      
    4 A further application was made to her Honour seeking a stay of the matter pending an appeal to this Court pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Her Honour declined that application. As we understand it the jury has now been empanelled and the trial is proceeding. 
     
      
    5 Before this Court this morning the applicant seeks leave pursuant to s 5F(3) to agitate the application for a separate trial. The applicant has been arraigned on seven counts. Drawing upon her Honour's judgment the first three counts allege sexual assaults on the complainant occurring between dates in September 1998 to January 1999. The fourth count alleges an assault on the complainant occasioning actual bodily harm between dates in December 1998 and January 1999. The applicant submits that these four counts should be the subject of a separate trial.  
     
      
    6 Count 5 relates to an allegation that the applicant fired a firearm with disregard for the safety of the complainant. That action is alleged to have occurred between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2000, being a period of time separate from the earlier alleged offences. Although that alleged action plainly involves violence or an apprehension of violence, no sexual allegation is related to it. 
     
      
    7 The final two counts, 6 and 7, allege that on 3 July 2001 the applicant broke and entered the house of the complainant and committed a serious indictable offence therein, namely, assault occasioning actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation, and on the same date that the applicant detained the complainant with intent to hold her for advantage to himself. 
     
      
    8 Her Honour determined the question of the admissibility of the disputed evidence before dealing with the matter of a separate trial. The evidence, as I understand it, which the Crown proposes to tender, is of a relationship between the applicant and the complainant extending over many years and well before the alleged sexual assaults in 1998 and 1999.  
     
      
    9 The relationship, although it has existed at various times, has apparently been interrupted on occasions and at least one of those interruptions was for a significant number of years. 
     
      
    10 Her Honour determined that the evidence which the Crown foreshadowed would be admissible and furthermore determined that its prejudicial effect was not such that it should be excluded. 
     
      
    11 Counsel before this Court this morning has sought to agitate whether or not her Honour's ruling was correct. However, that is not a matter which arises in relation to this application which is confined to the question of a separate trial. Nevertheless, in some respects consideration of that material is, as counsel has indicated, relevant to the question of whether or not a separate trial should be afforded to the applicant. 
     
      
    12 To my mind the question before this Court must be determined having regard to the nature of the proceedings and mindful of the capacity for the trial judge to consider, at the point at which the relevant evidence is being tendered, whether or not it should be admitted and having regard to her Honour's capacity to provide appropriate directions to the jury both at the point at which any evidence is tendered and in her final directions. 
     
      
    13 The Crown submits that although it may be accepted that the evidence relevant to the allegations in counts 5, 6 and 7 does not suggest a sexual component to the applicant's conduct, nevertheless it is evidence which affords an understanding of the relationship between the applicant and the complainant which is frequented with violent episodes. The Crown submits that it would be relevant for the jury to understand the history of that relationship in determining at least some of the charges. 
     
      
    14 Prima facie, in my view, there is force to that argument. However, if the evidence is to be admitted it will be necessary for the trial judge to provide the jury with careful directions as to the way in which that evidence may be used. Evidence of violence towards the complainant on later occasions would be unlikely to have any relevance to whether or not she gave consent with respect to the earlier matters by way of allegations of sexual assault. 
     
      
    15 Notwithstanding the care with which the trial judge will be required to deal with these evidentiary matters, I am not presently persuaded that in the interests of justice a separate trial is necessary. If it happens that difficulties, which cannot presently be foreseen, arise and adequate directions cannot or are not given, the applicant of course would be able to bring the matter before this Court to seek appropriate orders. The conduct of the trial will not to my mind have any inevitable consequence leading to injustice to the applicant. 
     
      
    16 In the matter of Saunders, (1994) 72 A Crim R 347, this Court had occasion to consider an application for leave to appeal in relation to a question of whether or not there should be a separate trial. In that case the applicant had the benefit of a certificate from the trial judge. In the present case the trial judge has declined to grant a certificate.  
     
      
    17 Nevertheless, in entertaining the application in Saunders, Smart AJ with whom the Chief Justice and Studdert J agreed, was careful to point out the fact that this Court would look carefully at any application for leave. 
     
      
    18 His Honour said at 356: 
     
      
       
        
        “It should not be thought that this judgment provides the slightest encouragement for applications for leave to appeal against judgments given in trial counts on applications for separate trials. This case raised some important points of practice which had not previously been decided directly and the judge gave a certificate”. 
        
       
      
    19 The case before us this morning does not raise any important points of practice and to my mind is a case which in many respects has similarities with many cases where a series of charges are brought against an accused in relation to his actions, sexual or otherwise, towards another person. 
     
      
    20 As I have already said, although in such cases the trial judge is required to exercise great care before admitting any particular evidence and also exercise care in giving appropriate directions, I am not presently persuaded that in the present case those tasks may not be adequately attended to. 
     
      
    21 In my opinion the application for leave should be refused. 
     
      
    22 JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the Chief Judge and with the order proposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    23 HALL J: I also agree with the Chief Judge and the order proposed by him. 
     
      
    24 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly the application for leave is refused.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Blackmore DCJ at Sydney District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to a count of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon with which he inflicted grievous bodily harm upon the victim. The available prescribed maximum penalty for such an offence is twenty five years imprisonment. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of nine years and a balance term of three years commencing on 20 May 2005 upon which date the applicant completed serving a balance of parole in respect of an unrelated offence. He was subject to parole at the time of the commission of the instant offence.  
     
      
    2 The facts of the offence were agreed and reduced to writing. His Honour recited them at length in his remarks on sentence and it suffices for present purposes to epitomise them.  
     
      
    3 The victim was a young man aged twenty six years who had travelled from Britain to Australia on a working holiday. At about 9.30 pm on a Sunday evening he had gone to the vicinity of Petersham Railway Station to use a public telephone in order to ring his parents in Britain. He could see that the particular telephone was being used so he walked along the railway concourse and sat on a wall and while he was there he commenced to use a mobile phone to speak to his girlfriend in Sydney. 
     
      
    4 The applicant came up behind him armed with an iron bar and struck him in the head and face area. The applicant stole the mobile phone and decamped. The victim was seen and an ambulance called. He was treated in emergency at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He was found to have a large fracture from the right orbit through the nasal bones to the left side and operation was performed consisting of insertion of four plates across the fracture from left to right skull.  
     
      
    5 A little less than two hours after the offence the applicant was spoken to by police at Lewisham Railway Station where they found him to be aggressive and appearing to be intoxicated. Not aware of what had occurred at Petersham the police attached no particular significance to their finding what was, in fact, the victim’s mobile phone in the possession of the applicant. Due to his state of intoxication police drove him to his home.  
     
      
    6 The product of video surveillance cameras was viewed and the applicant identified as the perpetrator of the offence at Petersham. A search warrant was executed and the applicant arrested and taken into custody. 
     
      
    7 It is significant to note his Honour’s finding that a proper appreciation of the seriousness of the offence could not be obtained without viewing a video, which actually captured the offence being committed. His Honour described the victim sitting on steps leading down to the railway platform and the applicant is shown walking past him and then returning to strike him about the head. This caused the victim to slump forward and the applicant is seen running from the scene skipping down the steps and departing the railway station. Although his Honour noted what was said about the applicant being heavily intoxicated, he noted that this did not appear to impede him from making his escape. 
     
      
    8 His Honour made findings concerning the residual damage to the victim which findings have not been the subject of challenge. He found that it appears that the plates inserted in the victim’s face could not now be removed without risking further nerve damage. He has great discomfort in the left eye which constantly waters, has broken teeth and sinus difficulties. He suffers nightmares, sleep deprivation and a loss of confidence particularly about going out in the evening. He has had difficulty in obtaining and holding a job which has, in its turn, brought a loss of independence. His Honour categorized the effects of these injuries as catastrophic.  
     
      
    9 The applicant is also a young man aged twenty seven years. As already mentioned he was on parole at the time of this offence, having been released from prison after serving a sentence for driving whilst disqualified. He had not been employed for some three or four years although he had previously done some labouring work in the building industry. To Dr Westmore, a psychiatrist, whose report was in evidence, he reported that he had not worked because he had been drinking excessive amounts of alcohol in association with which there were episodes of aggression. Dr Westmore noted that previous rehabilitation attempts had been unsuccessful. His Honour found that nothing in the material provided by Dr Westmore indicated a relationship between the commission of the offence and matters in his report, to which his Honour referred. Neither is his Honour’s finding in that regard the subject of challenge. It is not necessary to repeat the detail set out in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. The applicant has a substantial prior record but there is nothing on it which approaches the seriousness of the present offence.  
     
      
    10 The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal, the second asserting that the sentence was manifestly excessive and the first asserting specific error by the sentencing judge. I turn to that ground.  
     
      
    11 In the course of his remarks on sentence and with reference to a provision in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “With respect to s 21A(2)(g) to my mind the evidence establishes that the harm done to the victim here, both physical and emotional, was substantial”. 
        
       
      
    12 The contention of the applicant is that as it was an element of the offence that grievous bodily harm had been caused to the victim, his Honour in taking the matter stated into account had breached the statutory proviso that a court is not to have additional regard to a defined aggravating factor. The subsection stipulates “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”. 
     
      
    13 By definition, grievous bodily harm is really serious physical injury. His Honour’s reference to substance was clearly an indication that, in a sense of grading grievous bodily harm, the injury suffered by the victim was of a high order. The emotional harm as mentioned in the subsection is not necessarily an element of grievous bodily harm, the pertinent element of the offence.  
     
      
    14 His Honour’s expression and approach reveal no error. 
     
      
    15 The second ground of appeal is sought to be supported by reference to cases which it is contended manifest examples of criminality at the higher end of the range for the same or similar offences. There can be no doubt that the applicant’s offence should be categorized as one in the higher echelon of objective seriousness. The Crown has accepted the challenge implied by the case references and argued that in each case there are distinguishable factors. In my view, the Crown has succeeded in its exercise. 
     
      
    16 I refer briefly to the matters raised on behalf of the applicant.  
     
      
    17 R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 was a case of robbery in company. Undoubtedly the injury to the victim was horrific but it was noted that it was not possible to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was that offender who had been directly violent to the victim. A non parole period of eight years imprisonment and balance term of three years had been imposed.  
     
      
    18 In R v Teoka & Ors [2004] NSWCCA 373 there was again an offence of robbery in company. These were appeals by offenders complaining that imposition was manifestly excessive and the appeals were rejected on that ground and were successful only to the extent that adjustments were made in relation to parity between offenders. 
     
      
    19 R v Weldon and Carberry (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 and R v Campbell [2000] NSWCCA 157 were both Crown appeals and it is apparent in both those cases that the sentences were less than otherwise would have been imposed having regard to particular considerations that attach to such appeals. 
     
      
    20 R v Hamlin unreported NSWCCA 5 May 1997 was a case in which pre sentence custody needed to be taken into account and adjustment was relevant only to specification of non parole period. 
     
      
    21 In my view these cases, neither individually nor in combination, demonstrate error on the part of the sentencing judge. The Crown has drawn attention to R v Amohanga & Anor 2005 155 A Crim R 262. It is fortifying of the Crown submission. 
     
      
    22 His Honour found that the offence here clearly fell well above the middle range of objective seriousness. That finding was not erroneous and I would respectfully endorse it. His Honour correctly had reference to the seriousness with which Parliament regards such offences by the prescription of an available maximum which is set at the highest level of finite years, exceeded only by offences which carry possible life imprisonment.  
     
      
    23 His Honour is not shown to have erred in the application of principle, nor is his assessment shown to be outside the range of his sound exercise of discretion. 
     
      
    24 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    25 GILES JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    26 HIDDEN J: I also agree. 
     
      
    27 GILES JA: The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Grove J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 19 January 2007, the applicant was sentenced by Marien DCJ for two offences in respect of which he had pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    2 On 18 September 2006, the applicant had pleaded guilty to a charge that he, on 23 May 2005 at Wamberal in the State of New South Wales, did steal from a person a quantity of Codral and Sudafed tablets, the property of a person trading as Wamberal Pharmacy. This was an offence under s.94 of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 On 16 August 2006, the applicant had pleaded guilty to a charge that he, on 15 July 2005 at Charmhaven in the State of New South Wales, did rob a person of certain property, namely a display tray containing assorted jewellery, the property of another person, whilst being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a shotgun. This was an offence under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment.  
     
      
    4 For the earlier offence, the sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of two years imprisonment to commence on 9 November 2006 and expire on 8 November 2008.  
     
      
    5 For the later offence, he sentenced the applicant to four years' imprisonment commencing 8 May 2008 and expiring on 7 May 2012 with a non-parole period of two years, three months to commence on 8 May 2008 and expire on 7 August 2010.  
     
      
    6 Accordingly, the total effective sentence was imprisonment for five years, six months to commence on 9 November 2006 and expire 7 May 2012 with a non-parole period of three years and nine months to commence 9 November 2006 and expire on 7 August 2010.  
     
      
    7 The applicant seeks leave to appeal on these sentences.  
     
      
    8 The applicant's role in both offences was as driver of a get-away car.  
     
      
    9 On the earlier occasion the applicant had driven the co-offender to and from a pharmacy, and the co-offender had entered the pharmacy, confronted a 15-year-old employee of the pharmacy and taken about ninety boxes of Codral and Sudafed tablets from the pharmacy.  
     
      
    10 On the later occasion the applicant had driven a different co-offender to Charmhaven Loan Office. The co-offender had entered the office wearing a balaclava and carrying a sawn-off shotgun, struck one of the persons on the head with a shotgun, wounding him and had taken a tray of jewellery valued at $1,000. The applicant knew the co-offender was in possession of the shotgun, but the sentencing judge accepted that he did not know definitively until after the robbery that it was loaded. The co-offender was charged with armed robbery causing wounding, but the applicant was charged with armed robbery simpliciter, and it was not suggested that it was part of the joint enterprise that violence of any nature be used in the execution of the robbery. 
     
      
    11 At the time of both offences the applicant was subject to the conditions of an eighteen month s.9 good behaviour bond imposed for an offence of maliciously destroying property committed on 14 May 2004. When he committed the later offence, he was on bail for the earlier offence.  
     
      
    12 In relation to both offences the sentencing judge found the applicant was entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty towards the top of the range identified by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383; and entitled to a further reduction by reason of remorse and contrition. In relation to the earlier offence, he found the applicant was entitled to a discount for assistance and offer of assistance to authorities. The sentencing judge found special circumstances, in particular that this would be the applicant's first custodial sentence and the applicant's prospect of rehabilitation. The effective overall non-parole period was 68% of the effective full term.  
     
      
    13 The applicant relies on three grounds of appeal and the judgment will set out the grounds.  
     
      
       
        
        1. That the District Court erred in law by failing to give reasons for imposing a fixed sentence for the offence of larceny from the person and further erred in its discretion by directing that 18 months of the sentence for larceny from the person be cumulative upon the sentence for armed robbery;  
         
        2. That the sentence imposed for the offence of larceny from the person was in all circumstances manifestly excessive; 
         
        3. That the District Court erroneously took into account irrelevant aggravating matters concerning the offence of larceny from the person in particular, ""the offence was planned as part of a larger criminal enterprise to manufacture amphetamines,"" 
        
       
      
    14 In relation to ground 1, the applicant relies on section 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        45 Court may decline to set non-parole period 
         
        (1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence (other than an offence set out in the Table to Division 1A of this Part), a court may decline to set a non-parole period for the offence if it appears to the court that it is appropriate to do so:  
         
          
          (a) because of the nature of the offence to which the sentence relates or the antecedent character of the offender, or 
           
          (b) because of any other penalty previously imposed on the offender, or 
           
          (c) for any other reason that the court considers sufficient. 
          
         
        (2) If a court declines to set a non-parole period for a sentence of imprisonment, it must make a record of its reasons for doing so. 
         
        (3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions. 
         
        (4) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) with respect to a sentence does not invalidate the sentence. 
        
       
      
    15 Mr Wendler, for the applicant, submitted that the sentencing judge was in error in not giving reasons why he did not set a non-parole period for the stealing offence, and he also submitted that the significant identity between the two offences suggested one course of criminality requiring greater concurrency. In his written submissions, he referred to the cases of R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540 and R v Heikkinen [2006] NSWCCA 50 at [14]. In oral submissions, Mr Wendler put that the judge had not taken into account the elements of similarity between the offences, namely that in each case the applicant was the driver of a get-away car, both offences were drug-motivated and they were committed within a short period of time.  
     
      
    16 In my opinion, the sentencing judge was in error in that s.45(2) does require that reasons for not setting a non-parole period be explicitly set out. However in my opinion, this is not an error that could justify intervention of the Court of Criminal Appeal in this case, because it is plain that the sentencing judge was directing his attention to the total effect of the sentences for both offences and the appropriateness of the non-parole period for that totality. In those circumstances, to set a separate non-parole period for the shorter sentence, that was to take effect first, could be seen as a superfluity that could be productive of confusion. That does not mean that the section should not be complied with. The section is mandatory in its terms. However it does, in my opinion, mean that it is not appropriate for the Court of Criminal Appeal to intervene, particularly having regard to the provisions of s.45(4).  
     
      
    17 On the question of concurrency, it would have been within the sentencing judge's sentencing options to have provided for greater concurrency; but in circumstances where there were two distinct offences separated by seven weeks, with separate sets of victims, in my opinion it can't be said that the extent of accumulation was an error justifying intervention: see R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [37]-[38].  
     
      
    18 In relation to ground 2, I see no basis for any claim that the sentence for the stealing offence was manifestly excessive, whether considered in isolation or as part of the total sentence.  
     
      
    19 As for ground 3, Mr Wendler relied on the following passage in the sentencing remarks of the sentencing judge: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender's escapade into drug manufacture, however, did not end there. He states that on the next day or so he drove to Ultimo in Sydney where he bought equipment and chemicals totalling $1,178. Clearly they were purchased for the intended purpose of manufacturing amphetamine. There is no evidence before me, however, that anything further was done by the offender or Wells to manufacture illicit drugs.  
         
         
        Clearly, this offence was not an unplanned and spontaneous criminal act. The offence was planned as part of a larger criminal enterprise to manufacture amphetamine, however misguided that intention may have been.  
         
         
        Mr Day, who appears for the offender, concedes that the offender's state of mind in committing the offence, that is, to obtain these tablets for the purpose of manufacturing amphetamine is an aggravating factor. In other words, the purpose that the offender committed the offence was to commit a further and very serious criminal offence, namely the manufacture of prohibited drugs.  
        
       
       
      This, in turn, requires reference to par.(c) of s.21A(1) and par.(n) of s.21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provide to the effect that in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the Court is to take into account: 
       
        
        (c) any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence 
         
         
        (n) the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
        
       
      
    20 Mr Wendler submitted in written submissions that the quoted passage disclosed error because the applicant stood to be sentenced for what he had done, not for what he might do in the future. Those written submissions suggest that Mr Wendler may be relying on the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383, that no-one should be punished for an offence for which he/she has not been convicted. However, in oral submissions Mr Wendler rather emphasised the point that the sentencing judge's remarks could be seen as suggesting that the appellant was to manufacture drugs for commercial supply rather than merely as a rather unlikely scheme to manufacture drugs for his own use.  
     
      
    21 In my opinion, the sentencing judge did not proceed on the basis that any intended manufacture was for other than the applicant's own use. In my opinion also, for the sentencing judge to take into account that the intention of the applicant in stealing the tablets was to use them to manufacture illegal drugs, did not involve punishing the applicant for some offence of which he had not been convicted. Rather, this intention was relevant to the criminality of the offence for which he was convicted, and fell plainly within the paragraphs within section 21A referred to above.  
     
      
    22 For those reasons I propose the following orders:  
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal granted.  
       
      2. Appeal dismissed.  
       
      
    23 HISLOP J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
     
      
    24 LATHAM J: I also agree.  
     
      
    25 HODGSON JA: Those are the orders of the Court.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: Between February 1998 and August 2002 the Applicant operated as an investment adviser through Macquarie Towns Financial Services Pty Limited (“MTFS”), a company controlled by the Applicant. Whilst acting as an investment adviser the Applicant had the proper authorisation enabling him to act as a securities representative for AMP Financial Planning between April and November 1995; Financial Wisdom Limited, April 1995 to March 2000; Matrix Planning Solutions, March 2000 to May 2001; and Garrisons Limited, May 2001 to March 2002. 
     
      
    2 The Applicant was charged with three charges of dishonest conduct contrary to s1041G of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and fifteen charges of fraudulent misappropriation contrary to s178A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 
     
      
    3 The three charges contrary to s1041G of the Corporations Act were all in the following form:  
     
      
       
        
        “Between about (date) and about (date), at Sydney in the State of New South Wales being a person carrying on a financial services business, namely, Macquarie Town Services Pty Limited, engaged in dishonest conduct in the course of carrying on that business by holding himself out to a person as an authorised financial adviser when that authority had been revoked. 
        
       
      
    4 The fifteen charges contrary to s178A of the Crimes Act were all in the following form:  
     
      
       
        
        “On or about (date) at Sydney 
          
        in the State of New South Wales fraudulently misappropriated to his own use certain money, namely, the sum of $X, in violation of the terms on which he received the money, having received the money on terms requiring him to invest it on (particular person’s) behalf.” 
        
       
      
    5 The charges under the Corporations Act relate to three different investors toward whom, on each occasion, he engaged in dishonest conduct by holding himself out as an authorised financial adviser when that authority had been revoked. 
     
      
    6 The charges under the Crimes Act relate to nine different investors where the Applicant fraudulently misappropriated to his own use certain moneys in violation of the terms on which he received that money. In a nutshell, the Applicant held himself out to each of these investors as competent to advise them to put their money, often retirement funds, into various companies and ventures. Investors assumed that the moneys were being put into legitimate investments for their ultimate benefit and security. The Applicant put the money into his own business without permission. The total amount of moneys diverted by the Applicant was $1,702,527. 
     
      
    7 The Applicant was able to continue offending between February 1998 and July 2002 without detection because interest payments were being made to clients using funds received into the business of MTFS. The offences came to light following complaints about the Applicant which led to an investigation of his affairs by ASIC. 
     
      
    8 The maximum penalty prescribed for each of the Corporations Act offences is five years imprisonment. The maximum penalty prescribed for each of the Crimes Act offences is seven years imprisonment. 
     
      
    9 The Applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court on 31 January 2005. On 23 March 2005 Woods DCJ sentenced the Applicant on each of the separate charges to produce an overall term of imprisonment of eight years commencing from 23 March 2005 and an effective non-parole period of five years. The individual breakdown of the sentences is as follows: 
     
      
    · Counts 1, 2, 3 (Corporations Act offences) – sentence of imprisonment for two years to date from 23 March 2005. His Honour declined to make a recognizance release order due to the structure of the overall sentence. 
     
      
    · Counts 4, 8, 13, 15, 17 – sentence of imprisonment for three years to date from 23 March 2005 and to expire on 22 March 2008. His Honour declined to set a non-parole period due to the structure of the overall sentence. 
     
      
    · Counts 7, 10, 11, 14, 18 – sentence of imprisonment for two years and six months to date from 23 March 2007 and to expire on 22 March 2009. His Honour declined to set a non-parole period due to the structure of the overall sentence. 
     
      
    · Counts 5, 6, 9, 12, 16 – sentence of imprisonment for four years to date from 23 March 2009 and to expire on 22 March 2013, with a non-parole period of 1 year from the commencement of the sentence on 23 March 2009 and to expire on 22 March 2010. 
     
      
    10 His Honour found special circumstances. The bald recitation of the fact that the Applicant had fraudulently misappropriated funds does not convey the degree of personal anguish which his conduct caused to his victims. It is unnecessary to recite each of the examples. His Honour highlighted a particularly egregious example in the case of an eighty-two year old woman who had entrusted the Applicant to fill out a cheque book because she had difficulty writing. Instead of presenting the cheque for over $300,000 for the purpose of an authorised investment he in effect paid it into his own account. The investor was given small cheques from time to time by him which she believed represented interest payments, the receipt of which caused her to believe that a legitimate investment had been made and was continuing. 
     
      
    11 It is unnecessary to give further details of the personal anxiety that must have been caused to the range of small investors when they discovered they had been defrauded by the Applicant abusing his position of trust. His posture was to a substantial degree based on the deception that he continued to have the authority to act on behalf of a substantial financial corporation, that being the subject of the three charges under the Corporations Act.  
     
      
    12 The objective gravity of the offences was substantial. The amount of money misappropriated was over $1.7 million from a significant number of victims, all of whom were small investors and vulnerable to varying degrees, some to a very high degree of vulnerability. 
     
      
    13 The frauds took place over a period of some five years and involved premeditation and planning. Of particular significance is the gross breach of trust involved both directly to each investor for whom he was an adviser and by purporting to act with the authority of a financial corporation in whom the investors would also have trust. The element of general deterrence is entitled to considerable weight in white collar crimes involving a breach of trust (see eg R v Glenister [1980] 2 NSLWR 597; R v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330).  
     
      
    14 In the present case the element of personal deterrence is also entitled to some weight. The Applicant had a prior conviction, albeit in 1983, for fraudulent misappropriation. The fact that it was so old entitles that element to small weight. Nevertheless, notwithstanding a finding by his Honour of contrition on the part of the Applicant, for some considerable period the Applicant maintained the position that he was able to pay out the persons he had defrauded and, indeed, maintained the position that the rate of interest he was giving them was higher than they may otherwise have obtained. All of this does not suggest that the Applicant is as contrite as may otherwise have been expected and that the element of personal deterrence in this case is entitled to some weight in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    15 The grounds of appeal can be categorised under three headings. First, semantic quibbles about particular words used by the sentencing judge; second, an assertion of inadequate reasoning, limited in the course of oral submissions and, third, an assertion that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    16 The first semantic objection was to his Honour’s use of the words “very substantial” in the sentence “… the objective culpability of the offences is very substantial.”  
     
      
    17 The Applicant submits that this conclusion was “informed” by two adjectival findings: firstly, the fact that most of the investors have been compensated by the financial services companies which the Applicant purported without authority to represent; secondly, by his Honour’s finding which deprecated the value of the business, which could have served as a source of funds for repaying investors and to which I will refer with respect to another ground of appeal. 
     
      
    18 The first thing to say about this is that none of the matters to which attention is drawn in the written submissions are of significance for the ultimate finding that the objective culpability was “very substantial”. That finding was entirely justified on the whole of the evidence. I have referred to the general thrust of the evidence above. In any event, none of the propositions advanced with respect to the specific matters put forward are in my opinion correct. 
     
      
    19 Objection was taken to his Honour’s characterisation of the Applicant’s overall business as being valueless, it appears on the basis that the objective gravity of the offences could be limited if the Applicant throughout had, or believed he had, a capacity to repay the funds being fraudulently misappropriated from his own resources. 
     
      
    20 Similarly, it was also said his Honour’s characterisation of the Applicant’s own belief that there was value in the business as “a delusion” was incorrect. It was submitted that his Honour, accordingly, failed to take into account, as one of the subjective features of the offender, that he had a well-founded belief that he may be able to repay the misappropriated funds from his own resources. 
     
      
    21 The passages objected to are found in the following extracts from the Remarks on Sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender gave evidence before me and said that he had believed that he had a substantial business as a financial adviser, the substance of which he says was valued by Garrisons Pty Limited at one stage as $3,000,000. This was no doubt a paper castle. The valuation of any business he ran was fundamentally dependent on him conducting himself in a correct fashion and it cannot have been other than known to him that his conduct in these matters was criminal. It may be that he had a vague idea that he would pay these people back because his own business was so substantial, it is difficult to say, but he was certainly culpably reckless in his conduct. It is against the law to tell people that you are putting their money into one investment when in fact you use it yourself.” 
        
       
      
    22 The reference to “paper castle” was said to be associated with his Honour’s subsequent characterisation of the Applicant’s company as “a vehicle for fraud”. There is no relevant link between the “paper castle” reference and the “vehicle for fraud” reference. The latter is quite unimpeachable. The company was a vehicle for fraud. The submission on behalf of the Applicant that it may have done things that were not fraudulent does not detract from the accuracy of his Honour’s characterisation. 
     
      
    23 The reference to delusion occurred in the following passages of the Remarks on Sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Parole report … says this:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘In discussing the offences Mr Higgins indicated that he considered his actions in investing his clients’ funds in his own business were wrong but noted that he paid them a higher rate of interest than they might have achieved in some other investments and the funds were secured by the then value of the business’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    24 His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “That is, of course, substantially what he said to me in the witness box. It is a delusion. It was a delusion from which Mr Higgins continues to suffer. The provision of cheques from time to time by way of alleged interest is a classic badge of this kind of misappropriation and fraud. It is not a matter in mitigation of sentence but an index of criminality.” 
        
       
      
    25 His Honour also went on to quote an extract from the psychologist’s report which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “His offending behaviour was at the time of the commission however sustained by the distorted belief that he was serving the best interests of his clients and himself and that he was doing no wrong.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “That is once again, as I say, the delusion that he manifested in the witness box.” 
        
       
      
    27 The Applicant submitted that these passages failed to take into account his Honour’s acceptance of the proposition, as his Honour did in another passage of his reasons, that the Applicant had in fact performed services for other clients in a perfectly proper and satisfactory manner. Furthermore, it was submitted that his Honour failed to take into account the existence of sources of ongoing revenue from past proper advice in the form of trailing fees and commissions which had some value. That is to say, by reason of his past proper conduct the business was entitled to receive a flow of revenue from the advice given and the introductions made as an adviser. 
     
      
    28 On this basis it was submitted that, on normal principles of valuation of a business, the business must have had some value and, accordingly, it was wrong to describe it as a “paper castle” or that its value was dependent on the behaviour of the Applicant. Similarly, it was incorrect for his Honour to dismiss the Applicant’s belief in the value of the business as “delusional”. 
     
      
    29 In this latter respect I refer again to the passage in his Honour’s reasons that I have already quoted in which his Honour acknowledged that the Applicant had what his Honour described as “a vague idea that he would pay these people back because his own business was so substantial”. His Honour acknowledged that there was some such belief on the part of the Applicant, but nevertheless subsequently characterised it as “delusional”. These were findings of fact on the subjective position of the Applicant which were entirely open to his Honour. He acknowledged that there was some level of belief. Persons who commit frauds and misappropriate moneys for various purposes often have the belief that they will rectify the situation before they are caught. That does not mean that this is a factor entitled to any substantial weight in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    30 On the objective question of whether or not the business had value there can be little doubt that his Honour was correct when he said that a business of this character involving financial advice depends on trust. That trust is two-fold. First is the trust of the financial services businesses which the adviser represents. Second is the trust of the individual investors. Fraudulent conduct of the character identified in the present case would destroy the trust from both sources. Once the Applicant was caught, the business was valueless subject, of course, to whatever contractual entitlements there remained to trailing commissions and fees.  
     
      
    31 One would have expected at least some evidence in the defence case, if these were of any value, that the Applicant had sold the business or some part of it or assigned for consideration these trailing commissions and fees. There was no such evidence. What this meant in terms of the residual value of the business if the Applicant were caught, as he was, strongly suggests that the business overall was in truth valueless. At the very least it was open on the evidence for his Honour to make that finding. In my opinion, no error in this respect is established. 
     
      
    32 The complaint of inadequacy of reasons was in some respects in the alternative to this ground. In the original submissions the complaint was based on the fact that his Honour referred in a general way to having taken into account the factors set out in s16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) with respect to the Commonwealth offences and s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) with respect to the State offences. 
     
      
    33 In oral submissions this complaint was limited to his Honour’s failure, it was alleged, to give full reasons with respect to the factors in s16A(2)(a) of the Crimes Act (Cth), which refers to the obligation on the Court to take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the Court, relevantly, “the nature and circumstances of the offence”. In the way that the submission was put to this Court this was linked directly to his Honour’s “paper castle” references and the “delusional” references.  
     
      
    34 For the reasons I have outlined, in my opinion it was open to his Honour to make these findings. I can see no relevant omission in the steps taken in the reasoning process or lack of transparency with respect to his Honour’s formation of the opinion that, in the circumstances of this case, the business was valueless when the offender was caught. In any event, of course, this alternative ground, limited as it now is to s16A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, would relate only to the three Commonwealth offences and has no implications at all for the fifteen fraudulent misappropriation convictions and the sentences imposed on those. Regardless, I can see no relevant error on the part of his Honour. In my opinion this ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
    35 Little was said with respect to the ground of appeal asserting that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In my opinion the proposition cannot be sustained. Each specific sentence for the respective offences was appropriate in its terms. It was well within the range of the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The degree of cumulation involved was appropriate, indeed, it was not subject to criticism. The ultimate effective sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of five years is well within the range of the exercise of the sentencing discretion on the facts of this case. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion the Court should grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    37 BARR J: I agree. 
     
      
    38 HOWIE J: I agree. I simply wish to add one matter by way of comment. In addressing this Court in respect of the ground of appeal that the sentence was manifestly excessive counsel for the Applicant asked the Court to reduce the non-parole period on the basis of the decision of this Court in R v Corbett (1991) 52 A Crim R 112. In that case this Court recognised a past practice of sentencing persons for white collar crimes involving fraudulent abuse of trust by the imposition of a fairly heavy head sentence but a light non-parole period. The Court thought that this was as a result of a desire to on one hand reflect the importance of general deterrence in the head sentence but on the other hand to acknowledge the subjective circumstances of the offender. 
     
      
    39 That approach has not been followed by the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia: see R v Dubois (2004) 88 SASR 304. For my part, I doubt that that practice still continues in this State at this time having regard to the changes that have been made to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and having regard, as this Court does, to the significance of general deterrence featuring in non-parole periods as well as head sentences. 
     
      
    40 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: The appellant was convicted after trial by judge alone of an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The maximum penalty for an offence under that section is relevantly imprisonment for 15 years. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for two years to date from 12 June 2005 with a non-parole period of 18 months to expire on 11 December 2006, the date upon which the appellant is to be released to parole. The appellant appeals against both his conviction and sentence. 
     
      
    2 The facts can be very briefly stated. On the evening of 26 September 2003 police acting on intelligence stopped a vehicle heading towards Mudgee from Sydney. The appellant was travelling in the vehicle with other persons. Police took the appellant back to a police station and searched him. No drugs were found and he was allowed to leave the police station. Later a condom containing what was analysed as being 13.3gms of methylamphetamine was found behind a rubbish bag in the police station. The purity of the drug was seven per cent, approximately twice the purity of amphetamine usually located in the Mudgee area. DNA tests revealed that the condom had been in the possession of the appellant. The appellant was interviewed by police about the condom and its contents and but denied knowing anything about them. 
     
      
    3 The appellant gave evidence at the trial admitting that the condom was his. He said that he had bought the amphetamine in Sydney and he had paid $500 for half an ounce. He said that he was unemployed and had received a loan from his parents to use as bond money for a place he was looking to rent in Mudgee. However the appellant had used the money to purchase the drugs. He said he bought the amount he did it because of the expense of the drug in Mudgee. He was using about half a gram to a gram everyday. He had bought as much amphetamine as he could with the $500 and was intending to use it himself. The appellant admitted that he had told lies to the police in the course of his interview. His mother gave evidence to the effect that she had given the appellant about $600 on 25 August 2003. 
     
      
    4 The amount of drug that the appellant had in his possession at the time of his arrest was more than the trafficable quantity specified for methylamphetamine. The only issue, therefore, to be determined by the trial judge was whether the appellant had proved on the balance of probabilities that he had the drug in his possession for a purpose other than supply. 
     
      
    5 There is a single ground of appeal relied on for the appeal against conviction. It is to the effect that the trial judge did not comply with what is now s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act. That section is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        133 Verdict of single Judge  
         
         
        (1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury. 
         
         
        (2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied. 
         
         
        (3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter. 
        
       
      
    6 It was held in Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250 that the failure of a trial judge to include in his judgment a warning that would have been required to be given to a jury was a wrong decision on a question of law for the purposes of the Criminal Appeal Act and that a miscarriage of justice occurred. Here it is submitted by the appellant that the judge failed to direct himself appropriately on the evidence of lies told by the appellant to police in his recorded interview and, therefore, the trial miscarried. 
     
      
    7 There was no issue that the appellant had told police a number of lies during his interview. The Crown prosecutor at the hearing before the trial judge addressed him in respect of those lies as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Crown says, your Honour, that [the appellant’s case] is incredible and that your Honour would not accept it and the Crown says that your Honour would not accept it because the accused is, from his own mouth, on more than 10 occasions through the interview that he had with the police on 27 September, a teller of untruths. I expect, your Honour, that my friend and I will need to make submissions to your Honour about the issue of what is to be made of those lies told to the police. 
         
         
        I invite your Honour to regard them as lies that show a consciousness of guilt. They are lies, in the Crown's submission they are lies told in a way, and at a time, that allows them to be fully particularised, then recorded, they are told so often and on the last occasion with such vigour that there can be no mistaking the intention of the accused in telling them. 
        
       
       
      A little later the Crown said: 
       
        
         
        Because it's a case, your Honour, where the Crown needs to prove possession before s 29 comes to operate and it becomes a case of what we call deemed supply, and because the lie is about knowledge and physical custody - that is possession - the Crown says it's a material lie and your Honour made regard it and all of the lies that are told of the course of that record of interview - as lies that evince a consciousness of guilt. 
         
         
        If your Honour's against the Crown on that, they are lies that go directly to the credibility of the accused when your Honour comes to assess whether or not he has carried, on the balance of probabilities, the burden of proof that lies upon him as s 29 requires. Your Honour will need to have regard in that context too, to the demeanour of the accused when he gave evidence. I think it's fairly clear, your Honour, that the accused suffers some significant emotional disturbance by reason of events that have occurred in the course of his life. It's only right that your Honour might take that fact into account in assessing his demeanour. But your Honour will remember, as against that, that he told your Honour, ""I lied to the police because I was scared and I thought I could get out of it if I told lies"". 
         
         
        Today, your Honour, in my submission he is in exactly the same position. His ability and desire to tell the truth are things that are compromised when he's in a position where he needs to be believed, otherwise he is in trouble, he has every reason in the world for telling a lie to get out of it. 
         
         
        The Crown says that what your Honour saw today was a whole series of answers to many questions that demonstrate that the accused was doing just that, that he was telling untruths about his intention in the future with respect to his possession of the drug because it was in his interests to do so so he might escape liability. His economic circumstances provide a compelling motive for him to have the drug in his possession for supply. He’s a man who tells lies about the material fact of his possession of the drug he tells lies to the police about the other portion of the condom that’s found in his clothing when he’s searched. That set of lies your Honour, that is conceded about the other part of a condom in his clothing, is probably not well thought out, and your Honour can read the transcript, but nonetheless it is a distinct attempt to put the listener, the police officer, off the trail. That factor, your Honour bears heavily upon his credibility. 
        
       
      
    8 Counsel for the appellant in his address referred to the High Court decision of Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 and the facts that had to be proved before the Crown could rely upon a lie as evidencing a consciousness of guilt. He then went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Well he is charged basically with an offence that has the basis of its commission in possession of the item. He is also charged with supply based on that possession of a certain amount. But it would not be clear, your Honour, that what he is denying is I don't have possession of that item because I know how much it is and I know that if I say I've got possession of it, I might be deemed to have supplied it. And he's not telling lies that relate to the supply aspect of it, he's telling lies that relate to his possession of it your Honour, which might be understandable in the circumstances. He says ""I was scared, I wanted to disown my connection with it, not to be caught with it in my possession"". 
         
         
        It's my submission that the lies do go to credit but not consciousness of guilt in the terms required by Edwards. It's a circular thing I suppose, it starts and comes back to the same point, that the telling of lies by someone, if they were so found, still can't prove a case. The Crown has to prove possession, well it has, the accused admits possession and the Crown proves it with its physical evidence. 
         
         
        But the fact that he denied his contact with it, in my submission, doesn't detract or doesn't make him guilty of having something for the purpose of supply. The law deems that to be so, your Honour. It's my submission that there is no consciousness of guilt about that in what he does about telling a lie, that's why your Honour would not use lies as consciousness of guilt as corroborative of the Crown case, as my friend’s asking you to do. 
        
       
      
    9 In giving his reasons for finding the appellant guilty of the offence the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Firstly, it has been put to me that his lies to the police at the interview when he was confronted with the condom and the material in it, are lies that indicate a guilty conscience and therefore can corroborate his guilt. The accused has admitted that he deliberately lied to the police when interviewed when first arrested and before the condom was connected to him by the DNA evidence. He stated that he lied at the time because he was scared and he thought he might be able to get away with it, namely being connected with the object found discarded in the police station. 
         
         
        It has been put that whilst these lies may reveal a knowledge of an offence, it should initially be looked at as being the offence of possession of the drugs but not necessarily of being in possession for supply, thus they are not lies with a full knowledge of the deeming provisions of the Act. 
         
         
        
       
      It seems clear to me that the Judge was referring to the address of the appellant's counsel to the effect that the Judge could not use the lies told as revealing a consciousness of guilt of the offence of supply because they might be evidence of a consciousness of guilt of being in possession of the drug. The Judge then went on: 
       
        
         
        I cannot completely discount the lies he gave to the police at the time of his arrest that I will consider those lies along with his evidence before me in this Court. The main emphasis of his evidence in Court is his own usage, so does that all stand up? 
        
       
      
    10 I believe that these passages indicate that the judge had accepted the submissions made on behalf of the appellant that he could not use the lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt in respect of the offence of supply but that he did intend to use them in determining the issue of the appellant's credibility. That being the case, there was no reason for the Judge to refer to Edwards or the preconditions that had to be found before lies could be used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt of the offence charged. 
     
      
    11 Ultimately the Judge found that the appellant's explanation for having so much drug in his possession ""does stretch credibility"". The Judge concluded that he could not accept the appellant's explanation on the balance of probabilities and, therefore, found the offence proved. 
     
      
    12 In my opinion the ground of appeal has no merit and the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    13 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence. There are three grounds as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. His Honour erred by referring to the applicant's record within the context of section 21A and including it as an aggravating feature 
         
          
         
        2. His Honour did not take into account, or gave insufficient regard, to evidence that Mr Ghossein was suffering from a significant mental health condition. 
         
          
         
        3. His Honour did not find special circumstances pursuant to section 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
         
        
       
      
    14 The Judge in his sentencing remarks summarised the subjective case for the appellant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………. He is aged 30 years, grew up in a stable family environment in Sydney, obtained a School Certificate and then left school, completed an apprenticeship as a spray painter and was employed as such for six years. He had commenced using drugs when aged 15 years and this eventually started to affect his employment. He eventually left Sydney and moved to Mudgee where his parents had acquired a property. The reports note an extensive drug history and using heroin. 
         
         
        At age 20 he formed a relationship with a woman he met at a methadone clinic, however after two years his partner died from a drug induced stroke and then later the child died. He became more isolated and heavier into drugs. He then got involved with criminal offences. In 1998 there were break and enter offences for which he received community service orders, in the year 2000 there was a break and entry for which terms (sic) of imprisonment were suspended. So he is a 30 year old man with a record of serious offences and who has been given opportunities to resolve any issues. Recent psychological reports suggest the possibility of a significant mental health condition which it appears has been brought on through the use of drugs. 
         
         
        He has the support of his mother from Mudgee and claims to hope to remain drug free. However, whether his resolve will be fully transported into action remains to be seen………….. 
         
        
       
      
    15 The first ground concerns what is asserted to be an error in the Judge taking into account as an aggravating feature the appellant's criminal record. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Having regard to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, with respect to aggravating and mitigating factors………………….. 
         
         
        Included in aggravating factors would be that he does have a criminal record of offences………. 
        
       
      
    16 At the present time the state of the law in respect of s 21A(d) appears to be that a judge is not entitled to take into account as an aggravating feature an offender's criminal record unless the record was such that it indicated that “retribution, deterrence and protection of society may indicate that a more severe sentence is warranted”. The Crown concedes that the ground has been made out but argues that no lesser sentence is warranted. It is unfortunate that in August 2005 in light of the numerous authorities to the contrary that a sentencing judge could still be under the misapprehension that a criminal record itself was an aggravating feature regardless of the nature of that criminal record. However, that error does not indicate to me that the sentencing discretion miscarried to such an extent that this Court should necessarily interfere. However, I shall deal with the other grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    17 The second ground asserts that the judge gave insufficient weight to the applicant's mental condition. The presentence report, dated 25 July 2005, contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offender recently indicated that he is not suffering from any mental health condition. However, he is concerned about his medical health as he has been receiving treatment for a stomach complaint for some time. He indicated that his father was diagnosed with bowel cancer sometime ago and he feels that he may be afflicted with the same illness. Unfortunately, confirmation of the situation was unable to be verified with the offender's medical practitioner. 
        
       
      
    18 There was in evidence a report from Dr Wilcox, a psychiatrist, dated 14 December 1999. The report contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        After the death of his son I believe that he developed a Major Depression as he experienced loss of interest in his usual activities, he became more isolative and withdrawn, he had impaired sleep, poor appetite and weight loss, decreased energy and decreased motivation. 
        
       
       
      It should be noted that the appellant's son died in September 1998. 
       
      
    19 There was also a report from a psychologist, Mr Tyrer, dated 22 March 2005. That report referred to the earlier report of Dr Wilcox. It contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The appellant] reports a number of difficulties consistent with a significant depressive experience. Although he does not appear to feel hopeless and his self-esteem seems largely intact, he does manifest affective and psychological signs of depression. He admits openly to feelings of sadness, a loss of interest in normal activities, and a loss of the sense of pleasure in things that were previously enjoyed. His likely to show a disturbance in sleep pattern, a decrease in level of energy and sexual interest, and loss of appetite and/or weight. Psychomotor slowing might also be expected. 
        
       
       
      The psychologist concluded: 
       
        
         
        [The appellant] is a 30 year old man with a significant history of drug abuse and the possibility of a significant mental health condition. [The appellant] is not developmentally disabled. His presentation would suggest that he is functioning in the Average range of intelligence. His current functioning is significantly disturbed by his history of drug abuse and its repercussions and also by indications of psychiatric disorder. 
         
         
        [The appellant] appears to be vulnerable to external stressors, with his reactions to severe stresses provoking pathological responses, Major Depression following a death of his son, and a similar reaction compounded by a Somatisation Disorder developing after his father's bout with bowel cancer. These somatic symptoms were not mentioned in a 1999 psychiatric report and appear to have developed since that time. This raises the prospect that [the appellant] may be suffering from an emerging mental illness of a somatic nature, in addition to the strong likelihood that is currently clinically depressed. [The appellant] requires an up-to-date psychiatric assessment to allow for greater certainty in this regard. 
        
       
      
    20 The state of the evidence before the Judge does not indicate to me that the appellant was at the time of the offending or at the time of sentencing suffering from such a mental disability that would require, or even justify, the Judge declining to give full weight to general deterrence in respect of the appellant and his offending. In my view the line of authority, including cases such as R v Engert (1989) 84 A Crim R 67, upon which the appellant relies to submit that the Judge erred in not giving the appellant's mental condition, whatever it might be, sufficient weight, were not applicable. 
     
      
    21 The third ground of appeal asserts that the sentencing judge ought to have found special circumstances when determining the length of the non-parole period. It is accepted on behalf of the appellant that this was a discretionary matter but the submission was made that in light of the appellant's need for counselling and assistance, his mental condition, and the fact that it was his first time serving a custodial sentence required that the Judge find special circumstances. 
     
      
    22 The Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I cannot find that with his history and the circumstances of the offence that there are any circumstances for any special leniency nor that can be regarded as sufficiently special to justify a variation in the statutory proportion for any non-parole period. 
        
       
      
    23 I believe that this was a finding that it was well open to the sentencing judge to make and I am not satisfied that the subjective matters pertaining to the appellant were such that it was not within the judge's discretion to apply the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence. 
     
      
    24 In my opinion the sentence was a relatively lenient one and certainly I am not persuaded that any lesser sentence is warranted. 
     
      
    25 I would propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. I would grant leave to the appellant to appeal against sentence but I propose that this appeal also be dismissed. 
     
      
    26 GROVE J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    27 SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
     
      
    28 GROVE J: The orders of the Court are as proposed by Justice Howie.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application to this Court pursuant to s 176 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (the Act) following a revocation order made by the Parole Authority on 2 June 2006 revoking the applicant’s release on parole effective as at 24 April 2006. 
     
      
    2 The short facts are that the applicant was released to parole on an order made in the Local Court. The parole order was subject to a number of prescribed conditions as to the applicant being of good behaviour and supervision conditions, including one to obey all reasonable directions of the officer of the Parole Service and another to report to the officer at such times and places as the officer may direct. 
     
      
    3 The applicant had been sentenced in the Local Court to concurrent terms of imprisonment, as a result of which he had a period of some fifteen months to serve on parole. The applicant was released to parole on 1 February 2006. 
     
      
    4 There are three reports that are before me and were before the Authority when dealing with the decision that brings the matter before this Court. The first was a report of 15 March 2006 that was placed before the Parole Authority on 16 March of that year. That report was prepared by Ms Chalmers, a probation and parole officer and dated 15 March 2006. That report recommended that a warning should be given to the applicant by the Authority that he should comply fully with the conditions of his parole order. As a result, the Authority gave such a warning to the applicant. 
     
      
    5 There was a further report dated 21 May 2006, again made by the probation and parole officer, Ms Chalmers. That report recommended that his parole order be revoked. 
     
      
    6 There was a further report dated 1 June 2006, again by Ms Chalmers and again recommending revocation of parole. The recommendation resulted in the revocation of his parole on 2 June. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was before the Authority on 3 August 2006 represented by Mr Overall who appears for the applicant before this Court. During the course of those proceedings the applicant gave evidence. Ultimately, after shortly considering what it should so, the Authority stated that it was unpersuaded that it should alter the order revoking his parole. In giving the reasons for the decision, the Chairman said on behalf of the Authority; 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The Authority is of the view that the revocation order of 2 June 2006 ought to stand for the reasons that were stated, those reasons being your drug use, your failure to report and your failure to obey directions.” 
        
       
      
    8 On 14 August 2006, the applicant made this application asserting that there were statements that were false or misleading in the reports that were placed before the Authority. 
     
      
    9 Section 176 is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        176 Application to Supreme Court by offender 
          
         
        (1) If:  
         
        (a) the Parole Authority revokes a periodic detention order, home detention order or parole order, and  
         
        (b) the offender to whom the periodic detention order, home detention order or parole order relates alleges that the order has been revoked on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information,  
         
        the offender may, in accordance with rules of court, apply to the Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant. 
         
        (2) The Supreme Court may give such directions with respect to the information as it thinks fit. 
         
        (3) An application under this section is to be considered by the Supreme Court if and only if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application. 
         
        
       
      
    10 As far as I am aware, this Court has not yet considered this particular section. However, it is in the same terms as s 155 of that Act and that section has been reviewed on a number of occasions. The most recent review was carried out by Johnson J in a judgment handed down on 17 November 2006, being Lee v The State Parole Authority of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 1225. In that judgment, Johnson J in some detail considers the section then before him, that is s 155, and a number of authorities, including some of his own, which have considered that section and the extent of the jurisdiction of this Court to review the material before the Authority in relation to the orders made by it. 
     
      
    11 It is unnecessary for present purposes to undertake a further review of the section or the powers of this Court. It is enough to acknowledge the very limited basis upon which this Court has to concern itself with the material placed before the Authority. It should be noted that the Court is not reviewing the actual order that the Authority made. It is not a court of appeal, concerned in any way with the correctness or otherwise of the order made by the Authority. Nor is it a court sitting as an administrative appeal against the proceedings before the Authority or the reasons given by the Authority for the order it made. 
     
      
    12 It is important to note that matter because there continues apparently to be a misunderstanding by persons who have been before the Authority as to the powers of this Court and as to the limited nature of the Court’s power to address the proceedings before the Authority. As I have indicated, the Court is limited to a review of the material before the Authority rather than conducting a review of the proceedings before, or the orders made by, the Authority. 
     
      
    13 In the present case the Court has been more fortunate than some other courts that have had to deal with this type of application because the applicant was represented by competent counsel who endeavoured to argue the case with a full appreciation of the limits of this Court’s jurisdiction and its powers to intervene in what is in effect the business of the Authority. The Court was much assisted by both oral and written arguments made on the applicant’s behalf. 
     
      
    14 Initially there are a number of bases upon which it was said that the material before the Authority contained either false statements or misleading statements but sensibly, if I might say so and with due respect to this Court’s jurisdiction, the applicant’s counsel sought only to argue a very limited number of the matters that had been initially set out as being misleading or false. 
     
      
    15 The applicant should understand that the only arguable matters were those put forward to the Court on the applicant’s behalf and a number of the matters raised initially were either simply unarguable or were irrelevant to the ultimate decision made by the Parole Authority and, therefore, could not be the subject of any relief given by this Court. 
     
      
    16 However, with due regard to the applicant’s concern that in some way he was mistreated by the Authority or that the Authority’s decision was inappropriate, I received a letter from the St Vincent De Paul Society, a letter that was before the Authority and was relevant to one of the significant issues before the Authority which has been the subject of complaint and that is, the applicant’s use of drugs while subject to the parole order. The letter, strictly speaking, was not admissible and counsel conceded so much. However, simply so that the applicant is aware that this Court understands his frustration with the decision of the Authority and why he believes it is unjust and inappropriate, I had received the letter and am aware of its contents and aware how that might reflect upon the material about which complaint is made. 
     
      
    17 The first matter that was raised on the applicant’s behalf was a complaint that a piece of information in the parole report dated 21 May 2006 was false. The particular statement about which complaint is made appears under the heading, “Response to Supervision”. The officer wrote, 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The applicant attempts to hide and minimise his illicit drug use.” 
        
       
      
    18 It was submitted generally that that statement was false because the applicant had both admitted and self-reported his drug use and sought to attend treatment for it during the course of his parole supervision. One of the difficulties in the present matter is that the officer preparing the report or her supervisor was not called to give evidence before the Authority. I am told from the bar table that it is not unusual that the officer making a report would give evidence and would be challenged as to statements in the report by a person appearing for the parolee or on his or her behalf. Apparently, for reasons that it is unnecessary to state, the officer and her supervisor were unavailable at the time of the hearing before the Authority. 
     
      
    19 This fact makes it difficult for this Court to determine that a statement made by an officer in a report, which has not been challenged by way of cross-examination of the officer, is false, particularly when the officer has not been given the opportunity to explain the basis upon which the statement was made and the evidence upon which she would have relied upon to justify the statement. However, that does not mean that it could not be shown objectively to be false, based on other material that was available to the Parole Authority or to the officer. 
     
      
    20 Here the complaint is that it was obvious from the report itself that the applicant had acknowledged that he was still using illegal drugs during the course of his parole on a not infrequent basis, that the officer was well aware of this and had in fact been party to him making an application for entrance into a drug rehabilitation programme. On the material in the report, that application was unsuccessful because the applicant had, on his own account, not used illegal substances in the five days preceding his attendance at the rehabilitation centre. He was, therefore, considered by the person assessing his application as being unsuitable for the programme. 
     
      
    21 The letter that I have received from St Vincent De Paul fleshes out a statement in evidence given by the applicant before the Authority that he had been accepted for entrance into a rehabilitation programme called the Maryfields Day Recovery Centre but unfortunately was rearrested before he was able to take that opportunity. As I say, this is material that was given by the applicant in evidence before the Authority and is supportive of his contention that at the time of his arrest for breach of parole he had been making an effort to overcome his drug addiction. 
     
      
    22 The difficulty of course, as the applicant’s counsel realised, is that I am not here to review the decision made by the Authority and, in particular, to determine for myself whether on the material the applicant ought to have been further granted parole on the basis that he was not shown to be a person who could not lead a law abiding life within the community. 
     
      
    23 In answer to the statement made by the officer in the parole report as to the applicant attempting to hide and minimise his illicit drug use, the applicant gave evidence before the Authority and there is a transcript before me. In effect the applicant told the Authority that, when he had attended the programme, he was told that he was ineligible as an applicant because he failed two of the pre-conditions upon which a person would be accepted into that rehabilitation programme. The first was that the person be a frequent user of drug and the second was that the drug be of a fairly significant amount. The applicant told the Authority that he failed to satisfy these criteria because he was not using sufficient drug and did not need to embark upon a withdrawal programme. 
     
      
    24 In support of the finding made by the officer that he was seeking to hide or minimise his drug use, counsel appearing for the Authority relied upon a statement in the parole report to the effect that the applicant had failed a urine test which had proved positive for drugs, notwithstanding that he had signed a statement stating that he was not using drugs at that particular time. The officer reports that the applicant refused to accept that he had “dirty urine” and refused to accept that he had been using drugs such that he would fail that test. It was put that this was sufficient to justify the finding by the officer that he was hiding or attempting to hide and attempting to minimise his drug usage. 
     
      
    25 The difficulty for this Court is that it is confronted by a statement in a report which may or may not be false, and yet there is insufficient information before this Court to determine whether it is false or misleading. This was a situation where on its face there is nothing to indicate that the statement is unreliable yet the parolee gives evidence before the Authority that it was false. I do not understand how this Court is supposed to determine that issue and I would have thought that it is a matter for the Parole Authority to resolve. 
     
      
    26 The problem in this case I think lies, with respect, in the reasons or lack of reasons given by the Parole Authority or by the Chairperson of the Authority on its behalf, in determining to allow the revocation order to remain. Notwithstanding that the applicant had given sworn evidence before the Authority in respect of his drug usage and what he was doing about it, the Authority simply indicated that one of the reasons why it was not persuaded to overturn the earlier decision was his drug usage. In those circumstances it is difficult to know whether or not the statement in the report was false or whether it was influential in the determination made by the Parole Authority in light of the fact that the applicant had given evidence before it. It may simply be that the Authority determined not to accept the applicant’s evidence in relation to his drug usage and what he had been telling the officer about it. The Authority simply says nothing about what it made of the evidence given by the applicant. This is unsatisfactory and I would have thought it a matter of common fairness that the Authority indicate in the face of evidence given by the parolee why it decided to maintain the revocation order in more particularity than it did on this occasion. 
     
      
    27 The same problem arises in relation to the next ground of complaint. It is said that the following statement in the report of 16 March 2006 was misleading. The officer, under the heading, “Response to Supervision”, stated concerns about the applicant’s failure to obey directions in relation to where he was to reside. 
     
      
    28 The following passage appears in the report of 15 March as follows, 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Following his release the day prior and whilst reporting to this office on 2 February 2006 the applicant persistently argued that he wanted to move residence immediately in order to reside with his fiancée who resided in Waterloo. His fiancée was allegedly a Chinese student who returned to Australia around the time of the applicant’s release. 
         
         
        The parolee was informed that such a request would be considered after a period of time during which he must demonstrate positive progress and compliance with the conditions of his parole obligations. The applicant did not accept such a direction and was reportedly staying overnight and away from his approved residence within days [of being released]. This Service has been unable to verify his whereabouts on those evenings other than to confirm he was staying with his fiancée. The parolee spent only two nights in his approved residence before seeking independent accommodation with his fiancée. 
        
       
      
    29 It has been noted that one of the conditions placed upon the applicant was that he not proceed to the central business district of Sydney without consent from his officer. Under dint of argument counsel for the applicant was driven to argue that the condition that the applicant reside with his parents, as opposed to his fiancée, was unreasonable and, therefore, the passage that I have read from the report of 15 March was misleading in that the Parole Authority would not have understood that the condition was unreasonable. 
     
      
    30 Counsel, however, did concede ultimately that the proper place for an argument to be raised about whether a condition of parole was unreasonable and, therefore, whether a breach of it should be considered as a reason for revoking parole was before the Parole Authority and not before this Court. It is not for me to determine, at least in these proceedings, whether a condition of parole is unreasonable and the argument, if it had any merit, fails on that basis alone. 
     
      
    31 There does not seem to me to be anything misleading at all in the statement that has been set out from that report. It seemed to reflect the true situation, that is, that in breach of a condition of his parole the applicant was insistent upon living in a place that was not approved and with a person who was not approved and therefore was in breach of that condition of his parole. 
     
      
    32 The next matter that was raised concerned the report of 21 May 2006. This was the first of the reports recommending that the applicant’s parole be revoked. The complaint arises from the first page of the report which states the date and details of the alleged breach. There it sets out seven matters in chronological order that are said to have been breaches of the parole. 
     
      
    33 The first is dated 20 March 2006 and it relates to the positive analysis of the applicant’s urine that he had refused to accept and to which reference has already been made. This is followed by a complaint that the applicant had been entering the Sydney CBD, in breach of his parole condition. The next alleged breach is that on 24 April the applicant failed to report to the Service. The next alleged that on 4 May 2006 the applicant admitted to using methamphetamine every two to three days in the previous month, that is April 2006. 
     
      
    34 The complaint is that the setting out of these breaches in this way was misleading because the 4 May 2006 breach was in fact a reference back to the details under 20 March 2006 because, in that respect, on 12 April 2006 the applicant admitted to using the drug known as “ice” over the previous two to three days. The argument is that this chronology would lead the Parole Authority to believe that the situation was worse than it was because of, in effect, the double counting of the breaches of the parole order during April 2006. 
     
      
    35 I do not accept the argument. It seems to me to be on its face a fair statement of the breaches that had occurred and it would be evident to anybody who read the report what were the true circumstances upon which the report was based and the breaches which were being relied upon. 
     
      
    36 The next complaint is again made about the breaches set out in that part of the report to which I have already referred. As part of those breaches are two dealing with the failure by the applicant to report to the service. The first is under the date of 8 May 2005 and the report alleges that the applicant breached his parole by failing to report to the service as directed. Particulars given are as follows. 
     
      
       
        
         
        The applicant sought permission to enter the Sydney CBD to meet with his solicitor. However, he failed to report to this officer as directed later the same day. 
        
       
      
    37 The second matter arose on 19 May 2006 when again the applicant was alleged to have failed to contact the service as directed. The particulars given are as follows. 
     
      
       
        
         
        On 18 May 2006 a home visit was conducted to the parolee’s approved place of residence. Access to the applicant’s apartment was gained through the assistance of the caretaker. A card was left under the parolee’s front door directing him to contact his supervising officer on 19 May 2006 without fail. He failed to do so. 
        
       
      
    38 The applicant gave evidence about these allegations before the Authority. There was some confusion in his mind about the two dates but it is obvious that the applicant was asserting that he had an explanation for each of the alleged failures to do what he ought to have done under the conditions of his parole in relation to either reporting or contacting the supervising officer. In relation to the first breach, that is 8 May, the applicant gave evidence that he did report to the officer later that day but that the officer who was supervising him had left. He claimed to have signed in at the office, indicating that he had reported as required. In effect, he was claiming that it was not his fault that the officer had left the office before he could attend. Therefore, on his behalf it was submitted the breach was a technical one, if in fact he had breached his parole condition at all. 
     
      
    39 In relation to the next breach, that is on 19 May, his explanation was that normally a card was placed in his letter box and he received it and complied with it demand. On this occasion, however, the card was placed under the door and went underneath a mat so that he was unaware that the card was present or the obligation to report or contact the office in accordance with the request until two days later when the card was found. He said that he spoke to the officer about this problem and she instructed him to come in the next day, which he did. 
     
      
    40 Again, one of the difficulties is that the parole officer was not called and so she was not cross-examined or questioned about these circumstances and as to whether or not there might have been be some substance in the explanations given by the applicant in evidence before the Authority. Once more the Authority did not deign to give reasons for rejecting the applicant’s evidence, if this is what it did. Once more the Authority can be criticised for failing to explain why, in light of the evidence given by the applicant, it determined to continue the revocation order. 
     
      
    41 On its face the statements about which complaint is made are neither false nor misleading. They might become so when one considers the evidence of the applicant and if it were accepted as being true. But even then it may simply be the case that a statement in a report has been explained in circumstances where the applicant is asserting that the apparent breach as set out in the report can be explained and, therefore, should be excused by the Authority. Such a situation does not enliven the jurisdiction of this Court under the relevant statutory provision where the Authority does not accept the explanation or excuse the breach. 
     
      
    42 But once again, notwithstanding that the applicant gave evidence about these matters, the Authority gave, as one of the reasons for taking the stand that it did, his “failure to report”. The Authority says nothing to explain why it came to the finding that he had failed to report or why if he did it should be considered as a breach of his parole in light of the evidence given by the applicant. 
     
      
    43 In argument counsel conceded that this was a difficulty for his client and that perhaps, if any relief were available against the orders made by the Authority, it would be relief of an administrative law nature based upon a complaint about the lack of appropriate or proper reasons being given by the Authority in light of the material that was before it. Whether or not such a complaint would in the circumstances of this matter be sufficient for this Court to interfere in the business of the Parole Authority is not for me to determine. I am simply trying to point out the limit of this Court’s power to make orders under this section or under s 155. It is however of concern that the Parole Authority gives what, with respect, appear to be insufficient reasons to explain how it came to its decision based upon the material before it. In any event, it does not seem to me that there is any merit in the complaint made in relation to the actual reports. If there is any justifiable complaint, it arises from the reasons given or not given by the Parole Authority to justify its decision. 
     
      
    44 It seems to me, therefore, notwithstanding that perhaps understandably the applicant may feel aggrieved with the situation and that his efforts of reform have gone unacknowledged and his efforts to comply with his parole conditions was not given sufficient weight by the Authority or by the officer perhaps, it is not a matter which can be reviewed by this Court on such an application as before it. Again, this is one of these cases that does raise questions about the effectiveness of this form of application as being any sort of relief to a parolee who has complaints about the procedure adopted or the reasons given or the decision made by the Authority. 
     
      
    45 Criticism of the appropriateness or the effectiveness of this type of procedure for reviewing the decisions of the Authority has been raised before by this Court and by Court of Criminal Appeal. However, it remains and it is for this Court to apply the provisions as best it can to determine the complaints falling under the relevant provisions for whatever good it might ultimately do. 
     
      
    46 In the present case I am of the view that the application should be dismissed. 
     
      
    47 HIS HONOUR: Is there any order for costs? 
     
      
       
      MORRIS: No, your Honour. 
       
      
    48 HIS HONOUR: I do not make any order for costs. I hand you back that letter.

     ADAMS, Haik Aramice v REGINA 
     
     
     Judgment 
      
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to two counts: firstly, that between 4 April 2001 and 5 May 2001 at South Penrith in the State of New South Wales, he did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, of an amount being not less than the commercial quantity for such drug; secondly, that he, on 4 May 2001 at St Marys in the State of New South Wales, did supply a prohibited drug, namely, methylamphetamine.2 The applicant was charged and sentenced with two other offenders. John Christou pleaded guilty to a charge that he, between 4 April 2001 and 5 May 2001, did knowingly take part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine in an amount being not less than the commercial quantity for such drug.3 The other offender, Geoffrey Steven Hottes, pleaded guilty to a charge that he, before the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug was committed by Haik Aramice Adams and John Christou, aided in the commission of this offence.4 The maximum penalty for the offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug is imprisonment for twenty years. The maximum penalty for the offence of supplying the prohibited drug is imprisonment for fifteen years. The maximum penalty for the offence of aiding and knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug of an amount not less than the commercial quantity is imprisonment for twenty years.5 The sentencing judge had before him an agreed statement of facts. It is not necessary, for the purposes of this application, to set out all of the facts. However, in summary, his Honour found that the applicant and Mr Christou had, together, made arrangements to obtain the necessary materials and equipment to manufacture methylamphetamine. 6 Mr Hottes’ involvement in the enterprise was, as the charge to which he had pleaded indicates, to lend support to the operation before the manufacture took place and, in that respect, he provided the appropriate facilities.7 His Honour found that Mr Hottes made available his garage in South Penrith to be used by the applicant and Mr Christou to set up a laboratory and “cook” and do the necessary extraction. He also provided assistance in the purchase of airline tickets and organised another person to collect drums of methylated spirits. As the charges indicate, the applicant pleaded guilty to the further offence of supplying methylamphetamine.8 When considering the appropriate sentences his Honour, having considered the relevant facts, was careful to identify that in relation to the applicant he was required to be sentenced not only for his involvement in the manufacture, but also his involvement in supply. This, of course, distinguished his criminal activity from that of the other two offenders.9 His Honour related the personal circumstances of each of the offenders and drew attention to the fact that the applicant had apparently been suffering financial distress because of the failure of a motor car accessory business which he had entered upon. It would seem that, at least in part, his motivation for these offences, was an endeavour to make a profit to retrieve his financial position.10 When determining the sentence which he would impose his Honour found that the offences to which each of the offenders had pleaded guilty were serious. In relation to the applicant his Honour noted that his counsel conceded that the applicant’s conduct amounted to trafficking in a substantial degree and that the only appropriate penalty was a period of full-time imprisonment.11 The applicant’s counsel apparently made submissions that a finding of special circumstances should be made and a relatively short non-parole period imposed. 12 His counsel submitted that the amount of methylamphetamine found in the applicant’s possession at the time of his arrest was something less than the commercial quantity of 250 grams, although it was conceded on behalf of the applicant that his criminality lies in the fact that he was knowingly concerned in the manufacture of 331.7 grams, the wholesale value of that quantity, based on its purity, which was found to vary from pure to 31.3%. It was agreed, and his Honour found that the wholesale value of the substance seized was $31,000.13 Apparently, it was the applicant’s intention to sell the drugs wholesale and, accordingly, the wholesale value was a relevant consideration in relation to the offence of supply a prohibited drug. The applicant’s counsel submitted to the sentencing judge that, having regard to the nature of the manufacture, that the fact that he also has committed a “supply” offence was an inevitable consequence of the initial offending.14 It was submitted to his Honour that the term of imprisonment for the supply offence should be wholly concurrent with the term of imprisonment imposed in relation to the manufacture offence which was described as the primary offence.15 His Honour noted that the applicant had no prior convictions and found that his prospects of rehabilitation were excellent, and then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In coming to that decision [in relation to the applicant], I bear in mind that the evidence before me, such as it is, discloses that Haik Adams’ involvement was, to some extent, more significant than his co-offenders’.” 
        
       
      
    16 The agreed statement of facts contains this statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “The totality of the conversations involving all three offenders and others establish that the offenders were engaged in the manufacture for sale (and planned distribution in Adams’ case) of methylamphetamine.” 
        
       
      
    17 His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that it was Adams who organised the sale. In the case of Mr Adams the only aggravating factors referred to in s 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999 are referred to in subs (2(m), (n). The offence involved a series of criminal acts and it was part of a planned and organised criminal activity.” 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour then identified the relevant mitigating factors and considered whether or not it was necessary to backdate the sentence which he would impose. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I note that Haik Adams has been in custody since 2 July 2004 and that that custody is partly referable to these offences. I also note that prior to that he spent sixty-one days in custody, totally referable to these offences. In my view it is appropriate that the sentence I impose be backdated to 1 May 2004.” 
        
       
      
    19 The solicitor who appeared for the applicant today drew the Court’s attention to the indication in the particulars of trial that the applicant had been in continuous custody since 13 March 2004. It was suggested that, accordingly, the remark by his Honour that the applicant had been in custody since 2 July 2004 may not be correct.20 I am satisfied his Honour’s statement was correct, although not clear because his Honour did not identify when that period of custody in fact commenced. It was conceded that what occurred was that the applicant was taken into custody for other matters on 13 March 2004, and an application for bail in relation to the present offences was refused on 2 July 2004. This would appear to be the origin of that date in his Honour’s remarks on sentence.21 I also note that in the transcript of the sentencing hearing, the applicant’s counsel conceded to his Honour that it would be appropriate to have regard to the fact that bail was refused in relation to the present matters on 2 July 2004.22 Thus, the approach which his Honour took when ultimately sentencing the applicant appears to be explained by those dates and the concession made by counsel.23 In this appeal, the solicitor appearing for the applicant urged upon the Court that by taking the course which his Honour did, in the passage I have quoted, his Honour has misused his discretion in relation to the back-dating of the sentence. I do not believe this to be the case. His Honour had to make a decision as to the allowance which he should make when back-dating the sentence, having regard to the fact that the applicant was held in custody in relation to other matters. By allowing, as he did, for the sentence in relation to these matters to be back-dated to 1 May, and bearing in mind his Honour passed sentence on 19 November, I am of the view that an appropriate, if not generous, allowance was made when the sentence was back-dated. 24 His Honour imposed sentences on the applicant as follows: for the offence of being concerned with the manufacture, he imposed a sentence of four years to date from 1 May 2004 and to expire on 30 April 2008. He imposed a non-parole period of two years to date from 1 May 2004 and to expire on 30 April 2006.25 In relation to the offence of supply prohibited drug his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months to date from 1 May 2004 and to expire on 31 January 2005. His Honour said, after having pronounced the sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        “In imposing those sentences I have regard to the totality of the offender’s criminality.” 
        
       
      
    26 In relation to Christou his Honour received submissions that his position could be distinguished from that of the applicant on the basis that it was the applicant who organised the sale of the end product and who co-ordinated the enterprise. His Honour said that he accepted that the applicant’s involvement was, to some extent, more significant than that of his co-offenders. He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, the fact remains that Mr Christou was heavily involved in what was going on and had been from the outset. Any difference in his involvement and Mr Adams’ involvement is not such as would entitle him to a penalty different in nature from that imposed upon Mr Adams.” 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour then gives further consideration to the appropriate penalty for Christou, making plain that he was giving consideration to a submission that by reason of the difference between the applicant’s and Mr Christou’s involvement, Mr Christou should be sentenced to a term of periodic detention.28 His Honour rejected that submission and in my opinion, his reference to a penalty different in nature in the passage which I have quoted, was a reference to the submission that the sentence for Christou might be by way of periodic detention.29 Accordingly, his Honour’s findings should be understood as identifying the applicant as a more significant offender than his co-offenders and should be sentenced on the basis that he was the person who organised the sale of the end product and co-ordinated the enterprise.30 His Honour noted that Christou had already spent eighty-three days in custody referable to the charge to which he had pleaded guilty. His Honour made a finding of special circumstances and sentenced Christou to a total term of imprisonment of three years and four months to commence on 26 August 2004 and to expire on 25 December 2007.31 He was sentenced to a non-parole period of one year and eight months to commence on 26 August 2004 and expire on 25 April 2006. In relation to Hottes I have already described the circumstances of his offending.32 His Honour noted that Hottes had been in custody from 4 May 2001 to 2 August 2001 in relation to the relevant offence. His Honour had regard to that matter and imposed a sentence of a term of imprisonment of three years to date from 23 August 2004 and expire on 22 August 2007. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 23 August 2004.33 The applicant filed written submissions in which three grounds of appeal were suggested. The solicitor appearing for him today rightly conceded that ground two could not respectably be advanced and it was withdrawn. The solicitor accepted that in effect the submission which the applicant sought to advance was that the sentencing discretion miscarried by reason of the discrepancy of the sentence between the applicant and Christou.34 I have already addressed the submission which was advanced in relation to the way in which his Honour backdated the sentence for the applicant. The applicant's solicitor also submitted in relation to the matter of parity that there was a discrete issue arising from the failure of his Honour to mark out the influence which the prior convictions of Christou, in particular, but also of Hottes, had in the sentences which his Honour imposed.35 The criminal histories to which reference is made were in my opinion minor. His Honour correctly noted the existence of prior convictions and correctly identified that the applicant had no prior record. Beyond noting those matters, in my opinion, their significance was of little moment in the exercise of the sentencing discretion and no further explanation was required. 36 That leaves the substantial ground argued in the written submissions and supported orally today. To my mind, having regard to the findings of the sentencing judge, to which I have referred, there were sound reasons for the imposition of a greater sentence on the applicant in relation to the charge of manufacture than on the other offenders. His Honour's finding that the applicant was effectively in command of the criminal activities is sufficient to put the matter to rest.37 It must also be borne in mind that the applicant pleaded guilty to two offences, one was the manufacture of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and the other supply. He pleaded guilty to both matters. 38 The applicant drew attention to a submission made by the Crown at the sentencing hearing, to the effect that ""although Mr Adams obviously organised this sale in terms of the charge of knowingly involved in the manufacture that they are equally culpable."" The applicant complained that his Honour's sentence, when recounting this submission, does not reflect what is said to be the concession of equal culpability. 39 It is important to understand that that concession was made exclusively in relation to manufacture but was not made in relation to the overall criminal enterprise. It was because of the applicant's part in the overall activity that, in my opinion, his Honour imposed a greater sentence on the applicant in relation to the manufacture offence.40 I have already noted that the applicant's solicitor today abandoned the second ground originally advanced by the applicant in his written submissions. That ground referred to the principles provided by the High Court when sentencing offenders in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. It may be that in the approach which his Honour took when relating the sentences which he imposed that some problems existed in the application of the Pearce principle. However, if there is a problem the consequence would likely be, in my opinion, that a separate and discrete term of imprisonment may have been imposed in relation to the supply offence and that that term may have been required at least in part to be provided cumulatively rather than concurrently as his Honour did.41 Having regard to the matters to which I have referred, I am satisfied that the criminal enterprise in which the applicant played the central role was well organised and sophisticated. The crimes were committed for profit and born in part from the need for the applicant to meet the financial straits in which he found himself. 42 When considered against the maximum term for the relevant offences, I am satisfied that no lesser sentence could have been imposed in relation to each matter. Although I would grant leave to appeal, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.43 JAMES J: I agree with the Chief Judge.44 HALL J: I also agree with the Chief Judge.45 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly, the orders of the Court are as I have indicated.

     Adam SHAABAN v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     EX TEMPORE Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I will ask Rothman J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 ROTHMAN J: The applicant, Adam Shaaban, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by her Honour Judge English on 11 April 2006.  
     
      
    3 The applicant was charged with ongoing supply of prohibited drug, namely, methylamphetamine and ecstasy, the date of offence being between 8 December 2004 and 21 December 2004, contrary to section 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The maximum penalty for such an offence is 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for twenty years, or both.  
     
      
    4 The applicant pleaded guilty before the Local Court and adhered to that plea of guilty before the District Court. In the course of the sentencing, the applicant sought to take into account six further offences in a Form 1 being the following:  
     
      
       
      (i) supply prohibited drug, ecstacy; 
       
       
      (ii) possess prohibited drug, cannabis; 
       
       
      (iii) possess prohibited drug, methylamphetamine; 
       
       
      (iv) goods in custody (money); 
       
       
      (v) goods in custody (money); and 
       
       
      (vi) premises considered organised drug premises.  
       
      
    5 Taking into account the matters in the Form 1, her Honour sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of two years’ imprisonment commencing 21 December 2004 and expiring on 20 December 2006 with an overall term of four years commencing 21 December 2004 and expiring on 20 December 2008.  
     
      
    6 The applicant, who is self represented, raises grounds which, in essence, are that her Honour’s sentence was manifestly excessive. He raises issues associated with the subjective circumstances under which he came to be involved in these offences and the subjective circumstances associated with the conditions of his imprisonment. Further, he relies upon assistance to authorities said to have been given in relation to offences other than the ones with which he was charged.  
     
      
    7 There is no doubt that information has been given to police. That information was information already known to the police, but at the time it was supplied, the applicant would not have known that fact.  
     
      
    8 Some of the aspects raised in the submissions of the applicant seem to relate more to his complaint about the denial of his parole at or after the parole hearing on 20 December 2006.  
     
      
    9 The current case is yet another example of the vicious circle into which people step when they chose to take a course of conduct that is illegal. In the current circumstances, the applicant says that he embarked upon the use of drugs (together with the abuse of alcohol) in order to self medicate the depression that he suffered following his father’s death. The use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol led him to deal in drugs for the purpose of supporting his habits.  
     
      
    10 He was arrested on 21 December 2004 and has been in custody ever since. His arrest came about from a controlled operation by the police in the Mount Druitt area in which police undercover operatives were supplied by the applicant with methylamphetamine with a purity of approximately 19% (the normal street purity being between 3 and 5%). Subsequent supply to undercover operatives occurred on 15 December 2004 and again on 17 December 2004. Admissions were made to the undercover operatives relating to other acts of supply. On 21 December 2004 the undercover operative in question purchased further methylamphetamine and ecstasy tablets, following which the applicant was arrested.  
     
      
    11 The applicant pleaded guilty, which I have already said, which plea has been taken into account by the sentencing judge in the fixing of the sentence imposed.  
     
      
    12 Sentencing is an exercise in the discretion of the judge in which he/she is required to take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion that is reached. In doing so, a sentencing judge balances the need to protect the community, to deter criminal activity (both by the particular offender and generally within the community), rehabilitation of the offender and community retribution of the criminal offence in question. It is not a purely logical exercise. It is, as stated, an exercise in discretion and an appeal against such an exercise will not be successful unless one of the well known grounds for disturbing an exercise of discretion is established.  
     
      
    13 Reasonable minds may differ on the exact outcome in any sentencing exercise. The only time that the Court of Criminal Appeal (or any appellate court) will interfere with the exercise of such a discretion is in the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        “It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court at first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.” ( 
        House v The King 
          
        (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505) 
        
       
      
    14 Whether the error of law or mistake of fact is identifiable or the error arises from a manifest excess in the sentence imposed, it is only where there is error that the Court of Criminal Appeal will intervene. In the present proceedings no error has been displayed.  
     
      
    15 Because the applicant is unrepresented, I examined the remarks on sentencing for errors that may not have been obvious to the applicant. No error is disclosed. All of the relevant matters have been taken into account by her Honour below and only matters that are relevant have been considered. Further, the sentence imposed is a sentence that is within range bearing in mind the discounts that have been applied and the finding of special circumstances. Her Honour found that the special circumstances warranted a more generous ratio between non-parole period and the remainder of sentence than the statute otherwise provides. The assistance given by the applicant while in gaol is not such as would warrant disturbing the sentence imposed by her Honour. The issues of treatment in gaol and the circumstances of the death of his fellow inmate raised in his submissions in this Court are matters for consideration by the Parole Authority, not by the Court of Criminal Appeal at this stage. 
     
      
    16 The other matters of which complaint is made involve issues associated with the denial of benefits during imprisonment and the denial by the Parole Authority of parole.  
     
      
    17 While great attention is paid by judicial officers who are required to sentence to the determination of the correct non-parole period, that period establishes the minimum time during which a prisoner is to remain in gaol. At the conclusion of the non-parole period, a prisoner is first eligible to be granted parole. The grant of parole is governed by the provisions of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) and in particular to the duty imposed upon the Parole Authority by section 135(1) of that Act. The exercise of the duty reposed in the Parole Authority by section 135(1) requires the Parole Authority to take into account a number of matters adumbrated in section 135(2) of the Act.  
     
      
    18 Ultimately the Parole Authority is entitled to grant parole if, and only if, it forms the view that the release of the offender is appropriate in the public interest. In the current circumstances, the applicant has been denied parole, it seems, largely on the basis of his use of illicit drugs while in prison and his failure to behave in a manner that would allow the Parole Authority to have confidence in the appropriateness of his release. No criticism can be made of the Parole Authority for its decision and none is made. The Court of Criminal Appeal cannot on this application, or otherwise, interfere with the exercise of the powers of the Parole Authority.  
     
      
    19 The grant of parole to the prisoner is a matter within the prisoner’s own hands. It requires a display of appropriate behaviour in prison. The sentence originally imposed upon the applicant was not imposed in error and discloses no error either identifiable or manifest. In the circumstances, I propose that the following orders be made: 
     
      
       
      (a) leave to appeal be granted; 
       
       
      (b) appeal be dismissed. 
       
      
    20 MCCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree. 
     
      
    21 HIDDEN J: I also agree. 
     
      
    22 MCCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly, the orders of the court are as proposed by Rothman J.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an appeal against conviction following a trial before Hulme DCJ and a jury at Sydney District Court. The indictment charged a single count of dishonestly destroying property by means of a fire with a view to making a gain (arson). The trial commenced on 19 March 2007 and the jury returned its verdict on 2 April 2007. The appellant was then placed in custody but on 22 June 2007 Hulme DCJ ordered his release on conditional bail. Sentence has not yet been passed. 
     
      
    2 In short, the Crown alleged that business premises owned by a company of which the appellant was the sole director were destroyed by fire in the early hours of the morning of 1 June 2004. There was evidence of the presence of accelerant having been applied to the premises, that the appellant had shortly before the fire substantially increased the insurance cover on the building, of the appellant’s financial situation and need for funds and the closing of the premises and departures therefrom on the evening prior to the fire. In proof of its case the Crown also relied upon lies asserted to have been told by the appellant as evidencing a consciousness of his guilt. He had been interviewed by police and also by an insurance claims assessor. There is no complaint about the correctness or adequacy of the directions given by his Honour in regard to the use that the jury might make of any finding that the appellant had lied.  
     
      
    3 Two grounds of appeal are advanced. Ground one is expressed thus: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial proceedings miscarried by reason of the omission of the trial judge to give the jury a direction in accordance with  
        Azzopardi v The Queen 
         (2001) 205 CLR 50 as to the use which might be made by the jury of the fact that the appellant did not give evidence in the trial. The appellant relies on the decision of this Court in  
        R v Johnston 
          
        [2007] NSWCCA 133.” 
        
       
      
    4 The appellant did not give evidence. There is no dispute that in his charge to the jury his Honour made no mention of this fact and hence gave no warning or caution to the jury about the absence of evidence from the appellant. 
     
      
    5 The much quoted passage from the majority judgment in Azzopardi (Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) at p 70 reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the course of argument of the present matters it was suggested that if a judge said nothing to the jury about the fact that an accused had not given evidence, the jury may use the accused’s silence in court to his or her detriment. Plainly, that is so. It follows that if an accused does not give evidence at trial it will almost always be desirable for the judge to warn the jury that the accused’s silence in court is not evidence against the accused, does not constitute an admission by the accused, may not be used to fill gaps in the evidence tendered by the prosecution, and may not be used as a make-weight in assessing whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. ”. 
        
       
      
    6 Given their Honours’ expression “will almost always be desirable” an issue arises whether the current case is one where the omission has or has not given rise to miscarriage.  
     
      
    7 As above noted, the trial commenced on 19 March 2007. Johnston, cited in the ground of appeal, was decided in this Court on 14 March 2007. We have been informed that Hulme DCJ became aware of the decision after the trial and drew it to the attention of counsel. In Johnston the critical issue at trial was whether a victim of assault had correctly identified the accused as one of his assailants. He had not given evidence but in address his counsel pointed out that he was content to rely upon what he had said in a video taped interview by police which was before that jury. Counsel said that she anticipated that the presiding judge would give some directions about the right of the accused to remain silent but in the event he did not refer to the matter. Neither counsel at trial drew attention to this omission. 
     
      
    8 A further aspect of similarity to the present case was that in Johnston, the Crown also relied upon an asserted telling of a lie by the accused. Johnston’s conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered. 
     
      
    9 The Crown has sought to distinguish Johnston on several bases. First, it was pointed out that in the present case neither counsel (nor the Judge) said anything about the absence of evidence from the appellant in contrast with the mention by counsel in her address in the case of Johnston. Second, it was submitted in the present case nothing was said which drew attention to the fact that the appellant had not given evidence. In fact witnesses (the appellant’s wife, mother-in-law and a business associate) had been called in the defence case and the absence of the appellant must have been glaringly obvious to the jury. Third, as counsel sought no direction even though his Honour made the usual enquiry at the end of his charge to the jury as to whether anything further was desired by counsel, it “may also indicate that counsel at trial saw some tactical advantage in not having the matter brought to the jury’s attention.” Like McClellan CJ at CL in Johnston who responded to a similar submission, I cannot contemplate what tactical advantage might be perceived. I cannot identify a reason why the appellant would be well served by the omission of the caution suggested in Azzopardi. 
     
      
    10 In any event we have received without objection an affidavit by counsel who appeared at trial. That affidavit shows that the failure to ask for directions was an oversight and not a deliberate tactic by the accused. 
     
      
    11 I accept that the giving of such caution is not mandatory in every case. The extract from the joint judgment above quoted makes that plain. Nevertheless the ultimate question is whether, given the omission in the particular case, the appellant has lost a fair chance of acquittal and I would answer that question in the affirmative. 
     
      
    12 Ground 2 is expressed: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence of the witness Phillip Etienne (transcript 20 March 2007 at 55 – 75) relating to the activities of a dog by the name of Ellie should not have been admitted.” 
        
       
      
    13 The dog Ellie was trained to detect accelerants and her responses were used as a screening tool to point forensic police to places from which samples might usefully be gathered. After gathering the samples were taken and later analysed. It was the analysis that demonstrated the presence of accelerant. This was the potentially probative evidence and not any action observed to be being undertaken by the dog.  
     
      
    14 The appellant relied upon R v Benecke [1999] NSWCCA 163. That case concerned evidence of the behaviour of a tracker dog. The dog had appeared to follow a scent from the scene of a robbery at a service station to the rear of the fence of premises where the accused person had resided until a few months before the robbery. It was held that the evidence of the dog’s behaviour was of little probative value and, if admitted, should have been accompanied by particular warnings, notably that the dog could not be cross-examined and care should be taken not to overstate the reliability of the operation of canine senses. 
     
      
    15 The evidence concerning Ellie was merely part of a chain of events which led to the selection of locations at which samples were taken. It was appropriate in the interests of continuity for the Crown to call that evidence but as the evidence of probative value was the result of analysis of the sample taken, it could not have mattered whether the samples were taken randomly or as a result of being pointed to them by the dog.  
     
      
    16 I would reject ground 2. However, in the light of my conclusion on ground 1 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal against conviction allowed. 
       
      (2) Conviction quashed. 
       
      (3) New trial ordered. 
       
      
    17 HULME J: I agree. 
     
      
    18 SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
     
      
    19 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I propose.

     Judgment 
    [1] These are proceedings for defamation which were listed for hearing for five days commencing on 17 May 2010. After ten days of hearing and extensive submissions to 24 August 2010, I handed down my decision in Bechara v Bonacorso (No. 4) [2010] NSWDC 234 and made orders as follows: 
     
     (1) Judgment for the defendant for each of the first, second and third matters complained of. 
      
      
     (2) Plaintiff pay defendant’s costs. 
      
      
     (3) Liberty to restore concerning costs. 
      
      
     (4) Exhibits retained for 28 days. 
      
    [2] The defendant now brings an application by notice of motion pursuant to s 40 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) and r 42.15A Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (hereafter “UCPR”), that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of the proceedings: 
     
     (a) on a party and party basis until 29 August 2009, and 
      
      
     (b) on an indemnity basis thereafter. 
    [3] The principal basis for the application is that on 28 August 2009 (after the pleadings were closed, and before the matter was listed for trial) the defendant served an offer of compromise in accordance with r 20.26 UCPR offering to settle the proceedings on the following basis: 
     
     (a) Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff; 
      
      
     (b) Defendant to pay the plaintiff $35,000; 
      
      
     (c) Defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs as agreed or assessed. 
    [4] The affidavit of Mr John Puleo deposes to having sent the offer of compromise on 28 August 2009. This letter was not replied to. No counter offer was ever made by the plaintiff. Accordingly, as provided for by r 42.15A, the defendant is entitled to indemnity costs from the expiry of the offer, unless the court otherwise orders. The court has a discretion to make a different order from that specified in the rules in order to prevent substantial injustice in an exceptional case, but the exercise of that discretion would be “rare”: Leichhardt Municipal Council v Green [2004] NSWCA 341 at [19]; Melchior v Sydney Adventist Hospital [2009] NSWSC 65 at [15]; Regency Media Pty Ltd v AAV Australia Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 368 at [14]; Gaskin v Ollerenshaw [2010] NSWSC 874.[5] Counsel for the defendant submits that this is not an exceptional case, and points to the following as being relevant not only on this issue, but also concerning s 40 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW): 
     
      
     (a) Each of the three matters complained of was a very limited publication, being ostensibly to one person each, with a possible republication of the first and second matters complained of to those persons authorised to use the COPS data retrieval system set up by the NSW Police Service. Only part of one of the publications was in fact found to have been made; 
      
      
     (b) No evidence at all was led at the trial concerning the third publication; 
      
      
     (c) As to the first and second publications, it is asserted these were “classic” qualified privilege claims where the defendant, an authorised representative of his business (where the first car fire occurred) and family company (where the second car fire occurred), had gone to the police following the occurrence of these and another car fire which happened to his neighbour’s vehicle. The neighbour had been actively supporting the defendant’s opposition to the plaintiff’s company’s development proposals for property in the residential area known as the Strathfield Triangle. 
      
    [6] The defendant submits, and I agree, that the amount offered was generous, given the limited extent of publication of each of the matters complained of and the facts of the case. In addition, the plaintiff would have been entitled to a judgment in his favour, as well as payment of his costs if he had accepted the offer. The defendant points out that at all relevant times the plaintiff was represented by senior counsel and a solicitor who were experienced in defamation law and that it would be safe to assume that these persons had given sound advice to the plaintiff concerning the relevant principles.[7] The plaintiff submits that the phrase “unless the court orders otherwise” (r 42.15A(2) UCPR) means that the court should order otherwise where it is in the interests of justice. The following are matters relied upon: 
     
     (a) Those imputations pleaded in the first publication which I found to be conveyed were defamatory entitle the plaintiff to have brought the litigation as he had suffered a wrong.  
      
      
     (b) The plaintiff did not have enough information about the defendant’s claim to enable him to accept the defendant’s offer at the time, and there were significant changes to the defendant’s case during the trial. 
    [8] As to the first matter, the defendant submits that a partial success of this limited nature on one issue in the case should not entitle a party to avoid the consequences of failure to accept the offer, and that the nature of defamation actions is such that the test is not whether the publication is defamatory but whether the defamation is actionable: The Honourable Justice M H McHugh AC, “When is a defamation actionable?”, Aspects of the Law of Defamation in NSW, Law Society of NSW, 1990. As to the second, the defendant submits that while r 20.26(4) UCPR provides that a plaintiff may not make an offer unless the defendant has been given such particulars of the claim as are necessary to consider the offer, there is no comparable provision in respect of an offer by the defendant. However, the defendant’s case was, it is submitted, abundantly clear to the plaintiff at all times, and the complaints raised at trial by the plaintiff’s counsel about asserted inadequacies of particulars and answers to interrogatories (e.g. complaints that there were too many particulars, or that matters were particularized rather than provided as answers to interrogatories) were technicalities. Counsel for the defendant, in helpful written submissions, has carefully analysed all of these objections to particulars, and I do not propose to set these out again.[9] The defendant submits (written submissions, paragraph 22) that similar objections could be raised by the defendant to the plaintiff’s conduct of the trial, including the vastly expanded case on malice (in circumstances where the defendant’s request for particulars had not been answered) and the production, on day 4 of the trial, of four lever-arch folders of documents which had never been discovered (T 286). The production of undiscovered documents during defamation trials and the expansion of particulars are, however, a common occurrence in defamation trials, so I shall simply note these matters, as well as the matters I set out in my judgment at [258].[10] None of the circumstances put to me on behalf of the plaintiff, or of which I am aware as the trial judge, would justify the exercise of the discretion to “otherwise order”. The applicability of s 40 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)[11] Although the defendant’s written submissions refer to s 40 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), no submission is made for any costs orders for any period other than that covered by the offer of compromise. The plaintiff made no submissions concerning s 40 beyond repeating the submissions on the offer of compromise. [12] I briefly noted that s 40 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), or its predecessor s 48A Defamation Act 1974 (NSW), have been applied in similar circumstances by McClellan CJ at CL in Davis v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 946 (plaintiff’s offer of compromise for an amount very close to the damages award results in indemnity costs); Larach v Urriola (No 2) [2009] NSWDC 142 (defendant’s “walk away” offer insufficient and indemnity costs ordered); Hennessy v Lynch (No. 4) [2008] NSWDC 15 (defendant’s offer of compromise of $33,500 substantially better than the judgment sum awarded to the plaintiff) and the Federal Court in National Auto Glass Supplies (Aust) Pty Ltd v Nielsen & Moller Auto Glass (NSW) Pty Ltd (No.9) [2007] FCA 1826 (costs application by defendant who succeeded in the majority of the defamation claims) and s 48A was most recently considered by the NSW Court of Appeal in Habib v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2010] NSWCA 291.[13] While s 40 may apply in circumstances where no offers are made or relevant, where an offer has been made, the section confers the advantage of indemnity costs unless the court otherwise orders. In Davis, the plaintiff made an offer of compromise of $150,000, and ultimately received a sum, inclusive of interest, of $150,736.00. The defendant made a “walk away” offer, which it was submitted was sufficient to amount to compliance with s 40. McClellan CJ at CL did not accept this submission, nor did he accept that the failure of the plaintiff on certain aspects of the claim, such as the finding that a number of the imputations pleaded had not been conveyed, would disentitle the plaintiff to such a claim. [14] Where a defendant has complied with s 40, and the plaintiff has failed to accept the offer (s 40(2)), the court “must” make an order for indemnity costs if the plaintiff “unreasonably failed to accept a settlement offer made by the defendant”: National Auto Glass Supplies (Aust) Pty Ltd v Nielsen & Moller Auto Glass (NSW) Pty Ltd (No. 9) [2007] FCA 1826.[15] When considering whether the court should otherwise order, regard should be had to the purpose of this provision, because the cost of defamation litigation may be very high, and the trials “combative”, to use Levine J’s description of the multiple trials in Antoniadis v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 24 April 1997). Even where the extent of publication is limited, defamation actions may still result in very substantial legal costs. For instance, in Skalkos v Assaf [2002] NSWCA 14, where there were two limited publications (one to one person), the costs certificate for the trial totalled $941,444.77: Skalkos v T S Recoveries Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 281.[16] Even if an offer of compromise had not been made, these are matters which, in my view, would have warranted the making of costs orders under s 40.[17] Although entitled to do so under s 40, the orders sought by the defendant fall short of a request for indemnity costs for the trial. This is a moderate and sensible course of action in the circumstances, and to the credit of the defendant and those who have advised him during the conduct of this complex litigation.Orders [18] Accordingly, the orders I make are as follows: 
     
     (1) Vary order 2 of my orders of 15 October 2010 to provide that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of these proceedings on a party and party basis until 29 August 2009, and on an indemnity basis thereafter; 
      
     (2) The plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of this motion on an indemnity basis.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: John Leslie Wakefield appears for sentence on two serious offences, they being two offences of armed robbery, both committed in July 2009, less than a year after the offender was released on parole for a similar offence. 2 Mr Wakefield has spent thirty-seven of his last forty-two years in prison. His history of incarceration began at the tender of age of eleven. Since then he has been dealt with many times, most importantly for the purpose of sentencing for this offence, for armed robbery offences. Some of these have been much more serious than the two for which I have to sentence him.3 Let me deal with the facts of the present offences. On 2 July 2009 he went to Australia Post Office in Panania. He approached the counter, handed over a bag and said to the employee, “Put the money in the bag.” At this stage he was armed with what is described as a black rubber pipe, but he held it in such a way so that it looked like the barrel of a gun. Certainly the employee, the victim of this offence, believed that that is what he was armed with. He reinforced her belief by saying words to her which could only convey the meaning that if she did not cooperate with him, he was going to shoot her. No doubt, the experience of being robbed in this way was a terrifying one. She, of course, was not to know that he was incapable of shooting her. She, of course, was not to know that her life was not at risk. I have got no doubt that she genuinely feared for her life, and that the effects of this offence will continue for some time, if not forever. After presenting the weapon to her and asking for the notes, the employee handed over just more than $1,000 and the offender drove away. 4 The offender claims now that he is remorseful. That claim to be remorseful needs to be looked at in light of the fact that less than a month later the offender committed a remarkably similar offence. This time on 25 July 2009 he went into a video store, again presented the rubber pipe in a way that made it look like it was a gun, and demanded money. Through that means he obtained $300. Both of these offences were captured on closed-circuit television. 5 The police obtained a search warrant, went to the offender’s premises and discovered evidence incriminating him there. The offender made full admissions to the police when he was interviewed by them. 6 These offences were, as I have described them, very serious because of the circumstance that the victims must have believed that their lives were at risk, having what they believed to be a gun pointed at them. However, in looking at Mr Wakefield’s claims that he has begun the path of rehabilitation, it is perhaps instructive to have a look at what Mr Wakefield did in the past. The circumstances of his offence on 16 July 1990 are set out in a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal unreported 17 December 1993. He pointed a loaded sawn off shotgun only a few inches from the chest of one of the men who was in a post office on that occasion. So it can perhaps be said that the offender’s offences are becoming less serious. That is consistent with what he said to me today and what he has said to the psychologist and the probation and parole officer who interviewed him about his attitude towards his life so far. 7 The offender had an upbringing which can only be described as terrible. It involved him being exposed to a number of people, in particular relatives, who lived the lives of outlaws. He was used by his grandmother, who “cared” for him, in her thieving activities from a young age. He was only being cared for by his grandmother in the first place because his father was in gaol and his mother, for reasons that were not clear, was not looking after him. 8 In more recent times he has come under the care and attention of Mr and Mrs Clark. They are law abiding citizens who have put a great deal of effort and attention into caring for the offender. The offender is lucky to have met them and they are to be commended for what they have done. He went to live with them after his release on parole in July 2008, and he was for a while doing well. He had a job, but these offences were committed in circumstances where he found himself in debt. 9 At least part, if not a significant part, of the reason that he got into financial difficulty was because of his lack of living skills. As a person who has spent thirty-seven of the last forty-two years in gaol, he is, as Mr Wakefield has demonstrated, ill equipped to cope with financial matters. For example, he went into a bank seeking a loan for $3,000 but walked out with a loan for $12,000. Despite many attempts to obtain work, he was often thwarted by his criminal history. Employers would report to him that whilst he was a good worker, were such that once they found out about his criminal history, he was either not offered the job or terminated from the job he did have. In those circumstances he committed these two offences. He needed money, and the only way he knew to obtain it was to commit these offences. 10 He has expressed his remorse in many ways now. He wrote to the victims of the offences. He spoke about his remorse to the psychologist and the probation and parole officer, and he expressed his remorse in evidence today. I accept that he is sorry for what he has done. I accept that he regrets the decision that he made in July last year on two occasions to commit these offences, not only because it meant sending him back to gaol for a significant period of time but for many other reasons as well. He is sorry for the effects on the victim. He is sorry that he has let Mr and Mrs Clark down, and he is sorry that he has continued to take from the community when he should be putting something back into it.11 Of course, the offender was on parole at the time of these two offences. Since returning to custody his parole has been revoked. I have to be careful not to double count the circumstance of aggravation that the offender was on parole, in circumstances where it was the commission of these offences that has seen him returned to custody. I can say that I have not double counted and have chosen the appropriate penalty in light of the fact that I will commence the effective sentence that I will shortly impose upon the offender from today. 12 The offender’s record demonstrates a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. However, as I hope I have explained, there are some prospects for the future. I cannot say he has good prospects for rehabilitation. I can say, however, that he genuinely does desire to rehabilitate himself. It will be in his interests, and, of course, the community’s interests, that he is given as much assistance as possible whilst in gaol in order to promote the idea that upon his eventual release from custody, he will have living skills so as to reduce as much as is possible of the chances of him committing further offences when, perhaps, he gets into financial difficulties in the future. 13 There is occasionally publicity given to offenders serving sentences of imprisonment being allowed to leave the prison walls for the purposes of work release. Some commentators seem to have the view that a person in custody should remain in custody until the expiry of their sentence. What that fails to deal with, of course, is the circumstance that most offenders are eventually released back into the community, and it is in the community’s interests that they commit no further offences. Sometimes that is best achieved by sentences of personal deterrence. Sometimes that is best achieved by sentences which promote an offender’s rehabilitation. 14 In this case significant sentences are required to reflect the objective gravity of the offences and to reflect the aggravating circumstances I referred to. It is to be hoped that the prison authorities recognise the need to allow Mr Wakefield to engage in work release programs and similar, so that when he is released from custody he will have skills he does not presently have.15 There are no special circumstances in this case. It is to be noted that the offender has, according to the probation and parole report, breached every parole order he has ever been placed on. That itself is enough for me to say that there are no special circumstances justifying the extension of the period of eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period, so the overall sentence reflects the statutory ratio even if the individual sentences do not. 16 The offender has now developed an insight into his behaviour. He gave evidence at length today. He is articulate and personable, and I am satisfied that he recognises that the life he has lived has been rather futile. He is now fifty-three years of age. He will be spending a significant period of custody as a result of the sentence I will shortly impose, but with assistance of the prison authorities, I am satisfied that it is possible that the offender can do what he wants to do, that is live life outside gaol, putting something back into the community. 17 Of course, this being an armed robbery case, I should look at the decision of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. I note in comparison to the standard circumstances referred to in that case that the offender’s pleas in this case were early. The four to five year range in Henry is for a plea of guilty of limited assistance. The utilitarian value of the offender’s plea was much greater than the late plea postulated in Henry. It came at the earliest opportunity, and I have made an appropriate allowance for that. The weapon used by the offender was not as bad as the knife or similar weapon referred to in Henry. In realistic terms it was unlikely to have caused significant injury, albeit, as I have mentioned earlier in these remarks, the unfortunate victims of these offences did not know that. Of course, this is far from a young offender with little or no criminal history. These offences were planned to the extent that the offender obtained the rubber pipe and used it in a way that I have described. With those differences, however, the Henry guideline is important. 18 The guideline judgment itself was a response to growing concern about the prevalence of armed robbery offences. It is important for the purposes of general deterrence that those who would terrorise unfortunate employees of Australia Post or video stores for relatively small amounts of money understand that the courts do what they can to prevent offences such as these being committed in the future. General deterrence is of particular importance for offences of armed robbery.19 For the offence committed on 2 July 2009, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for five years. That is a fixed term because of the sentence I will pronounce on the second matter. That sentence is to commence on 18 February 2010, that is today.20 For the offence committed on 25 July 2009, the offender is also sentenced to a term of imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years and three months to commence on 18 February 2012, and a head sentence for that matter of five years. Thus, the overall sentence to be served by the offender consists of a non-parole period of five years and three months and a head sentence of seven years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 17 May 2015.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: In this matter the prosecution has advised me that the victim of these offences has prepared a victim impact statement which he proposes to tender. Mr Murray, who appears for the offender, has, correctly in my view, drawn my attention to the provisions of the legislation, which relate to the use of victim impact statements. The Crown concedes that, in this case, it does not propose to rely on anything contained in the statement, for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that is, as an aggravating or other factor in sentencing.2 It strikes me as a little difficult to understand the Crown’s position, if it is saying that the impact on the victim is not harm, but is still relevant to the process of sentencing. As I understand the purpose of the provisions relating to victim impact statements, it is to allow someone, who has been the victim of an offence, to express his or her feelings about the impact that the offence has had on them. A ‘victim impact statement’, as defined in s 26, means, “a statement containing particulars of”, and I omit some words, “any personal harm suffered by the victim as a direct result of the offence”, and ‘personal harm’ is defined as being the “actual physical bodily harm, mental illness or nervous shock”.3 The persons who are permitted to give statements are the victims themselves, and in some cases a professional person is allowed to assist them. In this case, the victim impact statement has been handed to me, and I have read it. It is the sort of statement that can be expected from someone who has been the victim of an offence such as this. It indicates that she has feelings of stress and anger and resentment, which is only to be expected. It also says that she has suffered anxiety and panic attacks, depression, damage to her self-esteem and damage to her relationships with other people. Again, that is to be expected.4 The question is whether those matters, or any of them, relate to mental illness or nervous shock. The term ‘nervous shock’ is not defined in the legislation. It is an expression, which has been used in the law to describe the sort of harm that people suffer in the course of exposure to various dangers, not just in criminal law, but also in civil law. It is usually taken to cover various sorts of disturbance or disorder, not amounting to a recognised mental illness. It is an expression, which is used to cover such events, as the harm suffered by a person who is a witness to a road accident in which someone is seriously injured, and obviously that causes harm.5 In the victim impact statement that is proposed to be tendered in this case, there is some material which, in my view, would fall within the expression ‘nervous shock’, and there is some material which describes mental illness. There is no question, at any time, that the victim suffered any actual physical harm. In its present form, a large part of the statement, although it is clearly what the victim feels, is not permissible as part of a victim impact statement, and those parts of it should be deleted. In my view, it is the responsibility of the prosecution, in such matters, to make sure that what is tendered as a victim impact statement falls squarely within the expression used in the Act.6 This is a criminal proceeding and, although the rights of the victims are important, and are recognised by the provisions which allow victims to make statements, the law is important. It is certainly the case, that what a victim suffers is important and is serious. I have been referred to the case of Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128. There, the leading judgment was given by Sperling J. At para 57 his Honour described the effect of what the victim, in that case, said it had done to her. She talked about the experience that she had had after the events that gave rise to the charge, and the treatment she has had. In that case, it seems that the Crown did rely on the statement as evidence of harm to the victim. I now read from some further passages from what Sperling J said:  
     
      
      60. Section 28(4) provides that the court must not consider a victim impact statement unless it has been given by or on behalf of the victim to whom it relates or by or on behalf of the prosecutor, and must not consider a victim impact statement given by a family victim… 
      
    And I omit some words there because they do not apply in this case. 
     
      
      The implication is that a victim impact statement may, in the discretion of a court, be received and taken into account as evidence of harm caused by the offence and, in that way, as evidence relevant to the determination of punishment by sentence. 
      
      
     
     
      
      61. Whilst a sentencing hearing is not subject to the rules of evidence unless an order to that effect is made and whilst s 28 also, by implication, allows the court to take a victim impact statement into account in determining the appropriate punishment by sentence, the weight to be given to such a statement is for the court to determine. In  
      RKB ( 
      NSWCCA, 30 June 1992, unreported) it was acknowledged that a sentencing court is required to take into account the impact of criminal behaviour on the victim or victims of such behaviour but, it was said, what is required is an objective assessment of the crime’s effect. 
      
      
     
     
      
      62. The court is required to be satisfied of the facts in question beyond reasonable doubt. In these circumstances, substantial weight cannot be given to an account of harm in an unsworn statement, not necessarily and almost certainly not in the victim’s own words, untested by cross-examination and, in the nature of things, far from being an objective and impartial account of the effect of the offence on the victim. 
      
    He goes on to say  
     
      
      64. ….. I would mention that it is impermissible for a sentencing judge to treat the distress of the victim in having to give evidence as a matter of aggravation:  
      Siganto 
       (1998) 194 CLR 656 at [27]. I do not construe the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as modifying that approach. 
      
    7 And in this case it is clear, and I think it is acknowledged, that for a victim to have to give evidence in a trial is always difficult. It is also clearly difficult for a victim in a trial to have to listen to legal argument such as this, but it is the function of the court to make sure that the law is applied properly and that what the court hears and receives is no more and no less than the law applies.8 What I am going to say is that it is clear that there are parts of this statement that do fall within the description of victim impact statements. 9 The object of this legislation is clearly to allow victims of crimes to say how the crime has had an impact on them, provided that it relates to physical harm, mental illness or nervous shock. In my view there are parts of this statement which fall within that description and I consider that the Court should receive a statement to that effect. It seems to me that what is not really permissible, and I will start from the end of the statement, is everything in it from the heading, “Physical impacts of the assault”. The two parts, “Emotional impacts of the assault” and “Psychological impacts of the assault”, although not entirely directed to the matters, I think, for practical purposes, could comprise the statement.

   JUDGMENT1. The plaintiff by way of statement of claim filed on 1 August 2007 brings proceedings for defamation for the publication by the defendants of a book “The Education of a Young Liberal” in or about July 2006.2. I have already given judgment in another matter Ann-Marie Clarke and Anor v Melbourne University Publishing Limited t/a Melbourne University Press [2007] NSWDC 189 in relation to other proceedings commenced over the same extract from the book, by the plaintiff’s daughters. 3. The matter complained of having been published after 1 January 2006, the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) applies. This means that I must have regard to the fact that the imputations are particulars of cause of action and no longer the cause of action and the appropriate test to apply is the test in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125. More recently in Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2007] NSWCA 254 the Court of Appeal noted a statement by Glass JA in Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 at 674 that the question of whether an imputation was conveyed should go to the jury unless it was blindingly obvious that no other conclusion was reasonably open.4. The plaintiff pleads the following imputations;  
     
     (a) that the plaintiff tried to pimp off his daughters; 
      
     (b) that the plaintiff solicits for prostitutes; 
      
     [there is no imputation (c)] 
      
     (d) that the plaintiff is a Nazi; 
      
     (e) that the plaintiff’s political views were similar to Nazism; 
      
     (f) that the plaintiff is a person of such low morals he allowed his daughters to act as prostitutes for his own advantage; 
      
     (g) that the plaintiff permits his daughters to work as prostitutes in order to assist his political career. 
    5. I do not need to set out the text of the matter complained of; it is a schedule to my judgment in the action brought in Ann-Marie Clarke & Anor v Melbourne University Publishing t/a Melbourne University Press. In my judgment in those proceedings I held that the following imputations were to go to the jury in respect of each of the plaintiffs:  
     
     (a) that she is a prostitute,  
      
     (b) that she is of such low moral character that her father solicits for her.  
      
    Those are the relevant imputations to have regard to in relation to this matter because I have indicated that I propose to rule in this matter in relation to imputations (f) and (g) in accordance with my earlier judgment.6. The defendant has indicated that it wishes to formally maintain the objections to these imputations but accepts that I propose to rule consistently with my judgment and as I understand this concession it is that I need not give further reasons in this judgment for that ruling in that the defendant is content to regard the reasons I gave in my judgment in [2007] NSWDC 189.7. The imputations to which the defendant takes objection are imputations (a), (b), (f) and (g). Objections to imputations (d) and (e) were withdrawn when the matter was last before me, and as I have indicated, the defendant has accepted I will rule in relation to imputations (f) and (g) conformly with my earlier judgment. This means that the two imputations which are the subject of dispute in this applications are imputations (a) and (b).Imputation (a): that the plaintiff tried to pimp off his daughters8. This is an objection on the basis of form. The defendant accepts that notwithstanding the different status of imputations under the Defamation Act 2005, where they are particulars rather than the cause of action, a pleading that is ambiguous has a tendency to cause prejudice or embarrassment and is liable to be struck out pursuant to Pt 14 r 28 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005. The defendant draws my attention to Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 where the word “corrupt” was held to be insufficiently precise in an imputation.9. The word “corrupt” has always occupied an exceptional position in cases concerning ambiguous meaning. The facts in Drummoyne Municipal Council, as counsel for the plaintiff has reminded me, were that in the publication in question there was no specific actual conduct to be pointed to. In addition, corrupt conduct can cover an enormous range of activities and perhaps this may explain why it has caused so many pleading problems.10. The complaint that is often made, and as I understand it is made by the defendant in these proceedings, is that the word “pimp” has more than one meaning and therefore the defendant does not know what meaning it is to justify. This complaint was given very careful consideration by Hutley JA in Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 at 687D to 688C and I set out the text of Hutley JA’s judgment in full. 
     
     “The variety of conditions under which the word may have different connotations, itself shows that the attempt to invest it with a necessary meaning is futile. Even accepting what is said about the knowledge of the community, it is for the jury to decide what is in fact within the general knowledge of the community in a case like this, and to apply that knowledge to the appellant who does not necessarily appear to be a doctor in the telecast. 
      
      
     Hunt J’s search for a necessary “meaning of ‘abortionist’ has its justification in the belief that because a word does not necessarily have a particular meaning, it does not identify the precise act or condition asserted of or attributed to the appellant or with which she is charged” and, therefore, does not properly set out the imputation sued on. It does not properly set out the imputation, it is said, because the defendant does not know what it has to justify. 
      
     Samuels JA, with whom Moffitt P and Reynolds JA agreed, said in  
     Feros v West Sydney Radio Pty Ltd  
     (Court of Appeal, 22nd June, 1982, unreported):  
      
      
       
      “...it was necessary  
      here 
       (my emphasis) for the plaintiff to specify, that is to state categorically, explicitly or particularly, the defamatory meaning or meanings which he alleged the matter in its natural and ordinary meaning would convey to an ordinary reasonable reader.” 
      
      
     As his Honour was carefully specifying, his remarks were not stating a universal rule but even if he were that does not mean that she has to state each imputation so that it does not cover defamations of different seriousness. Where she alleges that she has been characterized in a way calculated to damage her reputation in any meaning it can bear, she is entitled to have the imputation submitted to a jury in general terms, and the defendant has to justify it accordingly. For example, a person who claims he has been defamed by being called a communist is not required to refine the imputation down to one of the varieties of communists now current, though their official commitments to subversion now vary widely. 
      
      
     In  
     Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd 
      [1977] 2 NSWLR 749, at 771, the court said:  
      
      
       
      “Upon the proper construction of the rules, an imputation specified in a statement of claim must be taken to include all imputations which do not differ in substance. Accordingly, it is not open to the appellant to claim that the imputations as to promiscuity should have been taken from the jury, because the publications bore imputations of sexual immorality of a slightly lesser degree.” 
      
     
     
     This reasoning is equally applicable to imputations of slightly more serious import.  
      
      
     Though a defendant is entitled to know the case he has to meet, it is strange to hear the suggestion that this defendant does not understand an imputation which is precisely in the words it has used, so that it is embarrassed in justifying it. This must mean it does not know what it is alleged an ordinary reasonable hearer would make of it.” 
    11. Gleeson CJ in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation pointed out that the imputation “the plaintiff was an abortionist” was wrongly struck out in Hepburn “because it forced the plaintiff into pleading with greater precision than the actual publication”. That is the problem that has occurred here.12. The fact that the word “pimp” has gradations of meetings or even different meanings does not mean that it is necessary to state each imputation so that it covers defamations of a different nature or different seriousness. This is what Hutley JA meant at 687G when his Honour explained that a plaintiff is entitled to have an imputation submitted to a jury in general terms and the defendant has to justify it accordingly. Just as a person who is called a communist is not required to refine the imputation down to which of the varieties of communism is involved (noting that the various different kinds of communism have differing commitments to subversion), similarly, it is not necessary in my view to further specify the word “pimp”. It was not necessary in my view in proceedings brought under the Defamation Act 1974 and it is not necessary now that imputations are particulars as opposed to causes of action.This is because while a word is capable of having different meanings, what will always define the meaning will not be so much the dictionary as the context in which the word is used. The context in which the word “pimp” is used is in the sentence “and did you get a load of Clarke trying to pimp off his daughters” (which Mr Kutasi does not merely say but “enthused”, and then follows with the football hooligan chant “Oi oi oi”). This is a good example of the imputation not needing to be more specific than the matter complained of in the same way that Gleeson CJ explained that a publication “X is disgusting” need not give rise to an imputation more specific than that the plaintiff is disgusting (Drummoyne Municipal Council at 137).13. Accordingly it is my view that there is no ambiguity requiring the pleading with precision of what the “pimp” means.Imputation (b): that the plaintiff solicits for prostitutes14. This imputation could only arise from the reference to the word “pimp” in the statement by Mr Kutasi, this being Mr Kutasi’s inference as to what was on the table for the deal for Mr Kutasi and Mr Clarke to join the Right Wing of the Liberal party. While a jury might find that the matter complained of imputed that as part of the deal the plaintiff was prepared to “pimp off” his daughters there is nothing in the text to indicate that the plaintiff is a person who solicits for prostitutes in a more general sense. What the matter complained of refers to is the plaintiff talking “warmly” about his daughters in circumstances where it becomes apparent from the context that this apparent explanation, like many of the other explanations in the book, turns out to have some additional meanings which mean that it should not be taken at face value.15. However there is nothing in any part of the text to support a general imputation that the plaintiff solicits for prostitutes. The extent of his wrongdoing is that he has two daughters that he is prepared to throw into the deal, not that he is prepared to offer to obtain prostitutes for the author and Mr Kutasi. This is in my view one of those rare cases where it is blindingly obvious that no other conclusion is reasonably open, to use the words of Glass JA at 674 in Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission as referred to in Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Limited at [20].16. The ordinary reasonable reader, reading between the lines, might be capable of coming to the conclusion that the plaintiff was prepared to “pimp off” his own daughters but not that he was a person who solicited for prostitutes in the general sense of the word. It was submitted that this imputation refers to the plaintiff soliciting for his own daughters but this is not what the imputation says. The imputation says that he solicits for prostitutes and that is what Hunt CJ at CL in Amalgamated Television Services v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 165 called a “strained or forced or utterly unreasonable interpretation”.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The accused is charged with an offence which has as one of its elements an allegation that he intended to kidnap a person by the name of RM. For that reason, the offence is a prescribed sexual offence within the meaning given to those terms in the Criminal Procedure Act.2 That has a number of consequences in relation to the way the trial is to be held. In particular, it has an impact on the way in which the evidence of Ms M is to be given. The complainant is entitled to give evidence by way of closed-circuit television facilities unless I am satisfied that there are special reasons in the interests of justice for her evidence not to be given by those means.3 Mr King, on behalf of the accused, suggests that there are special reasons in the interests of justice that Ms M be required to give her evidence in court. He has not been able to find any authority dealing with the phrase ""special reasons in the interests of justice"" as they appear in s 294B of the Criminal Procedure Act but has helpfully referred to a similar expression in s 43(e)(a) of the Justices Act. It must be remembered, however, that the purposes of s 43(e)(a) of the Justices Act are different to the purposes for which s 294B was enacted.4 It is generally the case that complainants involved in proceedings defined as prescribed sexual offences give evidence about sexual matters and the focus of the second reading speech in the Legislative Council was on such more common cases but Parliament has specifically prescribed that an offence under s 86 of the Crimes Act is a prescribed sexual offence as are offences that include an intention to commit that offence or an offence of attempting or conspiring or inciting to commit that offence.5 Thus, whilst it is more usual for complainants who seek to give their evidence by way of closed-circuit television to be giving evidence about intimate sexual matters, that is only because such cases come before the courts more often than offences of kidnapping.6 It cannot be a special reason under s 294B(6) that the offence the subject of the present proceedings is one which is less usual than other offences caught by the definition of prescribed sexual offence. However, I accept Mr King's submission that a relevant matter in deciding whether there are special reasons is that Ms M will not be required to give evidence about particular sexual acts forming the basis of an alleged offence.7 It is safe to assume that her distress and embarrassment will be less than if she was giving evidence of that type. On the other hand, the circumstances of this offence as alleged by the Crown are that Ms M was to be kidnapped by a man who had a sexual interest in her, that she was present in her home when two men attempted to invade those premises for the purposes of kidnapping her so one can easily imagine that Ms M will be required to give evidence about events which she finds distressing.8 It was also said by Mr King that Ms M has earlier admitted to lying. A transcript of proceedings in the Local Court was tendered to me in which Ms M admits to having told police on two occasions things which were not true. She admitted to lying to police about those matters. I have to say that that is not at all uncommon. The courts regularly hear applications under s 38 of the Evidence Act based on such matters.9 Mr King also suggests that in those proceedings, the magistrate took into account the demeanour of the witness, that is Ms M, That submission I reject. There is no reference to it in the magistrate's judgment and one would have safely assumed that if the magistrate took into account Ms M gave her evidence, the magistrate would have said so.10 It may be that there was nothing in the way Ms M gave her evidence that was unusual or that assisted the magistrate. In any case, as I have said, I do not find that there was anything in the demeanour of the witness apparent in the earlier Local Court proceedings of relevance to this application.11 Mr King says that the jury will get a better assessment of the demeanour of Ms M in giving her evidence. Of course that is invariably the case, if it is true of course, (a matter to be determined), when a witness gives evidence by way of closed-circuit television. If the factual basis for Mr King's submission is accurate then that applies in every case where a witness gives evidence by way of CCTV.12 In any case, I do not accept that a jury will be better able to assess the demeanour of Ms M if she gives evidence in court compared to the situation of her giving evidence by way of closed-circuit television. The jury will see her face in close up, see her facial expressions in much closer detail than if the witness were actually in court.13 Mr King says that there might be other movements of the witness which are not apparent. If that is the case then the court could always ask Ms M to sit further away from the camera so that more of her body is visible. In any case, I do not accept the assumption behind Mr King's submission. I do not accept that one is able to better assess the demeanour of a witness in court than if the witness gives evidence by way of closed-circuit television.14 Mr King also says that it is important in encouraging Ms M to tell the truth that she is face to face with the accused. Once again, that is not anything special about this case. Once again, the assumption behind the submission has not been proved. There is nothing in my experience or reading or knowledge to suggest that witnesses are more likely to tell the truth when they are able to view the person about whom they are giving the evidence than otherwise.15 It is not the case that I should go through each reason advanced by Mr King and decide whether it alone is special or whether it alone suggests that the interests of justice require the witness give her evidence in court. I look at all of the matters advanced by Mr King. All of them, when taken together, may, in an appropriate case, amount to something which is accurately described as special but that is not this case.16 I am satisfied that Mr King has not demonstrated, either individually or when taken together, that the reasons he advanced are special. Certainly I do not find that they are special reasons in the interests of justice. The matters relied on by Mr King are either commonplace, inherent in cases where witnesses propose to give their evidence by way of closed-circuit television or where their unusual features only arise from the fact that offences of this type are less common than other offences prosecuted in the District Court. For those reasons, the application is refused.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Evan Petersen developed an interest in reptiles at a young age. This led to him working voluntarily at a local pet shop and later, when he was old enough being employed there. It also brought him into contact with others with interests in reptiles including a man I will describe as Mr X. I will call him Mr X because I do not know his name. 2 Mr Petersen had a girlfriend who, although she lived in Shanghai, would visit Phuket in Thailand regularly. It was something of a long distance relationship but the offender flew to Phuket to meet up with his girlfriend when he could. On one occasion, Mr X approached Mr Petersen and made him an offer. The offer was this: If he flew to Bangkok smuggling some reptiles out of the country, Mr X would pay for his holiday and give him some spending money as well. 3 Mr Petersen agreed. He decided that he would commit the serious criminal offence of exporting reptiles from Australia simply for money. He wanted to meet up with his girlfriend. He wanted to have a holiday in Thailand. It was going to cost him money to go there and do that but he could get it for free if he agreed to what Mr X proposed and that is what he did. 4 One day he put some of his clothes into a bag and provided that bag to Mr X. He then later picked up the bag from Mr X and went to Sydney Airport. He checked in at the Thai Airways counter. After he had done that he thought he was scot free. The plan was that he would not even have to collect the bags once he got to Bangkok and that he would simply walk out of the airport with carry on luggage. Apparently someone else was going to pick up the bags from the airport and he was prepared to lose the clothes that he had packed into the bag earlier. 5 Fortunately however his bags were x-rayed before the flight took off. The x-ray revealed the presence of forty-four reptiles secreted in the bags. Police were called, they went onto the aircraft and removed him from it. The offender was then interviewed by police. He told them at that stage a lot of lies. He suggested that he knew nothing about the reptiles packed in his bag and suggested that what may have happened is that when he left his bags unattended, someone had slipped the reptiles in. 6 Fortunately he did not persist with such a fanciful story. He pleaded guilty at a relatively early stage to the offence of attempting to export the forty-four reptiles discovered in his bag. That is an offence under s 303DD(1) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.7 The offender is a man of otherwise good character. He is a well regarded electrician. Evidence today both written and oral attests to his otherwise good character and indeed the Crown concedes it.8 Mr Boulten who appeared for the offender made no attempt to suggest that the offence was other than serious. I sentenced a man called Morgan a couple of years ago now and when doing so, I explained why it was that offences of this kind were as serious as they are and why in the appropriate case no other sentence than one of full-time custody is appropriate. The Court of Criminal Appeal agreed with some of what I said (see R v Morgan [2007] NSWCCA8). It said most importantly for the purposes of the sentencing exercise before me, that offences of this kind would normally attract a full-time custodial sentence.9 During the course of submissions, attention was focussed on a number of matters that Buddin J suggested it were very important in informing the sentencing exercise. The first was the nature and extent of the offender’s role. In this case the offender was a courier. As I have explained, it was the plan that he would not even pick up the bags in Bangkok and that his criminal activities in effect ended once he had checked the bags in. However, the fact that the offender was a mere courier does not mean that he should be dealt with leniently. The courts seek to discourage the drug trade as well as the trade in native animals by imposing harsh sentences on couriers. If couriers can be deterred from criminal activities then the drug trade and the native animal trade suffer accordingly. 10 Buddin J next suggested I should look at the motivation of the offender for committing the offence. As I have said, the offender did this simply for money. 11 Next I look at the level of sophistication which the offender was involved. This was not a sophisticated activity. There was no attempt to use corsets or other devices to conceal the reptiles, indeed they were simply put in socks in the bags. On the other hand there must be a level of sophistication at some level. Mr X must have had some arrangement that would enable him or someone else to obtain possession of the bags whilst they were still on the conveyer belt at Bangkok airport.12 The next matter I should look at concerns whether there were aggravating features such as undue cruelty. In this case some of the animals died. Others survived but were detrimentally affected by the experience. Clearly there was a significant risk to the reptiles. When asked about this in the witness box the offender said that the risk to the reptiles simply slipped his mind. I say quite clearly that I do not accept that. The offender, given his background in looking after reptiles, both his own and in the pet shop where he worked, simply could not have failed to appreciate the risks to the animals. I do not accept that he forgot that they may suffer.13 There were forty-four animals involved but there is no evidence to suggest that the animals were rare. Indeed the material tendered by the Crown suggests that there is a retail trade in the animals such that they can be valued, that a monetary value can be put on them. One of them may be rare because it had a high monetary value but it is not the case that there is any evidence to suggest that the animals were endangered or rare in the wild or indeed that they even came from the wild. 14 I have mentioned the actual harm to the particular animals and the Crown concedes that there was no harm to the environment through the spread of disease for example. Of course we do not know what would have happened once the reptiles got to Thailand. We do not know whether the introduction of a species that would have been transported to Bangkok would have any harm to the Thai environment but I do say and recognise that the potential is one of the reasons for offences such as this being treated as seriously as they are.15 The offender now says that he is remorseful. I do rather get the impression that his remorse is firstly for his parents, secondly for himself and only belatedly for the actual wrongfulness of his conduct but there is a concrete way that he has demonstrated his remorse and that relates to the identity of Mr X. In the witness box he indicated that he did not wish to name him because of fears, apparently genuine. However after being given the opportunity of speaking to Mr Boulten he has approached investigating officers and provided them with information about Mr X including his name. Of course as if that occurred only less than an hour ago, the value of that information is not made known to me but I do take into account that the offender has demonstrated his remorse by doing what he did and that this is likely to have been of assistance to the authorities.16 Given the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal decision in R v Morgan is the most recent and it contains statements of principle (and also the fact that I was the one who sentenced Mr Morgan), attention has been paid to a comparison between Mr Morgan’s case and this one. Mr Morgan was transporting eggs which he deliberately destroyed upon being detected. His decision to deliberately destroy the eggs led to a further offence but it is also relevant to the question as to the harm which the offender caused. Mr Morgan was not of prior good character, he had priors for cultivating cannabis and told, I was clearly satisfied, lies in court. 17 The Crown and Mr Boulten are some distance apart, as is often the case, as to the sentence which should be imposed upon the offender. The Crown says that nothing less than full-time custody is required. Mr Boulten says that I should firstly impose a community service order or if I feel that a sentence of imprisonment is required it should be suspended. I do not consider that either of those options is appropriate. A community service order or a suspended sentence of imprisonment would be insufficient to deter others who may be tempted to make money through the trade in native animals.18 Mr Petersen, the offender’s father, gave evidence saying that sending his son to gaol would do him no good at all, that his son has already appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct and that there is no benefit to him in locking him up. That may well be right but my task is to look not only at the offender. My task is much broader than that and it is as the Crown reminds me, it is important that I consider general deterrence when I formulate the appropriate sentence to impose upon this offender.19 Parliament, in introducing this offence, suggested that the trade in endangered species and native animals were second only to the drug trade in terms of the money that can be made. It is therefore necessary that I bear firmly in mind the need to send a message to those who might be tempted to do what Mr Petersen has done that if they are caught they cannot expect leniency and can indeed expect a harsh punishment.20 Mr Boulten acknowledges that his client is within a whisker of going to gaol full-time. Had there been any evidence that any of these reptiles was endangered, then his client would be spending tonight in Silverwater serving a full time custodial sentence. However, I consider that this is a matter where a full-time custodial sentence is not required. The offender is, as the Crown conceded, a man of otherwise good character. He has good prospects of rehabilitation. He pleaded guilty at a relatively early opportunity and has assisted the authorities in the way I identified earlier. He has much to offer in the future.21 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months. I order that he is to be released at the expiration of twelve months upon him entering into a recognizance pursuant to s 21B of the Crimes Act in the sum of $1,000 to be of good behaviour for a period of six months from the release date and to appear to receive sentence if called upon to do so at any time in respect of any breach within that period. I order that that sentence of imprisonment be served by way of periodic detention. The offender is therefore to report to the Silverwater Periodic Detention Centre at 8.30am on 13 September 2009 in order to commence serving his sentence.22 His Honour explained the sentence to the offender.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Rachel Baker appeals against her conviction for negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The circumstances of the collision between her and a bicycle being ridden by Mr Sweeney are difficult to describe without the use of diagrams, but I will do my best.2 Ms Sweeney intended to turn right, she therefore had to cross the path of vehicles coming towards her. She signalled her intention to turn right, but the car coming towards her (in the opposite direction to the way she was travelling) also wanted to turn right. He had also signalled and the two vehicles came to a stop at the intersection. 3 Behind the other vehicle was Mr Sweeney on his bicycle. Precisely where he was when Ms Baker got to the intersection is unknown, but what happened was this: after something of a stand-off where both Ms Baker’s vehicle and the other vehicle remained where they were, Ms Baker turned right. She said that she did not see any traffic coming in the other direction and believed it was safe to do so. 4 As she turned right, however, she saw Mr Sweeney on his bicycle. He had overtaken the other car on the left of that other car because it was stationary and turning right. Ms Baker got part way across the roadway when she saw Mr Sweeney, she immediately stopped, but although Mr Sweeney swerved he collided with the front driver’s side of Ms Baker’s vehicle causing him significant injuries which, there is no dispute, amounted to grievous bodily harm.5 The magistrate convicted Ms Baker and she appealed to this court. The appeal was basically brought on two bases. The first is that the magistrate misstated the test for negligence, equating it closer to the civil standard rather than the standard applicable to an offence under s 42 of the Road Transport Safety and Traffic Management Act. Reference was made to the test of negligence to be found in s 54 of the Crimes Act but as long ago as 1950 it was held that the negligence necessary to constitute the offence of driving negligently is of a lesser standard than that which is required to prove an offence under s 54 of the Crimes Act. In any case, having considered the transcript and exhibits in the court below I am satisfied that even if the standard is the higher standard that Mr Sachs referred to today, that is a serious falling short of the standard of driving required such that criminal punishment is appropriate, I am satisfied that Ms Baker’s driving fits that test. She says that she looked in the direction that Mr Sweeney was travelling for some five to ten seconds, but did not see him. Clearly he was there and clearly he was not obscured behind what I have described as the other vehicle for all of that five to ten seconds.6 Ms Baker gave evidence that she was aware that cyclists often used the roadway on which she was travelling. She should therefore have been aware of the possibility that there was a cyclist travelling down towards her and she should have looked carefully to see whether that was the case. 7 The only explanation for this collision occurring in the circumstances described in the transcript of evidence is that Ms Baker failed to keep a proper lookout. She failed to look carefully enough to see whether Ms Sweeney or any other cyclist, for that matter, was doing what he was entitled to do, namely overtake on the left of the other vehicle because that other vehicle had signalled its intention to turn right.8 In those circumstances I am satisfied that Ms Baker’s conduct did demonstrate such a serious falling short of the standard of driving applied that criminal punishment is merited and I dismiss her appeal.9 The orders of the magistrate are confirmed with the suspension to commence today. I note that Ms Baker’s licence is surrendered.

   SENTENCE1 Chan Chao appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence of supplying a prohibited drug. The prohibited drug was ecstasy, in tablet form, a total of 16.9 grams in sixty-one tablets. 2 The offender was detected when he committed a driving offence. Police stopped the car driven by the offender, and due to the strange behaviour that he displayed and that of his passenger, they decided to search the vehicle. They there discovered a number of important things, in particular the ecstasy tablets, some cash and a number of separate plastic bags. They interviewed the offender and he said that the drugs were all for his own use, a somewhat remarkable proposition given the number of drugs found.3 Despite his plea of guilty the offender maintained that position when he spoke to an officer from the Probation and Parole Service. He said to her or him that the drugs were for his own use, he was using eight to ten per day. This failure to be frank is a matter which has flowed through the sentencing proceedings even today. The offender was asked by the Crown in cross-examination some questions regarding where he got the money to buy the ecstasy tablets from. The offender said that the money came from him having pawned a gold necklace which his mother had previously given him. The Crown then asked about the money found with the drugs in the car, a sum of about $1,800. And the offender said that that money was not his. He suggested that it was his girlfriend’s and had to be used to pay off her credit card. After further questioning in which I asked the offender to explain why it was that he would hold onto money which belonged to his girlfriend the offender eventually admitted that he had been telling lies. 4 I am satisfied that the money was related to drug supply. When I say the money, I mean the money found in the car. I am satisfied that the offender is a person who comes clean with the truth only after he has been found out. I do not accept that he purchased the drugs only after hocking a gold necklace. I note the absence of any supporting documents to suggest that that is the case. 5 I do not accept that his supply activities were limited in the way he said in evidence today. He said that he was going to supply at cost to his friends and for profit to others. I am satisfied that the offender was prepared to engage in numerous separate acts of supply for profit. If he was to sell the ecstasy tablets a couple or a few at a time it means that he was prepared to engage in many separate drug supply transactions as evidenced by the numerous plastic bags to be found in photograph 14 of ex A. The offender was a significant drug dealer.6 He has already served time in custody for other matters, they relating to offences of dishonesty. Indeed he says it was whilst in custody that he first began himself taking ecstasy tablets. The offender committed his dishonest offences in the past in order to make money. I am satisfied that he committed the offence for which I am about to sentence him also in order to make money. He has shown a willingness to engage in significant criminality in order to profit.7 The offender is now thirty-one years of age. He came from Cambodia with his family when he was quite young. He is, as Mr Priddis put it, the only member of his family to go off the rails. As he was growing up he was subject to violence at the hands of his father and saw his mother also being subject to violence from her husband. 8 He completed his high school getting a TER of about 76 and has worked on occasions since then. He left home for a while when he was about fifteen but eventually he came back to live with his parents and was still living there when he was arrested on this matter. 9 He has a hearing problem and this will make his time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. I have taken that matter into account. 10 He also appears to have had a problem with gambling in the past and it was suggested that he committed his earlier fraud offences in order to pay off gambling debts. No such suggestion was made in the present case.11 One very significant matter is that the offender was on parole at the time he committed this offence. Indeed he had been released from custody only a few months before. This failure to take advantage of the leniency that was offered to him on that occasion is one which I propose to reflect in making a finding that there are no special circumstances in this case. Special circumstances were found when he was earlier sent to prison but all that has done is to enable the offender to have earlier committed fresh offences. That is why I say he took advantage of the leniency that was offered to him on that occasion.12 The offender said that he was remorseful but in a way which to me sounded rehearsed rather than genuine. Given that he tried to mislead the court on other matters I am satisfied that he has not discharged the onus which lies upon him of satisfying me that he is genuinely remorseful.13 I cannot find, for the same reason, that he has good prospects of rehabilitation or is unlikely to offend in the future. The very fact that he committed this offence only a short time after being released from custody is a significant impediment to him persuading me that he has reached the cross-roads of his life and is prepared and capable of living a law abiding life in the future. He did plead guilty at an early stage and so I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea. 14 Like almost drug supply offences this was planned and organised. The plastic bags that the offender had in his possession clearly show a degree of planning such that he was prepared to go to places where people would want to buy drugs and supply them to such drug users. As I have said the offender was in this to make money, or in terms of s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 financial gain, which is not a factor in all drug supply offences but is in most of them. The reason I have mentioned that most drug supply offences are planned or organised or involve financial gain is because I want to emphasise I will not be double counting despite the reference to such factors in s 21A. 15 This is a serious matter committed by a person who, as I have said, has shown a willingness to engage in significant criminality in order to make money. A sentence which reflects the objective gravity of his conduct must be imposed. It must be such as to bring home to the offender the consequences of further offending. It must be one which also has the effect of deterring others who might be tempted to act in the way the offender has. There was no suggestion made that anything other than a sentence of full time custody was appropriate.16 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of two years and three months to commence on 3 October 2007. It will expire on 2 January 2010 on which day the offender is to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of three years.17 Any other matter Mr Crown?18 ALLISON: Your Honour the Crown seeks a drug destruction order for the drugs.19 HIS HONOUR: Right, the drugs can be destroyed.20 ALLISON: Your Honour the Crown asks that sequence 3 of charge number H31495423 be dismissed.21 HIS HONOUR: Right, I’ll dismiss that.22 ALLISON: That is a back up possession charge. The Crown also asks that sequence 4 of the same charge sequence be dismissed. That’s a possess prescribed restricted substance but the substance is not a prescribed restricted substance.23 HIS HONOUR: That is the drug cialis?24 ALLISON: Yes your Honour.25 HIS HONOUR: Right well I will dismiss that matter.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff Sophia Gharib is a child. She was born on 22 August 1998. She is currently seven years old. Her action is for damages for personal injury based on the tort of negligence. 2 When the matter came before me on 4 May 2006, on the plaintiff’s application, I severed the issue of liability from all issues relating to quantum. That is because the plaintiff may well need further surgery once she has finished puberty and the defendant’s own orthopaedic surgeon has expressed a guarded prognosis. However, there is no dispute that the plaintiff sustained some form of injury on 27 August 2001, the date pleaded to in the statement of claim. If the plaintiff establishes liability some damage has been sustained, so that the cause of action in negligence will be complete. If the plaintiff be successful, then the order will be for damages to be assessed in futuro.3 The plaintiff relies on an injury which occurred to her on 27 August 2001. She had just turned three years old. The circumstances of her injury are hotly disputed. The plaintiff’s mother and tutor is Ms Kym Ottomar. She is the mother of three. She has two other daughters who are older than the plaintiff. For approximately six months before 27 August 2001 Ms Ottomar had been attending aqua aerobic classes at the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre, a facility provided by the defendant the Liverpool City Council. Ms Ottomar was going to the aqua aerobics classes three times a week. Attached to the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre is a childminding centre. That centre is operated by the defendant as part of the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre. The defendant charges a fee for minding a child whilst the child’s parent attends activities at the aquatic centre. Aqua aerobics was one such activity. The fee charged by the defendant for minding a child was ridiculously cheap. It was either $2 or $2.50 a session, which could be a number of hours or perhaps two and a half hours. The inference to be drawn from Ms Ottomar’s attendance at the aquatic centre was that she had some familiarity with the childminding facility at the aquatic centre. She had been there three times a week for the best part of twenty-six weeks, approximately seventy-five times prior to 27 August 2001. That day was a Monday. 4 According to the records of the childminding centre, which are ex 1, Ms Ottomar dropped Sophia into the childminding centre at 9.25am. Eventually Ms Ottomar was to pick up Sophia from the childminding centre at 10.30am. It is suggested the plaintiff’s injury had occurred approximately 10am, although the inference to be drawn is that it was some time after that, say, ten to fifteen minutes prior to Ms Ottomar’s signing the record as “time out” at 10.30am. 5 There is really no dispute that something happened to Sophia whilst she was in the childminding centre, and that incident led to a supracondylar fracture of the left humerus. Sophia was observed to be greatly distressed and crying whilst in the childminding centre and eventually Ms Ottomar was called back to the centre from her aqua aerobics class and took Sophia from the centre to a medical practitioner, Dr Goyal. 6 The essential issues for my determination are how did Sophia fracture her left humerus, and was there any negligence on the part of the defendant? 7 Contributory negligence has not been pleaded, and rightly so, given the plaintiff’s tender years at the time of the accident.8 The childminding centre in question was being conducted by Ms Erica Cantarella, an employee of the defendant. At the time Ms Cantarella gave evidence, on 4 May 2006, she had been employed at the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre for eleven years. Her appointment there must go back to approximately 1995. Prior to that she had worked, I infer for the defendant, at the Chipping Norton Children’s Centre and also at the Woodward Park Children’s Centre. Any formal qualifications obtained by Ms Cantarella have not been described in the evidence, but she gave her occupation as a “childminding coordinator”. She referred in her evidence to being a “trained worker” and to having a certificate in first aid. 9 On the day in question Ms Cantarella was assisted by a volunteer, Mrs Bonnie Harris. Mrs Harris did not have any formal qualification in first aid. 10 The allegation made on behalf of the plaintiff is that she was playing on some foam shaped gymnastic equipment from which she fell either onto a concrete floor covered only with carpet or onto a toy truck which had been placed either on the carpeted concrete floor or on a gymnastic mat which was around one side of the foam gymnastic equipment. 11 There is dispute in the evidence as to whether the gymnastic equipment was present in the childminding centre on 27 August 2001, as to whether the gymnastic equipment comprised only that shown in two photographs, which are Ex A, or comprised of other items such as a cube or rectangular shape and a second triangular shape and, of course, a dispute as to whether the plaintiff was injured when she fell from such foam gymnastic equipment. 12 After Sophia’s injury, attempts made by Ms Cantarella and/or Mrs Harris to console her were unsuccessful and Ms Ottomar was called by one of the childminding workers to return to the childminding centre to comfort her daughter. There is a dispute as to who called Ms Ottomar back to the childminding centre; whether it was Ms Cantarella or Mrs Harris.13 The first issue which I shall address is who called Ms Ottomar back to the childminding centre. Was it Ms Cantarella or was it Mrs Harris? It is the best way of commencing a discussion of the resolution of the issues before me. Even when I turn to this area, which might appear to be of little significance, it becomes clear to me that the evidence of Ms Cantarella must be approached with great caution. Unfortunately, I have formed the view that her evidence is largely unreliable. In saying that, I do not mean to suggest that she has been deliberately untruthful, but it became clear to me from listening to her evidence and reading the transcript of her evidence that much of her evidence was a reconstruction.14 In her evidence-in-chief Ms Ottomar was asked how did she find out that something was wrong with her child. She said this: 
     
      
      “Erica come to the pool and said that Sophia was crying and that she’d hurt herself and she couldn’t console her.” 
      
    Ms Ottomar went on to say that she returned to the childminding centre and found Sophia crying uncontrollably and sulking, holding her arm. She was cross-examined about that and this was her evidence in cross-examination: 
     
      
      “Q. Is it the case that, this is the day of the accident about, I put to you is it the case that a child worker or a person called Bonnie came to tell you about the accident to [Sophia]? 
       
      A. No. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Are you sure about that or could it be the case that Bonnie actually told you about the accident and, you returned to see Erica with your daughter at the centre? 
       
      A. No. Erica come and approached me while I was actually doing water aerobics. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. And did you see Bonnie when you [went] back to the centre with Erica? 
       
      A. She was sitting beside Sophia, yes.” 
      
    Ms Ottomar was quite clear that she was fetched back to the childminding centre by Ms Cantarella. 15 Evidence was also given by Katrina Carnevale in the plaintiff’s case. Ms Carnevale was also engaging in aqua aerobic classes with Ms Ottomar. She also had a child of preschool years whom she used to place in the childminding centre. Although Ms Carnevale was not aware of it when she was first giving evidence, she had in fact placed her daughter Nicola in the childminding centre at 9.15am on 27 August 2001. In her evidence-in-chief Ms Carnevale told me: 
     
      
      “I remember Erica coming through and telling Kym that, like I didn’t hear it, but just speaking to Kym and then Kym getting out of the pool so, later on.” 
      
    It was put to Ms Carnevale in cross-examination that another childcare worker notified Ms Ottomar of the incident when Ms Ottomar was at the pool, but Ms Carnevale was adamant that it was Ms Cantarella that came to the pool, describing her merely by her Christian name as Erica. Both Ms Ottomar and Ms Carnevale are certain that it was Erica Cantarella who fetched Ms Ottomar from the pool. However, Ms Cantarella now says otherwise. However, there are distinct indications in her evidence that that part of her evidence is a reconstruction. 16 Ms Cantarella at p 36 of the transcript of 4 May 2006 gave her description of what occurred. She continued thus: 
     
      
      “So I said to my assistant, ‘I think I’ll go and call her mother,’ and she goes, ‘You think so?’ and I just said, ‘Yeah. Her mother is on the premises, so we may as well call her.’ So Bonnie went out and called the mother because the person who is trained stays in the room with the child.” 
      
    17 Firstly, one will note that Ms Cantarella says that she thinks she would go to call the mother but then says Bonnie did so because Ms Cantarella was the trained childcare minder, whereas Bonnie was merely the volunteer. There is internal conflict in that evidence. In cross-examination Ms Cantarella was asked whether she was sure that it was not her that popped out to get Ms Ottomar. She replied thus: 
     
      
      “No, I don’t go out because I believe the trained person should stay in the room at all times.” 
      
    18 That, in my view, indicates that the proper procedure should be that the trained childcare worker stay in the childminding centre and send the volunteer to fetch a parent. However, that is a description of the proper procedure or a normal practice rather than what actually occurred on 27 August 2001.19 Ms Cantarella went on to say the following in cross-examination: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
     
     
      
      “Q. Does that mean that the first time you were asked to recollect who went out to fetch Kym was today? 
       
      A. It was.” 
      
     
     
      
      “Q. You see, a question was asked of you about that by Mr Glascott? 
       
      A. Yeah, I guess other people would have asked me but I know that I would send Bonnie out, not myself.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. This is what I am getting at. Your normal practice might be to send a co-worker out but are you sure, are you positively sure that you did it on this day? 
       
      A. Yes.” 
      
    One will note that the first question and answer suggests a reconstruction. Those questions were asked by me.20 Mr Lidden then continued his cross-examination and eventually these answers were given: 
     
      
      “Q. But I want to suggest to you it wasn’t her that went out to get the plaintiff’s mother, it was you, you went out where the aqua aerobics class was occurring? 
       
      A. No, no.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. And you told her there was a problem with her child? 
       
      A. No, because there were too many children in the room and I wouldn’t have went myself.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. But do you not agree that that’s a reconstruction, you’re thinking back now there was a lot of children there? 
       
      A. All right, that’s a reconstruction, but if I look at every day when I work if there’s an accident I do not go out.” 
      
    That was a frank admission of reconstruction based on normal practice.21 I have no hesitation, therefore, in accepting the evidence of Ms Ottomar and Ms Carnevale that it was Ms Erica Cantarella who fetched Ms Ottomar from the pool in which the aqua aerobics class was being conducted and took her back to the childminding centre to console Sophia. The evidence of Ms Cantarella on this issue is based on reconstruction. 22 When Ms Ottomar reached her daughter there was a conversation between her and Ms Cantarella. According to Ms Ottomar, Ms Cantarella said that Sophia was walking and that she had fallen over. Ms Ottomar said that she returned to the childminding centre on a second occasion and again spoke with Ms Cantarella. According to Ms Ottomar, she asked Ms Cantarella if she could tell her exactly what had happened to Sophia. Ms Ottomar said this: 
     
      
      “She said she thinks that she was pushing a small truck along. She heard her cry but she didn’t see her.” 
      
    23 There was some time spent in discussing when this visit to Ms Cantarella after 27 August 2001 occurred. Ms Ottomar originally said that it was roughly about seven days after Sophia had come out of hospital. Sophia was admitted to hospital on 29 August 2001 and underwent surgery on 30 August 2001. There is no hospital report before me, but the evidence of Ms Ottomar is that Sophia was in hospital for four days. That would indicate that she was discharged on 1 or 2 September 2001, so that the visit to Ms Cantarella was on approximately 8 or 9 September. Later in her evidence, Ms Ottomar said that the visit was a week after the accident had actually occurred, but then recanted from that and said that it was within the week after Sophia came out of hospital. Little turns on the exact timing, but it was clearly some time after 1 or 2 September 2001 and probably prior to 8 or 9 September 2001. Ms Ottomar’s visit to Ms Cantarella was because of her desire to find out what exactly had happened to her daughter. The visit to Ms Cantarella after 27 August 2001 is denied by Ms Cantarella, but I prefer the evidence of Ms Ottomar in that regard. 24 Therefore, accordingly to the evidence of Ms Ottomar, Ms Cantarella gave two versions of how the plaintiff’s accident occurred; firstly, that she was walking and that she fell over and, secondly, that she was pushing a small truck when the incident occurred.25 Ms Cantarella gave this evidence: 
     
      
      “What I remember occurred, Sophia was playing on the floor with a car. I was about 2 metres away from her, I wasn’t next to her, because the children that were with me were drawing at the table. Then I remember I think I saw her falling awkwardly and she started to cry a bit and I asked her what’s wrong and she didn’t really answer me. So I said, ‘Come over here and come and sit on the chair,’ so she sat on the chair, she was holding her arm and I tried to encourage her to do things and she didn’t want to do anything.” 
      
    Ms Cantarella went on to then refer to her conversation with Bonnie and as to Bonnie's going out to fetch Ms Ottomar. Again, one will note from what Ms Cantarella said that she remembers that she thought she saw what happened. Further on in her evidence-in-chief Ms Cantarella said that when Ms Ottomar came into the childminding centre that she, Ms Cantarella, told Ms Ottomar “what I thought happened”. Again, not what she actually saw but what she thought had happened.26 In cross-examination Ms Cantarella gave this evidence: 
     
      
      “Q. So you didn’t even see the accident, did you? 
       
      A. I think I saw it. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What does that mean? You think you saw it? 
       
      A. Where I was sitting at the time was opposite Sophia, so I was looking at her, that’s I say I think I saw it, that’s what it means. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Well, the use of the words ‘I think’ mean you’re uncertain, don’t they? 
       
      A. That’s right. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. You are certain that you saw her on the ground in close vicinity to a model vehicle, aren’t you, a small vehicle? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. She was crying? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. What I want to suggest to you is that right next to where she was was the triangular slide? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. You don’t know whether that’s true or not, do you? 
       
      A. I do, yes, I do.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. Because you remember back years after the event, is that it? 
       
      A. I do, yes, I believe I remember.” 
      
    Again, the flavour of that evidence is that the witness was reconstructing.27 Further in cross-examination, Ms Cantarella was asked whether Sophia was walking along and just fell over. According to Ms Cantarella, Sophia was not walking. Of course, the first version of events given by Ms Cantarella to Ms Ottomar is that she was walking and fell over. 28 The version of events ultimately proffered to me by Ms Cantarella is that Sophia was on the floor playing with a toy truck when she somehow fell forward, fracturing her left humerus. Just before telling me that she was not walking, Mr Lidden had been cross-examining Ms Cantarella about the version of events that she had given to Ms Ottomar. It was suggested to Ms Cantarella that she did not see the accident occur. This answer was given: 
     
      
      “No - I mean, yes, I did - I think I saw it.” 
      
    29 In other words, again the inference to be drawn from the way that Ms Cantarella was expressing herself is that she was reconstructing what may have occurred from what she had actually seen, which is probably merely the child in distress after the accident had occurred. 30 The evidence of Ms Cantarella on this issue is unsatisfactory and I accept, therefore, that Ms Cantarella gave two conflicting versions of events to Ms Ottomar; firstly, that Sophia was walking and fell over and, secondly, that she is on the floor playing with a truck when she somehow fell forward and fractured her left humerus, a mechanism of injury which to me, as a layman, seems quite remarkable. The giving of conflicting accounts of what happened, in my view, clearly indicates that Ms Cantarella did not see what had happened.31 After the plaintiff’s injury Ms Cantarella compiled an incident report. The incident report is signed by Ms Cantarella and co-signed by a coordinator at the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre. That gives as a description of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff a fracture of her left lower arm. It is said that the plaintiff was injured when she fell. Under the description “Type of Activity” a box has been ticked to indicate “free playing” and then under the heading “Other” are the words “on the floor with a toy car”. The first aid rendered was “cuddle/reassurance”. 32 The fact is that the extent of the plaintiff’s injury was not initially recognised. The plaintiff was taken on the day of the accident to Dr Goyal, a general practitioner at Liverpool. He organised for an x-ray to be performed, but that was reported as showing no fracture. Ms Ottomar took Sophia back to Dr Goyal on the following day, when Dr Goyal referred Sophia on to a specialist orthopaedic surgeon Dr Panjratan, whose rooms are at Windsor. 33 Further investigations were ordered by Dr Panjratan. An x-ray of the left elbow revealed an avulsion fracture of the lateral epicondyle of the left elbow. A 15 millimetre bony fragment had separated from the lateral epicondyle and that fragment included physis and capitulum. The fragment had displaced anteriorly and laterally, and was no longer in alignment with the radius. Dr Panjratan summed up the radiological investigation as: 
     
      
      “a nasty fracture of the lateral epicondyle and the capitulum with avulsion and separation”. 
      
    34 The “nasty fracture”, to use the words of Dr Panjratan, was not diagnosed until 29 August, two days after the incident in question. At the time the report form was completed that diagnosis must have been made. The report form must have been completed on or after 29 August 2001. The report form is not dated in itself; that is, there is no time specified when it was completed. There is no provision in the document for it to be dated in that fashion. However, the form does require its compiler to fill in the date of the incident in question. The date filled in is 27 August 2001. 35 The evidence of Ms Cantarella about the form is unsatisfactory. In her evidence she said that she filled it in “on the day”. It was then suggested to her that that was not possibly correct, and she agreed that maybe it was not. She was then asked whether the truthful answer to the question was that she did not know when it was filled in, and she answered that in the negative. She then gave this evidence: 
     
      
      “Q. Is the truthful answer, ‘I’m certain I filled it in on the day of the accident’? 
       
      A. Yes.” 
      
    She was then challenged about the diagnosis of a fracture being contained in the form and having pointed out to her that the diagnosis was not available until at least two days after the fall, and this evidence was then given: 
     
      
      “Q. The truth of the matter I want to suggest to you is that it was a week or so after the accident before you found out that the plaintiff had a fractured arm? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. You were told, weren’t you, that the fracture had been missed for some days? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. So you filled out the form, didn’t you, days afterwards? 
       
      A. I don’t remember.” 
      
    That evidence was given at p 49 of the transcript of 4 May 2006. The cross-examination returned to the same subject on p 54. 36 Suffice it to say, without quoting what was said in extenso, it became very clear to me that the evidence of Ms Cantarella was based on reconstruction, that the document had a date on it 27 August 2001 and, therefore, it must have been completed on that day. But again, the witness’ answers to the questions on the issue, minor in itself, are unsatisfactory and give me even further concern about the witness’ reliability.37 The evidence of Mrs Bonnie Harris was given yesterday. She did not see what happened to Sophia. However, she knew of the plaintiff’s being injured shortly after it occurred and she gave evidence that Ms Cantarella was seated at the table where the children were drawing at the time that some incident occurred to the plaintiff. 38 I should have mentioned earlier, when discussing who fetched Ms Ottomar from the pool, that the matter was also adverted to by Mrs Bonnie Harris. Mrs Harris said that she fetched Ms Ottomar from the pool but again, in my view, that was based on reconstruction. 39 I must also bear in mind the fact that when the defendant sought an adjournment to call Ms Harris on 5 May 2006 learned counsel for the defendant said this: 
     
      
      “Your Honour, I can indicate this: She doesn’t, as I understand, recall the incident. She does not recall who retrieved the plaintiff’s mother from the pool area. And the evidence that potentially may become significant in the matter is what her recollection is about the foam equipment and the mats.” 
      
    According to the instructions of Mr Glascott, no doubt communicated to him by his solicitor, who, one would hope, had discussed the matter with Mrs Harris at least on the telephone, is that Ms Harris did not have any recollection at that time of who had fetched Ms Ottomar from the aqua aerobics pool. 40 Accordingly, I cannot give any weight to the evidence of Mrs Harris in that regard, although I formed a favourable impression of Mrs Harris. However, clearly she was only asked to recollect who had actually fetched Ms Ottomar from the pool some time after 5 May 2006, almost five years after the events in question. 41 The only other evidence of what may have occurred to the plaintiff is from the plaintiff herself. That came before me in two ways: firstly, from what the plaintiff told her mother, no objection being taken by counsel for the defendant to the plaintiff’s mother telling me what the plaintiff had told her; the other way in which what the plaintiff said came before me is when the plaintiff gave unsworn evidence from the witness box, a major undertaking for a seven year old child.42 Ms Ottomar frankly concedes that it took some time for her to ascertain from her daughter what had happened to her. She told me that she obtained an explanation from her daughter about four weeks after the event in question, that is, weeks after the plaintiff’s discharge from hospital. Clearly, it appeared to me that Ms Ottomar, an anxious mother, wanted to know how her daughter had sustained the “nasty fracture” diagnosed by Dr Panjratan. Ms Ottomar gave this evidence-in-chief: 
     
      
      “Q. A little while after did Sophia tell you what had happened to her? 
       
      A. Yes. She said something about, ‘She didn’t catch me.’ I asked, ‘What do you mean?’ She said, ‘I fell backwards and fell onto a truck.’  
      
     
     
      
      Q. Did she say what she’d fallen off? 
       
      A. Yes. She said, ‘It was triangle foam slide and I’d fallen backwards.’” 
      
    43 In cross-examination Ms Ottomar said this: 
     
      
      “Q. Your daughter told you about four weeks later, that is four weeks after the accident, that the minder didn’t catch her? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Is that the version she told you? 
       
      A. She said, ‘She didn’t catch me.’ 
      
     
     
      
      Q. And that’s the first explanation she gave for the accident, is that right? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Were there other explanations your daughter gave you? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. And what were they? 
       
      A. Well, that she’d fallen off a triangle block. 
       
       
      Q. What other versions? 
       
      A. Well, she fell off the triangle block onto a toy car. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Other versions? 
       
      A. That was it. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. And had she told you those versions before she said that someone didn’t catch her? 
       
      A. No. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Well, were they versions that were told to you later or afterwards? 
       
      A. After asking her what had happened, she then tried to explain - was trying to hold it in and then just said - I said, ‘We need to know what happened. You’re not going to get into trouble, nobody is going to hurt you,’ and that’s when she told us what had happened.” 
      
    44 Although learned counsel for the defendant glossed the plaintiff’s explanations to her mother as “versions”, they are merely consecutive parts of the one event. As I apprehend the evidence, the plaintiff essentially told her mother that she fell off the triangle block, part of gymnastic equipment, and fell onto a toy car at a time when she was expecting to be caught by a minder. This was not a number of versions of an event, that is, a number of conflicting statements as to what had occurred, but rather separate parts of the one event.45 The significant part of the description given by the plaintiff to her mother, in my view, is the first part of the story. It is, “She didn’t catch me.” A child walking along the floor in a normal fashion would not expect anyone to be there to catch hold of her if she fell over. A child sitting on a floor playing with a toy would not expect someone to be there to catch her if she somehow fell forward whilst seated. However, a child who was used to playing on the type of gymnastic equipment that was from time to time in the childminding centre, where activities on the gymnastic equipment were supposed to be supervised, would anticipate that there would be someone there to catch her as she was on the gymnastic equipment in case she fell from it. So the initial explanation that she was not caught, to me, is entirely and solely consistent with the child having a recollection of falling from something where she expected to be caught if she fell. The only thing that matches that description in the factual matrix before me is the gymnastic equipment at the childminding centre. 46 Before turning to the two issues concerning that, I should refer to the plaintiff’s unsworn evidence. She told me that she remembered the accident happening. She said she was going down the triangle block and she fell, that she landed on the hard floor, that there was a toy truck on the floor where she landed, and that there were no blue mats on the floor at the time she fell. It was effectively and in child’s terms put to the plaintiff that there was no triangle block or gymnastic equipment in the centre from which she fell, and the plaintiff maintained her earlier evidence. It was suggested to the plaintiff that she was sitting on the floor playing with a toy truck when she hurt herself, to which the plaintiff said no; and that she was walking and fell over, to which she said no. 47 Exhibit A shows a configuration of gymnastic equipment comprising of essentially two pieces. One is in the form of a triangle that is effectively a ramp down which a child could slide. The other piece is a set of three steps which would enable a child to climb towards the top of the slide and then either slide down it feet first or even head first or roll down the slide sideways. Exhibit A also shows three blue gymnastic type mats, one at the base of the slide and the other two at the side of the slide and the set of three steps which had been put back to back so that a child could walk up the steps then slide down the slide. According to Ms Cantarella and Ms Harris, there was also a fourth mat which was generally placed at the base of the steps so that all four sides of the two blocks were surrounded by gymnastic mats. The evidence of the plaintiff is that there were two triangular slides with a square block in between the two slides, which has been referred to in her evidence as “the flat bit”. The plaintiff’s evidence was that she was sitting on top of the flat bit as if she was sitting on a chair when she fell backwards down the slide. That leads directly to the questions concerning the mats and the slide. 48 Suffice it to say at this stage that I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s evidence that there were two triangular slides with a flat bit in between. The evidence of Ms Cantarella and Ms Harris is that there was only one slide and one set of stairs, although Ms Harris thought there might be a block or cube as well, although Ms Cantarella denies that. Ms Cantarella at the time of giving evidence was still working in the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre childminding centre. She had been there for eleven years and she would clearly know what equipment was there to be used. Although I have grave doubts as to her reliability, I do not have doubts about her integrity. She is likely to be accurate in now being able to tell me what equipment was available. 49 However, in my view little turns on the plaintiff’s misdescription of the gymnastic equipment at the centre. She could equally have been sitting on the flat bit of the top stair and fallen backwards down the slide, or fallen somehow from the step onto the side of the slide, or the like. An important thing from my point of view is that the essential version of events given by Sophia to me from the witness box was consistent with what she had told her mother. 50 One must be extremely guarded in giving weight to unsworn testimony from a child of tender years. There is in evidence a chapter from a book called “Children’s Testimony” edited by Westcott, Davies and Bull, published in 2002. The chapter is chapter 4 which is headed “The Development of Autobiographical Memory”. I have read the article, despite the objection of learned counsel for the defendant. The article can do no more than tell me that it is physiologically possible for a child to remember what happened to the child at the age of three. Therefore, I can accept that in so far as Sophia has a recollection, that the recollection is an honest one, not a subsequent construction or confabulation. It is true that Sophia’s memory of events is limited, but this traumatic event is something that would stand out not only in a child’s mind but in the mind of any person who sustained a nasty injury. 51 Another important point, from my point of view about the evidence of Sophia are the repeated denials by Ms Ottomar of any prompting by her of her daughter, of her putting into her daughter’s mouth the fact that she had fallen from the triangle block. That was her evidence both on 4 May 2006 and yesterday 26 June 2006. I accept Ms Ottomar in that regard. 52 I therefore give weight to the essential version of events deposed to by Sophia that she fell from the triangle block from the top of it onto a surface. I say “a surface” because I am not persuaded by Sophia’s evidence that the mats were not in use around the gymnastic equipment. The evidence is that was normally the case and it appears to me that I should not postulate the extraordinary on the basis of Sophia’s recollection. She believed that she struck something hard and it may well be that she struck the toy truck. 53 There was one further area of evidence which will lead me to my ultimate conclusion. That evidence is expert evidence. Dr Peter Conrad in his report of 13 September 2004 said this: 
     
      
      “With regards to the question that you have posed to me in your letter of instructions, it is not likely that she would sustain such a severe elbow injury by a single fall to the ground. The nature of the injury is more consistent with a fall onto a hard surface, from a height of 3 feet to 4 feet.” 
      
    54 The defendant sought to counter that with evidence from Dr J B Stephenson. In a supplementary opinion bearing date 21 April 2006, omitting formal parts, Dr Stephenson said this: 
     
      
      “Her mother had said that Sophia had fallen from some large foam blocks onto a toy car.  
      
     
     
      
      You have stated in your referral letter, addressed originally to Dr Vote, 22 February 2006: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ‘...a witness to the incident disputes the version of events current pleaded and says the accident happened whilst the plaintiff was playing on the floor with a toy car (as opposed to on large rubber blocks) and lost her balance, landing awkwardly on her arm...’ 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      In your request for a further Supplementary Report of 11 August 2006: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ‘...as stated in our letter of instructions a witness to the incident disputes the version of events currently pleaded and says the plaintiff was either kneeling or sitting on the floor pushing a toy car sideways when she lost her balance landing awkwardly on her arm. The floor was a concrete surface covered with an industrial grade carpet.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Please provide your opinion as to whether the injury is consistent with that history...’ 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      I accept that the injury is consistent with that history. The type of fracture injury sustained is more likely to have occurred from, for example, a fall, after losing balance, landing awkwardly on her arm on a floor which was a concrete surface, covered by an industrial grade carpet.” 
      
    55 The expression of the opinion of Dr Conrad is clear. What exactly Dr Stephenson means is unclear. It was put to the doctor that the plaintiff was either kneeling or sitting on the floor when she somehow fell sideways after losing her balance and somehow sustained the fracture. That is not, in my view, a description of a “fall after losing balance” then landing awkwardly with an arm on the floor. As a layman, the medical opinion of Dr Conrad appears to have much greater weight than the diffident opinion of Dr Stephenson. In my view, the opinion of Dr Conrad reinforces the proposition that for the plaintiff to have sustained such a nasty injury she had to fall some distance, such as 3 or 4 feet, not the distance between a three year old’s kneeling on the floor and the floor itself, which might be only a height of 18 inches to 2 feet. 56 I accept, therefore, that the plaintiff fell from gymnastic equipment, namely the slide and/or the stairs to reach the top of the slide, within the childminding centre at the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre on 27 August 2001. That leads me on to discuss the evidence concerning the equipment at the centre.57 Ms Ottomar said that when she took Sophia into the aquatic centre on the morning of 27 August 2001 that she saw the foam equipment or foam blocks when she dropped her off. Ms Ottomar went on to say in cross-examination that the blocks were one of Sophia’s favourite things to play on. Ms Carnevale said that she passed the entrance to the childminding centre on the morning of the plaintiff’s injury and saw through the doorway that the foam blocks or gymnastic equipment were present. Indeed, she went so far as to say that there was never an occasion when the foam blocks were not present in the childminding centre. In cross-examination it became clear that in fact Ms Carnevale not only walked past the entrance to the childminding centre on 27 August 2001 but she in fact entered it in order to drop off her daughter Nicola at 9.15am. Ms Carnevale retrieved her daughter at 10.45am. On two occasions on that day she visited the centre. She was in a good position to know whether the foam blocks were present. She was adamant that they were. When Mrs Harris gave her evidence yesterday she said that she could not remember the plaintiff’s accident happening and did not say anything about the presence or otherwise on that day of the presence of the foam blocks in the childminding centre. The essence of the evidence of Ms Cantarella is that the foam blocks were not present. 58 For reasons that I have already stated in part and will reiterate when discussing this evidence, it is clear to me that the evidence of Ms Cantarella that the foam blocks were not present on this day is a reconstruction. I am able to accept that reconstruction in light of the firm evidence that Ms Ottomar and Ms Carnevale. Therefore, Ms Cantarella’s evidence does not stand in the way of the finding I have already announced.59 However, Ms Cantarella’s evidence on this issue goes very much to the question of liability in negligence. Essentially the plaintiff’s case is that there had been a failure by the defendant to properly supervise the plaintiff, a three year old child in a childminding centre. This is further particularised in the statement of claim as permitting the plaintiff to climb onto the foam rubber blocks without supervision and permitting the plaintiff to do so when she was at risk of falling. Essentially the plaintiff says she fell from the foam gymnastic equipment and through her counsel says that were she on the foam gymnastic equipment she ought to have been supervised and clearly was not. Therefore, there was a failing in the defendant’s system of supervision of children within the childminding centre.60 The evidence of Ms Cantarella, the person running the childminding centre, was that children on the gymnastic equipment were supervised on all occasions and did not go on the equipment without there being such supervision. There is really no dispute between the case of the plaintiff and the case of the defendant that each child on the gymnastic equipment ought be supervised. The real dispute is whether the child was on the gymnastic equipment, and I have already found that Sophia was. 61 An argument has been put to me by learned counsel for the defendant based on the decision of the Court of Appeal in City Elevator Services Pty Limited v Burrows [2004] NSW CA 26. That case concerned an allegation of a judge’s associate being caught in doors in the Supreme Court building. After that plaintiff’s injury, the timing of the closing of the doors of the lifts in the Supreme Court building was adjusted. The learned trial judge held that the defendant had been negligent. However, the appeal was successful. The essence of the finding of the Court of Appeal commences at para 57 in the reasons of Santow JA with whom Tobias JA and Palmer J concurred. His Honour said: 
     
      
      “However, the real problem which lies at the heart of this appeal is that the trial judge relied ultimately upon the proposition, correct but insufficient, that the accident would not have occurred had the adjustments been made which were subsequently made in January 1998. Why insufficient?  
      
     
     
      
      First, there was simply no evidence before the trial judge to conclude that the relevant Standards were not complied with. 
      
     
     
      
      Second, there was no suggestion that the lift did not have regular inspection, testing and maintenance, as again Mr Oldham confirms from his reading of the maintenance documentation. Then there is no evidence of the kind required to satisfy the Shirt calculus in terms of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of probability of its occurrence - we simply know that an accident occurred but have no knowledge of whether other accidents occurred or indeed not in the year or so preceding.  
      
     
     
      
      Finally, in terms of that calculus, there is no evidence of ‘the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action’, one way or the other. Nor is there any evidence as to the conflicting responsibility which the respective defendants at trial had for providing a functioning lift system operating without reasonable delays, consistent with reasonable safety. One therefore cannot, on the limited evidence, conclude that the injury which occurred was reasonably foreseeable.” 
      
    62 That statement has little to do with the current case. Here the plaintiff says children playing on the gymnastic equipment should have been supervised. The defendant says exactly the same thing. The plaintiff says that her accident happened because she was not supervised, that there was no one there to catch her if she fell. The defendant does not admit that but says that the fall did not occur because the equipment was not there. 63 A submission, a rather bold submission if I may say so, was put to me by learned counsel for the defendant that even assuming the Court found that the plaintiff was injured as she alleges in the statement of claim, that that was insufficient to find negligence. With the utmost respect, if the defendant’s own system of supervision of preschool children in a childminding centre is not adhered to, then the defendant itself has failed to comply with the standards it imposed upon itself. Here there was no suggestion made by or on behalf of the defendant that its standards of minding children were overly excessive or works of supererogation. However, there is on one issue evidence to suggest that even the defendant did not maintain the standards which had been laid down, whether by the defendant itself or by some external authority or authoritative body, I do not know. However, if the defendant fails to maintain its own standards it seems to me that the finding of negligence is inevitable, absent any evidence from the defendant itself that it took unnecessary or highly unusual precautions which would not be required. 64 Again, here such evidence would be hard to adduce in any event because common sense would indicate that children of tender years climbing onto things might easily fall off or be pushed off or overbalance and fall and ought be supervised. Even judges have had at some stage in their life young children. Not only do judges have young children but so do jurors, and a judge sitting without a jury is entitled to use jury knowledge. Such things do happen to young children and the need for supervision, to be ever vigilant, falls upon a childminder in a childminding centre being operated for fee or reward, just as it falls upon a parent or babysitter or grandparent exercising parental responsibility. 65 I turn now to the evidence of Ms Cantarella relating to the foam gymnastic equipment and liability. Ms Cantarella told me that she usually commenced work at 8.50am in order to set up the childminding centre for its opening at 9am. She told me that an assistant helped her each morning between nine and eleven, and that after eleven she ran the childminding centre by herself. The inference to be drawn is that the childminding centre was not busy after 11am. The childminding centre closed early in the afternoon. 66 The evidence discloses what are referred to as childminding ratios. For children under one there can be only five children to each childminder. For children between one and three the childminding ratio is eight children per childminder. For children over three the childminding ratio is ten children per childminder. The evidence does not disclose what occurs if there is a mixed collection of children; that is, children of various ages. 67 On the day in question, that is the day of the plaintiff’s injury, there were seventeen children in the childminding centre. The last to arrive was at 9.25, the same time as Sophia arrived, and the first to leave would appear to be one who left at 10.15, followed by another who left at 10.20, followed by two who left at 10.25, followed by Sophia who left at 10.30. 68 It would therefore appear that at or about the time of the plaintiff’s injury there were still sixteen or seventeen children in the childminding centre. Their ages cannot now be ascertained. If they were all roughly of the same age as the plaintiff herself, then the childminding ratio had been exceeded by one. Two minders are entitled to look after sixteen children, but there were seventeen children in attendance. Exceeding the ratio is, of course, not evidence of negligence and has not been pleaded as a particular of negligence. However, it is indicative of there being a large number of children to be supervised. The larger number of children to be supervised, the lesser amount of supervision can be given to each particular child.69 The evidence of Ms Cantarella relating to the mats is completely unsatisfactory. Commencing on p 35 of the transcript of 4 May 2006 Ms Cantarella tried to start out to tell me that the foam equipment “might have been [there] maybe once a month”. She then went on to say that if the equipment were put there it would stay there for a whole week. When I asked her questions she said it may be there for up to two weeks, but if she had “babies in the room” she would take the foam equipment out but she might bring it back the next day if there were no babies there. She went on to agree that the gist of her evidence was that the foam equipment might be there once a month for a week at a time. At the commencement of cross-examination she said that the equipment could be present “for up to two weeks”. Eventually at p 50 of the transcript the witness agreed that the equipment might be present for “around half the time”. I have already referred to the evidence of Ms Carnevale that the equipment was present all the time. The extent to which the equipment was present needed to be drawn painstakingly from Ms Cantarella. 70 Yesterday there was a refreshing evidence given by Mrs Harris. My note is that she said that the equipment could be present in the centre for three or four months before Erica changed it to other equipment which she described as an animal pen made of plastic, presumably in which the children could play with plastic animals. Counsel have another note of the witness saying two to three months at a time, but my recollection is that that was given in cross-examination rather than in chief. Suffice it to say that the evidence of Mrs Harris is that the equipment could be present there for months at a time without being moved. 71 The significance of that, of course, is that it is highly unlikely that the equipment would be moved out merely because babies were present or merely because there were too many children. The equipment could not be stored in the childminding centre itself. It had to be stored elsewhere in another part of the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre. The inference to be drawn is that it was inconvenient to unpack it and erect it and then to dismantle it and pack it back again in another place. It would appear to be a cumbersome procedure if one needed to put away the equipment. 72 In cross-examination Ms Cantarella said that the equipment was designed for educational gymnastic programmes with small children. She also said that it was used to build their gross motor skills. She agreed that when gymnastic programmes were being performed the children should be supervised. She agreed that when the gymnastic programmes were going on that she would be present with the children. It was then put to her that when the gymnastic programmes were not being performed the children would climb on the equipment, and the witness said that they did not. 73 There was then some discussion, or perhaps one might better say argument, between the witness and Mr Lidden as to the use of the equipment in question. Eventually the witness conceded that if the children are interested in climbing on the equipment the children would be supervised and the supervisor would assist the children with the skills that the child or children needed to develop. She confirmed that when that was happening someone had to be right next to the child supervising the child. 74 Evidence was then given about the childminding ratios and the cross-examination then turned to the presence or otherwise of the foam equipment on the day of the plaintiff’s injury. This evidence was given: 
     
      
      “Q. Now, how is it you remember that this accident happened to be on a day when the foam equipment wasn’t there? 
       
      A. Because I’d set it up mainly for the four to five year old children and, on that day I had a lot of two to three year old children. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. But you told us a little bit earlier you’d remove it for the babies? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. That was your general practice, was it? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. But not always? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. Well, how could it be set up for two weeks at a time in those circumstances, you’d just have no babies for two weeks at a go, would you? 
       
      A. Okay. If there were no babies I’d also look at how many children were in the room at the time as well. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Because, is this right, it’s difficult to supervise the children on that equipment if there are too many of them? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Because you had to keep a very careful eye on them, is that so? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
    The cross-examination continued on this issue and eventually this evidence was given: 
     
      
      “Q. Well, when it was raised with you years after the accident about whether the foam rubber blocks were there, how did you go about deciding whether they were there or not? 
       
      A. Because I remember Sophia playing where she was playing and where they would have been set up I would have remembered seeing them and, I don’t remember seeing them visually in my mind. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. But you would remember something being there that was there up to half the month? 
       
      A. Yeah, I’d remember if they were in the room, because I would have had someone watching over there for the kids to play on and there was no [activity] at that time. So that’s why I really remembered that it wasn’t in the room.” 
      
    Again, that evidence speaks highly of reconstruction by Ms Cantarella of what must have happened on the day of the plaintiff’s injury. 75 The evidence of the witness then became, in my view, somewhat amusing. According to Ms Cantarella, she ran a utopian childminding centre where every child did exactly what every child was told. I know of few parents, few schoolteachers, few leaders of youth groups who can run a show where every child does exactly what every child is supposed to do and every child does not do what every child is forbidden to do. Ms Cantarella said this: 
     
      
      “Q. And unsupervised the children are not supposed to climb on them, are they? 
       
      A. They don’t climb on it if they’re not supervised, no.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. Well, they’re not supposed to do that, are they? 
       
      A. They don’t do it. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. They’re all perfectly behaved, are they? 
       
      A. They are when I’m in the room. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. All perfectly able to resist the temptation of climbing on things, is that right? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. These are young aged children? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Who never climb on anything while under your care? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Because you know they are not supposed to? 
       
      A. Because they know me and I’ve been there a long time and they know the sort of person I am.” 
       
      
    76 Mr Lidden introduced an exhibit and this evidence was given: 
     
      
       
      “Q. There’s no doubt, is there, Ms Cantarella, that if this foam equipment was there on the day of the accident and Sophia was on it, somebody should have been next to her supervising her? 
       
      A. Would have been, yes.  
       
       
      Q. Would have been had the system worked properly but should have been in any event, do you agree? 
       
      A. Rephrase that, I don’t understand. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Well, at all times while a child was climbing on that foam equipment, a person should have been next to her supervising her? 
       
      A. Yes, yes.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. And, is this right, when some years after the accident you were asked about the foam equipment you had to look back in your mind and remember whether it was there or not? 
       
      A. No. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Well, what did you do? 
       
      A. I remember it wasn’t there.” 
      
    77 Mr Lidden then turned to the circumstances of the plaintiff’s accident and the evidence then continued: 
     
      
      “Q. Generally speaking, it would be a good idea, don’t you agree, that objects, such as small vehicles, be kept away from foam objects when they’re in use? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Because if a child falls onto a hard object such as a plastic vehicle rather than a soft mat, injuries can occur? 
       
      A. That’s why the mats are around, so that the - if you can look here you’d see that there’s no toys going onto the mats where they would actually fall. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Unless a child puts one on the mat, Ms Cantarella? 
       
      A. No, because there’s people supervising them, as we said, and they’d make sure that wouldn’t happen. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. That is a perfect system where a child can never pick up a toy and put it on one of those mats, is it? 
       
      A. Well, they can pick it up but we will move it. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. If you’re looking? 
       
      A. We will always teach the children, which we do, to keep toys in the area that they set up in. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. And they don’t always do [everything] that they’re taught, do they? 
       
      A. They do as they’re supposed to do and they listen more to strangers than their parents and, if you come into my centre you will see that they are all well behaved and do the right thing.” 
      
    78 Again, what was put to Ms Cantarella was the child could have put a toy vehicle on the mat onto which the plaintiff could have fallen. Ms Cantarella, in her best of all possible childminding centres, denied that that might occur but clearly it is something that could occur. A childminder could be distracted. For example, Ms Cantarella could be assisting a child with a painting or drawing at the table and not be looking towards the mats and the gymnastic equipment. Sophia could have climbed up and fallen onto it whilst another child had placed a toy on the mat. That, to me, is possible and, in my view, in this case likely to be what had occurred. 79 I am unable to accept the evidence of Ms Cantarella that the gymnastic equipment was not present on the day of the plaintiff’s accident. I accept that the plaintiff climbed up onto it without being seen to do so either by Ms Cantarella or Mrs Harris. It was reasonably foreseeable that a child of three years would do that. Despite the protestations of Ms Cantarella to the contrary, children do not always do what they are told to do and do not always forbear from doing what they are told to not do. The plaintiff climbed up, she was unsupervised, the foreseeable occurred, she fell, she fell either onto the floor, on which the child says there was no mat, or onto a mat on which had been placed a truck onto which she fell. 80 The latter is the more likely and I have already dismissed the suggestion that the mats were not there. It appears to be likely that they were there as part of the normal setup of this childminding centre. The fact that Sophia is likely to have fallen onto the toy truck explains why the first sight of Sophia in distress by Ms Cantarella was of Sophia with the truck. In my view, the plaintiff’s injury could have been avoided if the defendant had adhered to its own system of only permitting a child to get up onto the gymnastic equipment, these foam blocks, if the child was supervised. Sophia was not, despite the protestations of Ms Cantarella. Essentially she failed to exercise due care for the safety of the plaintiff by failing to observe that the plaintiff had mounted onto the foam blocks and was liable to fall. 81 In my view, therefore, the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing that the defendant is liable for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff when she fell on 27 August 2001.82 I have enquired of the representatives of the parties whether any further reasons for judgment are required. I am told that none is so required.83 For those reasons, there will be verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for damages to be assessed. 84 Stood over to the inactive list, to be called-over not later than one year from today’s date, for further directions. 85 I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs to date. 86 Pursuant to s 341 of the Legal Profession Act 2004, I exclude from the operation of Div 9 of Pt 3.2 of the Legal Profession Act 2004 the costs which I ordered the defendant to pay on 5 May 2006. That was an order that the defendant pay the costs thrown away by the adjournment in any event. Those costs are to include the costs of 26 and 27 June 2006. 87 I make an order for interim assessment, if necessary. Normally one could not have an assessment until after the case is concluded, so that is why I make that order. 88 The exhibits are to be retained.

   JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: 1. On 18 March 2008, John Carlo Alessi was convicted in his absence by the presiding magistrate at the Wyong Local Court. Section 4 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, gave to the appellant the right to appeal to the Local Court for the annulment of a conviction or sentence made or imposed upon him, provided that he was not in appearance before the Local Court when the conviction or sentence was made. 2. The matters before the Local Court on that day were that he had knowingly contravened a prohibition or restriction contained in an apprehended domestic violence order and that he had assaulted somebody, both of those events occurring simultaneously on 26 June 2007. 3. The matter had progressed as a defended matter on 26 February 2008. A solicitor had been instructed, Mr Archer who in fact appears in this Court was the solicitor on the record. Evidence was taken from a couple of witnesses and then it would seem the matter was stood over to 18 th March 2008. 4. On that date, Mr Archer unexpectedly found himself embarrassed in that he had obligations in the District Court in Newcastle and at the Local Court in Wyong. There was also a system failure operating in his office in that there were management restrictions upon his staff in terms of faxing documents from the office without their first being sighted by him. Consequently, his situation was not communicated by his office to the Local Court until sometime around or after eleven o’clock, no doubt coinciding with a morning tea adjournment in Newcastle. The appellant had indicated to the Court that he was not represented and was seeking an adjournment on two bases it would seem, firstly that he was seeking a triple­0 recording and secondly that his counsel was not present. 5. The Wyong Local Court, I have no doubt, is a busy court. His Honour was keen to get on with the hearing. The appellant appeared before his Honour and said that his solicitor was actually in transit, he had a small matter to attend to at the Newcastle Local Court and he was going to be at the Court within the next hour. His Honour indicated that he would wait the solicitor’s attendance. Meanwhile the prosecutor had his own difficulties in that the witness whose testimony he was seeking to introduce had some personal difficulties. She had just started a new job and her employer was not happy about it. The prosecution indicated that she could have the morning off, but needed to be at work at one o’clock in Sydney. Putting to one side the fairness to the employer, no doubt the witness herself was stressed by that situation. 6. His Honour then invited the appellant to retire outside and make a phone call, no doubt thinking that that would not take long. In the event it apparently took some twenty minutes. There is evidence that matters, were interposed. Then the next thing that is recorded is, “There’s no appearance of Mr Alessi anywhere in the building or outside the Court your Honour. We couldn’t see him anywhere, we checked the toilets and we’ve called him everywhere.” His Honour said, “I know you’ve said that you’ve done that and I don’t disbelieve you. If you'd do it [again], I'm desperate now to get this matter on.” His Honour continued, “I'm prepared to wait, I don’t want to start anything else. What time would it have been when I sent Mr Alessi out to ring his lawyers?” “About twenty past”, was the reply recorded. His Honour then went off the bench for five minutes. 7. His Honour then returned saying, “If Mr Archer had mentioned the matter at 9:30, he'd be lucky to be here by 11:00.” 8. The prosecutor then reminded the learned Magistrate of his own personal difficulty with the witness. His Honour said, “I'm not waiting for Mr Archer”. He was critical of Mr Archer for accepting the brief in the matter if he could not be here at 9 o’clock. His Honour then went off for a further five minutes to allow the search for the appellant to continue. Before he adjourned he said, “If Mr Alessi’s not back then, we’ll go to plan B” (whatever that is). His Honour returned, asked the court officer to give Mr Alessi another call and made the observation that he had been gone for at least twenty minutes. A further matter was interposed, his Honour yet again sought to have Mr Alessi called, observing that it had been a half an hour had passed. 9. I have not heard Mr Alessi’s evidence, but I am told that it would be to the effect that he was gone for twenty minutes and that he was trying to contact his solicitor. 10. It seems to me, the adjournment of this matter must have been something in excess of thirty minutes. It may be that Mr Alessi would have some difficulty persuading me that he had remained in the close precincts of the court or immediately outside it. I do not know what telephone equipment he had access to. I do recognise that he may well have been stressed. He does not appear to me to be a gentleman who would have felt comfortable trying to run his own case. The prosecutor then continued by showing the relevant witness who had come from Sydney, a document and tendering the statement. The statement was admitted, it was noted here without objection, it is difficult to imagine who could have objected. 11. Mr Archer raises the question of procedural fairness. In view of the question of why Mr Alessi was gone for so long, I could not come to any view about whether he had been denied procedural fairness or not. But I am satisfied that he did and was intending to defend this matter, was bona fide in that intent and that events beyond his control impacted upon his ability so to do. 12. In that case it seems to me he had a good case to argue before the Magistrate on the issue of whether his application for annulment should have been upheld or granted. In the event it was not granted. Mr Archer himself indicates that he gave evidence on the application seeking to explain the situation. It may be that in everyone’s concern about the situation, the fundamental proposition was overlooked, which is that the appellant bona fide was seeking to defend this case and the defence was capable of answering it. It seems to me that the administration of justice is best served by allowing that to go ahead. 13. The appellant appeals to this court, pursuant to 11A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act . He has an appeal as of right. The very fact that he has an appeal as of right suggest to me that the legislature is keen that those who are bona fide in seeking to defend a matter have the opportunity so to do. This is not a case of him needing to seek leave, he has the right to appeal against the annulment provided that appeal is made within twenty­eight days. Significantly, and he should know this, not more than one appeal may be made under this section. 14. The procedure for the determination of appeals against the local Court is set out in 16A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act . It provides that the application may be dismissed or it may be granted. If the application is granted, this Court must remit the matter to the Local Court and the Local Court is to deal with it under s 9 upon its return. That section requires that the Local Court must then notify each of the interested parties and must then deal with the matter afresh. 15. That has been of some concern to the Crown, particularly because the complainant and the police officer have given evidence already. In the course of the application, Mr Archer has indicated their willingness to tender in the Local Court, the transcripts of evidence of the two relevant witnesses that was taken on 26th of February. 16. That being so, the Crown now does not as I understand the Crown position, oppose the granting of this application, so it would it seem to be by consent. But in any event, for reasons I have given, it would have been granted anyway. 17. The formal orders are, the application is granted. The effect of that granting of the application is that the conviction is annulled. The matter is remitted to the Local Court pursuant to s 16A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: One of the important matters to look at when sentencing an offender for an offence of break, enter and steal or in this case aggravated break, enter and steal concerns the nature and value of the property stolen. Sometimes items of great sentimental but little monetary value are taken. Other times property of considerable value is stolen. Here the property was neither of sentimental value or of highly significant monetary value, but it was still very important to the school from which it was taken.2 Part of modern education requires modern technology. In this case the Nicholson Street Public School had finished installing some audio visual equipment on 17 June 2008. The offender and his de facto partner broken into the school and stole some of that equipment the very next day. Fortunately the education of the children would not have been greatly affected because the offender and his co-offender were arrested almost immediately.3 In assessing the gravity of this offence, I do take into account that the victim of the offence was a school and that the education of the children would have been affected, had the offender managed to complete doing what he wanted to do.4 When the offender and Ms Thurlow, his co-offender, broke into the school at about 12.25am on 18 June 2008, they set off an alarm. Police and security officers attended. When they got there, they saw the offender and his co-offender carrying a large flat screen television with a combined VCR/DVD recorder on top. Police called out to them to stop. Both offenders put the TV down, but the co-offender, Ms Thurlow, picked up the other piece of equipment and they ran away. Police were calling “stop there, Police” but the offenders did not. Ms Thurlow was arrested after she climbed onto a fence, and fell off, injuring herself in the process. The offender got a bit further, but was eventually detected hiding under a tree. He was arrested and when asked what they were doing, Ms Thurlow said “yeah, we broke. We were desperate.”5 The statement of facts tendered and signed by the offender contains this; in a conversation between police and Ms Thurlow, when the police officer said to her “how were you going to get the stuff back to Blacktown?” Ms Thurlow replied “We had to call when we were ready to be picked up.” I mention that in particular because of the way the offender gave his evidence today. He was to my impression, incredibly anxious to suggest that the third person involved, who was never named, had a very limited involvement in this matter. According to the offender, he had not quite worked out how he was going to get this large flat screen television away from the school after he had broken into it and stolen the TV. Perhaps, he said, “we would have called for a lift.” Of course the truth is much more likely to be what Ms Thurlow said to police; that is they had already arranged that the third person would come and pick them up when they were ready.6 Fortunately as I said, the equipment was recovered and it was reinstalled a couple of days later.7 The other offence for which the offender is to be sentenced concerned an offence of possessing house breaking equipment. When he was arrested, the offender had two screw drivers, both about twenty-five centimetres long in the rear of his jeans pocket. Ms Thurlow also had equipment including screw drivers, spanners, jimmy bars and other breaking implements. These were said to have come from the motor vehicle which the offender and Ms Thurlow owned, driven by this third person.8 The offender has a lengthy criminal history, although it does have to be said that there are fortunately many matters relatively minor; at least less serious than the one for which the offender is to be sentenced for today. He has a problem with alcohol. One of the things I did accept from the offender in the witness box is his evidence that all or at least almost all of his offending is due to his excessive consumption of alcohol. He said he has had a problem with alcohol since he was fifteen years of age. He says that this offence was at least partially motivated by a desire to buy more alcohol. In fact the presentence report suggests that that is the sole motivation, although in court the offender suggests that as well as buying alcohol, he also had to buy food and other necessities. The offender was on bail at the time of this offence. That represents a significant matter of aggravation.9 The offender is now forty-nine years old and frankly is old enough to know better. There needs to be a substantial component of general deterrence in this case. Whether the offender did plan to commit this offence before he went fishing or only thought about it after he had left where they were fishing and went for a walk, the decision that the offender made to break into somewhere to obtain some money seems to have been made fairly lightly. It was, as I say, an offence committed at least partially simply so he could buy more alcohol.10 The offender says that his offence was foolish. It certainly was. The offender has expressed his remorse, although that seems to be almost entirely due to the fact that he has, through his criminal activity, got Ms Thurlow involved. She is facing sentence early next year. The offender says Ms Thurlow and he had written to the school, expressing their remorse for what they did. I am prepared to find that the offender has expressed remorse as that term is now used in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The offender pleaded guilty to these offences at an early stage and so I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed for both of them by approximately twenty-five percent.11 The guideline judgment in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 sets out a number of matters that should be considered when an offence of break, enter and steal is considered. In this case, as I mentioned, the offender was on conditional liberty. I am satisfied that whilst there was not what I would call “professional planning” involved, this offence was planned. The offender decided at least while he was off walking that he would commit an offence to get some money. This required making a telephone call to a person who he knew would both give him a lift and had with him the tools necessary for the offender to commit the offence. There was that degree of planning. The offender has a prior record. There is one matter of break, enter and steal on it and other property offences as well. As I mentioned before, the property taken was not of sentimental value or particularly valuable in monetary terms, but it was important to the work of the school and the education of the children who attended it.12 Turning to the specific matters in s 21A, I cannot find that the offender has good prospects for rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. The evidence suggests the offender has had many opportunities to avail himself of counselling and the like to deal with his addiction to alcohol, but he has either not taken advantage of them or they have failed to bring about a change in the offender’s behaviour, as this very offence demonstrates. Mr Murphy placed emphasis on the suggestion that the offender could be dealt with by way of a suspended sentence. Of course this would require that the sentence imposed upon the offender was two years or less and I am certainly not entitled to decide firstly to impose a suspended sentence and the secondly to decide whether the period of imprisonment will be two years or less. A significant hurdle which the offender and Mr Murphy have to overcome is the fact that this matter has a standard non-parole period of five years; thus the standard non-parole period is two and a half times the cut-off period of the head sentence, which would entitle the offender to a suspended sentence.13 I am satisfied that this offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, primarily because of the fact that this was a school that was broken into and educational material and equipment used in the education of children was stolen. Of course the standard non-parole period is not of direct application given the pleas of guilty, but it remains as a guide for the sentence to be imposed. There can be no doubt that Parliament intended by the selection of a standard non-parole period of five years and more fundamentally perhaps the inclusion of aggravated break, enter and steal offences in the category of offences carrying a standard non-parole period, that significant sentences of imprisonment are to be imposed when offenders such as the present are detected.14 There are special circumstances in this case relating to the offender’s need to deal with his alcohol problems with the assistance of the Probation and Parole Service upon his release to parole, if that be the case. Although because of the length of the sentence I will shortly announce, it is not me who sets the conditions of parole. I do recommend that he be closely monitored and counselled regarding alcohol addiction on his release to parole.15 The offence of possess housebreaking implements has a fixed term of imprisonment of two years. That is a fixed term because of the sentence I will impose on the aggravated break, enter and steal matter. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period to date from 17 June 2008 and expire on 16 June 2011 and I set a head sentence of five years for that matter.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Ian Robert Campbell appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty this afternoon to an indictment containing three counts. He had earlier pleaded guilty at the Local Court to these same charges, the indictment being necessary because of some defect in the committal papers. So despite the fact that he has pleaded guilty today, the Crown accepts that he pleaded guilty at an early opportunity.2 Those three charges are all offences of obtaining a financial advantage from the Commonwealth by lodging claim forms containing false statements. The offender had a remarkably simple but fatally flawed scheme of operation. He took advantage of the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grant Scheme which commenced on 1 July 2000. That scheme was designed to provide cash rebates to businesses in certain industries to subsidise their vehicle fuel expenses. The scheme requires that those who wish to make a claim must register their businesses for the rebate scheme, nominate the vehicles which are the subject of claims and provide bank account details for the ATO to pay the rebates.3 In March 2002 the offender applied for an ABN. That was issued and the offender then registered for the rebate scheme. That registration referred to a single vehicle. The offender became the registered owner of that vehicle in April 2002. Between about 1 September 2002 and about 9 December 2004 the offender made fifty-six claims for rebates. He was entitled to none of them. The total amount that he claimed was $381,866.44. He obtained almost all of this. The only amount he did not receive was the final payment of $8,130.89. That payment is the subject of count 3 on the indictment, charged as an attempt, because by this stage the ATO was investigating matters and the payment was withheld. 4 It appears, as far as can be ascertained on the material before me, that the offender had no legitimate business and that the ABN was registered solely for the purpose of this fraudulent scheme. As is clear, on each occasion the offender lodged a fraudulent claim form he was committing a separate criminal offence. The Crown has chosen to charge offences covering broadly equal periods. There is no distinction between count 1 and count 2 on the indictment except that they relate to different periods and different amounts, but the conduct in both counts is essentially the same. Count 1 relates to the period 1 September 2002 to 5 August 2003 and relates to $104,013.62. Count 2 relates to the period 1 August 2003 to 30 November 2004 and relates to the sum of $258,353.63. 5 The fatal flaw in the offender’s scheme concerned the size of the refunds claimed. Averaged over the period, the offender was claiming over 14,000 litres of fuel a week for a single vehicle. That is 2,006 litres each day. If the vehicle never stopped, that is, if it ran twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, it would still be using eighty-four litres an hour according to the claims made by the offender. That would mean that it would have to be refuelled at least two times an hour or at least thirty-three times a day.6 The offender was spoken to by ATO investigators in May 2005. The offender blamed everything on a man called Bill Hilder who, it appears, does not exist. He also told the ATO that he could not provide the fuel purchase book because, somewhat inventively, his dog had chewed it up. He did provide at some stage fuel receipts, delivery dockets and invoices, but an examination of those showed recurring spelling errors. It appears that those documents were falsely created in order to cover the offender’s tracks. They failed lamentably.7 This is substantial criminality. The sum involved is significant. The offender apparently spent the money on clothes and speedway cars, at least that is what he told the ATO officers. The offender offended repeatedly, each time having the chance to reflect on what he was doing. 8 He has a criminal history. Most of the matters on it are for assaults or similar matters. He has received a number of bonds over the years, but most of the offences, not all of them, are of some age. There is one matter described as false pretence of title on his criminal history that occurred in 1992 and he was fined $250. So although it is probably an offence involving dishonesty, because of its age and apparent lack of seriousness it has not played a significant part in the sentence I have decided to impose upon the offender.9 The offender described to the author of the pre-sentence report a stable and uneventful upbringing. He had been married for eighteen years but that relationship recently ended. He moved from Sydney for a sea change to Foster in October 2009. He lives with and cares for his seventeen year old niece. There are however alternative arrangements for her care given the likelihood that the offender will receive a full-time custodial sentence.10 The offender completed Year 10 but did not receive his School Certificate. He joined the Army but was medically discharged after he injured his knees. Since then he has been on a disability pension supplemented by an army pension. He has not held any other paid employment but has apparently been a volunteer for the Rural Fire Service in the State Emergency Service for fourteen years.11 When these proceedings began this morning Mr Hanley drew to my attention the circumstance that this matter had been adjourned in order that Justice Health could be asked to provide information to the Court about treatment for what was said to be a myriad of health issues concerning the offender. Mr Hanley commendably told me that he needed to inform me that the Court had been misled, that the claims in medical reports relied on by the offender were false. Statements to the effect that the offender has problems with his liver are not truthful. He does not need a liver transplant in the future. Mr Hanley told me that he was putting these matters, not only as part of his duty of candour, but also on instructions.12 The relevance of this circumstance is this. Of course I must ignore statements in the pre-sentence report which have as their basis material now known to be false, but I cannot ignore what appears to have been an attempt by the offender to mislead the Court when it comes to consider other aspects of the sentencing process such as assessing the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation or considering the extent to which the offender has displayed a willingness to assist the course of justice. On the other hand, if the offender has in fact attempted to pervert the course of justice he could well face charges involving a maximum penalty, higher than the maximum penalty for any of the offences he is facing today. Therefore I will limit my consideration of the matters raised by Mr Hanley this morning in the way I have identified. To summarise, I will not take into account in the offender’s favour material in the pre-sentence report based on statements now known to be false. I will take into account against the offender his attempts to mislead the Court when deciding his prospects of rehabilitation and his willingness to assist the course of justice. Let me deal with those matters now.13 The offender has, from the moment, it would seem, the offences came to the attention of the ATO, attempted to mislead people, firstly, by falsely claiming that a non-existent partner was responsible for the problems; secondly, by claiming that a dog had eaten the relevant paper work and, thirdly, by providing false documents (with spelling mistakes) to ATO officers. Such conduct has persisted. I am therefore unable to say that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. In fact, the history of this matter suggests that his prospects of rehabilitation are poor.14 By his plea of guilty the offender has demonstrated a willingness to assist the course of justice. That is qualified, not only by the circumstance I have been discussing for some time now, but also by statements to the author of the pre-sentence report which indicate, as far as Mr Campbell wants other people to understand, he is only pleading guilty to get it over with and that he may have bumped up the figures a little bit but not to the extent indicated in the statement of facts. Those matters indicate something quite contrary to a genuine acknowledgment of guilt and a willingness to assist the course of justice. Although in ordinary circumstances a plea of guilty in a Commonwealth matter made at the earliest opportunity would usually entitle the offender to a discount of twenty-five per cent, the other circumstances to which I have referred suggest that, in this case, the discount should be less, approximately twenty per cent.15 The objective seriousness of these matters is obvious, as is the need for a substantial sentence, involving a significant component of general deterrence, to be imposed. The point has repeatedly been made that as our taxation arrangements move further and further towards them being based on self-assessment the prospects for fraud are increased. This is a very good example. To a large extent the ATO relied on the honesty of those claiming fuel rebates. It was only, I suspect, the size of the claims made that alerted ATO officers to the potential for fraud to be uncovered. 16 Thus where fraud is discovered, substantial and even harsh sentences need to be imposed. The rather basic idea which flows through the criminal justice system is appropriate here. By imposing a significant sentence on Mr Campbell it is hoped that others in the community who might be tempted, during the process of self-assessment, to lie in order to gain financial advantage, will reflect upon the consequences for them if they do so. 17 I mentioned before that the offender was living with his seventeen year old niece. Mr Hanley concedes that the circumstances involving her are not exceptional such that I can take them into account, except as part of the general mix of subjective factors. I will do that because the offender will know that because of his misconduct she is deprived of his care and will be for a substantial period of time. 18 There clearly has been a significant delay in this matter. Part of it is due to the offender’s attempts to mislead the ATO after they began investigations. Part of it is due to the offender obtaining an adjournment in order to investigate non-existent illnesses. But a large part of the delay is also due to the lack of urgency with which the investigating and prosecuting authorities have moved. This is not a matter where the offender would have been able to sit back thinking that he had got away with things. It is, however, a matter where the offender must have known for many years that this day would eventually come. I will therefore take a large part of the delay into account in favour of the offender.19 There are three matters on the indictment covering the one course of conduct. Of course the mere fact that an offender is to be sentenced for one course of conduct does not mean that concurrent sentences should be imposed. However, in my view, there is little to distinguish the offences, especially counts 1 and 2 which the Crown concedes have been divided up somewhat arbitrarily.20 Having considered the appropriate sentence to impose upon count 2, the most serious of the matters on the indictment, and having then turned to the question of whether there should be accumulation or concurrency, I have applied the principle of totality and I am satisfied that the sentence for count 2, which will be longer than the sentences for counts 1 and 3, is such that no further punishment is required in order to cover those other counts.21 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. 22 On count 1 I set a fixed term of two and a half years to date from 4 June 2010. 23 On count 3 I set a fixed term of six months to date from 4 June 2010. They are fixed terms because of the sentence I will now impose on count 2. 24 On count 2 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment to date from 4 June 2010. I set a non-parole period of three years which will expire on 3 June 2013. I set a head sentence of five years. 25 Mr Campbell that means that you will serve at least three years in custody. The earliest day on which you can be released is 3 June 2013. Whether you are released on that day or not is not a question for me, it is a question for the parole authorities. If you are released on parole you will still continue serving your sentence in the community until the expiry of your sentence which is on 3 June 2015. Do you understand sir. Thank you.26 HIS HONOUR: Anything else Madam Crown, Mr Hanley.27 ZAKI: Yes your Honour. The Crown seeks an order pursuant to s 21B of the Crimes Act which is a reparation order for the amount obtained in the sum of $362,367.25.28 HIS HONOUR: Is that opposed Mr Hanley?29 HANLEY: No your Honour.30 HIS HONOUR: I will make that reparation order.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Stephen Morris pleaded guilty on arraignment to one charge of aggravated break and enter and one charge of break, enter and steal and he is convicted of those charges. He also asked me to take into account four other offences. 2 The aggravated charge carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment, the other, fourteen years. The aggravated offence now attracts a standard non-parole period, but it did not at the time of the offence. In any event, the offender has pleaded guilty, so the standard non- parole period does not apply. COUNT 13 The facts of the offence charged to Count 1 of the indictment are that on Christmas Eve 2001, Mrs V and her two daughters, aged respectively nineteen and five attended a street party. The nineteen year old daughter D went home at about 12.30 on Christmas morning and went to sleep on the sofa in the lounge room downstairs. Mrs V and J, aged five, came home about thirty minutes later. Mrs V turned out all the downstairs lights and put J to bed in an upstairs bedroom. For a short time, she wrapped gifts in her bedroom and then went to bed. Shortly afterwards, she heard noises from the downstairs kitchen. She thought it might be her teenage son, and went back into her bedroom. The noises continued, so she went downstairs and called out four times, still thinking that the noises were caused by her son. No one responded. 4 When she walked into the kitchen, she saw a cigarette glowing in the dark, and she saw a person holding a kitchen knife, with a blade about thirty centimetres long. It is not in dispute that this knife was Mrs V’s property and was in the kitchen when the offender arrived. The person, now known to be the offender, walked towards her and pointed the knife at her stomach. He said, “Don’t move, I will get you if you scream. Give me the money and some valuables. Whatever you can, give me, because I need it for my heroin addiction.” Mrs V replied that she had no money because she was a pensioner. The offender said, “I don’t believe you. You have a nice house, go inside, keep moving.” He was still pointing the knife at her. She walked into the lounge room where her daughter D was asleep. She said to the offender, “Ask my daughter if she has something, she might give you some money.” The offender replied, “No, you’ll have more than that, you’ll have jewellery and other valuables and mobile phones.” Mrs V said, “I don’t have a mobile phone.” 5 The offender held the knife close to the daughter. Mrs V then woke her daughter. The daughter said, “Who is that?” Mrs V replied, “I don’t know, just give him your money D. How much do you have?” D said, “What for?” Mrs V said, “D, we’re being robbed.” D said, “Oh, shit. Okay, I’ll give you money, just wait, I’ll go upstairs.” The offender said, “Okay, I’ll wait down here.”6 The offender took the Nokia mobile phone from the armchair. This was valued at nearly $1,000. D said, “No, that’s all my life in there.” The offender said, “No, I’ll take this. You can have it if you give me money.” D said, “No, please give me my phone back first and I’ll give you the money.” The offender then pointed the knife at D and said, “Don’t move or I’ll hurt you. I know you’re going to call the police but don’t try. If you do nothing I won’t hurt you. Come on, we’ll go upstairs now.” D then gave the offender three rings and the necklace she was wearing. 7 Mrs V and D then went upstairs. The offender followed them, pointing the knife. While in Mrs V’s bedroom, the offender opened the drawers in the dressing table and threw them on the floor. He also looked through a brand new wallet. He took her birthstone ring, valued at about $2,500. He then tipped out the contents of Mrs V’s handbag and D’s wallet. He took a small amount of cash from Mrs V’s handbag, and $80, a credit card and a key card from D’s wallet. D said, “Don’t take my cards.” The offender said, “No, I’ll take it.” He pointed the knife towards D and said, “Give me your pin number.” 8 The offender then forced Mrs V and D to walk back downstairs. Mrs V went back upstairs to try to hide her younger daughter, J’s, necklace, but the offender followed her into J’s bedroom and searched the room. J was asleep in the room at the time. The offender took the necklace from the top of the dressing table, Mrs V said, “Please don’t, this is my little daughter’s room”. The offender said, “No, I’ll take whatever I want to, you have a computer here, I'll take it.” Mrs V said, “No, please, that is my little daughter’s.” The offender did not take the computer. He dropped the cross pendant from the necklace as he was going downstairs. 9 Another young child was asleep in another room but he did not wake during the incident. 10 The offender then tried to open the security screen door but it was locked. Mrs V took a key and said, “Please leave and don’t come back.” The offender said, “I will come back if you try to tell the police and tell them what happened and that I have been here.” He then ran off, taking the kitchen knife with him. 11 D went to neighbours and told them what happened. The neighbours contacted the police. The victims later noted that about thirty CDs valued at about $500 were missing from the house. 12 Police took Mrs V and D to Kings Cross Police Station. D was too distraught to give a statement at the time, but did so later. Mrs V provided a statement, describing the offender as being six feet tall, skinny build, sun-tanned skin, Australian, thirty to thirty-five years old, with short, fair to brownish hair and needle marks on his inner elbows. She also provided a description for the preparation of a ‘COMFIT’, and this description was consistent with the offender’s appearance. 13 It is not in dispute that, later that day, the offender was detained by a neighbour after he had broken into a unit in Waverley. He was taken to Waverley Police Station, where there was a struggle.14 On Christmas Day, police attended Mrs V’s house and found a fingerprint on the inside of the kitchen window, upside down, consistent with a person climbing over the sill. Fingerprints were also developed on the kitchen sink. It was discovered, some years later, that those fingerprints matched those of the offender. When the offender was arrested in May 2005, on other charges, fresh fingerprints were taken from him, and there was a new system of recording fingerprints in operation. Subsequently, the computer identified a possible match. 15 The offender denied the offences when he was charged. At that time he was also charged with the offence of armed robbery on DV. He was arrested on this charge on 10 October 2006, and committed for trial in May 2007. Up until that time, he indicated that he would defend the charges. Earlier this year, he did plead guilty, in circumstances that I shall describe later. As part of the negotiations, when he pleaded guilty to the offence in Count 1, the prosecution agreed that the armed robbery on DV would be taken into account on a Form 1, and that is before me. 16 The other Form 1 offence to be taken into account on Count 1 was committed on 21 October 2005, that is, at approximately the same time as the two Form 1 offences in relation to the Count 2 matter. The offence was committed - and that is the Form 1 matter - between 8.30am and 1pm. The house was ransacked, and a gold ring worth about a thousand dollars was stolen. The offender was detected because he left a blood-stained piece of paper towel under the bed in the house. DNA was taken from this, and compared with DNA from a buccal sample that the offender provided to the police. The offender was arrested and charged with this offence on 4 October 2007, that is, after he had been arraigned for the other offences. 17 I am also asked to take into account an offence committed on 28 January 2002. One of the offences on a Form 1, attached to Count 1, was committed at about the same time as the Count 2 offence and the other offences on a Form 1 attaching to that offence. COUNT 218 Mrs KM left her home in Killara, at about 9.30am on 23 September 2005. She returned about an hour later. Before leaving, she ensured that all windows and doors were locked. When she returned, she entered via a rear door, and, as she walked up an internal staircase, she saw some bags had been tipped over. She also noticed that the glass panel on French doors, at the front of the house, had been smashed. She inspected the house and found drawers in her bedroom had been emptied onto the floor, that cupboards had been opened and that property from the other bedrooms had been thrown on the floor. She contacted the police. She found that the following property had been stolen: one Olympus camera, a pair of binoculars and four pairs of earrings, in total valued at about $2,000. When police attended, they found a fingerprint on a plastic box that had been moved in a bedroom. This was later identified as being identical to that of the offender.19 The break, enter and steal offences on the Form 1 occurred at Haberfield on 17 October 2005, between 2am and 1pm, and at Newtown, the next day, between 8.40am and 3pm. Both were attributed to the offender, because fingerprints obtained at each crime scene were identified as being his. 20 The circumstances of this case are most unusual, because of the delays, and the manner in which the offender was charged. This offender has a very long history of break, enter and steal offences. Since he was arrested in June 2002, on matters subsequently dealt with by the Drug Court, he has spent over five years in custody, having been sentenced for other similar offences, and sentenced to terms of imprisonment in respect of them. On 7 August 2002, he was dealt with in the Drug Court, and received a number of concurrent sentences. He failed to complete the Drug Court program, and received a term of full-time imprisonment. On 20 September 2004, he was sentenced to a further fixed term of one year’s imprisonment for a similar offence of break, enter and steal. This sentence was due to expire on the same date as the non-parole period, for what I will refer to as the Drug Court offences. That date was 19 September 2005, and the offence was, in fact, an aggravated break, enter and steal. 21 On 18 May 2005, he was charged with the offence committed on 28 January 2002. I am told by the prosecution that this matter was not charged for some time, because of the delays in the processes of the government analytical laboratory, which prevented the offender’s DNA to be matched with DNA found at the crime scene, until shortly before that time. The delay is otherwise unexplained. 22 I have noticed a practice whereby police apparently wait until just before the expiry of a non-parole period, or the fixed term of a sentence, before arresting people currently in custody for past offences. If this practice is conscious, or an official or unofficial policy of the police, it flies in the face of popular concepts of justice and, as it is a form of extrajudicial punishment, the courts will not stand for it. It may well be, however, that the delay in this case may be explained by a backlog in the government analytical laboratories, but that type of explanation is not feasible to explain the delay following a match, in August 2005, of a fingerprint found in Mrs V’s house, with the fingerprints of the offender. 23 I am told by the prosecution that shortly after the 2001 offence, police attempted to match this fingerprint, but the technology then available did not enable it to be matched with the offender’s fingerprints, which were already on file. By August 2005, the police had available to them a fresh set of fingerprints from the offender, and new technology. A fingerprint match was made at that time but, as I have already pointed out, the offender was not charged with this offence until 10 October 2006, that is, some fifteen months after the police had the information available to them.24 The offender was released on parole on 19 September 2005, after serving the non-parole period for the drug-related offences and the fixed term. The date of his release was after the police had already matched his fingerprints with those taken from Mrs V’s house. 25 He was at liberty until 2005, when he was arrested and charged with goods in custody. He was, in fact, on bail, on parole, or both, at the time of all the offences now before the Court, other than the V offence, and, as I have said, he has otherwise been in custody, apart from that period in 2005, continuously since June 2002. He was, ultimately, sentenced to a fixed term of six months for the goods in custody offence. 26 He was only at liberty from 19 September until 2 November 2005, that is, about six weeks. During this time, he committed the second charge on the indictment and three offences that are on Form 1. On 3 November 2005, that is, the day after his arrest, his parole was revoked, although it is not clear to me what the basis of the revocation was.27 All these offences are objectively serious. The several break and enter offences involve entry to premises and stealing, admittedly during daylight hours, when each of the premises was empty. The property stolen was not particularly valuable, but was certainly not insubstantial. Each of these was a crime which, unfortunately, is typical of the offences committed by some people with drug addictions, in order to obtain more drugs. The offences are more significant because of the offender’s long record of similar offences.28 The V offence is even more serious. It involved the threat of violence, and the victims were vulnerable. There were young children in the house. However, there was no evidence that either the break and enter or the armed robbery of the elements of this offence were planned. The offender picked up the knife in the kitchen; he did not bring it with him. He says the offence was out of character, in that it involved violence, and it was at night, and that there were people in the house. There are no precisely similar previous offences which involve the threat of violence. 29 In each case, the offences on the Form 1, and there are several of them, require that the sentences be weighted accordingly. The offences on the indictment, therefore, cannot be regarded in isolation. 30 General deterrence is an important factor to be considered when sentencing for this type of offence. The courts must make it clear to the community that the offenders, especially repeat offenders, cannot expect leniency. Personal deterrence is also important, especially in the case where the offender has such a long record of break and enter offences. 31 In this case, the offender has given evidence that the offences were closely connected to his addictions, and that his attempts at rehabilitation have not succeeded completely. In the past, he seems to have relapsed into drug use, and re-offended rapidly after his release from custody. However, in this case, for reasons I shall explain, I am satisfied that there are some prospects for rehabilitation, in spite of the offender’s record.32 Mr Morris is now forty-one years old. He was born in the United Kingdom and then grew up in Australia from the age of three. His family was with the Air Force and the offender spent much of his childhood in Malaysia. After he returned to the Australian Capital Territory, he did not find the environment as positive as Malaysia. He began to commit offences, and to use alcohol and other drugs. From the age of thirteen, he spent time in juvenile institutions. After his release he went home, but he left home at age fifteen. By sixteen he was addicted to amphetamines, by eighteen, to heroin. When he was twenty-eight, he formed a relationship with a woman, who gave birth to their son whilst he was in custody, but who died shortly afterwards from a heroin overdose. The son is now twelve, and lives with the offender’s mother in Queensland. 33 In 1996 he was released to parole and moved to Western Australia, where he attempted to get a job in the mining industry. There, he formed a relationship with a woman, Kerry, and this relationship lasted some six years. They have a daughter, who is now nine. Although he wanted to marry Kerry, she had some reservations. The offender became depressed, and started using benzodiazepines. He relapsed into break and enter offences, and was returned to prison. Kerry waited for him for some time. Shortly before his planned date of release, as I have indicated, he was charged with outstanding offences. Kerry decided that she could no longer wait, and moved to Queensland with the daughter. 34 During his periods of release, the offender has worked in several occupations. Since 2002, while he has been in custody, he has completed a number of vocational courses. He is now, I think, qualified to work as a landscape gardener. He says that he did these courses in preparation for his release to parole, and starting a new life. 35 I have, in evidence, a report from Ms Suzanne Freeman, a forensic psychologist. The offender said on oath that what he told the psychologist was true. According to her, he has now developed considerable insight into the reasons for his criminal behaviour and his addiction. This is in large measure due to the short-term drug and alcohol courses he has completed whilst in custody. Ms Freeman concludes,  
     
      
      “For Stephen to make real changes in his life, he requires long-term structured drug rehabilitation that will allow him a supervised and gradual return to the community. He would also benefit from some individual counselling to deal with his abandonment issues, and to learn strategies to deal with anxiety. Educational programs that emphasise pro-social problem solving, anger management, social and general life skills and the role-playing of alternate coping strategies would also assist in his general rehabilitation.” 
      
    36 The offender has said on oath that he has not used heroin since 2005, and he is now on a methadone program. He said this has enabled him to think clearly. As I have already pointed out, it is clear that, on two separate occasions, this offender has been charged with old offences shortly before he was to be released on parole. The first was in May 2005, and the second was in October 2006. 37 At the time of all these offences, the offender was addicted to several prohibited drugs, most notably amphetamines and heroin. He was addicted to them before he went into custody late in 2005. There is no reason to doubt that he was affected by drugs at the time of each of the offences I am now considering. That is not an excuse, but it is a relevant factor.38 Before the offences, including the Drug Court offences and the aggravated break and enter, to which he has now pleaded guilty, although the offender was using illicit substances, he was in a steady, full-time relationship with a woman, and they had a small daughter. For the first, sustained period of his life, he was not charged with offences for a significant time. The breakdown in this relationship was instrumental in his relapse into drug abuse and crime. 39 During the periods he was in custody after 2002, the offender kept in touch with his partner Kerry, and, on two separate occasions, formed the plan, that upon his release to parole, he would join her and their child. While he was in custody, however, she moved to Queensland. When he was released from parole in September 2005, he could not go to Queensland, because it was a condition of his parole that he not leave New South Wales and, indeed, that he live at Hope House at Parramatta. This is apparently a hostel operated by the Salvation Army. 40 The offender had no other support during this period. Because his partner had gone to Queensland, he had no contact with anyone capable of giving him support, and he fell rapidly into heroin use again. During this period, he committed the second offence on the indictment, and three Form 1 offences. He had been looking forward to release at the end of the fixed term, when he was charged with the aggravating offence currently before the Court. This, again, destroyed his rehabilitation plans. He described himself as being shattered. 41 The offender pleaded guilty to the 2005 offence on the indictment, at the first opportunity, and he readily admitted the other offences committed at this time. 42 He gave evidence on oath that he had no memory of the Woolloomooloo offence at Mrs V’s house. When the police told him that he was being charged with this offence, he did not believe them. He said that this offence was totally out of character for him, for three reasons. First, he never committed break and enter offences at night, secondly, he always checked premises and never broke in if people were home, and third, he never used a weapon. In fact, his record contains two convictions for break and enter premises at night, and one for break and enter, aggravated by the fact that people were in the premises, but, apart from the V offence, the other offences before me were committed in daytime. 43 He has a number of assault convictions, one of which arose from the scuffle when he was arrested at Waverley in 2002. He maintained on oath, under cross-examination, that he had no memory of the V offence at all. He had vague memories of the subsequent break and enters at Waverley, for which he was arrested, and he vaguely remembers a scuffle with police outside the Waverley Police Station. In this sense, I find more probably than not, that the offender had no memories of the V offence. He, therefore, should not be penalised for refusing to plead guilty to an offence, of which he had no knowledge. It emerged, in the course of his evidence, that he did not become convinced of his guilt, until after his present counsel was instructed, and had discussed the brief of evidence with him. 44 As a result of the legal advice he received then, he decided to offer to plead guilty, on certain conditions, and those conditions were accepted by the prosecution. 45 There was a further reason why he should not have been expected to plead guilty. He was originally charged with three offences; aggravated break and enter and two armed robberies. The aggravated break and enter, and at least one of the armed robbery charges appeared, at least on their face, to be duplicitous. 46 The consequence of this is that, because he did not plead guilty at the earliest opportunity, he will not be entitled to the maximum discount for his plea, but the plea still has considerable utilitarian value, because the witnesses were not required to give distressing evidence, about an event that had occurred nearly five years before the offender was arrested.47 This situation is quite different from that discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kay [2004] NSWCCA 330, where the Court was of the view that the respondent, in that case, had not pleaded guilty from a conscious desire to avoid prosecution for the offence, and a hope that it, or his complicity in it, would not be discovered. The Court seemed satisfied that there was a conscious refusal to disclose this matter to the police. I am satisfied that the offender’s belief that he had not committed the offence was genuine, as was his assertion that he had and retains no memory of the events. 48 The delay and pressure caused by the late laying of additional charges in this case is exceptional. Delay has been considered by appellate courts many times. It has clearly made the offender’s time in custody more onerous than would otherwise have been the case, and this is an important consideration. 49 Even though I must allow for the issue of totality, in determining the total sentence that must be imposed in respect of the matters to which the offender has now pleaded guilty, I must not lose sight of the fact that those offences are such that, if he had been charged in a timely way, that is, without undue delay, the offences that took place in 2001 would have probably been dealt with at the same time as the drug offences in 2002. If so, they may possibly have increased both the non-parole period and the total term, which the offender was then required to serve, but this would not have been significant in relation to the total length of the sentence. Again, the 2005 matters on the indictment and the Form 1, if charged in a timely way, might well have been dealt with in connection with other matters, for which the offender was sentenced in 2006.50 To have those matters dealt with now, rather than at the same time as the offences which are similar in nature and seriousness, increases the possibility that the offender would be required to serve a longer period in custody, than would otherwise have been the case. 51 As I have indicated, the circumstances are significantly different, in my view, from those which faced the sentencing court in Kay. In that case, at paragraph 33, McColl JA, with whom the other judges agreed, emphasised that regard must be had to the circumstances of the particular case. I accept the submissions of the defence, that the principal guideline, for me, is provided by the Court of Appeal decision in Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517, approved by the High Court in Mill (1988) 166 CLR 59.52 In Todd, the Court discussed some previous authorities, in which there appeared to be a conflict of opinion as to the effect of delay. I do not think any of those authorities is directly in point. It may be that some remarks in Bragias (1997) 92 A Crim R 330 are to the effect that, where the delay is due to an offender exercising his right to put the prosecution to proof of the charges, he may not be entitled to any benefit, but this was not the view of Simpson J, and she affirmed her views in Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267, where Studdert J agreed with her. This approach also appears to have been adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Wong (2002) 137 ACR 120. With respect, I adopt and apply the views of Simpson J. 53 In any event, the offender in this case never denied his guilt of any of the offences before the Court except the V offence, where, given his genuine lack of memory, and the other reasons I have mentioned, he had good reasons to put the prosecution to proof. As Street CJ said in Todd, at 519-520, 
     
      
      “Preferably, one would hope that, in the orderly administration of justice within this State, all offences would have come before the same judge on the one occasion. But assuming they came before separate New South Wales judges, it would be a question for a second judge to evaluate what was the field open to be entered in sentencing for the Sydney crimes. It would be both relevant and material to pay regard to the totality of the imprisonment being visited on the appellant, in consequence of the totality of his criminality over this period of eight days of committing offences of similar character...Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstances that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.” 
      
    54 In this case, the offences committed by the offender were largely of the same character, and were committed over two short periods of a few weeks each, late 2001 to early 2002 and September to early November 2005. The reasons for the delay in Todd and Mill -  custody in another state - are different from those in the case before me, but it is clear that the principal criterion, as to whether delay should be considered in determining the length of sentence, is hardship, or at least the perception of hardship to the offender ; see Wong (2002) 137 ACR 120. There is no doubt that in this case there is actual, as well as perceived, hardship.55 It is also clear from Gower(1991) 56 A Crim R 115, that delay may, in some cases, amount to ‘special circumstances’ for the purposes of the sentencing legislation. Although that case has stood for some years, it is perfectly consistent with later authority. While an offender should not receive a double benefit, the issue of delay is relevant, both to findings of special circumstances and to the issue of totality. 56 Count 1 of the V offence is extremely serious. The Form 1 offences must be taken into account. Although I do not consider that the 'guideline judgment' of Henry [1999] New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal is directly in point, because the prosecutor raised it in his submissions, and because one Form 1 offence was an armed robbery, it may offer some guidance. 57 The offences on the indictment were committed at distinct times, and, even having regard to the principle of totality, there must be a degree of accumulation. The sentences will be back-dated to account for the time the offender has actually spent in custody on these matters. The Count 1 offence will be dealt with under the law relating to sentencing, as it was at the time of the offence. 58 I find special circumstances, because of factors which have not affected the head sentence, including the principle of totality, and my finding that the offender has substantial prospects of rehabilitation, and I will vary the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence accordingly. 59 On Count 2 there will be a maximum discount of twenty-five per cent for the early plea of guilty, and taking into account the matters on Form 1, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of two years imprisonment, commencing on 1 November 2005 and expiring on 31 October 2007 and a total term of three years expiring on 31 October 2008. On Count 1 there will be a discount of twenty per cent for the plea of guilty. The head sentence takes into account the age of the offence. The fact that this offence was committed in 2001 means that the head sentence is considerably less than it would have been if the offence had been recent. Again, taking into account the Form 1 matters, the offender is sentenced - and I have to express this in a different way, because the law was different at that time - to six and a half years imprisonment, commencing 1 May 2006 and expiring on 31 October 2012. There will be a non- parole period of three years and six months, expiring 31 October 2009, and an additional term of three years. So the first day that he is eligible for parole will be 31 October 2009. 60 This sentence is one of which, in my view, meets the criteria for a compulsory drug treatment order and I direct that this matter be referred to the Drug Court for the appropriate assessment.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Trent Madden appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence in company. The offence was committed on 16 March 2008 but Mr Madden only appears for sentence today, 5 November 2010, that delay primarily being due to the length of time between when the Division of Analytical Laboratories received relevant material and when they notified the police of a match between the blood stain they tested and the DNA of this offender. In the meantime the offender had served a sentence for an unrelated matter and had been released only shortly before being arrested for this matter.2 I have begun these remarks by referring to his circumstances because of the injustice that can be caused to an offender when inadequate resources are provided to the Division of Analytical Laboratories, such that offenders stand to be sentenced for offences they have committed some considerable time before. In some cases, although this is not one of them, offenders are completely different people, having rehabilitated themselves by the time they stand for sentence for an old offence. I have borne in mind to a significant extent that Mr Madden stands for sentence today for an offence committed a fair while ago.3 As I mentioned that offence was committed on 16 March 2008. On that day, the offender, together with an unknown female companion, smashed their way into the Australia Post office at about 10pm. Whilst inside they removed a large number of items, hard drives, printers, SIM cards, games, as well as a number of tickets to the Royal Easter Show. When police attended they discovered a piece of paper containing a red/brown stain. It was labelled “set up guide” and found behind the counter of the Australia Post office near a security door. It was this item which was later analysed by DAL and the offender’s DNA found upon it. It appears that the Crown relied exclusively on that DNA evidence in proving that the offender was one of the two people involved in the offence, with the faces of the people in the CCTV footage obtained from the shop being insufficiently clear to prosecute. As I mentioned the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I impose upon him will be twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been.4 The offender has a significantly lengthy criminal history, although it has to be said for offences less serious than that committed by the offender on 16 March 2008. He comes from a loving and supportive family; he is one of ten children. His mother and father are both in court today, his father having given evidence in support of his son earlier on. Mr Madden was a talented footballer as he was growing up. He went to Cleveland High School where he excelled in football. He was playing alongside Nathan Merritt and other current first grade rugby league players. If he had stayed on the right path it is likely that he, too, would now be playing first grade rugby league. Unfortunately he did not stay on the right path.5 He left school in Year 10 and began messing and mixing with the wrong crowd. He continued playing rugby league as well as doing a TAFE course, but the partying that came with his rugby league companions led to him drinking a lot of alcohol, and smoking marijuana, smoking heroin until eventually, in more recent times, he began injecting heroin. As might be expected for someone with that history of alcohol and drug abuse he does have a lengthy criminal history, as he obtained money to buy drugs to support his habit.6 I mentioned before that he comes from a supportive and loving family. His father spoke of the terrible dilemma that he and his wife were in as they saw their son going off the rails. At one stage they thought that perhaps it would be best for their son to actually go to gaol. They even contemplated ringing police themselves in order to bring home to the offender the seriousness of the path that he was heading on. Despite many opportunities and attempts at rehabilitation these have all failed with him returning to illegal drug use and the commission of further crimes.7 He is now, as his father and he himself recognise, getting too old for behaving like this. He has wasted his life thus far. Not only has he wasted his potential to be a first grade rugby league player but in broader terms, spending as much time as he has in gaol has prevented him having long term meaningful relationships, and prevented him from being a family man, both opportunities which he now wishes to seize, so that he can do much better in the future.8 It is truly a waste for the offender to have spent more than four years in custody out of the last six years. On the other hand it is important that the offender is punished for what he has done. It is important that he understands through the imposition of a sentence which will personally deter him from further misconduct in the future, that if he is going to continue committing crimes, he is going to continue going to gaol. It is important that the community also understand that those who do the wrong thing, as the offender has done, are significantly punished, so that others in Mr Madden’s position will be deterred if they too wish to use drugs and then wish to support their drug habit through the commission of crimes.9 It is to be noted that this offence carries with it a standard non parole period of five years, nor is it to be overlooked that the maximum penalty for this offence is twenty years imprisonment. This is, as both of those figures indicate, a serious offence. 10 Mr Karim handed to me Judicial Commission statistics regarding the sentences that have been imposed in the District Court for offences of this kind. They revealed some remarkable circumstances. Of 449 people sentenced to imprisonment since the imposition of the standard non parole period for offences of this kind, not a single person has received a non parole period longer than the standard non parole period and only one per cent, five people out of 449, have received the standard non parole period. In part, that may well be due to the circumstance that most of the people dealt with for that offence have been dealt with for aggravated break, enter and steal. The standard non parole period which is of course appropriate to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, would thus be more likely to be imposed for an offence where the indictable offence committed after breaking and entering is a more serious one. 11 Even with that qualification it is remarkable that the intention of the legislature does not appear to have been met. That said, I must regard the Judicial Commission statistics as providing guidance to me as to the sentence I should impose upon the offender. It was said by the High Court in R v Lowe [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 that inconsistency in sentencing is a badge of unfairness and whilst it is commonly thought that the High Court was only speaking about co-offenders in that decision, anyone who reads the case will realise that the High Court was speaking in wider terms. For those reasons, as I have said, I will be guided by the Judicial Commission’s statistics despite the remarkable features of them that I have mentioned.12 It is my task of course to assess the objective seriousness of the offender’s misconduct and compare it those offences in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type. I have already mentioned that the offence committed after breaking and entering, that is larceny, is less serious than many other indictable offences that can be committed after breaking and entering. I should also say that the circumstance of aggravation relied on by the Crown in this case, that is that the offender is in company, is also one of the less serious circumstances of aggravation covered by the section. On the other hand I do take into account that entry was gained to the shop by the offender smashing the front door and that the quantity of property taken was significant, not so much in dollar terms but in the large number of separate items taken. I therefore find that in objective terms the offence is slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of this type. 13 The offender, clearly wishes to put his life of crime behind him. He told me in evidence today of his goals, one of which is to get an apprenticeship and get a job. He does not want to be doing this in his thirties. He is now twenty-six years of age. He is in a relationship with a young woman, despite him being in custody and his father spoke well of the benefits of the offender being in that relationship. The offender expressed his remorse in evidence and has written a letter to the owner of the post office saying that he is sorry for what he has done. I will accept that the offender is remorseful. I accept that he committed this offence under the influence of drugs and was motivated by the desire to obtain further drugs. The offence was not planned to any great extent, probably because it was committed whilst he was under the influence of drugs. The offender had nothing to cover his hands. He seems to have ignored the CCTV.14 It was Mr Karim’s primary submission that having been in custody for just short of one year I should impose a sentence upon the offender which sees him being released today so that further rehabilitation can take place in the community. I have given anxious consideration as to whether I should do what Mr Karim asks. The primary reasons that I will not do what Mr Karim submitted that I should relate to the length of the standard non parole period and the length of the maximum penalty which the legislature has provided. 15 In view of the offender’s continuing attitude of disobedience to the law, in view of the absence of demonstrated rehabilitation, in view of the objective gravity of what he did on this occasion and in view of, as I have just mentioned, the standard non parole period and the maximum penalty of twenty years, a non parole period of less than one year would be significantly and manifestly inadequate. I repeat what I said earlier. The offender needs to be personally deterred from further offences of this kind and to let him out today would be insufficient, in my view, to achieve that objective, let alone the other objectives that I must bear in mind in determining the appropriate sentence for the offender.16 As I think I mentioned, the offender has much to contribute to society if he can put his life of crime behind him but given the regularity of his offending it is not going to be at all easy and thus personal deterrence plays a significant part. Were I to release the offender today, not only would that be inadequate as I have mentioned, but it would not have the effect of showing the offender what he needs to be shown, that is as he continues to commit offences he will continue to go to gaol for longer and longer periods.17 I have borne in mind very much Mr Karim’s submission there is a risk of the offender becoming institutionalised. That is, unfortunately, a necessary risk that occurs when people commit regular offences. I have borne in mind also that had he been arrested for this offence soon after it was committed he might have served the sentence for this offence concurrently with others he has served in the meantime. One difficulty however with accepting what Mr Karim said about that issue was that I do not know anything about those other offences and so when applying the principle of totality as I must I am hampered by the fact that I know nothing about the other offences for which he was sent to gaol.18 I have also taken into account, both in finding special circumstances and in determining the length of the head sentence, that the offender has spent a very short time in the community before he was re-arrested on this matter on 30 November 2009 and to a large extent he will be serving sentences in effect cumulatively.19 For all of those reasons,this is the sentence that I propose to impose. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of two and a half years to date from 30 November 2009. It will expire on 29 May 2012. I set an overall term of four and a half years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 29 May 2012. He is referred to the Drug Court for determination as to his suitability for a compulsory drug treatment order.

   JUDGMENT 1. HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff Michael David Foley has sued the defendant David Gregory Radford for certain defamatory written statements that the defendant made about him. They appear in three matters complained of. The first was sent to Ms PJ Staunton, Chief Magistrate, on 25 January 2002, in a letter of four pages. The second to Brook Burke of Bartercard Legal Services in a fax together with a copy of the letter to Ms PJ Staunton. The fax is dated 29 January 2002. The third is a letter of 18 September 2002 to Ms Kim Cull president of the Law Society of New South Wales. That is a letter of twenty-three pages, together with a bundle of attachments which are greater than a centimetre in thickness.2. On 26 October 2006 Judge Gibson of this court gave judgment under s 7A of the Defamation Act about the imputations which arose and which were defamatory. Because of the length of the various matters complained of I am not going to set them out in detail in this judgment, rather, I will simply refer to the findings of her Honour about the imputations in the judgment. The imputations which her Honour found arose in relation to the first matter complained of are in paragraph 4(a) to (f) of the statement of claim. 3. They are as follows: 
     
     “(a) That the plaintiff abused the process of the courts. 
      
     (b) That the plaintiff was dishonest in his dealings with legal practitioners and unrepresented litigants. 
      
     (c) That the plaintiff was unfit to be an officer of the court. 
      
     (d) That the plaintiff lied to a judicial officer. 
      
     (e) That the plaintiff was deceitful. 
      
     (f) That the plaintiff conducted himself unethically in his practice of the law.” 
      
    4. Her Honour found that those imputations were defamatory of the plaintiff.5. In relation to the second matter complained of her Honour found that imputations 7(a) to (e) arose. They are: 
     
     “(a) That the plaintiff unduly delayed and frustrated the efficient administration of justice. 
      
     (b) That the plaintiff lied to a judicial officer. 
      
     (c) That the plaintiff was dishonest in his dealings with legal practitioners and unrepresented litigants. 
      
     (d) That the plaintiff was a dishonest person generally. 
      
     (e) The plaintiff was not to be believed.” 
      
    6. Her Honour found that they were defamatory.7. In relation to the third matter complained of her Honour found that imputations in paras 10(a) to (g) arose. They are: 
     
     “(a) The plaintiff was a liar. 
      
     (b) The plaintiff abused the process of the courts. 
      
     (c) The plaintiff was deceitful. 
      
     (d) That the plaintiff unduly delayed and frustrated the course of legal proceedings. 
      
     (e) That the plaintiff acted in a manner contrary to his duties and responsibilities as a legal practitioner. 
      
     (f) That the plaintiff was not a fit and proper person to be a legal practitioner. 
      
     (g) That the plaintiff conspired with his client to pervert the course of justice.” 
    8. When the matter came on before me last week there were documents in the form of two defences. After submissions from both parties I struck out the earlier of those documents. Essentially that disposed of any defence of truth or justification and any defence of qualified privilege. I then dealt with the second defence which was a long and rambling document. I did not strike it out but it seemed to me that arising from that document there may have been a defence in relation to the third matter complained of under ss 17F and 17J of the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW). I allowed that defence to proceed. 9. During the course of evidence, which I will come to in a moment, it also became clear that the information upon which the defendant claimed that there had been a defence of truth, was totally inadequate to establish any truth or justification. Section 17F provides: 
     
     “There is a defence of absolute privilege for a publication to or by the Legal Services Commission of New South Wales constituted under the  
     Legal Services Commission Act  
     1979, an officer of that Commission or a committee established under that Act if the publication is made for the purpose of the execution or administration of that Act.” 
    10. Section 17J, for present purposes, reads: 
     
     “(1) There is a defence of absolute privilege: 
      
      (a) For a publication to or by any of the following: 
       
       (iv) The Law Society Council, 
        
       (v) a member of the Law Society Council as such a member, 
        
       (vi) a committee or sub-committee of the Law Society Council, or any member of a committee or sub-committee of the Law Society Council, 
        
       ... 
        
       (viii) the Law Society, 
        
       (ix) the Legal Services Commission, 
        
       ... 
       
      for the purpose of making or referral of a complaint, or the investigation, hearing or review of a complaint, under Pt 10 of the  
      Legal Profession Act 
       1987.” 
      
    11. It is important to note the words in s 17F of the Act which read: 
     
     “If the publication is made for the purpose of the execution or administration of that Act.” 
    12. And the words in s 17J: 
     
     “for the purpose of making or referral of a complaint, or the investigation, hearing or review of a complaint, under Pt 10 of the  
     Legal Profession Act 
      1987.” 
    13. In Rajski v Carson (1988) 15 NSWLR 84 the Court of Appeal dealt with the meaning of the words in s 17F that I have referred to. The Court of Appeal said that  
     
     “the defence of absolute privilege which applies, pursuant to s 17 
     F 
      of the  
     Defamation Act 
      1974, to the publication to an officer of the Legal Aid Commission “if the publication is made for the purpose of the execution or administration” of the  
     Legal Aid Commission Act 
      1979, is available only where the clear and unassailable objective of the correspondent to the Commission is “the execution or administration” of that Act”. 
    14. The court further said where other purposes or objectives are shown to be arguable issues in fact the resolution of those issues must be left to be tried by a jury or by a judge alone. In this case this trial was proceeding by judge alone and I must now proceed to deal with the matter as a factual matter to be tried by me. At 95 the majority of the court gave their conclusions and said: 
     
     “In the present state of the evidence, if we had to determine the matter, we would be inclined to conclude that the “purpose” of the respondents in writing as they did was mixed. It might have involved all of the purposes or motives mentioned in these reasons. If one “purpose” only had to be chosen, we would be inclined to agree that the respondents have shown (the onus being upon them) that, in a general way, their purpose was the “execution or administration” of the  
     Legal Aid Commission Act 
     .” 
    15. The court went on to say that they were dealing with the matter at the level of whether it should be left to the jury and therefore they should not make any final decision. It is important for me to note however that where there is a mixed purpose I have to determine whether in that mixed purpose the general purpose or the purpose in a general way is the execution and administration of in this case the Legal Services Commission Act. I will come to that test later.16. In order for me to determine the issues it is necessary to look at the background relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. It would seem that the defendant, a man called Gregory Huxley, and a man Lawton, were defendants in defamation proceedings brought by one Sengos. Bush Bourke and Co solicitors represented the three men. At some time in or about July 1997 Huxley apparently terminated Bush Bourke and Co’s retainer. In about late September 1997 Huxley instructed the plaintiff to act for him in the Sengos defamation proceedings. At that time, as I understand it from the evidence, the defendant continued to instruct Bush Bourke and Co to act for him in the Sengos defamation proceedings. The defendant said in his evidence, which I will come to later, that Huxley said to him that he, Huxley, would pay the fees. On or about 27 January 2000 the plaintiff accepted instructions from Huxley to act on his behalf in a local court matter. Radford had issued a statement of liquidated claim against Huxley. Radford claimed that Huxley owed certain monies to him which were legal fees that Radford, the defendant, had undertaken to pay on Huxley’s behalf in the Sengos defamation matter. In evidence before me the Plaintiff said that Huxley denied any such arrangement to him. 17. The proceedings commenced at the Newtown Local Court but were later transferred to the Downing Centre Local Court and became 7969/2000. Not long after the commencement of the Radford local court matter against Huxley the plaintiff said that he began to receive letters from Mr Radford. He described them in certain terms but the terms of those letters were not before me and do not concern me. Mr Foley said that the proceedings between Radford and Huxley were set down on 10 October 2001 for directions and possibly subpoenas. Mr Radford challenges that, and I will come to his evidence later. Mr Foley said that he spoke to Huxley and told Huxley that he could not get to the court on 10 October and could someone else get there for him. Huxley then contacted a firm, Craddock Murray and Newman. This was a firm unknown to Mr Foley. Bernadette Power, apparently an employed solicitor at Craddock Murray and Newman appeared on 10 October. She arranged for a new date. Apparently there had been a date previously set of 26 October for hearing. When Ms Power turned up at the court she arranged for new date being 3 December. Mr Foley was advised by Ms Power of the new date 3 December and did not attend the court on the morning of 26 October. Mr Foley said that on 26 October he went to see clients at Paddington. He said that some time after twelve he was driving past the Downing Centre Local Court and he decided to check on the status of the matter and what its list position was. He said he arrived at the court at about 12.30. He said he found Mr Radford in the local court before Mr Lulham local court magistrate. Mr Foley said he told Mr Lulham what had occurred and Mr Lulham told Mr Foley to get a copy of the agent’s letter. Mr Foley did not have a copy of the agent’s letter with him. The agent’s letter quite clearly said that the matter had been stood over to 3 December. Mr Foley said that after Mr Lulham told him to get a copy of the letter he contacted Mr Huxley’s office. Mr Huxley’s office had a copy of the letter and they forwarded a copy of the letter by fax. He said he also made contact with Craddock Murray and Newman and got the phone number of Ms Powers. He telephoned her and asked her to come to court but she said she could not come that afternoon as she had other engagements. He rang her again later and asked her to come and she said that she would try. The proceedings resumed after two o'clock and Mr Foley said that he tendered the letter to the magistrate and showed a copy to Mr Radford. He said that Mr Lulham accepted the letter, made no comment, and adjourned the matter for further call-over on 10 December 2001 and awarded costs to Mr Radford of $390. 18. Essentially Mr Radford did not accept that the letter was genuine. He thought that there was something wrong that had taken place in the changing of the date. Mr Radford himself gave evidence and gave a great deal of detail about the relationship between himself and Mr Huxley and how he had helped Mr Huxley in many of Mr Huxley’s dealings. I need not deal with all of the evidence that Mr Radford gave. According to him Mr Huxley said that he would pay the costs of Craig Laughton and as to the other legal costs “they would split the rest”. Mr Radford said that Mr Huxley made many promises to pay the fees right up until the end of the Sengos defamation hearing. The Sengos defamation hearing ended in settlements against of the various defendants at different times. The last settlement as I understand it being against Mr Huxley.19. Mr Radford said that he commenced the case against Mr Huxley in the Newtown local court on about 6 January 2000. He said that he went to the court next on 15 February 2000 and asked if a defence had been filed. He said there was no note of any defence being filed but there was a note that Mr Huxley had rung the court to ask if it was legal to serve a statement of claim by post. Mr Radford obtained a default judgment against Mr Huxley in default of the defence. He also obtained an execution and seizure order ex parte. On 27 April 2000 however a motion to set aside the default judgment was served on him. The next step was in July 2000 when the motion for setting aside the default judgment was transferred to the Downing Centre court. Mr Foley was appearing for Mr Huxley and served the request for particulars. The matter apparently dragged on, and in July 2002 Mr Foley and Mr Radford attended the Registrar’s court at court 5.9 in the Downing Centre local court and there was a timetable arranged with dates for exchange of statements and subpoenas. Mr Radford said at that time the hearing was set down for 26 July at 9.30am. 20. Mr Radford said that on 5 October he checked with the registry to see if there were any subpoenae outstanding. He said that on 26 October at 9.30 he attended court, believing that the case was to be heard on that day. He waited half an hour. He then went before Mr Lulham. Mr Lulham asked if he, Mr Radford, had a statement of payments for the claim. Mr Radford said that he had a part statement and Mr Lulham told him to come back at 12.45 with the statements and he, Mr Lulham, would deal with it then. 21. Mr Radford said that he got back at 12.45pm on 26 October and saw Mr Foley. He said that Mr Foley was telling Mr Lulham that the hearing date had changed to 3 December. Mr Lulham said that he would adjourn the matter until 2pm and he would check whether there was a change of date recorded on the court computer. At 2pm Mr Lulham returned and said there was no record of any change of the date and no record of any attendance for the subpoena on 10 October. Mr Lulham said he would set it down for callover on 3 December and he granted Mr Radford costs of $360.22. Mr Radford said that the following week he went to see the Chamber Magistrate to enquire about the procedure to allow dates to be changed. He said the Chamber Magistrate told him it was not possible to change dates in the way that Mr Radford understood had taken place. The chamber Magistrate said he would arrange for the Local Court Rules to be sent to Mr Radford and if Mr Radford felt that a process had taken place to avoid a hearing then he should report it to the Chief Magistrate. 23. Mr Radford said that he was aware that Huxley owed a lot of money to different people and he said that he knew of debts of some $30 million owed by Huxley and his companies. Mr Radford said that he read the practice note in the Local Court for the change of date and this led him to make his comments about the process to the Chief Magistrate and in the letter, which is the first matter complained of, he said the Chief Magistrate directed him to send the complaint to the Law Society.24. Mr Radford said that he subpoenaed records from Bartercard, and an officer from Bartercard subsequently contacted him about a debt owed by ICA Special Projects Pty Limited, a company of which Huxley was a director, and was also a guarantor of the debt. Mr Radford said that he spoke to Brooke Burke at Bartercard and Mr Burke said to send him any information he had about what was happening in relation to Mr Huxley’s debt. He said that so far as Bernadette Power was concerned, he faxed Mr Foley for a copy of the agent’s letter, because he did not have the name of the agent. He said that he asked for it five times. He said that when he got the copy he tried to contact Ms Power but she had left Craddock, Murray and Newman and gone back to Adelaide so he could not contact her, but he did speak to the Law Society in Adelaide to ascertain her whereabouts. He said Huxley subsequently declared himself bankrupt and the matter has sat in court ever since. Subsequently he himself was sent bankrupt. 25. He said that he sent the letter to the Law Society, which is the third matter complained of, and the Law Society rang him and told him to collect it and take it to the Legal Services Commission. He said that he went and collected the letter and he said that at the time it was still sealed. I find this difficult to understand because the Law Society would have had to have opened the letter in order to determine where it should be delivered. Mr Radford was not sure about his memory on this point, and I have concluded that the letter was in fact opened by the Law Society before he was directed to collect it and take it to the Legal Services Commission. In any event, it having been taken to the Legal Services Commissioner, the Legal Services Commissioner referred it back to the Law Society so it was read by the President of the Law Society, to whom it was addressed in the first place.26. It will be recalled the letter to the Law Society was 18 September 2002 and there is a received stamp on the letter, dated 18 September 2002 which also suggests to me that the letter must have been opened by the Law Society on that same day. Mr Radford said that Mr Foley subsequently received notice of the matter, and there seems to be no dispute about that, although the date may be a little uncertain. He said that at the end of 2002 and beginning of 2003 Mr Foley attended the North Sydney Local Court and lodged three private prosecutions against him, Mr Radford. He said that on 21 January police attended his premises at midnight with a warrant for his arrest, and a return date for 19 February 2002 in relation to those three criminal prosecutions. He gave considerable evidence about the criminal prosecutions and said that in his view these were brought forward in order to avoid Mr Foley having to deal with the Law Society complaint. Mr Foley subsequently seems to have dealt with the Law Society complaint in great detail. 27. Mr Radford said that he engaged a solicitor, Mr Wakefield, to do a submission to the Director of Public Prosecutions to take over the three private prosecutions and he, Mr Radford, attended court on seventeen occasions. 28. Mr Radford said that so far as the private prosecutions were concerned they commenced at a time when Mr Foley was in default of the complaint procedure. The Law Society and Mr Foley in his view chose that method, that is, the private prosecutions, as a priority to block the complaint procedure in the Law Society which he said Mr Foley successfully did. However, as I understand the evidence, the matter before the Law Society did proceed, at least to an investigation and Mr Foley did provide the information required.29. Mr Radford said that part of the matter that he relied upon in relation to the second matter complained of, which was the publication to Bartercard Legal Services, was a letter which had been sent to Bartercard Legal Services. The letter was on what appeared to be a letterhead of Mr Foley. Mr Foley gave evidence that it was not his letterhead and Mr Radford ultimately in this court accepted that that was the case. It would appear that Mr Huxley, using fabricated but similar letterhead to the letterhead of Mr Foley, sent a letterhead to Bartercard concerning certain matters which caused Mr Radford to have certain suspicions and come to certain conclusions. He said that he accepted Mr Foley’s explanation that Mr Huxley had sent the letter and that it was not Mr Foley who sent it and it was not Mr Foley’s letter. I asked him at this time, before cross-examination, about the information or material he had which he thought might establish the truth of the imputations, which I have set about above. He said that it was based on the Huxley letter and the change of date of 26 October 2002.30. Mr Radford in cross-examination was cross-examined about a number of things, in particular about the third matter complained of. He was asked about his purpose or motive in publishing the third matter complained of and he ultimately agreed that his intent was to have Mr Foley punished. And, further, his intent was, in part, to get compensation for the debt which he had had to pay. This is set out in the third matter complained of at page 22 where Mr Radford set out that the original debt was $40,000. There is an outstanding costs order of $6,000, interest of $10,142.46 and further costs of $11,790, a total of $61,916, which he wanted to get from Mr Michael Foley or from his insurer. He also said: 
     
     “I would also appreciate your advice as to how I might go about making a claim through the Law Society or LawCover, if applicable, or s 52(1) of the  
     Trade Practices Act 
     , to seek compensation for the injustices perpetrated against me by Michael Foley.” 
    31. Mr Foley during the course of his case alleged that Mr Radford had published one or other of the matters complained of to persons other than those nominated in the documents themselves. He cross-examined Mr Radford about this. During the course of that cross-examination it became apparent that Mr Radford did provide a copy of the third matter complained of to his counsel, Mr Justin Conomy, who was counsel for him in certain legal proceedings. He also provided a letter of 17 August 2006 to Mr Geoffrey David McDonald, Mr Radford’s trustee in bankruptcy. He did not provide a copy of the matter complained of in that letter but, rather, sent a letter to Mr McDonald in which he repeated a number of matters which were in one or other of the three matters complained of. And to that extent I find that there was further publication by Mr Radford. However, I do not find that there was the general republication to the extent that Mr Foley alleged, although I accept that Mr Foley may well have believed that there was a much greater general publication.32. During the course of submissions today I raised with Mr Radford his position in view of the absence of any adequate evidence of truth in the defence of justification which he had originally filed. In consequence of my discussion with him he withdrew all the imputations and he apologised to Mr Foley for each and every of the imputations which he had published. On the first day of the hearing when Mr Foley sought a further order that there be an injunction to prohibit Mr Radford from further publication, Mr Radford agreed immediately to that order when the matter was raised in court. As I said before, on the first day of the proceedings I struck out much of the defences that Mr Radford had put forward. In view of the evidence which I subsequently invited him to give, in case there was any substance in any of the defences, I have come to the conclusion that there was simply no basis for a plea of justification or for a claim of any truth in the matters complained of. Further, I have come to the conclusion that the plea under ss 17F and 17J was available to the defendant but I now have to decide whether that in fact applies. I have already pointed out that Mr Radford had other matters in his mind as part of his motive or purpose when he sought to have the Law Society examine the matter.33. The other matter which I have to look at in determining whether s 17F or 17J have been complied with is the third matter complained of itself. It will be recalled that s 17F requires that, “The publication be made for the purpose of the execution or administration of that Act”. And s 17J requires that, “The publication be for the purpose of making or referral of a complaint under Pt 10 of the Legal Profession Act 1987”. In determining what the purpose was in accordance with my conclusions about Rajski v Carson above, I need to look at the tone of the letter which is the third matter complained of. I have to say it is very extreme at times and it becomes more extreme and indeed offensive as the letter progresses. For example, at page 21 Mr Radford wrote this: 
     
     “In the meantime, a charge of attempting to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice instigated by the Law Society would serve to temper this type of criminal behaviour and place other unscrupulous practitioners on notice.” 
    34. I do not think that that passage is for the purpose of making a complaint under Pt 10 of the Legal Profession Act 1987. Rather, the purpose of that is to have the Law Society instigate criminal proceedings. Again at page 20 at point 3: 
     
     “Again, as a layperson, I would appreciate an explanation as to how an officer of the court can deliberately mislead a magistrate by committing such deceitful and premeditated acts without any apparent fear of consequences.” 
    35. And again further down the page: 
     
     “At the very least, I expect your office to determine the origin, and purpose, of the letter that Foley used in his attempt to deceive Magistrate Lulham. If that letter is proven to be fabricated I insist that you come down on Foley (and on Craddock Murray Newman, if necessary) with the full force available to your organisation.” 
    36. Further, at the bottom of page 20 Mr Radford wrote: 
     
     “From day one of this debacle the defendant and his solicitor (Mr Foley) have set out deliberately to pervert the course of justice in terms of s 319 of  
     Crimes Act 
      No 40. If it is necessary for me to seek the permission of the Right Honourable Robert Debus, Attorney General for the State of New South Wales, to have Michael Foley charged under this section I will do so.” 
    37. At page 14 Mr Radford wrote: 
     
     “In spite of the fact that he had successfully obstructed, prevented, perverted or defeated the course of justice by deceiving a magistrate with outright lies supported by a knowingly deceptive document.” 
      
    38. Similar words appear at page 13. On page 12 he said that the trust of the officer of the court, Mr Foley, “Was completely and deliberately betrayed.” At page 10 he wrote: 
     
     “Is this how solicitors work when they know they are up against an adversary with limited funds? Just stall, stall, stall until their adversaries run out of money and their clients get off scott free? And is the court compelled to assist its officers to deny aggrieved parties natural justice? Or this is the mark of a shyster who: 
      
     -is completely cognoscente of his client’s nefarious scams to fleece creditors? 
      
     -will accept higher than usual fee, believed to be approximately $500 per hour, to assist in the success of his client’s scams? 
      
     -will also assist his client to conceal assets purchased with creditors’ money and conceal those assets in a series of trusts set up to make it impossible for any debts to be recovered?” 
      
    39. Looking at the totality of the letter, the letter does not focus specifically on any default by Mr Foley but, rather, sets out in long rambling repetitive detail the concerns that Mr Radford had about Mr Huxley and Mr Huxley’s dealings and Mr Foley’s association with them and the alleged actions that I have mentioned above. Applying the test in Rajski v Carson I have come to the conclusion that in relation to s 17F the publication was not made for the purpose of the execution or administration of the Act and in relation to s 17J the publication being the third matter complained of was not made for the purpose of making or referral of a complaint under Pt 10 of the Legal Profession Act 1987. I appreciate that that may have been part of the purpose but looking at the general overall tenor of the document together with the admissions made by the defendant in cross-examination, it seems to me that the third matter complained of does not fall within the protection of either s 17F or 17J of the Defamation Act.40. That leads me to the following conclusions. In relation to the first and second matter complained of no defence has been made out. In relation to the third matter complained of no defence has been made out. I therefore conclude that the defendant has made out no defence to any of the matters complained of and I will propose to proceed to the issue of damages.41. Gentlemen, I see the time. Rather than start damages now and then adjourn I’ll start them at 2 o'clock. Before I do that is there anything that you want to correct?42. PLAINTIFF: Your Honour, without altering what your Honour said, just on one small point you did say originally the costs awarded were 390 and then later you said 360.43. HIS HONOUR: I know, because that’s what was said first time 390, you were giving evidence, Mr Radford butted in and said 390, when he came to give his own evidence he said 360 and that’s what I’m relying upon.44. PLAINTIFF: Thank you, your Honour.45. DEFENDANT: There are just a couple of date errors but I’ll wait until the transcript comes out.46. PLAINTIFF: Tell his Honour now.47. HIS HONOUR: Sorry, Mr Foley?48. PLAINTIFF: I’m just saying he should tell your Honour now.49. HIS HONOUR: Yes, I’ll tell him that, not you. Mr Radford, the transcript doesn’t come through until after I’ve corrected it. So if there are some date errors do you want to give them to me now and I will incorporate them when the transcript does come through?50. DEFENDANT: You mentioned a date for the hearing when you went from 26 July in 5.9. You said the timetable was arranged with the hearing of 26 July 2001, it should have been 26 October 2001.51. HIS HONOUR: 26 October 2001.52. DEFENDANT: Further down you said there was a call over set down by Magistrate Lulham for 3 December, it should have been 10 December.53. HIS HONOUR: Anything else? I’m grateful for that, I’ll correct those.54. DEFENDANT: Not at this stage, your Honour.55. HIS HONOUR: When you say not at this stage, this is the stage, Mr Radford, it’s now or never. You can do it at 2 o'clock if you like.56. DEFENDANT: Yes, I might, I’ll go back through.[LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT]57. HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff gave evidence that he is a solicitor who was admitted in 1978, he is aged fifty-four, he went to school at St Cannes’s Elizabeth Bay then to St Mary’s Cathedral School and St Patricks at Goulburn. He went to Sydney University where, after trying a number of other courses, he finally decided to do law which he commenced in 1973 and he graduated in 1977. He said the law was the whole of his life. He said he jealously guarded his reputation. He said he had been thirty years in practice and he had always tried to do the right thing and he put his duty to the client always in front of his own interest.58. He called evidence from other witnesses, Michael Lawler, Vice President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Norman Sakr, a project manager in construction, Kevin Foley, a solicitor, who is his cousin, William Hundy, a Company Secretary and solicitor, Warner Meredith who is also a solicitor, all of these witnesses testified to his highly esteemed reputation. They all had various professional and personal dealings with him. They observed his conduct and had a high opinion of his character and reputation, and in their conversation with others they found that he had a very high reputation and that he deserved his character and reputation. He also was involved in the school where his children went, where he was both a Rugby Union Coach very successfully and a Cricket Coach also very successfully between 1995 and 2005. He is a man who I accept has and had a high reputation and deserves every part of it. 59. The plaintiff said that on 10 November 2002 he received a further letter from the Professional Standards Department of the Law Society enclosing a copy of Mr Radford’s letter dated 6 November 2002. He said on 10 January 2003 he delivered his reply to the letters that he had received from the Law Society. He said that on 7 March 2003, he began to feel unwell. By 18 March 2003 he was fighting what he believed was a viral infection and he saw a doctor on 21 March 2003 when he could barely get out of bed. On 22 March 2003 he was admitted to the Royal North Shore Hospital suffering from a bacterial infection of the blood, known as endocarditis. On 23 March 2003 he was gravely ill and received the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church from the hospital chaplain. For about three weeks he had a central line that passed through his carotid vein into his heart. He was connected to an infusion pump through which he received what he said were massive doses of antibiotics and he was discharged from hospital on 11 April 2003. He then undertook a period of time of some two weeks rest and recuperation while he was still on oral antibiotics for another four weeks and he had to undergo a number of tests including an MRI test of his arteries. He said that he himself blamed, to a large extent, the stress, anxiety and sleepless nights and his failure to have any Christmas break as a result of the wrongful allegations being made against him by Mr Radford. There is no medical evidence to support this, but there is a coincidence of time and to a degree I will reflect what I see is some connection but not necessarily a total connection.60. In February 2006 the plaintiff’s health further deteriorated when he apparently had concerns about his heart. He saw a specialist in October and was due for surgery on 12 December 2006. Procedures showed that he had an infection and the operation was delayed until 7 February 2007 when he had open-heart surgery. He left hospital on 21 February 2007 and in late February 2007 he collapsed and was taken to Hornsby Hospital for a couple of days. In March 2007 he suffered from another infection and again was hospitalised at Royal North Shore Hospital for four days. 61. He said that he believed himself that the defendant had undertaken a calculated campaign to cause damage to the plaintiff in the practice of his profession and that publications were made in contumelies disregard of his right to a good reputation. He said he thought the principal motive was to get money either from the plaintiff himself or from LawCover. He said that he thought the defendant lacked an honest belief in the truth of the matter and I myself on the evidence, have concluded that the defendant did not have a proper basis for believing any truth in the matters. He said that as a result of the defendant’s actions, he suffered injury to his proper feelings of dignity and pride. He suffered from anger and anxiety due to his inability to protect himself, his personal and professional reputation from actions of the defendant in publishing the matters complained of. He said that he thought that the defendant acted in disregard of the truth in publishing the matters complained of and in his dealings with the plaintiff. He said that he suffered loss of enjoyment of life given the excessive worry about being involved with the Law Society and Legal Services Commission and the prosecution of these present defamation proceedings. He said he suffered anger, anxiety, irritability, headaches, stress, impaired health, loss of fitness, inability to sleep, embarrassment and inadequacy, loss of dignity, inability to concentrate due to the defendant’s activities and over Christmas 2002 he had no holidays but he had to spend all the time answering the accusations. 62. He then spoke of the period in hospital in 2003 and again from 12 December 2006 to 15 December 2006 and from 6 February 2007 to 21 February 2007 when he had open-heart surgery. He said he was incapacitated for several months after recovering from the open-heart surgery. He said as a sole practitioner he was unable to earn income for various periods and he estimated his gross loss net of GST was four thousand dollars per week for sixteen weeks, being a total of sixty-four thousand dollars. 63. He is a married man who has six children, he said he had worked hard, the children are aged fifteen to twenty-five years. He spoke about coaching the school Rugby Union Team and the Cricket Team and he said this was illustrative of many of the community things which he was involved in. He suffered rage, anger and ill health as a result of what had occurred and he had attempted to protect himself and his family. 64. The damages are inappropriate to restore a damaged reputation, but they are awarded to compensate for damaged reputation, to console the plaintiff, to provide official recognition that the imputation made was defamatory, and was indefensible. This latter purpose is often referred to as vindicating the plaintiff’s reputation. The plaintiff submitted that the size of the verdict was important in determining the extent of the vindication and understandably, he was seeking a sizeable verdict, substantial verdict, in order to show substantial vindication. 65. The plaintiff submitted that the publications were part of an orchestrated and determined and relentless plan to injure and hurt the plaintiff in his practice of his profession as a solicitor. Because it was only limited further publication by the defendant, I am not able to accept that submission in its entirety, although I do certainly consider that there was at least in 2002, a relentless plan to injure and hurt the plaintiff in his practice of his profession as a solicitor and I rely in particular upon the language which I have already referred to above. The whole of the material published in all three matters complained of is very condemnatory of the plaintiff. The language is highly rhetorical and consists of a series of false accusations accusing the plaintiff of disgraceful, corrupt and criminal conduct. Indeed, it is hard to think of any further descriptions of any solicitor which could be worse for his professional reputation.66. The plaintiff submitted that there were numerous significant and substantial factual errors. That is certainly true as is witnessed by the fact that there simply was no truth in the matters which were alleged. The plaintiff said that the defendant should have had regard for the general principle that in attempting to defend his defamatory actions “the harder hitting the comment, the greater should be the care to establish the truth of the facts upon which it is based”: Austin v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1986] AC 299 at 317. 67. The plaintiff submits that he was powerfully affected by publication of each of the matters complained of and that the anguish that he suffered and the hurt to his feelings was of the most extreme kind. He gave evidence about this and I accept his evidence on that point. He said he jealously regarded his good reputation as a solicitor which he had practised mostly as a sole-practitioner for most of his adult life. I also accept that submission on the evidence which he has given. 68. The plaintiff said that he suffered from feelings of inadequacy due to his inability to prevent the plaintiff from continuing to conduct his relentless campaign of personal vilification and defamation of the plaintiff. As I said on the evidence before me, there is not sufficient evidence for me to find that such activities did occur, but I do accept that the plaintiff thought they were occurring . The plaintiff said that the issue of falsity was important because the plaintiff claimed in addition to general damages, that his hurt to feelings was greatly aggravated by reason of the knowledge of the falsity of the imputations. I accept that submission. The plaintiff also claims aggravated compensatory damages and said that the general effect of all the imputations complained of did not fully take into account the extent of the aggravation caused by the repetition of these allegations concerning the plaintiff over a long period. As I say there were only two repetitions on the evidence before me and I do not think that that leads to any significant aggravation over and above the initial aggravation and distress from the initial aggravation. 69. The plaintiff submitted that when I consider aggravated compensatory damages, great care must be taken to avoid double counting for the reasons explained by Hodgson JA in State of New South Wales v Riley (2003) 57 NSWLR 496 at [131]. In this case I think that there is additional leave for aggravated compensation because the defendant persisted in his plea of truth and in particular, did not withdraw the imputations and apologise until today. The plaintiff was left to deal with this situation over a number of years.70. The plaintiff submits that where there is serious misconduct by the defendant, as I think there is in this case, a court should be careful to avoid the risk of under-compensating a plaintiff and what a court should do is aim at the upper limit of the wide range of damages which might conceivably be appropriate for the publication and he pointed to the English cases in particular Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome [1972] AC 1027 at 1085. He said that if I followed that approach then when ordinary compensatory damages were awarded, the award of aggravated damages is justified by bringing the damages to the top end of the range. I do not accept that submission in that form but I will certainly take into account the totality of the suffering which the plaintiff has undergone and award aggravated compensatory damages.71. The plaintiff said that aggravated damages are awarded when conduct of a defendant, whether or not it takes the form of another libel “rubs salt in the wounds”: Sutcliffe v Pressdram Ltd (Private Eye/Yorkshire Ripper Defamation case) [1991] 1 QB 153 at 170D per Lord Donaldson. The plaintiff also referred me to Carson v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1993) 178 CLR 44 at 106 per McHugh J. While it cannot be said there is no element of punishment in the assessment of aggravated compensatory damages, it is still appropriate for a court to award damages on the basis the defendant has contumelious disregard for the wrongfulness of his actions. In this case I think the defendant has had contumelious disregard for the wrongfulness of his actions by pursuing the defence of justification and the claim of truth for all of the imputations, when in my view, there was simply no foundation at all for doing so. 72. The plaintiff has referred me to s 46A of the Defamation Act which provides that when awarding damages, it is for the court to ensure there is an appropriate and rational relationship between the relevant harm and the amount of damages awarded and that when considering general damages in any claim for aggravated compensatory damages, the court is to take into account damages for non-economic loss in personal injury awards in this State including any awards made under statute regulating the award of any such damages by caps on the sum of damages and by further amending the check list to set out by Hayne J in Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2003) 216 CLR 327 at 327. 73. The defendant referred me to some recent cases, in particular McMullen v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (2001) Aust Torts Reports 81-584, where Dunford J awarded one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to a plaintiff, his professional competency and responsibilities as a school teacher was the subject of an attack. He further referred me to Bishop Zaia v Chibo [2005] NSWSC 917 where the plaintiff was awarded one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars for allegations concerning his conduct as a Bishop of the Assyrian Church. The plaintiff said that he was utterly devastated by the contents of the publications and the plaintiff said that the top end of the range of damages would have to be a figure approaching the limit of this court’s jurisdiction. Bearing in mind that this was a limited publication, albeit in very serious circumstances, I do not accept that submission.74. The plaintiff further said that any award of less than something approaching the jurisdictional limit of the court would be to disregard not only the very serious nature of the libels but also its devastating impact on the plaintiff and his health and wellbeing as well as addressing the aggravating features of the series of defamatory defamations by reason of the plaintiff’s knowledge of the falsity of the imputations. He also referred to the constant continuing repetition which I have found was limited to the two matters referred to above. He referred me to Crampton v Nugawela (1996) 41 NSWLR 176 per Mahoney JA where his Honour said that the reputation of a professional person is not only a very important part of the person’s life, but often the whole of that person’s life.75. I have concluded that for the first matter complained of, the matter written to the Chief Magistrate was quite limited and the appropriate amount of damages for that is ten thousand dollars ($10,000). I have concluded that the second matter complained of, the matter published at Barter Card was also very limited and the appropriate amount of damages is five thousand dollars ($5,000). I have concluded that the third matter complained of is much more serious but again, if publication is limited and I consider that the appropriate amount of damages for this publication is twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). I also consider that because of the continued maintenance of the plea of truth and justification, and because there was simply no basis on which the defendant could possibly have believed that the matters were true, that the plaintiff is entitled to aggravated compensatory damages of ten thousand dollars ($10,000).76. I have examined the situation of special damages. In the absence of any medical evidence it is difficult for me to make definite conclusions about the connection between the defamatory publications and the physical suffering and injury and disability which the plaintiff suffered. However on balance I have concluded that there is some connection between the two but because of the uncertainty I have to discount that connection to a degree and for the special damages I am awarding forty thousand dollars ($40,000). 77. The total damages therefore are ninety thousand dollars ($90,000) plus interest. 78. HIS HONOUR: The interest Mr Foley is two percent on half the verdict from the date of publication. The date of publication is about two and one-half years ago now is it not, sorry 2002, four and one-half. It will be five and one-half years ago, so I will just do some calculations on that. I make that four thousand nine hundred and fifty ($4,950). I will just check that again. Yes I make that four thousand nine hundred and fifty ($4,950).79. A total verdict of ninety-four thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars ($94,950).80. In addition there will be a question of costs.81. HIS HONOUR: Costs normally follow the event Mr Radford. In the ordinary course I would make an order that you pay the costs of the plaintiff. Of course I understand your financial situation in terms of the bankruptcy so that it may not matter greatly what I say about that but that is the ordinary order that I would make. Do you want to say anything against that? I do not think there is much you can say to be quite honest.82. DEFENDANT: No there isn’t your Honour, it is a matter that has dragged on a long time and because of my circumstances it has been difficult for me to defend the matter.83. HIS HONOUR: I understand that.84. HIS HONOUR: Mr Foley, what do you want to say about it. I see somewhere you wanted an indemnity --85. PLAINTIFF: Your Honour made comments about that yes.86. HIS HONOUR: -- costs order. You wanted an indemnity costs order didn’t you?87. PLAINTIFF: I did ask for it your Honour.88. HIS HONOUR: Yes, what is the basis for it, is there an offer of compromise or something?89. PLAINTIFF: No there was no offer of compromise. 90. HIS HONOUR: I think I need something to base such an order on. The order I will make is simply that the defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings. 91. PLAINTIFF: Does the question of the injunction—92. HIS HONOUR: The injunction yes. 93. PLAINTIFF: And if I may also say there was just one mistake your Honour. I was admitted on 22 July 1977.94. HIS HONOUR: Sorry, 22 July 1977.95. PLAINTIFF: I went into my own practice on 28 September 1978.96. HIS HONOUR: By the way let me just get this 360 or 390 cleared up. What was the costs order awarded to you?97. DEFENDANT: 360 I think it was your Honour.98. HIS HONOUR: I will correct that when it comes back because I noted in one part of the evidence you said it was 360 and in one part 390, so it is in fact 360.99. DEFENDANT: I think I said 360 and Mr Foley said 390 but it was 360.100. HIS HONOUR: All right, I will work on that. Are you happy with that Mr Foley?101. PLAINTIFF: I am your Honour.102. HIS HONOUR: Now where is the injunction. You saw the injunction did you not, you have no problem with that Mr Radford?103. DEFENDANT: I would like to see it again if I could.104. HIS HONOUR: Yes certainly.105. DEFENDANT: There are a couple of other minor details that I might mention.106. HIS HONOUR: Yes, yes most certainly.107. DEFENDANT: After the date of 18 September 2002 for the report to the Law Society, you mentioned the date of receipt or you were about to mention a date of receipt by Mr Foley.108. HIS HONOUR: Yes I took that out because I couldn’t find it.109. DEFENDANT: It was 3 November.110. HIS HONOUR: It doesn’t matter now, I haven’t put it in, I don’t have to correct it.111. DEFENDANT: And you mentioned that the private criminal prosecutions commenced on 2 December, it was 2 January.112. HIS HONOUR: I thought I said it was between those dates but anyway. The private prosecutions—113. DEFENDANT: Were stamped in the North Sydney Court.114. HIS HONOUR: --were lodged—115. DEFENDANT: On 2 January.116. HIS HONOUR: --on 2 January 2003. Yes anything else?117. DEFENDANT: And police served it on me on the 25th not the 21st, I think you had said the 21st.118. HIS HONOUR: I had noted that you said I was served with three private prosecutions on 24 January 2004, is that right?119. DEFENDANT: Yes that is correct. 120. HIS HONOUR: 24 January 2004 I hope that is what I said.121. DEFENDANT: 24 March.122. HIS HONOUR: All right I’m sorry, that’s where I did get it wrong. Anything else?123. DEFENDANT: No that is all your Honour.124. HIS HONOUR: Do you want me to keep the exhibits Mr Foley or can I hand them back.125. PLAINTIFF: The injunction your Honour but perhaps—126. HIS HONOUR: The injunction, yes Mr Radford still has it down there.127. PLAINTIFF: Perhaps you can make an order that they be kept for twenty-eight days and returned or return them now, whichever—128. HIS HONOUR: I can return them now. Exhibits may be returned now.129. PLAINTIFF: I will undertake to hold them.130. HIS HONOUR: Mr Radford if you wanted to appeal you’ve got twenty-eight days, that’s why the exhibits will be kept by Mr Foley and looked after for that time. After that time they may well be destroyed, that’s often the case. Any problem with that Mr Radford?131. DEFENDANT: No there isn’t.132. HIS HONOUR: I make this further order. That the defendant, his servants and agents be restrained from publishing or further publishing or permitting or causing to be published against the plaintiff, the words appearing in the documents containing all the matters complained of and which are annexed to the plaintiff’s statement of claim filed on 10 February 2004 in these proceedings number 636 of 2004 or any words to like effect.133. Mr Foley I will take out the words “until further order of the court”, there will not be a further order of the court. 134. I will direct that a transcript of that judgment be made available to the parties when revised.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Hoang Phuc Ung got into a bit of financial difficulty through his gambling. He began borrowing money and because those who lent it to him were charging quite high interest, it soon got to the stage where he could not pay back what he owed. He says that it was at that stage that some people threatened him, and his family as well, that if he did not do what they said he should, he would be harmed, but that, if he did comply with their demands, his debt would be wiped. It was in those circumstances, the offender says, that he left Australia, went back to his country of birth, Vietnam, and returned with a substantial quantity of heroin. 2 He came to the attention of customs officers on the morning of 20 September 2009 after he returned from Vietnam. Those officers noticed that the shoes he was wearing appeared to be unusually high. They attempted to conduct a search of the accused at which point he made admissions. He told them not only were there narcotics concealed within his shoes, but there were also narcotics internally concealed. 3 Police came and interviewed him briefly. The offender told them that he had swallowed some objects and that someone had paid him money to bring both those objects and items hidden in his shoes. Between the time of his arrival in Australia and 23 September 2009, the offender passed a total of 133 foreign objects.4 When his shoes were deconstructed, they were found to contain a cream coloured powdered substance. In total there was a significant quantity of powder concealed either internally or in the offender’s shoes. The combined pure weight was just short of 800 grams. The street value of that quantity of heroin is between one and one and one-half million dollars with a wholesale price of between $279,000 and $300,000. Clearly this is a significant importation. The figures I have just mentioned show how lucrative drug importation is. For that reason, sentences imposed upon those involved in the drug trade and drug importation must necessarily be harsh in order to deter others who may be tempted to do similar things, especially when they too get into financial difficulty. 5 I note also that the offender has no drug addiction himself but was doing this purely so that he could pay off the debt that he owed. It will be noticed that I have, in what I have just said, disregarded the offender’s explanation insofar as he says he was threatened and kidnapped. The offender has said similar things to a psychologist in the past, but there is no other material at all to suggest the accuracy of what the offender says. In circumstances where the onus of proof is on the offender to satisfy me the mitigating circumstance on the balance of probabilities, I am simply unable to determine that in the offender’s favour. It might be right, or it might not, I simply do not know.6 The offender was born in Vietnam. He spent a great deal of time in a refugee camp after he left Vietnam where he met his wife. They had two children there. Eventually he and his wife came to Australia where they had two more children. They are now nineteen, seventeen, twelve and eight years of age. The offender and his wife are separated but the offender says that he regularly contacts his children and supports them. His ex-wife and three of his children are in court today. 7 The offender has been working on occasions, he has been employed as a chef and also as a truck driver. After he separated from his wife in around 2003 or 2004, he told a psychologist he began drinking. Others noticed that he went downhill. In 2008 he tried to reconcile with his wife but that was unsuccessful, he started to increase his gambling and drinking so that he could put out of his mind the unsatisfactory aspects of his life. A family friend, Ms Vo, also noticed his increasing use of poker machines and suspected that he had a gambling problem. In a document prepared for the court, she indicates that she learnt that he was constantly asking friends if he could borrow money from them. Lastly, the offence occurred at a time when the offender was vulnerable and easily influenced. However his offending was very serious indeed. 8 The offender claims that it was only after he has gone into custody that he realised just how bad drugs are. That may well be true but the offender does not suggest that, before he decided to leave Australia with a plan to return with a substantial quantity of drugs in his possession, he was unaware of the great harm that drugs do to many members of society. The offender’s decision to involve himself in this very serious crime was one that he made very much with his eyes open. He can have been under no illusions as to what was likely to happen to him if he was caught. He was clearly prepared to take that risk because of the rewards which would come his way.9 It appears that the offender’s involvement in the organisation was relatively low level. I will sentence him on the basis that his involvement was simply to go to Vietnam and bring the drugs back. That does not mean however that his conduct was anything other than very serious indeed. The “Mr Bigs” of the drug trade depend on people such as the offender in order to carry out their criminal activities. The courts hope to disrupt and deter the Mr Bigs of the drug trade by imposing deterrent sentences on couriers who commit serious offences such as the offender’s. 10 The offender was, apart from this matter and another unrelated matter of drink driving, a man of otherwise good character. However the courts have repeatedly said that that circumstance is of less relevance in cases involving couriers because those who are asked to be couriers are almost invariably people without prior offences. 11 Although the offender said little to police on the day of his arrest, he later spoke to them about what he said were the circumstances in which he became involved in this offence. A letter indicating what the offender told the police on those occasions, because there were more than one, was tendered. That document is to be placed in an envelope and sealed and only to be opened by order of a judge of this court or of a superior court. I will not set out the nature of what the offender told police for obvious reasons. I will however note that it was described by those who investigated the matter as being information of low value. It was certainly not sufficient to justify the prosecution of any other person. Nevertheless, even given that I have difficulty accepting everything that the offender told police on that occasion, I do find that his nomination of particular people is evidence of his remorse. 12 There is other evidence of that as well, the offender telling the psychologist that it was wrong of him to bring the drugs into Australia. I should also indicate that the offender pleaded guilty, whilst not at the earliest opportunity, at an early opportunity. His willingness to assist the authorities in that regard together with his low level of assistance, has led me to impose a sentence which is thirty per cent less than would otherwise be the case. Both the Crown and Ms Johnson for the offender referred to other cases involving importations of drugs of this approximate quantity. Somewhat coincidentally one of them involved a person whom I sentenced. There were many similarities between the circumstances of that offender and the circumstances of this offender. 13 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for six and one-half years with a non-parole period of four years. That is to date from 20 September 2009 and the offender’s non-parole period will expire on 19 September 2013. 14 HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Ung I just need to explain to you what I have done. I have imposed a sentence of imprisonment. It starts from 20 September 2009 because that is the day you went to gaol. The non-parole period is four years which means that the earliest you can get out from gaol is 19 September 2013. Whether you are released on that date or released later than that, depends on the parole authorities, not me. You must be released, that is you cannot be held in custody longer than six and one-half years from 20 September 2009. If you are released on parole, you will still be serving a sentence in the community which means that if you breach the parole orders, you can be taken back into custody to serve the remainder of your sentence. Mr Ung do you understand what I have said to you?15 OFFENDER (INTERPRETER): Yes.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Many years ago now the Court of Criminal Appeal had occasion to comment about the seriousness of bag snatching offences. In the decision of  R v Ranse NSWCCA (unreported) 8 August 1994, then Chief Justice Gleeson reminded us all of the grave criminality involved in offences such as those for which Bianca Barton appears for sentence today. Bag snatching offences not only have direct effect on the victims of those offences, sometimes serious as in the first of the offences committed by Ms Barton, but also have other effects on the rest of the community. These offences represent a breach of the peace. They cause fear and apprehension in members of the community, especially elderly members of the community who should be entitled to go and do their shopping without people like Ms Barton preying upon them. It is important to remember these statements of the Court of Criminal Appeal when I consider the sentence to impose upon Ms Barton, a woman who has a seventeen page criminal history, such that her life has been measured out in court dates and periods of imprisonment.2 On 1 August 2009 a man by the name of Ron Thomas stole a station wagon from Liverpool Hospital. Ms Barton allowed herself to be carried in that car knowing that it was taken without the consent of the owner. It was probably not known at all to Ms Barton that the owner of the car had driven it to hospital for tests on chest pains that she was suffering. The offence of being carried in that conveyance appears on the Form 1 attached an offence I will now describe.3 Ms Barton was in the car along with the man who had taken it, Ronald Thomas, and another man by the name of Matthew Heath. The three of them saw a sixty-seven year old woman, Janette Asciak, walking along Vine Street in Fairfield. The three of them decided that Ms Barton would steal Ms Asciak’s black leather handbag. Ms Asciak felt a push from behind and stumbled. She turned around to see Ms Barton. Ms Barton grabbed the handbag. Ms Asciak..(fault in recording equipment)..Ms Barton was not so easily deterred. She said, “Let go, let go, I don’t want to hurt you but I will, I’ll hit you, I’ll hit you.” With one hand she pulled the handbag and the other she raised in a clenched fist as if to hit Ms Asciak. She managed to get Ms Asciak’s handbag away from her and ran away. She got back in the station wagon and it drove away.4 Ms Asciak has not felt safe to leave her house since the robbery. Some might think that an extreme reaction but those of us who have dealt with the criminal law on a daily basis for many years know that this is relatively common in the elderly who are victims of offences of this kind. And for that, Ms Barton and the co-offenders got a purse, a mobile phone, personal cards and papers, and the grand total of a $165 in cash. Ms Asciak would be entitled to wonder about the sort of person that would do that to her for such a small return.5 Did Ms Barton regret what she had done? Well, apparently not, because very shortly afterwards on the very same day Ms Barton did it again. This time she approached a younger woman, twenty-seven years of age, who was returning to her car at the shopping centre. Once more Ms Barton robbed the victim of her handbag. But that was not enough for Ms Barton. She could see that the victim was wearing a gold coloured chain around her neck, so Ms Barton simply grabbed it and ripped it away from her neck. She then got back into the station wagon and once again drove away.6 Those two offences that I have described are offences of robbery, carrying a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. I should also mention that on the very same day Ms Barton committed a further offence, this time of stealing from the person, when she took a handbag from the vicinity of its owner, this time a fifteen-year-old girl who was travelling on a train. Ms Barton has actually been sentenced for that, but the Crown appropriately told me about it because of the principle of totality which I must apply.7 It is clear that Ms Barton paid little regard to the feelings and welfare of the sixty-seven-year-old woman, the twenty-seven-year-old woman and the fifteen-year-old girl against whom she committed offences that day. However, things are not as bleak as they first appear because Ms Barton has now both admitted her offending and undertaken to assist the authorities by giving evidence against the two men in the station wagon with her. I will return to this matter in a little while.8 I mentioned before that Ms Barton has a lengthy criminal history. She began committing crimes at about the same time she began using drugs. She was the eldest of her mother’s three children. When she was about ten or eleven she learnt that the man she regarded as her father was not in fact her father and that her two siblings were in fact half siblings. This led to some distress in the family and when her mother died shortly thereafter she found that she had no one to turn to. She formed a de facto relationship with a man called Steve when she was about sixteen or seventeen, he being considerably older than her. Steve was a substance abuser and so she began using drugs at the age of twenty. She has committed many offences along the way but these offences for which I am now sentencing her represent something of an escalation in her offending behaviour. She is now in a relationship with another man called Steve. She has three children, one of whom is being fostered by a good family and there are thoughts being given to allowing that child to be adopted by that family so that she can remain where she is. Her other two children are being cared for by her current partner, Steven Engelcott. Ms Barton has plans upon her release from custody to resume living with Mr Engelcott. He is not a substance abuser. Ms Barton expects that she will benefit from the stability that such a relationship will provide her. She is currently on methadone and hopes one day to get off the methadone maintenance program. 9 She has no real explanation for the offences that she committed with the two men on 1 August 2009. She was not using heroin at the time. She was supplied medication and had no pressing need for money. Instead she claimed that she was simply helping out the other two men. I mentioned before that she has now decided to give evidence against the men. At the time that she spoke to police and assisted them, there was no information linking the offences, particularly that involving Ms Asciak, to the two men. However, since the provision of information from Ms Barton police have been able to obtain evidence against them, and more importantly for the task that I have to perform today, Ms Barton will give evidence. She has given an undertaking to give evidence at the trial of Mr Beattie and Mr Thomas, which is due to commence early next year. Ms Barton gave evidence that she understood that if she did not give evidence her sentence would be increased and that the undertaking included giving evidence at retrials, that is if they apply.10 I should also say at this stage that Ms Barton pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to these two matters. I will not separately quantify the discount for pleading guilty from the discount for assistance. I will say that together those two matters have led to me imposing sentences which are forty per cent less than they would otherwise have been.11 Given Ms Barton’s criminal history and given the matters referred to in the psychologist’s report tendered today, it really cannot be said that there are good prospects of rehabilitation. One day, hopefully soon, Ms Barton will tire of life that she has been leading and recognise that spending significant parts of it in custody is simply wasting her life, to say nothing of denying her children the care to which they are entitled. I note that Ms Barton was on a bond at the time of these offences. She has expressed remorse to the author of the psychological report, saying that now she is able to think more clearly she realises what she has done. I actually have my doubts that she really does appreciate the impact that her offending has had on the life of Ms Asciak.12 There are special circumstances in this case, not only the matters referred to in the psychological report but also the mathematical consequence of accumulation. The sentences that I will impose will not be wholly concurrent. Ms Reynolds at first asked that I impose sentences upon her client which were concurrent. But when pressed as to whether that would be an appropriate outcome, Ms Reynolds moved to a fall back position of partial accumulation. That is what I propose to do.13 I also note that Ms Barton has served a sentence for the steal from a person matter that I described earlier, that being the offence committed on the fifteen-year-old girl. The principle of totality of course arises. What I propose to do to give effect to that is to start the sentence that I impose sometime after the commencement date of the sentence for steal from the person matter so that the sentences for the two robbery offences that I am dealing with and the steal from person matter, all committed on the same day, will all be partially accumulated on each other.14 Ultimately the sentences that I impose upon Ms Barton must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the objective gravity of what she has done. As I began these remarks on sentence, the objective gravity of the bag snatching offences can be quite high, so it has proved to be in at least one of these cases. The sentences I impose will be as follows. Taking into account the Form 1 matter in relation to the robbery of Jeanette Asciak, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of eighteen months to commence on 28 April 2010. For the robbery involving Anne Jones, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of twelve months to commence from 28 April 2011. On that matter I set a total term of two and a half years. The overall term of imprisonment is thus one of three and a half years with a non-parole period of two years, when Ms Barton will be eligible to be released to parole on 27 April 2012.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The evidence is closed and addresses in this matter are going to occur tomorrow. We took the opportunity to discuss the directions that I would be giving. One of the directions sought by Mr Norrie is a direction under s 165A(2) of the Evidence Act. We have therefore spent a short period of time this afternoon considering that matter. The Crown opposes the direction being given. 2 It is to be noted that I should only give a direction under 165A(2) if the accused has satisfied me that there are circumstances, other than solely the age of the child, particular to the child, that affect the reliability of the child's evidence and that warrant the giving of a warning or the information referred to in section 165.3 What circumstances particular to the child in this case, MN, does Mr Norrie, on behalf of the accused say affect the reliability of her evidence? He relied on three matters. Firstly, he says that in the transcript of the interview between MN and Detective McCarthy the complainant refers to a shark. She said that, whilst she was at the beach with the accused, ""I thought I saw a shark but I didn't."" She goes on, ""It had red eyes…red eyes and these things, black ones."" As she said that she was describing things with her hands. The officer thought that she was attempting to describe a pointy nose but MN said that she wasn't. It is said on behalf of the accused that this was a fantasy. Well, what part of it would I find was a fantasy? Would I say it was untrue because MN thought she saw a shark but she didn't or that she didn't see something with red eyes? 4 Of course it would only be a fantasy if MN was describing something she didn't see but there is no evidence one way or the other as to whether she saw something that she has thought initially was a shark, which had red eyes and looked otherwise in the manner she described on the videoed interview. 5 A second aspect that Mr Norrie relies on concerns the reference by MN to a witch. She was asked by Detective McCarthy how she felt when the accused put his finger inside her ""wee wee"". She replied: ""It feeled, it feeled like a witch um hurting me."" She was cross-examined about this.6 The answers given by MN in cross examination made it abundantly clear that she did not actually believe that witches exist and indeed, she said with some levity in her voice during cross-examination that her mother believed in ghosts but she didn't. Although she gave this answer to this question: 
     
      
      ""Q. MN, when were you hurt by a witch? 
       
      A. When it was the beach."" 
      
    7 She immediately clarified what she meant in answer to the following question, which was: 
     
      
      ""Q. MN, what did the witch look like? 
       
      A. It wasn't a real witch but inside my brain it feeled like a ugly - really ugly witch, has got pimple all over it and it got like a scar near its foot and face."" 
      
    8 She was then asked: 
     
      
      Q. When you say witch, MN, are you meaning the witches that have broomsticks? 
       
      A. Yeah, but I am not talking about a real witch because witches aren't true."" 
      
    9 In fact she said she never will believe witches are true. 10 It is said that this demonstrates a vivid and creative imagination. It has to be understood that it would be quite inappropriate to conclude from what MN said to the police officer and what she said in interview that she genuinely believed that the person that hurt her was a witch or that witches were capable of hurting her. It is abundantly clear that MN was attempting to describe her emotional state when the accused did to her what she said he did.11 Quite eloquently for a child of six, she made it clear that she was not saying that witches really exist but was attempting to describe how bad it was and how she felt when the accused put his finger inside her genitals.12 The third aspect that Mr Norrie relies on is the ability of the complainant, MN, to lie. There is evidence to that effect in the following circumstances: the relationship between MN's mother and the accused was not a good one. Although she denied it, both MN and her father said that the complainant's mother had accused Mr Kertai of bringing fleas into the premises where the complainant lived.13 Mr JN gave evidence today that in order to avoid trouble and, I gather, lead a more relaxing life with his de facto wife, it would be better if she did not know that the accused visited the unit where she lived in Rockdale. He, therefore, told his daughter not to tell her mother that the accused had visited there.14 In cross-examination MN, the complainant, agreed that she would lie to her mother about whether the accused had visited her mother’s unit while she was out. As far as this aspect is concerned, that a child would lie to one parent at the request of another parent is not surprising at all. Mr JN said that sometimes his daughter would lie about the matter and at other times she wouldn't, which I gather caused a few problems for him.15 This area of the law is one which I confess to find a big curious. Usually judges give directions to juries about matters which are within the knowledge of the law and which lay people, such as jurors, may not appreciate without a direction. Obvious examples concern hearsay, accomplices and prison informers. The experience of the law is that, for example, accomplices may have reasons to make up evidence.16 But what is it about children that gives judges special knowledge as to their reliability? In fact, if literature readily available to lawyers, such as the various Law Reform Commission reports, is examined, it would tend to suggest that the special knowledge judges have would be that children are more reliable than is commonly accepted. However, s 165A, of course, must be given some work to do and a judge can't simply say, “well, I don't have any special knowledge in this area and so I won't give a direction”.17 Notwithstanding the curiosity I have just raised, it's clear that a direction should be given if there are circumstances particular to MN that affect the reliability of her evidence and warrant the giving of the warning or information contemplated by section 165A. Even if it can be said that a vivid imagination used by a child to explain her emotions and a willingness to lie to one parent on behalf of another are particular to the child, the question is whether those matters affect the reliability of her evidence such as to warrant the giving of the warning or information under s 165A. They are very common place matters when children are concerned. The effect that they have on her reliability is obvious. Uninstructed, the jury may conclude that the child is prepared to lie might be thought to damage her credibility. Uninstructed, the jury may conclude that the fact that the child uses the analogy of a witch with pimples to explain emotions might perhaps be thought to indicate that she is able to use that imagination to imagine an event which did not occur.18 It is unnecessary for me to say anything to the jury about those matters for them to understand the significance of those two matters on the reliability of the evidence of the complainant.19 It will be noted that I have ignored so far in this part of my judgment the reference to MN seeing a shark - or, to be more precise, telling the police officer that at one stage she thought she saw a shark but it turned out not to be one - because of the problem with that matter that I raised earlier. We simply do not know whether it is true or not, and there is no warrant for assuming that it is not true.20 There is, of course, the risk that a juror would interpret a warning given by a Judge as a hint, despite any other direction that I would give to the jury. So a Judge would not give a 165A warning lightly, because of its possible misinterpretation. Nevertheless, as I keep saying, if Mr Norrie on behalf of the accused had satisfied me that there are circumstances particular to MN that affect the reliability of her evidence, to warrant giving of the warning or information then I would have done so. But for reasons I trust I have explained, Mr Norrie has not overcome the burden which is placed upon him.21 Accordingly I decline to give the direction sought.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Jon Christopher Stacey appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty at the local court to a number of serious offences, all involved the supply of drugs. There was one offence of supply, one offence of ongoing supply, a further offence of supply relating to drugs found in his possession on his arrest, as well as the related matters of dealing with the proceeds of crime and possessing prohibited drug. The supply matters and the dealing with the proceeds of crime matter all relate to the offender’s large scale supplying of the drug ecstasy. The possess prohibited drug matter relates to a single tab of LSD.2 The offender was a user of cocaine. In order to fund that drug use he began supplying drugs. He clearly came to the attention of police who put an undercover officer in contact with him. On 25 June 2009 that officer telephoned the offender and organised to purchase 100 MDMA tablets for $2,200. They met later that day and the purchase took place. That relates to the single act of supply, the subject of the first count that I mentioned. Then on four occasion between 2 July and 29 July, the offender supplied that undercover officer with a large number of other tablets of ecstasy, 600 in total: 200 on 2 July, 100 on 7 July, 100 on 16 July and 200 on 28 July. He was arrested on 6 August. Police found a large quantity of cash in his possession which clearly came to him from drug supply activities. They then executed a search warrant on premises where he was living and found a quantity of MDMA tablets and some powder weighing total of 65.77 grams. The facts do not detail the number of tablets that involves but some basic mathematics allows me to say that there must have been at least the equivalent of 200 tablets given the weights and quantities involved in the offender’s other misconduct. This was, as I said, large scale drug dealing. There are at least 900 tablets either supplied or held by the offender for the purposes of supplying them. The total weight was something in the order of 240 grams, almost twice the commercial quantity applicable to MDMA. 3 It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the sentence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. Despite all the positive things that can be said about the offender, and there are many, it remains the case that the sentence that I ultimately impose upon him has to reflect the gravity of his conduct. To supply 900 tablets in quantities approaching twice the commercial quantity is very serious conduct indeed. It alone demonstrates the inability to accept the submission put on his behalf that ten months in custody is enough. As I mentioned, the offender pleaded guilty at the local court. The sentence I will ultimately impose upon him therefore is twenty-five per cent less than what otherwise have been. 4 The offender is now twenty-one years of age. He has no priors in his criminal history. Apart from drug use and drug supply, he appear to have been a man of prior good character. He had a positive upbringing with the one qualification to that perhaps being the fact that when his parents separated when he was about ten his father moved to Queensland and the offender has had little contact with him thereafter. He was educated to year 10, left school and then has had periods of unemployment, periods of study and periods of work. His behaviour at home deteriorated to the extent that his mother asked him to leave and he did so, and away from the supervision and influence of his mother he began using drugs to a greater extent than he had earlier been. At least in part that may have been because the offender has been diagnosed as suffering from ADD. It is important to distinguish between attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. The symptoms displayed by those who have those two conditions are different. The “H” in ADHD indicates hyperactivity; a person with ADD does not jump around, or find it difficult to sit still and so it is much easier to miss a person suffering from ADD than it is to miss a person suffering from ADHD. It appears that that is what has happened in this case. The offender’s teacher did not realise that he was having difficulty studying, difficulty learning and difficulties at school which may well have related to his ADD condition. 5 The psychiatrist’s report indicates that it is common for those with ADD to find drug use particularly attractive as a means of self medicating for their condition. The offender in those circumstances found himself as a user of cocaine. Since being arrested of course he has ceased drug use and, as is common with cocaine users, did not find that terribly difficult. It remains the case that the offender’s decision to commence and continue drug use was probably related to his attention deficit disorder. That condition, however, has much less to say about the seriously criminal decision the offender took to supply drugs in the quantities he ultimately ended up supplying. 6 The offender was arrested on 6 August 2009 and has been in custody since that date. He has been spending his time in protection because his father used to be a prison officer. It used to be the law that there was almost an automatic reduction when a person served their sentence on protection but that is no longer the case. There is a possibility that the offender will serve the entirety of his sentence on protection and there is a possibility that that will involve harsher conditions of custody than would otherwise be the case. I will take those two possibilities into account in formulating the appropriate sentence. 7 The period of the offender’s criminality was relatively short but there is nothing to indicate that he was other than an enthusiastic supplier of the large quantity of drugs that he did supply. There is nothing of which I have been made aware which suggested that the offender ever paused to consider at the time he was supplying the drugs whether he should do what the undercover officer asked him to do. There was nothing to suggest that he was reluctant in any way. 8 Having been arrested, having been put in gaol, the offender has given up drugs and reflected on what he has done. He has plans for the future, they involve him moving away from the area where he committed these offences, to stay with his grandmother in Newcastle, where he has employment lined up. He has agreed that he will see a psychiatrist and will trial some medication for his ADD. There are thus good prospects for the offender’s future. If he does what he says he will do then he is unlikely to re-offend and he would most likely be able to put this period of his life behind him. 9 There are special circumstances in this case, they relate to the offender’s youth and the fact that this is his first time in custody because it is his first series of offences. Ultimately, however, it remains the case that the offender must be punished, and significantly so, for his high level of drug supply. The offender is sentenced as follows.10 For the offences of supply on 25 June 2009 and the supply on 6 August 2009, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a fixed term of eighteen months in each case to have commenced on 6 August 2009. For the offence of ongoing supply, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a non-parole period of one year to commence on 6 August 2010 and expire on 5 August 2011 and a head sentence of three years. For the offence of dealing with proceeds of crime I set a fixed term of imprisonment of two years to commence on 6 August 2009, and for the possessing the single tab of LSD the offender is dealt with under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I dismiss the backup charge of possessing a prohibited drug. The result is that the offender is to serve a non-parole period of two years with a total sentence of four years. He is eligible to be released to parole on 5 August 2011. I order that the drugs are to be destroyed.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Courtney Howell appeals against three sentences imposed by a magistrate arising out of the events of 22 September 2006. The first is an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment to be served by way of a periodic detention for sixteen months with a non-parole period of ten months. The next offence is one of hinder investigation by police; the appellant also received periodic detention for that matter, this time of nine months with a non-parole period of six months, it being wholly subsumed in the sentence of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm. And finally, there is an offence of assault for which the magistrate imposed a sentence of one month periodic detention, it also being wholly subsumed by the other two matters. 2 On 22 September 2006 the appellant and some friends of his went to a hotel. Also present at the hotel were a group of other people. Both groups seem to have been drinking. An altercation arose. Matters were taken outside, in the course of which the appellant struck a man by the name of John Coonahan to his face. He also struck Mr Foley. The circumstances of the assault on Mr Coonahan, it being assault occasioning actual bodily harm, required close examination. It is common ground that after the appellant struck Mr Coonahan, he was severely assaulted by a friend of the appellant, Matthew Lowe. It is common ground also that in the course of that assault Mr Lowe stomped on Mr Coonahan’s head, rendering him unconscious and leading to a situation where he required brain surgery and has been left with permanent brain damage. 3 In the statement of facts, which were described as agreed facts by both parties in court today, this appears:“Howell turned to Coonahan and punched him with a closed fist to the head, hard enough for him to be knocked to the ground. He hit the ground heavily, some witnesses described his head in fact hitting the ground. The security guard, Naffa Fonmoa, described Coonahan as moving, trying to coordinate himself but was dazed. Howell was restrained by security guard Naffa Fonmoa. Lowe then proceeded to punch Coonahan and stomp on his head a number of times, eventually rendering him unconscious. Due to the earlier punch by Howell, he was unable to shield himself from Lowe”.4 However, in a statement given by the appellant attached to an undertaking to give evidence against Mr Lowe, a somewhat different version of events appears. In contrast to the agreed statement of facts which suggests that after Mr Coonahan was punched by the appellant he was dazed and unable to shield himself, the version given by the appellant in his undertaking is that after he punched Mr Coonahan the latter got up and walked away when Mr Lowe then punched Mr Coonahan in the face causing him to fall to the ground, and it was at that stage that Mr Lowe stomped on his head. I am satisfied that there is a contradiction between the agreed facts and the version given in the appellant’s statement that is attached to his undertaking. It is agreed that in those circumstances, I should sentence the appellant on the basis of the agreed statement of facts and take into account that the appellant, should he give evidence against Mr Lowe, will be cross-examined as to that discrepancy, it being implicit that that would therefore reduce the significance and effectiveness and utility of his assistance. 5 I have to be very careful here because the appellant’s actions in relation to Mr Coonahan were a single punch. He did not stomp on the unfortunate Mr Coonahan, and indeed, the appellant has agreed to give evidence against the person who did. But that is not to say that the events which took place after the appellant punched Mr Coonahan are irrelevant. In a situation where groups of young men are fighting each other, it is entirely foreseeable that one young man will punch another person and an associate of the young man will proceed further, inflicting more violence on the same victim. That is exactly what has happened here. Mr Lowe came after the appellant and took advantage of the state in which the victim had been rendered to inflict further and much more serious violence upon him. But that was only due to the initial punch by the appellant. It is not the case that I should, in effect, put a full-stop in the agreed statement of facts and proceed as though nothing more happened to Mr Coonahan after the appellant punched him. Properly understood, therefore, this matter is a very serious offence. True it is that there was a single punch but its seriousness is, as I have outlined, not to be examined on the basis that all that was involved in the events of that evening were that single punch. 6 The events also represent a significant breach of the peace. There would have been many people at the hotel that evening, trying to have a good time, and the incredibly distressing events would have affected everyone who was present that evening. Pub violence is a matter of great community concern and understandably so. Law abiding citizens are entitled to go out for an evening’s entertainment and an evening socialising without being forced to witness violence of the kind committed by the appellant in this case. 7 The appellant is a man of prior good character, he has no criminal history and references were tendered attesting to his good character. There is, of course, a qualification to his good character which is to be found in fact that after he was involved in the events of this evening, he lied to police, concocted a false alibi and hindered their investigation into establishing the identity of the person who had caused such serious injuries to Mr Coonahan. A person who is truly of good character would not have done those things. A person who is truly of good character would have recognised just how wrong it was for Mr Lowe to have acted the way he did and would have contacted police, or at least not lied to them when the police contacted him. 8 I accept that the appellant is remorseful. I accept that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and that he has undertaken to give evidence against Mr Lowe. That assistance is of course to be recognised by an appropriate discount on a sentence that would otherwise have been imposed. A police officer has described the assistance of being of significance. I will accept that but I do note that this assistance only came about after earlier lies were told to police, only came about after a significant amount of evidence had been marshalled against the appellant, that the versions of events is, as I have mentioned, inconsistent with the agreed facts, and it is not even known whether the appellant will ever be called upon to honour his undertaking, Mr Lowe having flown to New Zealand soon after these events. He has not been charged with anything in relation to his conduct and, as the matter stands at the moment, it is not known whether he ever will be. Nevertheless the appellant has undertaken to give evidence against Mr Lowe in the event that he is charged and faces trial.9 It seems that the appellant pleaded guilty to these matters at an early opportunity, I will therefore consider that the appropriate discount for both assistance and the plea of guilty is thirty-five per cent. 10 Mr Gibson says that this is not a case that a sentence of imprisonment is required. I disagree. This offence was a serious one for the reasons that I have indicated. Even committed by a person with no criminal history, a sentence of imprisonment is required to mark the community’s attitude towards offences of this type in order to deter others who may be tempted to assault others as the appellant has on this occasion. I am, however, like the magistrate, satisfied that the matter should be dealt with by way of periodic detention. I am also satisfied that the periods of imprisonment chosen by the magistrate are appropriate. For my part, I might have been tempted to partially accumulate the sentence for hindering police, but I am not of such a firm view that this was a possibility, therefore I did not give a Parker warning to the appellant. In those circumstances, the orders of the magistrate are confirmed and the appeal is dismissed. The appellant should therefore attend the Parramatta Periodic Detention Centre at 8.30am on 5 April 2008 in order to commence serving his sentence.11 Thank you, Mr Gibson, your client will just have to be taken into custody for a short time by Corrective Services authorities.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Liang Gary Xu comes before me for sentence on two completely separate matters. One of them is a most serious offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. That carries with it a maximum penalty of twenty-five years and a standard non-parole period of seven years. The other offence is an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely 2.8 kilograms of cannabis. That carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment with no standard non-parole period.2 I will begin these remarks by saying something about the standard non-parole period in this case. The various offences which carry with them standard non-parole periods have widely disproportionate ratios between the standard non-parole period and the maximum penalty. This has led to some difficulty as sentencing judges attempt to comply with the various statutory and common law requirements concerning sentencing. One particular difficulty which arises in the present case is that sentencing judges have to be careful not to focus only on the standard non-parole period and ignore the maximum penalty. I have borne both of those statutory constraints in mind in the present case.3 The offender was a student studying cooking in Australia. He had previously been studying accountancy at Macquarie University. He was born in China and came to Australia via New Zealand primarily it would seem for the purpose of educating himself, although the New Zealand to Australia leg of the journey may have been more for an emotional reason.4 Leading up to this offence he suffered from two significant circumstances which the evidence might suggest caused him to begin to drink more than he should and to start taking drugs. His father died and he broke up with his girlfriend. Mr Boulton said that this led to the offender entering something of a downward spiral. That may well be the case, but as remains obvious, most people who suffer losses of this type and who begin to drink more than they should and who even take drugs, do not end up stabbing innocent people and causing serious injury to them.5 The events of 6 November 2008 are somewhat confusing. It appears that the offender was with a group of friends when he became aware of a dispute between a number of other people, in particular two women. This disputing became violent and the victim of this matter, Mr Zhou, attempted to separate the two women. A number of other friends of Mr Zhou were also about to step in to try and separate the two women when they were approached by an Asian man. This was a man by the name of Zheng who I will sentence immediately after sentencing the present offender. Mr Zheng was holding a knife approximately twenty-five centimetres long. He warned Mr Zhou and his friends not to become involved.6 At this point Mr Zhou fell over, falling onto a roadway along with the two women. The offender Mr Xu is then seen on closed-circuit television. He was also armed with a knife. I mentioned before that he was studying cooking in Australia. As part of his cooking course he was required to purchase a number of knives and at some point before he was captured on the closed-circuit television it is clear that, having become aware of the altercation, he decided to arm himself with one of the knives from his cooking set.7 The offender took steps to stop Mr Zhou assisting one of the women involved in the altercation. He pushed him and Mr Zhou went backwards. Mr Zheng, who it will be recalled was also armed with a knife, began to swing his right arm towards Mr Zhou’s torso. Mr Zhou continued to move backwards away from the offender and his co-offender Mr Zheng. At this stage the CCTV camera moves away from recording the incident, however what is clear is that Mr Zhou was stabbed by both this offender, Mr Xu, and his co-offender, Mr Zheng, a significant number of times.8 It is impossible of course to work out who did what, but it does not matter. As Mr Boulton, senior counsel who appeared for Mr Xu concedes, his client is criminally responsible for all wounds, no matter who inflicted them upon Mr Zhou.9 Immediately after the offence Mr Xu dumped the knife he had. It may well be that Mr Zheng was injured in some way in the melee and Mr Xu took him to hospital. Also taken to hospital was Mr Zhou. He suffered from a number of serious slash and puncture wounds. One of the wounds perforated his bowel, whilst the other wounds narrowly missed a number of vital organs. 10 The ferocity of the attack can be seen by considering the injuries which were observed when Mr Zhou was taken to hospital. The evidence regarding that is to be found in the statement of one of the doctors who treated him. Mr Zhou was found to have a thirty centimetre laceration to his left chest, two thirty centimetre lacerations to his left upper abdomen, a ten centimetre laceration to his mid left abdomen, a one to two centimetre deep penetrating laceration to his lower right abdominal flank. That was found to be penetrating his peritoneal cavity. He had a one centimetre laceration to his left shoulder, an eight centimetre deep laceration to his right lower back and other comparatively small but nevertheless serious lacerations to his back, his left buttock, his left thigh, his right elbow, his right forearm and his left little finger. Mr Zhou spent almost a week in hospital recovering from his wounds.11 As police were investigating this matter they intercepted a number of telephone calls. This provided clear evidence as to the involvement in the offence of both Mr Xu and his co-offender. They obtained a search warrant in relation to the premises where Mr Xu was living. When they went there they found the remaining knives from Mr Xu’s cooking set and also a large quantity of cannabis, packaged in such a way and with other paraphernalia suggesting the drugs were to be supplied.12 The cannabis when weighed was found to be 2.771 kilograms in the offender’s possession. He has now pleaded guilty to an offence of supplying that cannabis, although it has been his version of events asserted repeatedly that the drugs were for his own use. Of course that cannot be accepted given his plea of guilty.13 The offender was born in China and is now twenty-seven years of age. He was brought up in a poor household and as Dr Borenstein’s report reveals, his upbringing was characterised by separation from his parents and the lack of male input. He went to boarding school, finishing high school and then went to New Zealand for the purposes of further study at the age of twenty.14 He was socially isolated and inexperienced with members of the opposite sex. He met his first girlfriend in New Zealand and they remained together for some time. She moved to Australia and Mr Xu followed. As I mentioned before, his relationship with his girlfriend ended. This was in early 2007. It was then that he began to drink and abuse drugs. His problems were exacerbated of course after his father died.15 Mr Xu has been seen by the psychologist and a psychiatrist. None of the findings of either suggest that any psychiatric or other condition of the offender significantly contributed to his offending, nor do they suggest that because of those matters his time in custody will be harder than it would otherwise be.16 I turn now to one of the most important matters concerning the sentence to be imposed on Mr Xu. It is a matter where I exercise considerable circumspection and not say, nor even refer to obliquely, a number of matters which are highly significant to the ultimate sentence to be imposed.17 I will content myself with saying this. The offender has assisted in the past and undertaken to assist in the future, the authorities. His assistance has been assessed. As a result of his assistance he has received threats and his safety is at risk. The assistance is of high order. It concerns two completely distinct matters; the matter for which he is to be sentenced today and another one where three offenders have been charged with very serious offences indeed.18 As a result of that assistance he is serving his sentence on protection and it is likely, I find, that he will serve the entirety of his sentence in such a manner and there is a real risk that that will involve conditions of custody that are more onerous than in the general prison population.19 Of recent time the Court of Criminal Appeal has provided significant assistance to judges of this and other courts concerning the appropriate discounts for such matters. Of course that discount encompasses a discount for pleading guilty, as the offender did, at the earliest opportunity. The Crown does not dispute that this is a matter which justifies a discount of fifty per cent. Mr Boulton suggested that a discount of a higher order was appropriate, but in my view this is not one of those rare cases where a discount beyond fifty per cent is appropriate.20 In any case the sentence that I impose must bear a reasonable relationship to the gravity of the offender’s conduct. The legislature accepts that a discount for assistance will lead to a situation where that may not be the case, but the ultimate constraint to be found in s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act must be borne in mind. That is that the sentence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offender’s misconduct.21 It is clear that the offender is remorseful for what he has done. Perhaps the best evidence of that is his assistance, but there is other evidence as well; his immediate plea of guilt and a letter that he has written to the victim. I am satisfied that the offender is sorry for his actions which have led to Mr Zhou suffering such serious injuries.22 I take into account that this is not a case where Mr Xu’s knives were carried with him habitually as weapons. They were, as I have repeatedly stated, legitimate tools of trade that he was using as part of his cookery course. On the other hand there seems to have been some time between the offender’s decision to arm himself with one of those knives and his decision to stab Mr Zhou. This was not a case where Mr Xu’s offending was spontaneous. He had to return to his car to get his knives. The time between his decision to get the knives and stabbing was short indeed.23 I am required to assess the objective seriousness of the offender’s misconduct for the purposes of determining the relevance of the standard non-parole period for the s 33 offence. I take into account that Mr Zhou was confronted by two men, both armed with knives. The injuries were serious and whilst almost all of the offences of this type involve serious injuries, the number and nature of the wounds was also more than would usually be expected in an offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 24 On the other hand the circumstance that the knives were opportunistically to hand rather than being habitually carried is a matter that clearly works in the offender’s favour. In objective terms I am satisfied that this offence is slightly above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.25 The offender has no prior criminal history either here or in China. I am satisfied that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to offend in the future. There are special circumstances in this case. It will be his first time in custody and as he will most likely be serving his entire sentence on protection, it is probable that he will have less access to courses, counselling and the like than would otherwise be the case.26 Another thing I should say about his conditions of custody, it of course affects not only the non-parole period but the overall head sentence as well, is that because he is a native Mandarin speaker and because his English is limited, he finds himself somewhat socially isolated in custody where his association with other prisoners is limited to others in a similar situation to him.27 Mr Boulton points out that despite what seems to be at first blush a large quantity of cannabis, almost all offences of this type are dealt with in the Local Court. Of course the supply cannabis matter is being dealt with in this court, it would seem, because of the other matter which can only be dealt with here. The quantity involved is less than one-tenth of the commercial quantity and the maximum penalty for a cannabis matter is significantly less than offences involving other drugs. Nevertheless as Mr Boulton concedes, the two offences are completely separate and there must be some measure of accumulation, although the principle of totality obviously applies.28 Mr Xu is sentenced as follows. For the offence of supplying cannabis, I impose a fixed term of twelve months imprisonment to date from the date of his arrest, 8 April 2009. That is a fixed term because of the sentence I will impose on the other matter.29 For the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 8 October 2009. It will expire on 7 April 2012 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of four and a half years for that matter, which means that the overall sentence is one consisting of the non-parole period of three years and a head sentence of five years.30 Mr Xu did you understand that sentence? Would you like me to repeat it to you? I’ll repeat it to you. The effective sentence, which is I’m sure what you’re interested in, is that you will serve at least three years in prison dating from the date of your arrest. So that means the earliest date you can be released is 7 April 2012. You may be released on that date, but that will be a decision for the parole board and not me.31 LYDIARD: Your Honour just in relation to the discount for future assistance--32 HIS HONOUR: I know that - if you want me to say something about it, I will. I know that the authorities say that where possible a judge should - if this was a Commonwealth matter I would have no alternative, but I do have an alternative. In my view to say that a judge is capable of dividing up assistance into past and future with precision is simply wrong. It has to be done and the courts do the best they can where people do not comply with their undertakings. But to suggest that it can be done in every case before we know whether someone is going to comply with their undertaking or not is to suggest mathematical precision which is inappropriate. So I’m not going to. If Mr Xu does not comply with his undertaking, I apologise to the Court of Criminal Appeal. They will have to work it out.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Alexander Carl Parkes appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty to an offence of being an accessory after the fact to an offence of break enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation. The circumstance of aggravation was that the principal offender Mr Shearer was in company with this offender Mr Parkes. So Mr Parkes’ involvement in the offence was, according to the indictment, that he was an accessory after an offence that he was involved in as the primary offender, he having been in company with Mr Shearer. 2 This may well be yet another case of creative plea bargaining in which representatives of the Crown seem to regard it as a challenge to give interesting legal problems to District Court Judges. I mean no criticism at all of the present representative of the Crown, I can tell from the signature on the indictment that he is not the person responsible for the present form of the indictment. Nevertheless despite the creative nature of the offence to which Mr Parkes has pleaded guilty I am able to sentence him. 3 The circumstances of the offence are that on 4 July last year Mr Shearer and Mr Parkes went to a residential home in North Narrabeen. When they got there the offender performed the role of the cockatoo waiting outside the premises whilst Mr Shearer went inside. He broke in by forcing some locks and he began to remove electrical equipment. There were people at home and one of them was attracted by the noise of what was going on. 4 The two occupants of the house confronted Mr Shearer. He reacted by pulling a syringe from the right-hand pocket of his tracksuit pants. At that stage he was being held but the person holding him released him as soon as the syringe was presented. Whilst all this was going on, this offender was watching through the front doors. After Mr Shearer was able to make good his escape by presenting the syringe he and the offender ran away. They were arrested soon afterwards. The offender spent one day in custody following his arrest. 5 The offender is now thirty-two years of age. He has been a heavy drug user and a heavy consumer of alcohol at times, however, there have been periods of abstinence as well. Unfortunately those periods of abstinence have been followed by relapses as in the present case. On 4 July 2006 the offender was a drug user and was at that stage drinking heavily. He had undergone some rehabilitation programs before then and they were successful for a short time. It was the fact that the offender relapsed and needed money for drugs which led to the present offence being committed. Even though the offender has pleaded guilty to be an accessory to the offence of Mr Shearer it remains a very serious matter. The maximum penalty for the offence is twenty years imprisonment although there is no standard non-parole period because of the accessorial nature of the offender’s liability. Quite recently the offender has commenced working again. At the time of the preparation of the pre-sentence report he was not working and had a certificate indicating that he was unable to work due to mental illness issues. However, about five weeks ago the offender started working for a removalist. He is not in regular employment, he turns up in the morning, if work is available it is given to him. Nevertheless, the fact that he is working when he can is a very important matter which I have taken into account. This is the offender’s first employment in nine months. He is also at the moment attending the Northern Beaches Mental Health Service. There are prospects of rehabilitation which could easily be undone. 6 Of course the fact remains that I must impose a sentence which reflects the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. It is notorious that those who are the victims of such offences feel less safe in their own homes. Even though the financial loss to the victims of the offence was limited, the emotional consequences I am sure are considerable and long lasting. 7 The offender needs to have imposed upon him a sentence which does not lead to him having a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares that sentence with the sentence I earlier imposed on Mr Shearer. I sentenced him to imprisonment setting a non-parole period of eighteen months, with a head sentence of three years. When I compare Mr Shearer’s case with the present I notice that Mr Shearer had a criminal record which was much worse. There was a standard non-parole period attached to his offence and because he was the one who went into the house and removed the property, his involvement was much deeper. 8 Perhaps of most importance is the circumstance that Mr Shearer was armed and produced the weapon with which he was armed upon being confronted by the home owners. The offender is not to be sentenced on that basis. There is no charge in relation to Mr Shearer being armed, there is no material before me to suggest that he was aware that Mr Shearer was, firstly, armed and, secondly, would produce the syringe as a weapon when confronted. Those circumstances suggest that the offender should receive a lesser sentence than that imposed on Mr Shearer. The offender pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and so I would discount the sentence by approximately twenty five per cent to reflect that circumstance. 9 When sentencing Mr Shearer I noted that although the circumstances of aggravation relied on was that he was in company, the Crown could have also relied on the circumstance that there were people in the home at the time. I refer to s 105A(2)(a) of the Crimes Act. In that regard that circumstance also applies to this offender. The offence must also have been planned to the extent that roles had to be allocated, the offender performing the role of the lookout. 10 The offender has expressed his remorse for what he did that day. I cannot say that the offender is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. Certainly there are prospects of rehabilitation but whether the offender rehabilitates or not is largely a matter under his control. Earlier I said that it is important that if possible that steps that the offender has taken towards rehabilitating himself are not undone, although it is clear that a custodial sentence is required. I am satisfied that that sentence is at such a level that I can suspend that term of imprisonment. In that regard I note the head sentence of three years imposed on Mr Shearer in circumstances where Mr Shearer deserves to be punished more harshly than Mr Parkes. 11 I am therefore satisfied that I should sentence the offender to imprisonment for a period of two years. But under s12 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act I order suspension of the imprisonment for a period of two years today upon the offender entering into a good behaviour bond for that period. The conditions applying during the term of the bond are as follows. The offender is to be of good behaviour. He is to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and obey all their reasonable directions. He is to attend courses, counselling and the like as required by the Probation and Parole Service and he is to continue to attend the Northern Beaches Mental Health Service at the Queenscliff Community Health Centre and comply with treatment suggested by them. In order to commence the process by which the offender is to be supervised., he is to attend the Dee Why District office of the Probation and Parole Service within five days of today. 12 HIS HONOUR: Anything else Mr Elks, Mr Crown.13 ELKS: No your Honour.14 KIMBELL: No your Honour.15 HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Parkes would you mind telling me your address.16 OFFENDER: ………17 HIS HONOUR: …… and the suburb, …….wasn’t It? ……. Mr Parkes you have heard what I’ve just said about the bond that you’re on?18 OFFENDER: ..(not transcribable).. a suspended sentence means that I’m on that good behaviour bond for a period, if I commit another crime I get done for that crime no matter what sentence is made. Plus added to that is the remaining time of the suspended sentence.19 HIS HONOUR: Close. If you commit an offence or breach this bond in any other way you’ll go to goal for two years. Assume that a year from now you commit an offence, you don’t go to gaol for a year, you go to gaol for two years. 20 OFFENDER: Yes.21 HIS HONOUR: Okay, it’s hanging over your head for two years. Now it’s not only committing another offence that could lead you into gaol, it’s also breaching the bond in other ways. So if you, for example, fail to accept the supervision of Probation and Parole Service and you don’t comply with the bond in that respect you can go to gaol, understand?22 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.23 HIS HONOUR: Mr Parkes I just have to ask you, do you agree to be bound by the conditions of the bond that I’ve announced?24 OFFENDER: I agree your Honour .25 HIS HONOUR: Good thank you. The bond will be posted out to you at ………. It is very important Mr Parkes for your benefit that you do what is required under the bond. In particular, to start with, you’ve got to go to the Dee Why office of Probation and Parole Service within five days. So that’s early next week do you understand?26 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.27 HIS HONOUR: You then have to do whatever they tell you to do. If you do this for two years then you won’t go to gaol. If however you breach the bond then you will go to gaol and you know whose fault that will be.28 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.29 HIS HONOUR: It will be yours won’t it?30 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.31 ADJOURNED

   JUDGMENT1. On 27 August 2009 the accused appeared before his Honour Judge Sorby. He was arraigned on an indictment containing seven counts and pleaded not guilty to each count. At that time his Honour stood the matter over for trial to commence on Monday 23 November with an estimate of three to four days. On 23 November 2009 I was allocated the matter for trial. The indictment contains seven charges, three of them aggravated indecent assault, three of them aggravated sexual assault and one of them incite an act of indecency. 2. When the matter came on for hearing Mr O’Sullivan of counsel who appears for the accused raised the question of fitness in the sense that he expressed concern that his client may not be fit to be tried. It became abundantly clear during the discussion (if I can just describe it that way) that then followed, that the accused was not a party to making any application for an inquiry as to his fitness. 3. But bearing in mind Mr O’Sullivan’s role as an officer of the court, his duties to the court and other matters that were raised at that time, I indicated that I would like the accused to be assessed by properly trained forensic psychiatrists for the purpose of determining whether he would be fit for trial or not. It was also made clear to me at that point in time that the accused was unwilling to be so assessed. 4. Concerned that the court may be putting someone on trial who may not have reached the appropriate minimum standards of mental health or awareness of issues, I invited Mr O’Sullivan and his instructing solicitor, Mr Quinn, to consider whether they thought it was appropriate for an affidavit to be put on- without breaching any instructions, or at least getting some advice as to whether ethically they could reveal such matters as had passed between them and the accused on the question of the accused’s fitness or, more importantly, unfitness to be tried. 5. That was done on 27 November. I then stood it over to today’s date 30 November in order to give to Mr Quinn an opportunity to determine whether he would wish to put on an affidavit. 6. Today an affidavit has been tendered. A copy of the indictment to which the accused pleaded guilty has been also tendered before me. Today I have embarked upon an inquiry of my own motion as to whether the accused is fit to be tried or not. He has at these hearings still been represented by both his solicitor and Mr O’Sullivan. 7. The inquiry, brief as it was, was conducted in a non adversarial manner. Neither party carries an onus of proving unfitness. Neither party strictly speaking have sought the ruling. Mr O’Sullivan, because he lacks instructions so to do, and the crown because, so far as he is concerned, it is a matter, in a sense, for someone other than he, if I can put it that way. That’s not to say he’s not concerned but he has made no particular application. 8. The court’s task however is now to determine whether the accused be unfit to be tried. That is a matter that I would have to determine on the balance of probabilities. 9. The reason the court is concerned as to whether an accused be unfit to be tried is because each person coming to be tried must measure up to certain minimum standards of mental understanding and mental health. To try, in a criminal trial, in our system of justice, an accused who does not reach those minimum standards would result in an intolerable unfairness and injustice to him. 10. As I consider whether Mr Rush is unfit, there are a number of matters I am required to assess. The starting point is one that is in his favour, in the sense that the presumption is, he is not unfit to be tried, or putting it so he can understand it, he is fit to be tried. Therefore, his unfitness is the matter that will need to be proved on the balance of probabilities on the evidence before me. 11. I also begin by accepting that qualified and competent lawyers will legally represent him at trial. The minimum standards I am concerned with are not those needed for an accused to represent himself at trial. He will become unfit to be tried because of a mental defect should he fail to come up to certain minimum standards which he need to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him. See The Queen v Presser [1958] VR 45 at p48. There was also another case mentioned to me. R v Tigger unreported [2001] NSW CCA 53. 12. The question of an accused’s unfitness to be tried is not limited to unfitness by reason of mental illness or mental disorder and is not to the exclusion of developmental or intellectual capacity, The Queen v Mailes (2001) 53 NSW LR 251. It is not a question to be determined on the mental state at the time of the alleged offence but rather his mental state or mental fitness now. See R v Dennison NSW CCA Unreported 3 March 1988. 13. The issues that I must be concerned with are these. The accused should be able to understand the nature and alleged circumstances of the charges brought against him so as to formulate his plea to them. The crown case has been tendered and is Exhibit 3. The Crown Case14. Shortly put, all seven charges arise, says the crown out of one episode or event that occurred on Saturday 6 September 1997 against a young person, JPR, 13 at the time of the offences. On that occasion he was staying overnight at somebody’s place. He decided to go for a walk. He had a headache and so he went outside by himself. He ended up in an area of bushland down the very same street, not far, I assume, from where the party was. On the crown case he was in the bush there somewhere and the accused saw him. They did not know each other. The accused threatened him and during their interchange which lasted, I would say not for long, put his hand down the victim’s tracksuit pants and stroked the alleged victim’s penis, made the alleged victim put his hands in the air, pulled down his pants and, licked the boy’s penis which he then put in his mouth and sucked. On the crown case there were a requirement that the victim was required to say, “No-one will know about it”. 15. The accused is then alleged to have taken his own pants down and sought to place the boy’s penis into his anus. On the crown case the boy’s penis penetrated his anus, but the boy was unable to maintain an erection. He was told to masturbate himself which he did for some two minutes. The accused also masturbated himself standing before the victim. The accused fellated the victim at a time when the boy was about to ejaculate. The victim ejaculated, on the crown case, into the accused’s mouth. The accused then required, on the crown case, the victim to masturbate him and ejaculated upon the ground. Thereafter the victim was allowed to leave. The Presser Test16. The evidence before me does not make clear one way or the other whether the accused has an inability to understand the nature of the charges or the circumstances in which they are said to have occurred. In those circumstances the presumption goes in his favour, that he does so recall those things. 17. He should have a capacity to determine whether it is in his forensic interests to seek to be tried by a judge sitting alone; assuming the crown should so consent, or by a jury. The likelihood of one or the other being taken up has not been canvassed before me and, again, in those circumstances the presumption must be in favour of the accused that he would have that capacity. 18. The accused should be capable of sensibly exercising his right to challenge a panel member from joining the jury. Challenging a potential juror requires firstly an understanding that each juror participates with others in determining whether the crown has brought evidence sufficient to prove charges beyond a reasonable doubt. All this requires that an accused, at least intuitively, base his or her challenge upon the notion that he will leave on the jury persons he feels are likely to regard his case more favourably and strike off those potential jurors he feels are likely to regard his case less sympathetically. That is to say, that his choice of jurors should, at some level, be related to his hope for outcome of the case and not upon some matter unrelated to the outcome of the trial; such as, that he likes the look of one person or that some other person smiled at him. Challenging a potential juror requires a capacity to form a view that there may well be something about the appearance or presence of a potential juror to allow that juror to form a view that he would prefer, or at the very least would not prefer, deliberations to be made by that person on the panel. 19. On that score there is no evidence. It is a much more complicated task and true it is, or can be, delegated to counsel. Nonetheless it is important that an accused be able to exercise challenges personally so that in the event he felt the need to do so he could withdraw the delegation or at least indicate that he did not agree with the proposed challenge or non-challenge prior to the opportunity passing. The evidence is silent on this. While, particularly from interventions made by the accused to me, I have some concern about it, frankly as I analyse the interventions, none of them really did bear upon that issue to the extent that I could put aside the presumption in his favour. That is, on that score at least, that he would be fit to be tried. 20. An accused should be able to follow the course of proceedings so as to understand what is going on. That is, he will need to understand at some level that the proceedings are a formal inquiry conducted before a presiding judge and usually a jury. If there is no jury he will need to understand the judge is the tribunal of both law and fact. He will need to understand the prosecutor is tasked with presenting evidence in support of the crown allegations; that defence counsel is tasked with answering those allegations as best they can be answered. He will understand that the tribunal of fact, however constituted, is tasked with determining whether the prosecution has proved from the evidence in the trial, the allegations or any of them made in the charges. 21. In respect of that matter I must say, that particularly bearing in mind some of the intervention and some of the material contained in the affidavit of Mr Quinn, I have some reservations. I will come to the relevant parts of the allegation - of the affidavit that are of concern to me overall shortly. But it will be seen that they certainly can bear upon the capacity of the accused to conceive that the jury’s task or the tribunal of facts task is determining whether the prosecution has proved from the evidence in the trial the allegations it’s making in the charges. 22. In following the course of proceedings the accused must be able to follow the evidence and have at least a rudimentary understanding of the reception of evidence adverse to him, whether orally or by exhibits, and have some concept of the effect of the cross-examination. For the purposes of the Presser tests I am prepared to accept that the accused does have at least a rudimentary understanding of those matters. 23. The accused must be capable of giving instructions to his legal representative both prior to and during the trial so that his lawyers can properly defend him in the proceedings. He must be able to decide what defence he will rely upon. He must be able to make out that defence, not in the sense of persuading the jury to accept it, but in the sense of articulating it so that his counsel and the court can understand it. He must be capable of articulating his defence so that he has a meaningful option to enter the witness box should he so choose. Simply put, he must be able to make his version of the facts known to both his counsel and the court. This may require some assessment of his capacity to give evidence-in-chief and to submit to cross-examination. It certainly does require some assessment of his capacity to tell his own solicitors his side of the “story”. In that area I must say that I have come to a view adverse to the accused. 24. The affidavit of Brian Quinn was sworn on 27 November 2009, that is last Friday. At paragraph 4 Mr Quinn says on 26 August  
     
      
      “I had some difficulty in obtaining instructions from Mr Rush and while he was aware he was facing criminal charges he believed them to be backup charges for offences he had previously been sentenced on and for which he had already served a term of imprisonment”.  
       
      
     Paragraph 5,  
     
      
      “I tried to take Mr Rush through the counts but he would not be drawn on any of the specific alleged events and stated that he wanted to go to trial.” 
       
       
      
    25. There was then some discussion about the accused’s mental health and whether he had been diagnosed with any psychiatric conditions to which he said “No”. There was some other discussion about an irrelevant matter, that is, a matter which had kept him in custody on a previous occasion, but in the circumstances of that he could not remember whether he’d been seen by a psychiatrist; but he didn’t want to see one on 26 August. 26. On 27 August Mr Quinn spoke to Mr Rush where ability to communicate on that occasion seemed to have improved. On 23 September he received a letter from Mr Rush requesting assistance from him as a solicitor to deal with a request for some new prison issue shoes and to organise photographs of his feet “for his case file”. Mr Quinn says in his affidavit that he was not sure what the accused meant when he referred to “his case file” but wrote to the governor on behalf of the accused. 27. On 20 and 21 October 2009 Mr Quinn received telephone calls from the welfare staff at Parklea Gaol. On the first of those two occasions he spoke to Mr Rush about his feet and shoes and on the second, contacted the Deputy’s office at Parklea. On 6 November he, with his counsel Mr O’Sullivan, went to Parklea and saw the accused. On this occasion Mr Rush was more focussed on a number of issues relating to his health and his treatment or allegations of mistreatment by various government departments over the years than the proceedings. He showed Mr Quinn, and I assume Mr O’Sullivan, his feet and various parts of his torso asking him to note the appearances of a rash. The accused expressed disappointment that there was no camera there to photograph the points of interest on his body he was pointing to. There were apparently lumps on the feet such as calluses and small spots, limited in number, on the torso. Mr Quinn was unable to understand what and why he was being asked to look at in relation to this case, or any other matter as I understand it. 28. Mr O’Sullivan deposes that in relation to the criminal matters Mr Rush, after having the benefit of Mr O’Sullivan’s opinion on the crown case, repeated his desire to take the matter to trial. The question of psychiatric assessment was raised and the accused indicated he did not wish to be assessed. 29. On 20 November there was a telephone call from the Legal Aid Office at Gosford which had received a letter from Mr Rush. There was some suggestion in the letter that Mr Rush no longer wanted Mr Quinn to represent him at trial. 30. On 23 November Mr O’Sullivan and Mr Quinn spoke to Rush about his wishes. That you will recall was the day fixed for trial. On that day Mr Rush indicated he was concerned with a number of things not the least of which was his outstanding civil matters. As to whether they exist or not, the evidence is unclear. He was also upset about personal belongings that had gone astray between the time of his arrest earlier this year and his appearance at court and having to wear prison greens. He also indicated that he was not ready for court as he had not spoken to his solicitor and given his solicitor instructions. Mr Quinn pointed out to Mr Rush that he was the solicitor and that both O’Sullivan and he had previously spoken to him. The affidavit continues,  
     
      
       “...Mr Rush acknowledged my presence but went on to restate that he was not ready for trial and that he wanted an adjournment until March or April next year”.  
       
      
     Paragraph 17,  
     
      
      “Mr Rush, when asked a number of specific questions by Mr O’Sullivan about the charges said, “I told you what happened. That’s it. I’m not answering any more of your questions. I’m going to tell them what happened and that’s it”.  
       
       
      
    31. My sense of the situation is that up to this point in time neither Mr Quinn nor Mr O’Sullivan were possessed of any account of events that occurred on 6 September 1997, one way or the other.  Paragraph 18, 
     
      
       
      “Mr Rush then signalled his intention to tell the jury about his prior criminal history and the fact that he had been in gaol for the first [as said- read “last”] ten years, to explain the delay in bringing these charges and to also tell the jury about some other matters which would prejudice his case (that latter portion being the opinion of his solicitor). Mr Rush, despite our lengthy explanation as to why it would not be in his interests to make such disclosures, just restated his intention to tell the jury that he had been in prison and that these charges were backup charges”. 
       
       
      
    32. In paragraph 19 Mr Quinn comes to the view that there had been a marked decline in Mr Rush’s presentation and his apparent ability to understand what was being said to him over the last few weeks. As a consequence of that view his concerns about the accused’s mental state were considerably heightened. It was Mr Quinn’s view that neither he nor Mr O’Sullivan could make the accused understand that if he were to make the abovementioned disclosures during the trial to the jury he would seriously prejudice his position. “He did not understand that he needed to provide us with a cogent and considered response to the allegations”, says Mr Quinn, and refused to provide anything but general comments about “telling his version of events relating to these charges”. 33. It seemed to Mr Quinn that Mr Rush was aware of his surroundings and what he was at court for, and what he was to face court for and there would be a judge and jury present and that the evidence about the allegations would be led. “However, the accused did not or would not accept the concerns”, says Mr Quinn, “raised by Mr O’Sullivan and I. He would not provide instructions that would enable us to properly conduct his defence”. Para 22 is in these terms and I will quote it: 
     
      
      “In some general sense Mr Rush spoke about the alleged victim and himself as if they were both still involved in some ongoing relationship and that they were aware of each other’s thoughts and wishes, both at the time of the alleged incident and now in the present time”. 
       
      
    In the course of his submission Mr O'Sullivan said to me that, based on what he knew of his instructions and what he knew generally about the case, that was an unreal proposition. I interpolate that I fear it is one based upon fantasy.34. In para 24 Mr Quinn forms the opinion that Mr Rush is suffering from some mental condition that strongly suggests that he either does not understand what he is charged with or if he does understand the nature of the charges, he cannot respond appropriately to the charges and provide cogent and comprehensible instructions to allow his version of the events to be properly put. It is on that score then; that is his capacity to make his version of the facts known to both his counsel and the court; that I come to a view he fails that aspect of the Presser test.35. As to his capacity to sustain his participation in the trial for its duration, I have no evidence one way or the other and that is a matter where the presumption must go his way.36. A person will be unfit to be tried where one or more of these matters is outside the capacity of the person because of some mental defect. It is that last portion that causes me some concern, particularly as the accused will not submit to a forensic mental examination. But I can see no other basis for the defect. He appears otherwise to be in good health. There is no explanation other than that it must be some mental defect that is causing his incapacity to give instructions. There is no suggestion he has lost his memory. There is no suggestion of some blackout or some coma. There is no suggestion of any amnesia. There is no suggestion of any gross or extreme intellectual impairment. The only available explanation is some unidentified mental condition or mental defect is causing the inability of the accused to give instructions to his solicitors and articulating a defence that can be available for him.37. As recently as half an hour ago I asked for some indication from the accused through his counsel as to whether he was now prepared to accept a forensic mental assessment. He has indicated that he is not willing so to do. In those circumstances I am not able to order one. I cannot compel him as I understand such powers as I have, to attend any medical mental health assessment. The best that I can do is to urge his cooperation. He refuses to so do. Whether that also is symptomatic of some illness or just simply a fear of what may happen, I cannot determine. But in all the circumstances on the balance of probabilities, confined solely to the evidence before me, I have come to a view that as presently advised, he is not fit to be tried.38. That then requires me to take some steps, does it not. I think the first of them is that I must refer him to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. I must adjourn the proceedings and I must await a report from the Mental Health Review Tribunal. I may remand him in custody until the determination of the Tribunal had been given. 39. The formal orders I make are these, Shayne Charles Rush, having been found by me to be unfit to be tried, is referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. These proceedings are adjourned generally. The accused is remanded in custody until the determination of the tribunal has been given effect to. 40. I should tell you Mr Rush that the tribunal will seek to determine - hopefully you may cooperate with them where you have not with me - but they will seek to determine whether the situation of your being unfit will last for more than a year. If it is not likely to last for more than a year, then your trial will be rescheduled once you become fit. If it is likely to last for more than a year then you will be given what is called a trial on limited evidence. The limited hearing is comprised of evidence which is usually regarded as limited because of your inability to instruct. So that one way or the other this matter will be determined hopefully within the year. If you become fit within the year it will be that way. If you do not become fit and the Tribunal comes to the view you will not become fit, then it will be a hearing on the limited evidence.41. All right. Any other order I need to make?  STEWART: No your Honour.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Martin Gillies appears for sentence today after he pleaded guilty at an early time to an offence of ongoing supply of ecstasy. When I sentence him for that he asks that I take into account other related offences on a Form 1. They are: dealing with property which was suspected to be the proceeds of crime, (the amount involved being $6,050); supplying cannabis; and possessing cannabis, (the supply relating to 306.4 grams and the possession relating to 6.7 grams).2 The offender was contacted by undercover police on 6 December 2007. The undercover officer indicated a desire to purchase some ecstasy tablets. He said that one of the “Dublin Boys” had given had given the offender’s number to him. They therefore met and after some negotiations regarding price and quantity the offender supplied the undercover officer with fifteen ecstasy tablets, the officer paying $450 for those tablets. Further transactions occurred. On 13 December the undercover officer bought fifty tablets for $1,250. On 28 December the officer bought 101 ecstasy tablets for $2100. On 2 January he bought 200 tablets for $3,900. In total, the offender supplied to the undercover officer 366 tablets weighing a total of 109.9 grams. Of course this is an offence of an ongoing supply of drugs but in order to assess the objective seriousness of the offence it is relevant to note that the commercial quantity of ecstasy is 125 grams. So the offender supplied in total just under what would have been a commercial quantity of ecstasy tablets.3 The offender was arrested a short time after the final act of supplying. He was searched and the money that I have referred to earlier was found and cannabis weighing 6.7 grams was found in his shorts. The offender was taken to hospital as a result of concerns about his medical condition. Whilst he was there police searched his home and discovered more money, $5,450, clearly the results of drug supply, more cannabis, this time 306.4 grams which forms the basis of the supply charge on the Form 1, a set of digital scales and several mobile phones. It is clear that the offender was an enthusiastic and successful drug supplier. This is a most serious offence.4 Nor was the offender only supplying at street level quantities. He was prepared to involve himself fairly high up the drug supply chain which is obvious from the fact that he was prepared to supply on the last occasion 200 ecstasy tablets. 5 The offender was born in New Zealand, he was raised in Rotarua and is of Maori descent. He had a positive and supportive upbringing. He came to Australia in 1970 and had a relationship with an Australian woman; they have one son who is now thirty-five years of age living in Queensland. He is no longer with the mother of his son and at the time of preparation of a pre-sentence report he lived in boarding house accommodation in Double Bay. He has been in a casual relationship with a woman for the past eight years. He is now sixty years of age. He has been unemployed for a long time because of health issues. He did work when he was able to, but, as I said, his health issues have prevented him doing so recently.6 He has a number of medical conditions. He has severe asthma which is unstable, requires regular prevention and intermittent doses of steroids. His asthma attacks occasionally lead to inpatient hospital stays. He has severe arthritis effecting many of his joints. Surgical intervention has been contemplated but cardiovascular respiratory issues have been a factor in deferring such intervention. He has ischemic heart disease, although his cardiac condition is considered stable at the moment. A report tendered on behalf of the offender suggests that there should be no impact on the offender’s health whilst in custody, but it is clear that he will do his time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. 7 He has spent some time in custody already, two months and twenty-eight days before being granted bail on this matter. During that time he lost a considerable amount of weight, so it cannot be said that there was little impact upon the offender through going into custody.8 One of the most important matters that Mr Barko, who appeared for the offender today, relies on is the offender’s rehabilitation. He was a man who had a long term addiction to drugs and alcohol, he is now dealing with both of these issues in a substantial way. He said that his offence was partly related to his ongoing drug use and of course if he is able to overcome that problem his chances of rehabilitation, in the sense of committing no further offences, are good. Somewhat surprisingly there was no remorse offered by the offender for his serious misconduct.9 He is in many respects a man of good character. A number of testimonials tendered today from friends and family spoke of his regard in the community and the fact that he has helped the Sydney Maori community in many ways. One of the references says “Your Honour, I hope you find Ture contrite and remorseful” I would have liked to have been able to make that finding, but there was no evidence to suggest that, presented to me.10 It is clear that a full time custodial sentence is required. It is clear also that there are special circumstances. This will be the offender’s first time in custody, he will need assistance in his ongoing rehabilitation upon his release from custody, and I have therefore extended the period of eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period. However the non-parole period I will shortly impose is the least which properly reflects the objective criminality of the offender’s behaviour.11 He pleaded guilty at an early stage and so I will reduce the sentence I would otherwise impose by twenty-five per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea. 12 Taking into account the matters on the Form 1 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to commence on 29 June 2008, that being the appropriate date in view of the offender’s presentence custody. The non-parole period will expire on 28 December 2009 on which date he is eligible to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of three years.13 The drugs are to be destroyed. I will make an order under Confiscation of Proceeds of Crimes Act, and sign the documents that have been provided to me.

   SENTENCE1 Garrick Keith Foord is to be sentenced for an offence of ongoing supply of prohibited drugs under s 25A of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act. The maximum penalty for that offence is twenty years imprisonment, it does not carry with it a standard non-parole period.2 The individual supplies encompassed by that offence relate to three acts of supply of relatively small quantities of amphetamine to an undercover officer. They were on 15 April, 17 April and 22 April 2008. They were not isolated acts of supply, however. In the course of his discussions with the undercover officer, the offender told him that he was supplying to others as well. The offender was doing this because he was able by that means to fund his own drug use. He was not making money out of his activities, but merely supplying drugs so that he could get his drugs for free. 3 He appeared in court today with three others, Matthew Hall, Edward Elelman and Suzanne Lenton. I did propose at one stage to sentence all of them together, but the evidence revealed that the only connection between Mr Foord, this offender, and the other three, was that some time before his arrest he moved into a home at which Ms Lenton also lived. There is no suggestion that he was involved in Ms Lenton’s activities, or those of Mr Elelman or Mr Hall. It is appropriate therefore that he be sentenced separately. I should also add that the principles of parity seemed to have no impact upon him as far as those other three are concerned. A matter of significance in assessing the offender’s criminality is that the last of his supplies, that is, 22 April 2008, was one month before his arrest. In evidence today he said that he himself stopped supplying because he was concerned of the consequences for him of being caught. Given the month which elapsed between his last supply to the undercover officer and his arrest, I am prepared to accept what the offender says. 4 He was born in 1956 and was therefore fifty-two years of age, about to turn fifty-three. A perusal of his criminal history indicates that he managed to get to thirty years of age before he committed his first offence and that there have been some gaps, significant at times, in his criminal history. He has been able in the past to hold down responsible and lucrative jobs, but his drug use has interfered with his ability to work productively. His criminality began at the age of thirty at a time when a number of friends of his were dying from AIDS. The offender gave evidence that at time when he and a number of other people were tested for AIDS, of those who were tested, nineteen eventually died. It was in those circumstances that the offender began using drugs. As I mentioned before there have been times when he has been able to live a law abiding lifestyle. What triggered his most recent involvement in drugs appears to have been the death of his mother in 2007 to cancer. 5 Primarily because of the age at which he first committed offences and also because of his ability to live his life without committing offences as demonstrated in the past, I accept Mr Hutchison’s submission that there are good prospects of rehabilitation if the offender is given adequate incentive and support. 6 I will therefore find special circumstances in this case and make an order that the offender is only to be released to parole on condition that he attend the residential drug rehabilitation program at Odyssey House or some other similar institution. I will therefore enlarge the period of eligibility for parole to take account of that quasi custody. 7 These offences were of course serious, the offender was under no illusions as to what would occur to him if he was caught. For that reason he tried to ensure that he didn’t have large quantities of drugs in his possession. The offender has also been dealt with in the past for supplying prohibited drugs. 8 Both the Crown and Mr Hutchison have supplied me with some cases which I am able to use as a comparison. Of course no two cases are the same, but, given that inconsistency in sentencing is a badge of unfairness, I have had particular regard to the material that both parties have presented to me in identifying the appropriate sentencing range in this case. Some matters do stand out, perhaps the most important which takes this case out of the ordinary is the fact that the offender himself ceased supplying to the undercover officer. This is far from the usual case where supplies continue up until the date of arrest. For that matter, I will impose a sentence which would otherwise be viewed I suspect as lenient. 9 There is no doubt that deterrent sentences are required, however. There is no doubt that those who supply drugs, even if all they are interested in is getting drugs for themselves, need to be dealt with by a significantly lengthy sentence, and even harsh sentence on occasions, to reflect the gravity of what they have done. 10 The sentence I impose on Mr Foord is as follows. He is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 22 May 2008, it will expire on 21 November 2009, on which day the offender is to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of three years. It is a condition of the offender’s release to parole that he attend a residential rehabilitation program in Odyssey House or a similar institution.11 In case I have not mentioned it, the plea of guilty was entered at the first opportunity and the sentence that I have just imposed is reduced by twenty-five per cent to account for that fact.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The offender Todd Ballenden appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early opportunity to three serious offences. The first is being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely, intimidation. That carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. The second offence is detaining with intent to obtain an advantage, in this case to have a conversation with his de facto partner. That carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. And the third offence is an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. When sentencing him for the last of those matters he asks that I take into account two other matters on a Form 1, namely, a further offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and an offence of contravening an apprehended violence order.2 All of these offences took place over the evening on 12 November 2009 and the following day. The offender had been in a relationship with the complainant since January 2009; however, in May 2009 he was sentenced to imprisonment for maliciously damaging her property. On that day an apprehended domestic violence order was also made for the protection of the complainant. At the same time parole was revoked. The offender was on parole, it is to be noted for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and thus he was taken into custody. He was released from custody only a few days before committing this very serious series of offences. He was released, on parole it must be noted, on 9 November 2009. 3 On 12 November 2009 he and the complainant began to argue. At one stage the complainant decided to sleep on the lounge, but the offender came out and disturbed her. The offender then said he would sleep on the lounge and the complainant decided to go back to bed, which she did. Throughout the night the offender however came into the bedroom waking the complainant each time. Things escalated to the point where at about one o’clock in the morning of 13 November 2009 the offender came into the bedroom once more and woke up the complainant. This time he was armed with a silver carving knife about twenty centimetres long. He pointed this at the complainant. Not surprisingly, she felt frightened and threatened. Her fears no doubt escalated when the offender told her that he was going to have sexual intercourse with her and sodomise her. It seems to be accepted by the Crown that by saying those things the offender wished to intimidate the complainant and make her afraid. It further seems to be accepted by the Crown that the offender did not in fact intend at that stage to have sexual intercourse with the complainant against her will.4 The offender then grabbed the complainant by the throat and banged her head against the wall saying, “If I can’t have you, no-one else is going to have you either.” The complainant was asking him to stop. She was saying, “Don’t do this. I love you. You love me. I don’t want you to go to gaol.” Notwithstanding this very sensible advice, the offender simply seemed to get angrier. This continued until it was about four-thirty in the morning. Thus the complainant had been terrorised in this manner for about three hours before finally the offender put the knife down saying, “It’s only because I love you.” He then began to cry and fell asleep. The complainant fell asleep a short time later.5 The evidence suggests that the reason that the offender gives for his violent behaviour which he admits terrorised the complainant was that she told him that whilst in custody her ex-boyfriend stayed the night. Of course, this in no way at all justifies or excuses or even mitigates the offender’s disgraceful conduct. Unfortunately, he had not finished. The next morning after the complainant’s children left for school, the complainant said that she was going to go to a friend’s house, but the offender prevented her from doing so, blocking the doorway. The complainant realised what had happened. She realised that she was being held prisoner by the offender. She tried to call the police, but the offender simply pulled the phone cord out of the wall. 6 The complainant told the offender that she had dialled three numbers which the offender decided meant that she was calling the police because she wanted him to go back to gaol. Rather than taking stock of matters and realising what he had done, the offender decided to inflict actual violence on the complainant. Thus far he had merely terrorised her, but he went so far this time as to hit her with a closed fist, once to the shoulder and then in the face. This blow was so forceful that it knocked the complainant off the armrest where she was seated and caused her to be bruised. That assault forms the basis of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence on the Form 1. 7 The complainant tried to get away, heading towards the front door, but the offender grabbed her by her shoulders and pulled her to the ground. She screamed, resulting in the offender simply putting his hand over her mouth. He then pulled her to her feet and held her against a wall near the bedroom before again hitting her in the face with his fist, making the complainant dazed and dizzy and splitting the inside of her cheek causing it to bleed. This is the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence for which the offender is to be specifically sentenced.8 Eventually the complainant was able to calm the offender down. He agreed to walk with her to the supermarket to buy some cigarettes. The complainant said she needed to go to the toilet and she took her handbag with her. Whilst there she called police on triple 0. They arrived a short time later. The complainant pointed out the offender, who ran away, but he was arrested soon thereafter. 9 As a result of this the complainant was left with reddening to her face, a split lip, a laceration inside her cheek, heavy bruising to the top of her chest and bruising to her arm. The offender admitted most of what he did when speaking to police, saying that he was jealous of other men. 10 The offender has now been in custody since the date of his arrest, 13 November 2009. 11 These were very serious offences committed over a lengthy period of time against a woman in her own home whilst the offender was on parole for an offence of violence. The objective gravity of the offender’s conduct requires that significant sentences of imprisonment are imposed for each of these three offences. 12 The offender is now forty years of age, almost forty-one. He was raised in Cooma by his mother, but tragically she died when the offender was in Year 9. As a result of that he moved to Newcastle to live with his father. He was about thirteen at the time and has not been to school since. The time with his father was difficult because his father was a violent alcoholic. As a result of that circumstance the offender spent a lot of time out of the house where he engaged firstly in petty crime and then more serious offending. He started using drugs at the age of about thirteen or fourteen and drinking as well. Since then he has committed many, many offences, all of which he attributes to his drug and alcohol use.13 The offender gave evidence today and said that he had in the past experienced mood swings, that he would just snap, lose his temper and get angry and violent without any warning. He said that that has been a feature of his life since his teenage years. However, he has recently seen a psychiatrist whilst in custody. That psychiatrist has prescribed some medication for him which helps with the mood swings. The offender says that he feels a lot better, that things do not irritate him as much as they used to and he does not lose his temper as often as he did. As the offender grew up he has worked and regards himself as a good worker. He has had employment as a labourer, storeman and packer, did some time concreting and on traffic control. He was last employed in late 2007. 14 He said that he was not using drugs as at the date of the offence in November 2009 nor was he drinking. He said that he had given up drugs since going into custody and sees himself as capable of being a good partner to his de facto wife upon his release from custody. His evidence was that his partner has told him that she wants to try living with him in the future. The offender says that because of the medication he is taking he does not he think will ever put his partner through a similar experience. He is now calmer, although he accepts that he will need ongoing care upon his release and is thus willing to continue to go to either a psychiatrist or a psychologist. There are thus prospects of rehabilitation, but I cannot say they are good. He has only been on medication whilst in custody. That may help matters, but it remains to be seen how he will behave upon his release from custody whilst under that medication.15 The offender’s plea of guilty has a significant utilitarian benefit and thus the sentences I will shortly announce are in each case 25 per cent less than they would otherwise have been. Although all of these offences arose at the same time, that does not mean that concurrent sentences should be imposed. Each of the offences is aimed at a different aspect of the offender’s misconduct, that is, that he was armed with a knife with intent to intimidate the complainant at one stage and that he detained her at another stage and that during the period of detention he assaulted her on two occasions. It would be thus quite wrong for wholly concurrent sentences to be imposed. On the other hand there is a significant overlap in the offender’s criminality and so I will impose sentences which are partially cumulative on each other.16 Mr Fitzgerald who appeared for the offender said that there were special circumstances in this case, they relating to the circumstance that the offender has for the first time been put on medication to control his mood swings and that the offender himself accepts that he will need assistance upon his release from custody. I accept what Mr Fitzgerald says and thus will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour, enlarging the period of eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period. However, there is a significant constraint in this case and that is that the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct must bear a reasonable relationship to the sentence and in particular the non-parole period which I will impose.17 The offender accepts that he terrorised his de facto partner over a significant period. He has apologised to her and thus I am satisfied that he has expressed his remorse. It appears that whilst the complainant may or may not have actually forgiven the offender, general deterrence as well as personal deterrence require that lengthy custodial sentences are imposed. The offender is sentenced as follows:18 For the offence of detaining for advantage, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year to commence on 13 November 2009 and a head sentence of two years. For the offence of being armed with intent, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one and a half years to commence on 13 November 2010 and a head sentence in that matter of three years. For the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year to commence on 13 November 2011 and a head sentence of three years.19 The effective sentence is thus one of a non-parole period of three years with a head sentence of five years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 12 November 2012. 20 I also impose an apprehended violence order on the offender, the terms being as follows. The offender must not assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with the protected person or a person with whom the protected person has a domestic relationship. The offender must not engage in conduct that intimidates the protected person or a person with whom the protected person has a domestic relationship. The offender must not stalk the protected person or a person with whom the protected person has a domestic relationship. The offender must not approach the protected person or any such premises or place at which the protected person from time to time resides or works within twelve hours of consuming intoxicating liquor or illicit drugs. The offender must not destroy or deliberately damage or interfere with the property of the protected person. The protected person in this case is Deborah Hewson and the AVO will be for a period of four and a half years from today. Now, is there any other matter, Mr Fitzgerald, Mr Crown?21 FITZGERALD: Thank you, your Honour.22 OUTRAM: Only one--23 HIS HONOUR: What’s that?24 OUTRAM: --further matter that’s required or envisaged under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act, your Honour, and that’s under s 12. Would your Honour direct that the s 86 and the s 59 matters are recorded on the offender’s criminal history as domestic violence related matters.25 HIS HONOUR: That’s appropriate, is it, Mr Fitzgerald?26 FITZGERALD: I think it is, your Honour.27 HIS HONOUR: I will make that order.

     EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT 
      
     [2005] NSWIRComm 376 
    1 Illawarra Canvas Blinds Pty Limited and Michael Vimpany have pleaded guilty to offences under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000. The company has pleaded guilty to a breach of section 8(1) of the Act and Mr Vimpany, as a director and by operation of section 26(1) of the Act, is deemed to have also been in breach of section 8(1) of the Act.2 The undertaking of the company, as the name suggests, is the supply of blinds and awnings part of their work involves installation. The prosecutor has tendered an Agreed Statement of Facts in each matter, a number of photographs that help illuminate the circumstances in which the workplace accident occurred and a police sketch.  
    3 It was clear from a quote supplied by the company that it was contemplated that aspects of this work would take place at a height of between six and 6.5 metres. The photographs of the site show a steep side passage, the use of ladders in attaching the awnings to the building, and those were the surrounding circumstances leading to the severe injury to one of the workers of the company who fell from the ladder.4 That employee, Mr Richards, had been employed by the defendant since around 1999. On 17 March 2004, with another person from the company, he was involved in installing awnings and, according to the agreed statement of facts, in a way that had been performed by the company over a number of years. Both were involved in applying the normal method of work when installing awnings.5 I do not detail what is set out in the agreed statement of facts, but it is sufficient to say that in this work Mr Richards used a ladder that might commonly be found in domestic premises, it was not secured to the building, it was in other ways obviously unstable in the situation in which it had to be used. Unfortunately for Mr Richards this was no minor accident. He suffered quite severe injuries and, on the Agreed Statement of Facts, continues under severe disabilities. That evidence, of course, is evidence of the nature of the risk but, as I will come to shortly, it was frankly accepted by the defendants that the risks in this case and circumstances were grave.6 That very briefly, if somewhat inadequately, sets out the background. As I say, it is set out in much more detail in the both the Agreed Statement of Facts and the affidavit of the Inspector commencing these proceedings. I have had regard to the detail in the agreed statement of facts in dealing with this matter.7 In considering the objective seriousness of this offence I accept what has been put by the prosecutor in her submissions, namely, these aspects: The defendants failed to carry out an adequate site specific risk assessment in relation to the work to be performed and the place where the work was to be performed; the defendants failed to prepare a written safe work method statement and to ensure the work was done in accordance with such a work method statement; the defendants' failure to provide adequate information, training and instruction in relation to the work; the defendants' failure to ensure that the worker, who was relatively inexperienced, was instructed and supervised so as to perform the work safely; the defendants' failure to control risks associated with a fall from height by providing the worker with an appropriate work platform or by other means; the nature of the offence where the risk of injury demonstrated a degree of seriousness and a potential detriment to health and safety, and in circumstances where there were obvious and foreseeable risks to safety which had not been identified and accordingly against which appropriate measures would have been taken.8 The brief description I have already given of the circumstances in which this accident took place makes it abundantly clear that not only was this a serious risk and ultimately a serious breach of the Act, but it was one that was foreseeable.9 The use of ladders in industry is not unusual. The prosecutor makes a point that they are used across a wide range of businesses. Because of that fact there are often found to be risks associated with their use. Here, as I have indicated, it has been readily accepted and properly accepted by the defendant that there was a serious breach of the Act and a serious offence has been committed.10 I also accept what has been submitted on behalf of the prosecutor in relation to obvious and foreseeable circumstances having regard to these factors: Firstly, the work was being performed at height; the worker was relatively inexperienced in the installation of awnings, including being inexperienced in installation of awnings at heights; there was no or no adequate training, instruction or information provided to the injured worker, notwithstanding that the worker was relatively inexperienced and posed a risk to his safety; there was no adequate supervision of the worker, notwithstanding that the worker was relatively inexperienced and posed a risk to his safety.11 Having concluded that this is a serious breach, there are a number of issues that also need to be dealt with. Firstly, I consider the application of the principle of general deterrence. I accept the prosecutor's submission as to the need for this penalty to reflect the operation of that principle for reasons I have already briefly touched upon. There is no submission made by the defendant to the contrary. 
    12 The issue of specific deterrence is to be considered somewhat differently, in my view. I think fairly the prosecutor accepted that, having regard to the steps taken by the defendants following this accident, there is perhaps a reduced role for the operation of specific deterrence. It may be, if I understand the submission correctly, put a little higher by the defendant. I am unable to reach the view that there should be no role for specific deterrence in setting an appropriate penalty. The defendants continue in business and that is a significant consideration in reaching the view that I have reached.13 That approach must be tempered, however, by the evidence as to the small nature of the company, the effect of this accident, unexpected and terrible in its consequences for Mr Richards, the effects on Mr Vimpany of which he has given evidence and also the steps taken by the company following this incident to address occupational health and safety more generally in relation to its operations. While specific deterrence will play a role in the setting of an appropriate penalty, it will be one tempered by those considerations.14 I have mentioned in dealing with deterrence the steps taken by the company in addressing occupational health and safety in relation to its entire operations following this accident. The agreed statement of facts accepts these steps: A number of policies and documents have been adopted, including site safety rules; an induction course; a document dealing with occupational health and safety risk management; a document dealing with Illawarra Blinds training officers; and an occupational health and safety consultation statement.15 It is also agreed that since the time of the incident, the company has changed its work procedures to ensure that any work performed at height is performed from either a cherry picker or scaffolding and the defendants have ensured that its employees have completed the OHS general induction or ""green card"" course. One of the employees, Mr Harris, has since been re-trained in the use of cherry pickers. Those matters are also to be taken into account in addressing the subjective factors relevant to both defendants.16 I have had urged upon me by counsel for the defendants a number of other matters. It is significant that in both cases there was an early plea. When these matters were first called before the Court on return of the order issued by the Court there was a plea of guilty entered in each case. I am satisfied that the full discount available, in accordance with guideline judgments, should be granted to the defendants in this case and that will result in a discount of 25 per cent on the final penalty.17 There are a number of other issues that are urged upon behalf of the defendants. There was co-operation with the WorkCover Authority as well as the measures taken since the accident that I have already referred to. The company has a very long history and this is its first offence and that is to be taken as a good record. Mr Vimpany has no prior convictions. His is a presence in the industry of a much shorter duration but, nevertheless, is I think to be regarded as a good record.18 The prosecutor, correctly, suggests that there needs to be some caution in dealing with a long record without conviction. That is not to reduce the importance of that factor, but to realise that on occasions that can allow participants in industry to become perhaps too complacent about their usual work methods and fail to be diligent in relation to occupational health and safety. I do not think that that is the case here. There does seem to be a long period of an accepted work practice and that was a work practice that was adopted on this occasion. It was not unknown for this defendant to use the cherry picker, but apparently only in relation to work above two stories. It appears that, prompted by documents undoubtedly sent out by WorkCover to industry in general, Mr Vimpany was in the course of putting together safety documentation for the company, but that was very much in prospect when this unfortunate accident occurred and Mr Richards was, as a consequence, seriously injured. It is in that context that I take into account the good record of both the defendants.19 I accept the submission as to the defendant's contrition. Mr Vimpany gave evidence of attendances on the injured worker, he has remained in contact with him, holding the job open for Mr Richards. There is substance in the submission put by the defendant that there was certainly no abandonment of the injured worker after the accident. Those matters are all deserving of consideration and serve to mitigate the severity of the ultimate penalty.20 The matter that has taken some time in the evidence and submissions is the financial position of the defendants and considerations arising under section 6 of the Fines Act. It is said on behalf of the defendant that certainly the company is at the moment operating on a basis that has seen its last annual return record a small loss. The previous year to that indicated a fairly modest profit. It is said that from that material, and I do not again stay to canvas the detail of every aspect referred to, the financial evidence is such that here there is demonstrated a modest capacity to pay.21 The evidence shows that Mr Vimpany has assets. His family home is mortgaged but there is a substantial equity in the home. There is another property that has a mortgage but, again, there is substantial equity. I did not hear and I did not understand the submission to be made that there was no capacity to pay: it was a submission that those matters needed to be considered so that the Court, in accordance with the provisions of the Fines Act, might properly consider how an appropriate penalty might be imposed upon these defendants having this evidence available as to their financial situation.22 There was some conjecture arising from Mr Vimpany's evidence that if a significant penalty be imposed, that would require a loan and there would ultimately, probably, be some application for time to pay. Against that it is said there might be some tax benefits if the company took out the loan to pay any penalty; but I think I am not venturing too far by suggesting that common experience is that financial institutions are not in the habit of lending without substantial security being available. On the evidence I have, the company does not appear to have substantial assets. It seems very much to me that the paying of the fine or fines for both defendants will fall to Mr Vimpany. 
    23 When I am considering these matters, I have to take into account what a number of judgments have highlighted in this area, that while there is a statutory requirement to take these matters into account, there has to be care exercised so as not to ignore or reduce unacceptably the penalty as a reflection of the objective seriousness of the offence. That is a difficult task and in this particular case it is particularly difficult.24 I have had some discussion with counsel for the defendant and the prosecutor as to an appropriate course. I have canvassed with them an approach adopted by a Full Bench of the previous Industrial Court in Haynes v CI & D Manufacturing Pty Limited (1994) 60 IR 149. This is not the occasion to quote at length or at all from the judgment, but I can perhaps, for present purposes, encapsulate it this way: There are times when the Court is faced with evidence that allows it to reach a conclusion that a corporate defendant is by and large the means by which the directors, who are also defendants, earn a living. In the particular circumstances of CI & D there were in fact two companies - and I would suggest companies of more substance that I have before me in these particular cases. In that case the Full Court said that there might well be circumstances where a global approach should be taken and that the overall culpability or criminality of the offence should be the determining factor. There are a number of ways in which that can be accomplished but in a general sense, that is the approach that I propose to follow, although I would do so by concluding what I regard as an appropriate penalty for the overall criminality of these offences and to then divide them appropriately between the two defendants. 
    25 Taking that approach, I make the following orders in Matter No IRC 2214 of 2005: 
     
     1. The defendant, Illawarra Canvas Blinds Pty Limited is found guilty of the breach of section 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 to which it has pleaded guilty. 
      
     2. The defendant is fined the sum of $70,000 with half the fine to be paid to the prosecutor as a moiety. 
      
     3. The defendant is to pay the costs of the prosecutor in a sum agreed or, in the absence of agreement, as ordered I by the Court. 
      
    In relation to Matter No IRC 2216 of 2005, I make the following orders: 
     
     1. The defendant, Michael Vimpany, is found guilty of a breach of section 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 by operation of section 26 (1) of that Act to which he has pleaded guilty. 
      
     2. The defendant is fined the sum of $7,000 with half the fine to be paid to the prosecutor as a moiety. 
      
     3. The defendant is to pay the costs of the prosecution in a sum as agreed or, in the absence of agreement, as ordered by the Court. 
      
    26 During the course of submissions there was some discussion about the power of the Court, in a sentencing exercise, to deal with the issue of allowing time to pay. It is not my desire to make this a test case, but I think I would not intrude upon recent legislative provisions if I recorded my recommendation to the Industrial Registrar that this is a case deserving of close consideration for time to pay. If there is a capacity to have that ultimately considered in this Court, I would be prepared to do so if it is necessary.

   JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HER HONOUR: This is an appeal against conviction in relation to two charges that were before the Children's Court. One is a charge of resist officer in execution of duty and the other is using offensive language. One is contrary to s 58 of the Crimes Act and the second is contrary to s 4A of the Summary Offences Act.  
     
      
    2 I do not propose to canvass the facts of either of these two offences. For reasons that will be clear that will not become necessary. For what it is worth, however, it seems to me that had the evidence that was relied on been admissible, the offences were on their face very clearly made out by the circumstances relied on by the Prosecution. That was not in dispute before the Children's Court Magistrate. What is in dispute is whether or not the evidence relied on to prove each of these cases was admissible. The challenge to the evidence is made on the basis that it is said to amount to an impropriety.  
     
      
    3 Initially in the Children's Court a challenge was taken to the legality of the arrest, but that was not pursued after some evidence and argument. The issue taken in the Children's Court was whether or not the evidence was obtained improperly and a challenge to its admissibility was made under s 138 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    4 The factual circumstances relevant for this determination are found in the bundle of documents which include the fairly brief transcript before the Children's Court and exhibits there. The major exhibit is the statement of the arresting officer, Constable Sheils.  
     
      
    5 I accept that on 14 March 2010 at about 3.30 she was rostered to perform duty in a police vehicle with another police officer. At about 3.30 she was advised by another officer that the appellant in this case was to be arrested for breaching her bail the night before. The appellant is a thirteen year old girl who I infer was on some form of bail with conditions. The evidence of her bail, the conditions or the offence for which she was on bail is not before me. It would appear from this statement of Constable Sheils, that it was during the course of being rostered on in this police vehicle, just under two hours after receiving the advice that the appellant was to be arrested for breaching bail, she attended her address.  
     
      
    6 There appeared to be no suggestion that her address was unknown. The young person's father answered the door. It was 5.15. He was asked whether the appellant was home. He called out for her and she came to the door. The officer said something to the effect ""We need to sort out you breaching your bail, come outside so we can have chat and sort this out"". In reply to that the appellant denied breaching it, in colourful language, and also said ""why didn't you come and get me last night then?"" The officer said, ""That's what we need to sort out, so step outside for me"".  
     
      
    7 It was clear from the evidence she gave that the officer, despite those words that she used, had intended to arrest her in any event immediately, notwithstanding what she would have said. The officer, I accept from her evidence, mistakenly believed that the appellant had committed an offence, namely the offence of breaching a bail condition. There is no such offence under the Bail Act. The Bail Act under s 50 however, enables a police officer to arrest a person on bail, without warrant, in various circumstances including if it is believed that they have breached a condition of their bail. A further provision of s 50 of the Bail Act provides that the police may approach an authorised Justice to enable either a warrant for arrest for breach of bail to be obtained, or for a summons for breach of bail to be obtained and served. 
     
      
    8 There is other evidence in the statement, and evidence given by the police officer, but to cut to the chase, the police officer claims that she was of the view that the appellant might escape if she was informed she was under arrest. She asked her to step outside and sent for a police caged vehicle. At that stage she saw the appellant go inside to get changed and could hear her swearing at her mother, indicating she believed that they were going to take her to the Maroubra police station. The appellant then walked outside, pushed past the two police and said ""Get out of my fucking way then"".  
     
      
    9 Apparently this caused the police officer to take hold of the appellant to prevent her from running away and falling down the stairs. At that, the appellant thrashed her arms around in an attempt to break free. She tried to get away from the two officers. Constable Sheils then decided to handcuff this thirteen year old girl and according to the statement, ""used the approved police technique of the arm bar take down"" where she was taken to the ground to prevent her escape. The young person's father then picked her up and carried her across the road to the police vehicle. She was kicking and screaming. Sheils then said ""You're under arrest for breach of bail"".  
     
      
    10 At that stage however, although she had the lawful power to arrest without warrant for breach of bail, I accept from her evidence that the officer believed that she was arresting her for the commission of an offence, namely the offence of breaching bail. She cautioned her. Again the young person effectively denied that she had been in breach of bail and asked again ""why they didn't get her the night before?"" There were other activities then out in the street in which the appellant moved her hands to the front when the police were trying to handcuff her hands at the back. She swore, she used extremely unpleasant language, calling the police ""You fucking dog cunts"" and the like. 
     
      
    11 She was then ultimately taken to the back of a caged vehicle and taken to Maroubra police station.  
     
      
    12 The officer gave evidence in the proceedings and I accept from that, that the officer never turned her mind to the circumstances in which she was arresting the appellant without warrant. Arresting without warrant normally for a police officer should only occur when they believe an offence has been committed, is in the process of being committed, or is likely to be committed and to avoid the commission of that offence. It is clear that Constable Sheils believed that an offence had been committed, namely the offence of breaching bail and that that was the basis on which she was entitled to arrest. That is an error. There has never been an offence under the Bail Act of breaching bail. That does not stop a number of allegations of such an offence being committed being brought to Court, even the issuing of court attendance notices for the same. That is the situation that has pertained in New South Wales to the knowledge of this Court for at least twenty five to thirty years. In any event there is no offence under the Bail Act of breaching a bail condition.  
     
      
    13 The police do have the power to arrest without warrant, however, where a bail condition has been breached.  
     
      
    14 It seems to me, however, that the same provisions and considerations that apply, or ought to apply, in deciding whether or not to arrest a person on warrant for an offence, or deal with the matter by way of summons, ought equally apply to a decision how to deal with an allegation of breach of bail condition. There are alternatives available to police, one out of three of which does not involve the issue of a warrant and the taking of a person into police custody. The evidence in this case is that the police officer did not turn her mind to whether or not it would have been appropriate to approach an authorised Justice to issue a summons under s 50 of the Bail Act because she did not understand that that was an available option.  
     
      
    15 There is no evidence before the Court that any of those who instructed her or advised her to undertake the arrest turned their minds to it either, and given that this was a voir dire before the Magistrate in which no such evidence was called by the Prosecution I infer that they did not. I also infer, in the circumstances of this case, that whatever the breach might have been - and I emphasize no such evidence was called by the Prosecution on the voir dire to explain the seriousness or otherwise of the breach - I infer from the lack of that evidence that the breach was minor and certainly not sufficient to require immediate action at the time the breach was alleged to be occurring and for that matter not requiring immediate action on the part of Constable Sheils after receiving the message at 3.30. 
     
      
    16 In those circumstances, inferentially, something not requiring arrest without warrant would be the preferable option. Whether or not that amounts to an impropriety itself depends on the circumstances. This is a case in which the police were detaining in custody a thirteen year old Aboriginal girl, where they knew her address, where they knew she was then with her parents at that address at 5.15 in the afternoon, and where the possibility existed that she would not be re-released on bail after being taken into custody by them. The provisions of the Bail Act require that when there is an arrest without warrant for breach of bail that the person be taken as soon as possible before a Court. This was 5.15 on a Sunday afternoon. The possibility existed that a thirteen year old Aboriginal girl would have been kept in police custody overnight, until Monday morning in circumstances where on the evidence no police officer had turned his or her mind to the alternatives available to bring her before the Court on an allegation of breach of bail, which did not require going into custody, and further, where as I have found by inference, the breach, on its face, is not likely to have been serious. 
     
      
    17 In making those findings I do not suggest, nor is there any evidence to establish, that Constable Sheils was acting in any malicious way. She simply was doing what she believed was appropriate and available to her in the circumstances. Nor am I by making these comments, suggesting that her behaviour was not lawful. She was lawfully entitled to arrest without warrant, pursuant to s 50 of the Bail Act.  
     
      
    18 I do make a finding, however, that the use of handcuffs and the restraining techniques used on a thirteen year old girl in the circumstances was excessive and it is hard to imagine that two police officers could not have dealt with this situation in a less confrontational manner. 
     
      
    19 I refer to the decision of DPP v Carr, [2002] NSWCCA 194.a decision delivered on 25 January 2002. That decision in part relied on reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Fleet v District Court and Ors. With respect I refer to the dicta in that case in which this is stated; 
     
      
       
        
        ""Lawfulness of arrest is one thing, appropriateness is another."" 
        
       
      
    20 And further, the comments of Acting Justice Smart, at para 35 of that case in which he said this; 
     
      
       
        
        ""This Court in its appellate and trial divisions has been emphasising for many years that it is inappropriate for powers of arrest to be used for minor offences where the defendant's name and address are known, there is no risk of him departing and there is no reason to believe that a summons will not be effective. Arrest is an additional punishment involving deprivation of freedom and frequently ignominy and fear. The consequences of the employment of the power of arrest unnecessarily and inappropriately and instead of issuing a summons are often anger on the part of the person arrested and an escalation of the situation leading to the person resisting arrest and assaulting the police. The pattern in this case is all too familiar. It is time the statements of this Court were heeded."" 
        
       
      
    21 It seems to me that this is exactly what happened in this case and in fact was foreseeable given that what was being dealt with here was the almost certainly foreseeable actions of a thirteen year old girl in the circumstances.  
     
      
    22 The test of impropriety does not depend on a dishonest state of mind on the part of the police officer, nor does it depend on the finding that the officer acted unlawfully or without integrity. Even in circumstances where, much like this one, the officer acted lawfully and honestly, a circumstance can nonetheless be improper. The test is whether the behaviour should be viewed to have fallen below the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement. 
     
      
    23 It seems to me that in this case they have fallen below those standards. First and foremost, not knowing that the alternative power of summons existed for breach of bail falls below that. Second, not determining to proceed by way of summons, or at the very least, approaching a third party, an authorised magistrate for a warrant to arrest falls below those. Contextually doing that in circumstances where what was being proceeded against was an alleged breach of bail, apparently minor, committed by a thirteen year old girl, and in circumstances where the possibility existed that she would remain in police custody overnight on a Sunday night, because no Court would then be available till Monday, in the circumstances, it seems to me, falls below the standards which we ought expect of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement.  
     
      
    24 The evidence giving rise to the two charges was collected in direct consequence of this impropriety and I then need to turn to whether or not, in the exercise of my discretion, despite the impropriety, it should be admitted. The probative value of the evidence is obviously high. It is the only evidence in fact capable of proving the offences. It is therefore important. The relevant offences themselves, it seems to me, are not, in relative terms, particularly serious and what is more, committed as a direct consequence of the impropriety. 
     
      
    25 It seems to me to constitute a relatively serious impropriety, albeit I stress, not committed intentionally or with knowledge or intention on the part of the police officer. None of the other provisions S138(3) seem to be relevant.  
     
      
    26 All in all, in undertaking the balancing exercise that now falls to me, having made a finding that it is an impropriety and that the evidence was gathered as a direct result of that impropriety, I have concluded that on balance the evidence ought be excluded.  
     
      
    27 The evidence is rejected and as such there is no evidence which is capable of proving the charges against the appellant. Therefore, the conviction appeal is upheld. The convictions and sentences are quashed.

     JUDGMENT 
    CLOSED COURT1 GROVE J: These are applications for leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed in the District Court respectively by McGuire DCJ and Blanch DC/CJ.2 It is important to bear in mind the jurisdiction of this Court specified by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act in that in an appeal against sentence the Court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence whether more or less severe is warranted in law should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor. This is a case in which that statutory prescription should be borne in mind.3 The first offence in time occurred on 13 May 1997 at about 3.20pm on Tuesday 13 May 1997. The complainant, a school student had finished school at Canterbury and with another friend went to the railway station in order to travel home. They were sitting on a seat. Without any warning whatsoever and without engaging in conversation, the applicant placed his left arm around the complainant's head, firmly held it in a headlock. As he did this, with a sharp bladed knife, he stabbed the complainant in the back of his neck and demanded the complainant's wallet and keys. He firmly held the neck as well as the knife. The victim was in extreme pain and called out to release the grip and remove the knife. This and other calls for help were ignored by the applicant and went unanswered by bystanders.4 The applicant maintained the knife in the wound for some five minutes and continued to demand the wallet and keys. In extreme pain and in desperation to stop his agony, the victim took hold of the blade of the knife, he attempted to twist the blade of the knife and suffered lacerations to his fingers and it was only when a train arrived on the platform that the grip was released.5 Those circumstances are substantially confirmed by the applicant in a video taped interview held sometime after his arrest.6 Whilst on bail in respect of that matter, the offence occurred in relation to which the applicant was dealt with by Blanch DC/CJ. On 16 December 1997 when the victim was walking at 1.30 in the afternoon in a street in Newtown, he was approached by the applicant who asked him what he had in his pocket. The applicant then stepped in front of the victim and demanded a wallet. He continued to block the victim's path and when that person attempted to pass him, the applicant struck him a blow to the right side of the head and told him that the next blow would knock him out. Unfortunately for the applicant, two plain clothes police constables were in the area and he was then arrested.7 In respect of both of these matters, the applicant was dealt with according to law. It was mandatory for McGuire DCJ so to deal with the offence of being armed and assaulting with intent to rob with wounding. Blanch DC/CJ concluded that it would be quite artificial dealing with the applicant subsequently to seek to deal with him other than according to law.8 The respective consequences were that McGuire DCJ sentenced the applicant to penal servitude consisting of a minimum term of three years and three months with an additional term of two years and six months. He directed however that the sentence was to be served in a juvenile detention centre until the applicant reached the age of twenty-one years. The applicant at the time of the offences was very young indeed, having been born on 10 February 1982.9 When the applicant appeared before Blanch DC/CJ, his Honour gave express consideration as to whether concurrency of sentence was appropriate. He came to the conclusion that it was not. He imposed a sentence of penal servitude for six months which he accumulated upon the minimum term specified by McGuire DCJ. He then specified an additional term of two years and six months, that is to say, an additional term identical to that which was part of the sentence division ordered by McGuire DCJ. Blanch DC/CJ also ordered that the sentence upon the applicant was to be served in a juvenile justice centre.10 Two issues have been raised substantially on behalf of the applicant in this Court. The second issue which it is convenient to deal with first and briefly, arises out of a remark by McGuire DCJ who was aware of the pending charge ultimately dealt with by Blanch DC/CJ that he thought it likely that any further sentence would be served concurrently. As I have recorded, Blanch DC/CJ directed that there be a relatively short cumulative sentence. Indeed his Honour pointed out that the sentence which he was imposing was much less than the offence deserved but he was taking into account the other sentence that the applicant was already serving. He noted that the offence with which he was dealing had been committed whilst on bail.11 It was argued that if the applicant had been dealt with by the one judge it could be assumed that there would be a concurrency of sentence and that therefore, by accident as it were, the applicant had been exposed to and received an accumulation of sentence. I would reject that contention. It does not follow that, if McGuire DCJ was dealing with both matters for example, the total term imposed by him for both offences would have been as short as that which he imposed for the single offence.12 In any event, no judge could bind the action of a subsequent judge obliged to deal independently with a matter regularly before him. As I have recounted, Blanch DC/CJ gave explicit attention to the question of concurrency of sentence and any view of McGuire DCJ was really irrelevant to the subsequent judge's independent exercise of sentencing discretion. I see no error in it and I would reject that argument.13 The principal thrust of argument on behalf of the applicant has been that it is asserted that both judges were misinformed in relation to the availability of rehabilitative supervision by juvenile justice officers upon the applicant's potential release from custody. It is pointed out that if the applicant has reached the age of eighteen, he will be released from custody under the supervision of the adult probation and parole service, whereas there are remarks in their Honours' sentences which indicate that they specifically believed that he could be supervised by officers of the Juvenile Justice Department. Therefore it is argued that there is an unintended interruption to a continuing rehabilitative process about which their Honours had been misinformed.14 It is apparent that the applicant will not be eligible for supervision if released after the age of eighteen by the Juvenile Justice officers. Nevertheless the misinformation to the respective judges does not in my view touch upon any error in their assessment of sentence. It is true that the courts, when dealing with young offenders, regard rehabilitation as a principal and most important aspect. Nevertheless that cannot be permitted to overwhelm the need for appropriate punishment. Still less does a particular form of available possible rehabilitative assistance operate so as to impute error to sentences which are otherwise well within the range of the sound exercise of discretion.15 The short facts which I have related give some idea of the seriousness of these offences. 16 Part of the evidence before McGuire DCJ included the transcript of the interview with the applicant. It showed an absence of remorse and indeed an apparent failure to grasp the seriousness of what he had done. The effect upon the victim in relation to the first matter must have been extreme.17 These sentences are manifestly far less than would have been imposed upon an adult offender upon similar charges. 18 I am entirely unpersuaded that any error has been demonstrated, nor am I persuaded that any other sentence should properly have been imposed. Therefore in terms of the duty expressed in s 6 of the Act, the appeal should be dismissed.19 I would propose that the applications for leave to appeal be granted but in each instance the appeals be dismissed.20 KIRBY J: I agree.21 GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will be as I have proposed.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONSPERLING JWednesday, 14 April 199970217/98 - Regina v Hassan Kalache70216/98 - Regina v Emad Sleiman70036/98 - Regina v Leanne CassarJUDGMENT NO. 11HIS HONOUR:1 On 9 April 1999 I ruled that evidence which the Crown wished to adduce as to the identity of Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar in certain covertly recorded conversations was admissible, subject to arguments yet to be put on a basis not argued to date.2 The conversations were recorded via listening device and telephone intercept and occurred at 8/42 Newman Street, Merrylands. The speakers recorded allegedly include, so far as is relevant, the accused, Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar. Ms Cassar, through her counsel, conceded that the voices included his client as alleged by the Crown. Mr Sleiman did not concede that the voices in the recorded conversations were his or Ms Cassar’s.3 The evidence sought to be led by the Crown in proof against Mr Sleiman that the conversations did include Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar is oral evidence by Det Sgt McNab (which I heard on the voir dire), evidence by a Mr Rizk (whose statement was tendered on the voir dire) and other evidence which for the purpose of the ruling it was conceded the Crown would be in a position to call.4 I will deal first with the evidence tending to establish Mr Sleiman’s voice.5 The evidence of Det Sgt McNab, as given on the voir dire, was that between 3 December 1997 and 11 December 1997 he listened to recorded conversations which included some hours of a male voice. He then met Mr Sleiman in person on 11 December 1997 when a search warrant was executed. A video of that search, carried out in Mr Sleiman’s presence, was tendered on the voir dire. Mr Sleiman spoke on that occasion. Det Sgt McNab said Mr Sleiman’s voice, as heard on 11 December 1997, was the same as the male voice he had heard in the recorded conversations. Det Sgt McNab said he then listened to conversations recorded after 11 December 1997. On 8 June 1998, Det Sgt McNab again attended on the execution of a search warrant at the flat. Mr Sleiman spoke again on that occasion. Again, a video record was made. Det Sgt McNab said additional conversation with Mr Sleiman occurred off camera. Det Sgt McNab said Mr Sleiman’s voice on that occasion was the same as in the recorded conversations.6 The statement by Mr Rizk, tendered on the voir dire, was to the effect that he knew Mr Sleiman before these events. He said a taped conversation purporting to be a record of a telephone conversation between him and Mr Sleiman, being one of the recorded conversations which the Crown wished to put into evidence, was a conversation with Mr Sleiman.7 The facts as to which it was conceded the Crown was in a position to adduce evidence were as follows:· That various persons, including Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar, came and went from the home unit block or building, as distinct from Unit 8 in particular.· That conversations occurred in the flat where persons used and identified the other by the names of Emad and Leanne (being the first names of Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar).· That a conversation occurred on 4 December 1997 between a male person and Merrylands police officers unrelated to this matter where the male person was spoken to about other criminal conduct. (The Crown conceded that this was of no value without further evidence.)· That the flat was leased in the name of Mr Sleiman’s sister.8 The concession concerning Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar going in and out of the building is supplemented by the Crown being able to prove that the times of entry into and/or exit from the particular flat (as indicated by the opening and closing of the flat door) and/or the times of commencement and/or termination of conversations in the flat are conformable with the times of entry into and/or exit from the flat building by Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar (Tr 220). (I have taken what was stated in court in the disjunctive sense in which I have paraphrased it.) The Crown Prosecutor said he understood that was not in issue (Tr 220). There was no dissent by counsel for the accused. I should take this as common ground.9 In Smith (1987) 7 NSWLR 444, the accused was charged with murder and other offences committed on the same occasion. A witness heard voices, one of which implicated the speaker in the offences charged. Nine months later, the accused conducted his own defence in court. The witness listened to him in court cross-examining another witness. She gave evidence that within five minutes or so she recognised the accused’s voice as that of the assailant she had heard at the time of the crime nine months earlier. She said the voice she remembered at the time of the crime was a rough Australian voice, gruff at times, loud at times but at times going to a higher pitch, a bit whiny, a wingy sort of voice and the manner was rude, pushy and very domineering. The evidence was left to the jury.10 The accused was convicted and appealed. Lee J (whom Street CJ and Maxwell J agreed) said that the trial judge was right to leave the evidence to the jury. The appeal was allowed because of misdirection not presently relevant. In the course of his judgment Lee J (at 450) quoted the following passage from the summing up: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Basically then for identification to be reliable of a voice with which one is not previously familiar, the law requires that the voice unlike the appearance of a person - must be found to have very distinctive characteristics, very distinctive characteristics, firstly because of the intrinsic qualities of the voice and secondly because of the circumstances in which it was used so that the totality of the qualities of the voice, both in intrinsic qualities and those brought out by its use in those circumstances, make it readily recognisable to a witness who is not previously familiar with that voice.” 
         
        
       
      
    11 It is apparent from what follows in Lee J’s judgment that he regarded that as a correct statement of legal principle.12 The requirement of distinctive characteristics did not apply where the witness was familiar with the voice prior to the event.13 The facts of Brownlowe (1987) 7 NSWLR 461 (decided eight months after Smith) were similar. Two witnesses heard the voice of one of the offenders at an armed robbery. At the trial the witnesses heard the voice of the accused. In this case though, they were not so sure about the identification as in Smith. They described the voice of the accused relevant at the crime as softly and calmly spoken and as having an Australian accent. One witness said the voice of the accused was similar and the other that she was fairly certain it was the same voice because it was so similar. The accused was convicted and appealed.14 On appeal Hunt J (with whom Finlay and Brownie JJ agreed) referred to a lengthy judgment given by the trial judge, O’Brien J, in Smith (1984) 1 NSWLR 462 concerning the admissibility of voice identification evidence. Hunt J summarised part of that judgment as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Mainly basing his decision upon the American authorities, O’Brien CJ of Criminal Division concluded (at 477) that a witness giving evidence identifying the accused by his voice must either have recognised that voice at the time of the crime because of his previous familiarity with it or, where he had no such previous familiarity, have recognised that voice at some subsequent occasion because it was very distinctive when he first heard it at the time of the crime. When dealing with the facts of that particular case, his Honour twice referred (at 482, 485) to the need for the evidence of a witness on this issue to be that the distinctive features of a voice first heard at the time of the crime were such that the jury could accept that an indelible mental impression had been left in the witness’s mind, thus permitting the conclusion safely to be drawn that the two voices were the same.” 
         
        
       
      
    15 Hunt J went on to say that O’Brien J’s judgment was approved on appeal in Smith. I have not noticed where that occurred, but the judgment is to same effect as the summing-up which was approved on appeal. The alternative requirements of previous familiarity and distinctive character were adopted in Brownlowe. Because there was no previous familiarity, the test was distinctive character. The case failed the test and the conviction was quashed.16 The same approach in point of principle was taken in Brotherton (1992) 29 NSWLR 95. The conviction for a sexual assault, was quashed because of a misdirection not presently relevant. The issue as to whether there should be a new trial gave rise to the question as to whether there was admissible evidence of identification.17 The complainant had spoken to the accused for about ten minutes two days before the assault and the assailant had spoken at the time of the assault. She described the voice as a really low, husky voice.18 Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Wood and Sharpe JJ agreed) referred to Smith and Brownlowe. He restated the alternatives (at 106), introducing - I think for the first time - the word “very” into the first alternative (“where the witness is very familiar with the voice before hearing it at the crime”). His Honour went on to say (at 106): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “But it is clear that the particularly distinctive characteristics of the voices were required in both cases in order to enable it to be recognised by the witness for the first time  
         subsequently 
          to the crime. Such characteristics are not said to have been required in order to enable a voice which was already familiar to the witness to be recognised  
         at 
          the crime. In the second situation, the recognition occurs at the time of the crime; it does not occur as a result of the circumstances in which recognition for the first time usually occurs subsequently. Where someone is already familiar with the voice  
         before  
         the crime, the recognition does not depend upon any particularly distinctive characteristics of the voice; it occurs as a result of that familiarity. A good test is to ask a person to describe the distinctive characteristics of his or her spouse’s voice. Such a description is unlikely to be forthcoming with any precision, but the voice will nevertheless always be recognisable by that person. Accordingly, I reject the argument that, in a case where a witness recognises the already familiar voice of the accused  
         at  
         the time of the crime, his or her evidence is inadmissible unless it is shown that the voice was sufficiently distinctive as to make its characteristics memorable.” 
         
        
       
      
    19 There was other evidence in Brotherton tending to prove the identity of the offender, including a tattoo noticed by the complainant. His Honour went on (at 106): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The issue which arose as to the admissibility of the complainant’s evidence in the present case depended upon the extent of her familiarity with the appellant’s voice. The complainant had spoken to the appellant only the once before the assault upon her, two days earlier and then only for ten minutes. She had not spoken to him when she saw him again earlier on the day when the offences were committed. Yet she said that the man who had sexually assaulted her had the  
         same 
          voice as that which she had heard earlier, and that the voice was one of the factors which had led her to recognise him at the time. It was the appellant whom she named when she woke the foreman shortly after the offences and made a complaint. 
          
         If that had been all, I would have considerable doubt whether the complainant’s familiarity with the appellant’s voice would have been sufficient for the voice identification by way of recognition to go to the jury.” 
         
        
       
      
    20 The use of other evidence to support evidence of voice identification is to be noted. The same approach was taken in Heuston (CCA NSW, 20 June 1995, unreported) (per Hunt CJ at CL, McInerney and Smart JJ).21 The authorities to which I have referred appear to limit the familiarity test to familiarity prior to the occasion in question and the distinctive quality test to recognition subsequent to the occasion in question. I do not see why this should be so. A voice with distinctive qualities may be heard, remembered and then recognised on a later occasion. That point does not, however, arise in the present case.22 It should also be noticed that, despite the scant evidence of prior familiarity, Hunt J in Brotherton left open whether the evidence of voice identification would have been sufficient to go to the jury on its own. He doubted that it would have been, but he did not say it would not.23 An approach contrary to the Smith line of authority, adopted in Victoria and Tasmania, is that the degree of familiarity and the distinctiveness of quality do not go to the admissibility of the evidence but only to the weight a jury might give to it. (the references are given in Bulejcik (1996) 135 ALR 517, 530). Under that approach, those considerations would, of course, remain relevant to the question as to whether the evidence should be excluded on discretionary grounds.24 Bulejcik concerned the capacity of a jury to make a comparison between the accused’s voice in a recorded conversation and as heard in court. I read the judgment of Brennan CJ in Bulejcik  as supporting the alternative approach. On the other hand, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, cited Smith, Brownlowe and Brotherton with apparent approval (at 530). (I would mention that they also stated the familiarity test as applicable to prior experience of the accused’s voice and the distinctive quality test as applicable to subsequent experience of the voice.) McHugh and Gummow JJ said it was arguable that Smith was wrongly decided and appeared to favour the Victorian approach, but they found it unnecessary to decide that question. 25 There was no majority view in Bulejcik upholding or over-ruling Smith. Furthermore, the views on Smith in Bulejcik were all obiter, except possibly that of Brennan J.26 No authority as to any threshold test other than I have mentioned was cited in argument before me. The Smith line of authority is binding on me, if applicable.27 The applicability of the Smith line of authority to the present case is not entirely clear but clear enough. This is not a case of identifying the accused as the person present at the crime by identification of his voice. This is a case of identifying the speaker in recorded conversations heard by the witness as the accused, who subsequently speaks to the witness person to person. Det Sgt McNab asserts a familiarity with a voice by listening to recorded conversations and says that, on meeting Mr Sleiman subsequently, he recognised Mr Sleiman’s voice as that voice. The difference is apparent. But there is no distinction in principles. Indeed, it was common ground in the submissions by the Crown Prosecutor (Tr 228) and by counsel for Mr Sleiman (Tr 243) that there was a threshold test for the admissibility of voice identification evidence and that the test in this case - by whatever route - was familiarity. In my view, the Smith line of authority should be applied, and familiarity is the test.28 As to familiarity, I take the Smith line of authority to refer to the kind of familiarity that would enable a person to recognise the voice on a later occasion without necessarily being able to specify distinctive characteristics in the voice.29 Counsel for Mr Sleiman submitted, first, that prior exposure to the voice in the recorded conversations was not sufficient to satisfy the test of familiarity, and that exposure at the meetings when search warrants were executed was inadequate to enable the witness to make an identification based on prior exposure to the voice.30 I disagree. Det Sgt McNab’s exposure to Mr Sleiman’s voice was substantial in relation to each of the following: exposure to recorded conversations prior to 11 December 1997, in person on 11 December 1997, to recorded conversations after 11 December 1997, and in person on 8 January 1998. Exposure prior to 11 December 1997 was sufficient to make the witness familiar with Mr Sleiman’s voice. Subsequent exposure reinforced that familiarity.31 Having regard to the extent of exposure prior to and on 11 December 1997, a jury, properly instructed and appropriately warned, could reasonably find that the degree of familiarity acquired prior to 11 December 1997 and the extent of exposure on 11 December 1997 were sufficient to enable the witness to recognise Mr Sleiman’s voice, when he met him in person on 11 December 1997, as the voice in the recorded conversations prior to 11 December 1997.32 Having regard to the extent of exposure on those occasions and in subsequent recorded conversations and to the extent of exposure on 8 January 1998, a jury, properly instructed and appropriately warned, could reasonably find that the witness’ familiarity with Mr Sleiman’s voice was sufficient to enable him to recognise Mr Sleiman’s voice on 8 January 1998 as the voice in the recorded conversations before and after 11 December 1997 as Mr Sleiman’s voice.33 If I am wrong in regarding the threshold as satisfied for Det Sgt McNab’s evidence alone, the threshold is satisfied when one has regard to the additional matters to which I have referred and which contribute to the identification of Mr Sleiman as the speaker in the recorded conversations.34 As to identification of Ms Cassar, the Crown begins with recorded conversations between Ms Cassar and members of her family, being her sister and her mother. The mother and sister say the recorded conversations with them are what they purport to be. The Crown then submits that the jury could find that the balance of the proffered conversations include Ms Cassar as the Crown alleges, by comparison of the balance of the recorded conversations with those authenticated by the mother and sister.35 Bulejcik justifies this approach. In my view, the established conversations (with the sister and mother) and the other recorded conversations are sufficient to enable a jury, properly instructed and appropriately warned, to find that all of the proffered conversations allegedly involving Ms Cassar do include her as is alleged. If that is wrong, the appropriate threshold is satisfied when one has regard to the other corroborative matters to which I have referred.36 As a separate argument, counsel for Mr Sleiman submitted that evidence of voice identification evidence should not be admitted without or otherwise than by expert testimony. Such expert testimony is admissible: Gilmore (1977) 2 NSWLR 935; but that does not mean it is required No direct authority was cited in favour of such a requirement. Reference was made to authority relating to handwriting, but that was distinguished in Bulejcik, where Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (at 533) that expert evidence was unnecessary in the case of voice comparison. I do not see why it should be necessary in a case of voice recognition such as the present case. That there exists a body of scientific expertise on the topic does not logically result in lay opinion being inadmissible. I am not persuaded that the evidence is inadmissible on this ground.37 Counsel for Mr Sleiman also referred me compendiously to what appears in Uniform Evidence Law, S Odgers (3rd ed) pages 322-334. The matters referred to there appear to relate to whether identification evidence should be excluded pursuant to s 135 or s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. I think that may remain to be argued as a topic. I have, therefore, deferred consideration of the passage I have mentioned.38 Accordingly, with the qualification mentioned at the commencement of this judgment, evidence of recorded conversations and of the identification of the voices of Mr Sleiman and Ms Cassar should be allowed. The evidence is as follows: 
     
      
       
       (a) The tapes of recorded conversations, transcripts of which are Exhibit A on the voir dire. 
        
       (b) The transcripts, Exhibit A on the voir dire. 
        
       (c) The statements, Exhibit B on the voir dire. 
        
       (d) The log, Exhibit D on the voir dire. 
        
       (e) The videos of the execution of search warrants on 11 December 1997 and 8 January 1998, Exhibit C and F on the voir dire. 
        
       (f) Evidence of opening and / or closing of the flat door and / or commencement and /or termination of conversations in the flat in conformity with entries and / exits by Mr Sleiman and Miss Cassar to or from the flat building. 
        
       (g) Evidence of Miss Cassar’s mother and of her sister authenticating some of the recorded conversations involving Miss Cassar.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONSPERLING JThursday, 15 April 199970329/98 - REGINA v HASSAM KALACHE70216/98 - REGINA v EMAD SLEIMAN70036/98 - REGINA v LEANNE CASSAR  --- JUDGMENT 12 (On admissibility of material in statement of Sgt Buckley) HIS HONOUR: 1 Mr Stacey has given evidence of having seen the accused, Mr Kalache, push the deceased and the accused Mr Sleiman then having lunged at the deceased, consistently with stabbing him. He has also given evidence of having heard the deceased shortly thereafter saying that it was Mr Kalache who had done it. It was brought out in cross-examination that when interviewed by the police immediately following the event, Mr Stacey said nothing about that and gave an account conveying that he had neither seen nor heard anything of the kind. It was further brought out in cross-examination that it was only some seven months later, on 20 December 1997, that the witness gave the police the account of events which he has given in evidence here.2 The witness's explanation, of which the accused were on notice by the service of statements, is that he was put in fear of his own life and that of his family, by things that happened immediately following the stabbing and continued to happen thereafter. Those incidents were traversed, to some extent, in cross-examination with a view to casting doubt on the witness's contention that he was truly put in fear of telling the police what he asserted to be the truth. I allowed re-examination over objection of the accused as to the detail of certain of the incidents on which the Crown wished to rely and as to the effect which the witness said the incidents had on him.3 The evidence now sought to be led is evidence of conversations between Mr Stacey and Sgt Buckley on 6 December 1997 and 13 December 1997. The evidence is contained in a statement by Sgt Buckley dated 15 March 1999, Exhibit P on the voir dire.4 For the reasons which follow, it would not matter whether the evidence were given by Mr Stacey, Sgt Buckley or both. It is convenient, however’ to note the proposed evidence as it appears in Sgt Buckley's statement: ""3. I am a member of the Parramatta Golf Club and have been so for the past 10 years. In December, 1997 I knew of another member, Adam Stacey. I also had dealings with Adam in my role as a Police Officer attached to Parramatta Police Station. At that time Adam was a security supervisor at the General Bourke Hotel, Parramatta. I had a good rapport with Adam and his staff. 
     
      
       
        4. I remember, on Saturday, 6 December, 1997 Adam Stacey approached me in the club house of the Parramatta Golf Club. He said, 'Buck' (my nickname), 'can I see you for a minute?' I said, 'Adam, I have to leave, I'm in a hurry to get home. Is it important?' He said, 'Fuckin' oath it is, I've got huge dramas.' I said, 'Mate, I'm really sorry but can it wait to next Saturday? I'll be here the same time.' He said, 'OK, I'll see you for sure.' I said, 'No worries.' I left the premises. 
        
        5. The following Saturday, 13 December 1997, I again saw Adam at the Golf Club We went to a table and sat down. I said, 'How can I help you?' He said, 'Buck, I can't handle it any more. They're giving me heaps.' I interrupted and said, 'Hold on mate, what are we talking about?' He said, 'The Burton murder. The Lebs won't let me alone. Everywhere I go, they're there. I go shopping with the missus in Westfield, they follow me. They threaten me. They hassle me. I'm worried about the family, mate.' 
        
        
        6. I said, 'Why? Why are they doing this?' He said, 'Because of what I know. What I saw.' I said, 'What did you see?' He said, after a long pause, 'If I give them up I'm a dead man. You gotta understand, they mean business.' I said, 'Look Adam, if you want me to help you, you've got to be straight down the line with me. If you saw the murder, you've got a public duty to come forward. If that's the case, we can help you. We have systems in place to protect you and your family. Nobody will get to you.' He said, 'Buck, I saw the lot. I was in the beer garden out the back and saw the lot.' I said, 'I won't discuss the matter any more with you. That's for the detectives to sort out. I'll organise a meeting between Steve Morrisby and you. I'm back at work next week. Leave it with me.' The conversation concluded. 
        
         
        
        7. I had known Adam Stacey for some considerable time. I had seen him in his work at the General Bourke Hotel. He has always appeared to me to be a sensible, laid-back person, not phased by pressure or stressful situations. I have seen him in potentially violent situations outside the hotel dealing with intoxicated and violent people. He impressed me by the way he took charge of the situation, the way he dealt and spoke with unruly persons and the way he appeared to control his emotions. 
        
         
        
        8. However, when speaking with him at the Golf Club, I noticed him to be on edge, nervous and fidgety. His demeanour was totally in opposition to the behaviour I have previously described."" 
       
      
    5 The whole of that evidence is objected to. 6 The proposed evidence includes the following elements or themes:(a)  A social association between Mr Stacey and Sgt Buckley.(b)  Mr Stacey's wish to speak to Sgt Buckley urgently. 
     
      
       
        
         
         (c) Mr Stacey's anxiety over what he regarded as harassment related to the murder. 
          
         (d) Mr Stacey's belief that if he told the police what he said he saw, he would be killed. 
          
         (e) The implication that Mr Stacey was looking to Sgt Buckley for guidance. 
          
         (f) Sgt Buckley's advice to come forward and his assurance that Mr Stacey would be protected if he did. 
          
         (g) Mr Stacey's statement to Sgt Buckley that he had seen the murder from the beer garden.  
         
        
       
      
    7 There are broadly two categories in this evidence, although they overlap considerably. First, there is the statement by Mr Stacey to Sgt Buckley that Mr Stacey saw the murder from the beer garden and the context in which that statement was made to Sgt Buckley. That evidence is proffered as a prior consistent statement tending to rebut the attack on the credit of the witness in his assertion as to what he allegedly saw. 8 The second category is evidence of Mr Stacey's fear of telling what he saw and heard, as a result of the harassing incidents to which he referred, and as to how Mr Stacey came to tell the police what had occurred, notwithstanding. That evidence is proffered as evidence explaining the delay of seven months which is relied upon by the accused as discrediting the witness' account of events given at that later time and in his evidence here.9 The evidence in the first category, that is, the statement by the witness to Sgt Buckley that he had seen the murder from the beer garden, is admissible. It is relevant and therefore admissible, unless otherwise inadmissible, (Evidence Act 1995, ss 55 and 56) because it tends to support the credit of a witness which has been impugned. The credibility rule (s 102) operates to exclude the evidence, subject to specified exceptions. The exception in section 108(3) applies for the reasons which follow. 10 Section 108(3) provides: ""The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if: 
     
      
       
        (a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted; or 
        
        (b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or reconstructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion; 
        
        and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.""  
       
      
    11 Paragraph (a) of subs (3) is attracted because it was adduced from Mr Stacey in cross-examination that he had made a statement immediately after the event which was inconsistent with his evidence in chief as to what he allegedly saw and heard. Paragraph (b) of the subsection is attracted because fabrication of the evidence in chief has been suggested. 12 That raises the question of leave and I take leave to have been sought. Section 192 provides as follows: ""192. (1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
     
      
       
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 
        
        (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing; and 
        
        (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness; and 
        
        (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought; and 
        
        (d) the nature of the proceeding; and 
        
        (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence."" 
       
      
    13 In Graham (1998) 72 ALJR 1491, it was a ground of appeal that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of a statement by the complainant in a sexual assault case. The statement was made six years after the last of the acts alleged. It was made in conversation with a flatmate when discussing boyfriends. Leave had not been sought pursuant to s 192. The trial judge was not directed to the requirement for leave. 14 In the judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ, the reasoning proceeded on the basis of the statement was admissible pursuant to section 108(3)(b) subject to the question of leave. Leave was held not to have been inevitable had it been sought. The appellant might, therefore, have lost a significant chance of acquittal. It followed that the appeal should be allowed. Callinan J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed, also said that leave would not inevitably have been given. They allowed the appeal on this and other grounds. 15 Some guidance as to how s 192 could be applied in such a case may be obtained from the following dicta in the judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ (at 1493): ""The exercise of the discretion under s 108 depends upon the effect of the evidence on the witness's credibility: here, the suggestion of fabrication. 
     
      
       
        How does the making of a complaint six years after the events bear upon that question? Unless the making of the complaint can be said to assist the resolution of that question, the evidence of complaint is not important (cf s 192(2)(c)) and would do nothing except add to the length of the hearing (cf 192(2)(a)). And in this case, it is by no means clear that the making of a complaint six years after the event does assist in deciding whether the complainant had fabricated her evidence. . . . . . . . . . . . . . The complaint having been made in 1994, and it having led at once to the start of police investigations, it may be doubted that a jury could gain assistance from its making in deciding whether the complainant had fabricated her story."" 
       
      
    16 The gist of this passage is that a late statement which is merely an assertion of what is then given by the witness in evidence has low probative value. It is unlikely to assist in resolving whether what the witness says in his or her evidence is true. Leave might be refused on that account. 17 That evidence may be adduced of statements before action pursuant to s 108(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 in appropriate circumstances in sexual assault cases cannot be doubted: see Hall (CCA NSW, 28 February 1997, unreported), Foley (CCA NSW, 5 June 1996, unreported), BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131, DJT [1999] NSWCCA 22 and Gillard and Gillard [1999] NSWCCA 21. All that is really established by the dicta in Graham, to which I have referred, is that leave is likely to be refused where the statement is merely an assertion of what is then reasserted in evidence. Mere repetition does not make the story unlikely to have been fabricated. The prior statement may not then be ""important"" (see s 192(2)(c)). 18 I would interpolate here a comment about the ordinary case of a police statement in criminal proceedings or a proof of evidence in civil proceedings. Such a prior consistent statement would ordinarily be so devoid of value in answering an earlier inconsistent statement or in answering a suggestion of fabrication as not to be arguably probative at all. It would then not be “relevant”, and would not be admissible on that account. One would not come to the application of the credibility rule in such a case, let alone the exceptions to it. The evidence would be inadmissible at the anterior threshold of relevance. 19 The proposed evidence in the present instance is not mere prior assertion of what was later said in evidence by the witness. There is the context in which the statement was made to Sgt Buckley. It would be open to a jury to accept that this was a statement made by a man, fearful of telling what he knew but looking for a way to do so. A statement made in that context would have a probative value beyond mere assertion, in advance, of what was later said in evidence. It could rebut the suggestion of fabrication. 20 I have taken into account the considerations mentioned in s 192(2). Having regard to the likely overall length of the trial, the evidence in Sgt Buckley’s statement would not add unduly to the length of the hearing. I do not apprehend unfairness to the accused in admitting the evidence. The evidence is important for the reasons I have mentioned. In the exercise of my discretion I grant leave pursuant to s 108(3). 21 I come then to the second category of evidence. That is the evidence as to how Mr Stacey came to tell the police what he says he saw and heard, notwithstanding his fear if he did so, proffered as an explanation for the delay of seven months in doing so. It is, if accepted, the resolution of a dilemma which had existed for that period of time, activated by an approach to Sgt Buckley for guidance and the advice and assurance that Sgt Buckley gave. 22 The evidence is admissible in re-examination, whether adduced from Mr Stacey, from Sgt Buckley or from both. Evidence which explains adverse evidence, adduced in cross-examination, is admissible in re-examination whether adduced from the witness or from some other source: McLean v The Commonwealth of Australia (Sperling J, 27 June 1996, unreported). It does not matter that the evidence goes only to the credit of the witness, as this does. Evidence in re-examination is an exception to the credibility rule: s 108(1). 23 It is submitted by counsel for Ms Cassar that I should not allow the evidence because of the provisions of s 135(b), namely, that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be misleading or confusing. It was observed in this submission that the conversations with Sgt Buckley occurred only a week or so before Mr Stacey making the statement on 20 December 1997; secondly, that Mr Stacey's statement to Sgt Buckley of what he saw was of a very limited nature and not plainly to the effect of the evidence which he gave here; thirdly, that the evidence would be in the nature of the witness corroborating himself. 24 The evidence is not of low probative value for the reasons I have given. It is important evidence in support of the credit of Mr Stacey who is, as I understand it, the Crown's only eye witness to what is alleged to have occurred. I do not believe that there is any serious risk or danger that the jury, properly directed, would be misled or confused about the significance they would be entitled to attach to it. The evidence should not be excluded pursuant to s 135(b). 25 For these reasons, the material in Sgt Buckley's statement may be adduced in evidence.

     REGINA v STEPHEN JOHN BURNS 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Patten in the Dubbo District Court on 8 April 1998. On that occasion the applicant pleaded guilty to two charges, a count of aggravated armed robbery (charged in the alternative to a different offence) and a count of possessing a shortened firearm. His Honour was asked to take into account on a schedule four further charges to which I will make some reference in due course.2 The effective sentence imposed was a total of 12 years penal servitude. His Honour found special circumstances justifying extension of the additional term component of that sentence and ultimately it was constructed to consist of a minimum term of 8 years penal servitude. It has to be said that that is a very severe and significant sentence.3 In brief, the facts are that in the early hours of the morning of 29 August 1997, a person aged 18 years of age was woken from his sleep by a knock on the front door. He was confronted by the applicant who was armed with a shortened .303 rifle. There was a demand for drug and the young man replied that there was none. He was then pushed in the chest with the rifle and hit on the head on a couple of occasions. At the point of the gun the victim was taken into several rooms of the house where the applicant collected valuables. There were further assaults during this activity. On one occasion the victim was ordered onto the lounge room floor and the rifle pushed against his cheek. The barrel slid down his face, damaging the skin. During the activity further threats were made to the victim. In the course of what was occurring, the rifle in fact discharged. Thereafter the applicant fled. It was said that various goods to the value of about $3,000 were taken.4 It is appropriate to take some note of the subsequent arrest of the applicant. The victim himself identified the applicant to police and they executed a search warrant upon his home. He was not there at the time. In a nearby lane there was recovered an amount of the stolen property. It is said that the police also recovered a stolen video which had been sold to an associate of the applicant for $50 on that very morning.5 There was a phone conversation, later in the day apparently, and the applicant indicated that he intended to give himself up. The police advised he should surrender, which he did.6 Upon arrival at the police station, he was routinely asked to participate in an interview, but his response was, ""You know what I did, I don't want to do an interview"". There was some discussion then about the missing weapon and the applicant took police to a location where the weapon was found. It was loaded and there was ammunition with it.7 I indicated I would make some reference to the matters on the schedule. It suffices to mention two of the offences in particular. The first was a matter of assault occasioning actual bodily harm with which was associated a matter of malicious damage to property. I say ""associated"" because they arose out of the same incident. It appears that the applicant and a companion were travelling in a motor vehicle and stopped to pick up a hitchhiker. The pair of them then commenced to attack the hitchhiker with a baseball bat or similar. They caused actual bodily harm to him. A motorist described as a good samaritan stopped in order to prevent further pursuit of the attack. The hitchhiker sought to enter the vehicle of the good samaritan. There was an apparent attempt to strike either the driver or the victim, but the blow with the bat struck the vehicle causing minor damage. I have elaborated upon this matter as it has been the subject of a submission in the course of this application.8 The applicant relies upon five principal grounds and I should deal with them seriatim. The first matter argued on behalf of the applicant asserts that the learned sentencing judge fell into error in relation to his finding of an aggravating circumstance relating to the offence. In his remarks on sentence concerning the discharge of the firearm, he had said, ""Threats were made to the victim, in the course of which the firearm was discharged into the floor. There may be some doubt as to whether or not this was accidental. The probability is that it was not accidental and that it was done as a threat, but there is no suggestion that the weapon was discharged at the victim."" 
     
      
       
       Later in his remarks, his Honour said, 
        
        ""I take a very serious view indeed of persons who commit robberies while armed with any weapon, but particularly with a firearm and, more particularly, with one which is loaded and which, as in this case, is discharged during the course of the robbery. I regard that as very much an aggravating factor."" 
       
      
    9 The argument is advanced that his Honour was bound to find any aggravating circumstance proved beyond reasonable doubt. As a matter of law, that is beyond argument and is not in contest.10 What is in contest is whether, on a fair reading of those two matters together, his Honour has fallen into the error of taking into account as an aggravating factor a deliberate discharge of the weapon by the applicant. I do not read what his Honour has said as indicating that error at all. He has observed that he thought the probability was that the discharge was deliberate, but when he came to the aggravating factor, his reference clearly was to the circumstance that it was an aggravating factor to commit such an offence with a weapon which was in fact loaded because of the obvious risk. The risk fell due when the rifle discharged and his Honour recorded that fact. It was in my view an available aggravating matter for his Honour to find that there was a loaded weapon used in the offence. I am unpersuaded that error was demonstrated in relation to this ground.11 The second ground advanced on behalf of the applicant relates to the offences on the schedule which I have mentioned. It is said that his Honour made an error in that he referred to the applicant having attempted to strike the driver of the vehicle, but in failing to hit him, caused the damage to the vehicle. It would seem from the police facts which were tended to his Honour that such a blow was in fact struck at the victim as distinct from the driver. The short statement of facts records: 
     
      
       
        
         
       ""During the course of the assault, the victim has attempted to flee into a vehicle which had stopped to assist him and the defendant has struck the vehicle with a baseball bat, causing a dent to the rear passenger side door."" 
       
      
    12 In my view it is a matter of total inconsequence whether the blow was aimed at the victim or the good samaritan. If his Honour erred in finding the blow was aimed at the driver, it was, as I have said, not a matter of any consequence.13 The next matter advanced on behalf of the applicant concerned the weight that needed to be given to the applicant's plea of guilty and cooperation with authorities. The matter of evaluation is a matter for the trial judge. It was contended that his Honour's finding of the Crown case was strong was a circumstance that was only made available by reason of the cooperation of the applicant, particularly in his assistance in locating the loaded weapon.14 As I have mentioned, the victim was able to identify the applicant. It is true that the remarks made upon arrest were less than a full confession, but given the overall circumstances, including the finding of the proceeds of the robbery and the apparent ability of the police to locate one of the items sold that morning to an associate, I would not estimate the Crown case as anything other than strong. It is true that as a result of the cooperation of the applicant, the Crown case became virtually invincible, but, as I said at the outset, the evaluation of this worth was essentially a matter for the presiding judge and I am unable to perceive any error in his assessment.15 The fourth matter advanced on behalf of the applicant related to the principle of totality. It was said by senior counsel for the applicant to be unusual to charge a person with aggravated armed robbery and a separate firearm offence. The outcome of the proceedings was that the sentencing judge imposed a term for the firearm offence which was totally absorbed in the minimum term of the more serious matter. However, it was argued that there was some implicit doubling up, as it were, in the procedure adopted by the Crown. I should record that the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor in response to these submissions indicated to the court that in his experience it was the Crown practice where shortened weapons were presented in such circumstances to charge the additional matter. It is not necessary for this court to enter upon a determination of the relative experiences of Senior Counsel. What this court must do is determine whether or not there is manifest error in either the approach or the assessment of the sentencing judge. In my judgment there is no such error to be seen.16 The fifth and final matter argued on behalf of the applicant was that the sentence was in any event manifestly excessive. We were referred to various statistics extracted from the Judicial Commission records. It was observed that this sentence was, so far as the statistics demonstrate, at the very top of the range of sentences imposed.17 It has to be observed, of course, that in relation to the aggravated armed robbery, the total term is less than half the statutory maximum prescribed. This was, however, as I observed at the outset, undoubtedly a very severe sentence. In my view, it was warranted. The facts were particularly serious and the principal matters taken into account in the schedule were by no means minor.18 The question ultimately for this court on such a ground is whether or not there has been a miscarriage of sentencing discretion on the part of the sentencing judge. I am unable to perceive that. Whilst I believe the sentence is markedly severe, it is in my view within the range of a sound exercise of discretion. Because of the length of sentence, leave should be granted to appeal, but I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.19 BELL J: I agree.20 GROVE J: The order of the court therefore is that application for leave to appeal against sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

     REGINA v BRADLEY JOHN McKENDRICK 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Grogan DCJ in the Sydney District Court on 16 October 1997. On that occasion the applicant was sentenced, having been convicted by his Honour after a trial without jury, to a total term of two years and eight months penal servitude comprising a minimum term component of two years specified to commence on 19 September 1997 and to expire on 18 September 1999. The sole matter raised for deliberation on behalf of the applicant is the question of parity with sentences received by co-offenders and one co-offender in particular.  2 The offence in respect of which the applicant was an accessory before the fact was a robbery which took place upon a public street when a female employee of a Mobil service station and convenience store was on the way to the bank with a little under $5,000 takings. The victim was an employee of such an establishment at Ashfield and the applicant was the manager of a similar facility at Burwood; hence, he was able to give information as to the likely amount of money that was being taken to the bank, the address of the bank, the expected times of arrival and other information which would enable the crime to be carried out.3 The crime was, in fact, carried out by a man called Sljivar. Two other participants were a man called Shaitly and a woman called Thompson. For present purposes one can ignore the participation of Thompson who was, in fact, charged as an accessory after the fact. Shaitly was also charged, like the applicant, with being an accessory before the fact.4 The three co-offenders were variously dealt with before Graham DCJ. Grogan DCJ was advised of the outcome of the proceedings concerning them. He came to the conclusion, which he expressed, that the question of parity did not arise. By that I understood his Honour to be saying he did not feel questions of parity obliged him to make any particular reference for quantifying his sentence, to what had been received by the co-offenders.5 There were undoubted differences between the applicant and Sljivar and Shaitly. Both of the latter pleaded guilty. Sljivar gave assistance to the extent of giving evidence in the case against the applicant. Shaitly was said to be entitled not only to a discount of appropriate sentence for his plea of guilty but also for matters taken into account pursuant to s 442B of the Crimes Act. It would appear that whatever was the focus of the matters taken into account under that provision, they had been raised in other proceedings in the District Court but the sentencing Judge dealing with his offence of accessory before the fact to robbery came to the conclusion that there was a continuing benefit to authority which ought to be reflected. Accordingly, I would comment that it is easy to see how Grogan DCJ came to the conclusion that the matter of parity could be put to one side, as it were.6 We have, however, today been taken to the record, in particular, of the offender Shaitly. It should be commented that the applicant had no significant past record, whereas Shaitly, in particular, had a considerable record and at about the time of the current offence was directly before courts for matters of some seriousness. It is unnecessary to recapitulate all the details of Shaitly's forensic excursions. It was submitted by counsel that analysis showed that Shaitly, in fact, served but four months and eight days specifically referrable to his participation in this offence. 7 Mr Dawe of Queen's Counsel for the Crown very fairly has indicated to the Court that he cannot dispute the arithmetic which leads to that conclusion and he has acknowledged that if it be the fact that Shaitly has served but four months and eight days in reference to his participation, then the contrast between that and the term of two years and eight months imposed upon the applicant, including the minimum term component of two years, would be likely to provoke intervention by this Court.8 The issue of parity is governed by well-known authority, including The Queen v Lowe and the recent judgments in the High Court in The Queen v Postiglione. It is unnecessary for present purposes to engage in an analysis of either of those cases. 9 In my view it is apparent that although the participation in the offence of the applicant and Shaitly were different and although Shaitly was entitled to discounts for the reasons which I have mentioned, the yawning gap between the sentence he has been required to serve and that required to be served by Shaitly is such that it should be concluded that the applicant is entitled to harbour a justified sense of grievance by reason of the lenience which was received by Shaitly. Therefore, in my view this Court ought intervene. It will be observed that the minimum term element of the applicant's sentence has less than six months to run. At the outset of proceedings, inquiry was made as to why there had been such a long delay in this matter coming before the Court and we were informed that the delay was as a consequence of the inability to obtain necessary transcript from courts below. It is common ground that the significant delay does not result from any action by the applicant. 10 The minimum term to serve under the current sentence has been served to the extent of in excess of 18 months. Although I regard the participation of the applicant, in effect, targeting a fellow employee for robbery on her way to the bank, as a matter requiring significant punishment I am unable to conclude that as a matter of parity the applicant should serve by way of minimum term any longer than he has already served. 11 For the reasons that I have sketched I have come to the conclusion that the following order should be made:-12 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted.13 The appeal be allowed.14 The sentence imposed in the District Court be quashed. In lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a total term of two years penal servitude to consist of a minimum term of 18 months commencing on 19 September 1997 and expiring on 18 March 1999.15 I would direct that the applicant be released to parole with effect from 18 March 1999 and whilst on parole he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. 16 BELL J: I agree.17 GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as I proposed.

     REGINA v RGG 
      
      
     The appellant was convicted of two counts of sexual intercourse with a girl under sixteen, without her consent, contrary to s 61D(1)  
     Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) 
     . He was sentenced to concurrent terms of 12 months penal servitude, and to additional terms of 4 months penal servitude, in relation to the two offences. 
      
      
     His case was essentially that the verdicts should be set aside on the ground that they were unreasonable, or could not be supported, having regard to the evidence, and that in lieu a verdict of acquittal should be entered. 
      
      
     HELD 
      (allowing the appeal): 
      
      
     (1)  
     The Court must examine independently the nature and quality of all the evidence to determine whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.

      (1991) 171 CLR 432, followed. 
      
       
      
     (2)  
     If the Court concludes that notwithstanding the existence of evidence sufficient to entitle a jury to convict, the jury ought nevertheless to have entertained a reasonable doubt, then the ground is made out.

     (3)  
     In undertaking this exercise, the Court should respect the advantage that the jury had in seeing and hearing the evidence, where that is capable of resolving any doubt experienced by the Court. 
      
       
     Chidiac  
     (above), 
      M  
     (above) followed. 
      
       
      
     (4)  
     Notwithstanding the trial judge’s impeccable directions to the jury, the combination of circumstances identified by counsel for the appellant were such that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt. They were: 
      
     (i) the complainant’s tender age at the time of the alleged incidents, and the extent of her claimed recollection some 13 years later; 
      
     (ii) the apparent absence of any signs of physical injury or of distress of the complainant immediately following an allegedly forceful incident; 
      
     (iii) uncertainty as to the year in which the conduct alleged took place; 
      
     (iv) the circumstance that not only the appellant, but also three other persons said to have been present when the offences took place denied any such event; 
      
     (v) the improbability of the occurrence taking place in a household where there were other persons immediately present; 
      
     (vi) the lengthy delay in complaint capable of weakening her credibility; 
      
     (vii) the somewhat inexplicable correction of the account initially given to police, so as to substitute the appellant’s daughter for another girl as the victim of a sexual assault by the appellant’s son, allegedly occurring at the same time, and in the same room as that alleged by the complainant; 
      
     (viii) the fact that the account of the layout of the appellant’s house was contradicted by other evidence. 
      
      
     (5) The weaknesses identified above cannot be satisfactorily explained by the manner in which the evidence was given, or by the advantage that the jury had in seeing and hearing the witnesses. A doubt arises of a positive kind leading to the conclusion that the convictions and sentences should be set aside and verdicts of acquittal substituted.

     (NSWCCA, 9 April 1998), considered. 
      
       
      
     (6) It is emphasised that this does not involve a finding that the complainant lied. It simply means that having regard to the special circumstances of the case and the requirements of criminal proof, the jury should have had a reasonable doubt.

     Regina v RGG 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 THE COURT: The appellant was convicted, following trial in the District Court at Newcastle of two counts of sexual intercourse with SP, a girl then under the age of 16 years, without her consent, knowing she was not consenting thereto (S 61D(1) Crimes Act 1900). He was sentenced to concurrent terms of twelve months penal servitude, and to additional terms of 4 months penal servitude, in relation to the two offences.2 He appealed against the convictions upon the basis that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. Properly formulated, his case was that the verdicts should be set aside on the ground that they were unreasonable, or could not be supported, having regard to the evidence, and that in lieu a verdict of acquittal should be entered. 3 The appeal came on for hearing on 14 April 1999. The Court having reached the conclusion that it should be allowed, and being concerned at the delays in the listing of the appeal, attributable to problems experienced in the preparation and release of the transcript, announced its conclusion and made the necessary orders that day, for reasons that would be later published. Those reasons are now published.4 The test to be applied in a case such as the present is well recognised. It requires this Court to undertake an independent examination of the nature and quality of the whole of the evidence to determine whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused: Morris (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 472/3 and Chidiac (1991) 171 CLR 432 at 442/3.5 It is not enough that there was evidence sufficient to entitle a jury to convict, because a verdict may be unsafe or unsatisfactory even when there is a sufficiency of evidence for the purpose: Chidiac at 443 and at 445. If the Court concludes that notwithstanding the existence of evidence of that kind the jury ought nevertheless to have entertained a reasonable doubt then the ground is made out: M (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493-5 and Jones (1997) 191 CLR 439. 6 In undertaking this exercise it is appropriate for the Court to respect the advantage that the jury, which is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, had in seeing and hearing the evidence, (Chidiac at 443-4, 453 and 462) and M at 493, where that is capable of resolving any doubt experienced by the Court. Otherwise, as was said in M at 494: “Where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the Court will be one which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” 
     
      
       
         
       The Crown Case 
       
      
    7 The complainant gave evidence that the incidents charged occurred on the same day, at the home of the appellant, at Stanford Merthyr, in late 1982. These premises were situated near the home of her grandparents with whom she was living. Her parents had divorced and her mother was living in Queensland. She dated the incident by reference to the circumstance that it occurred while she was in kindergarten at Stanford Merthyr, towards the end of the year in which her brother was born (2 February 1982), and after her mother had left to go to Queensland (six months after his birth). She also dated it by her recollection that in the following year she began 1st class at Stanford Merthyr school, and met another girl, RS, who lived a few doors down from the appellant. That girl, she said, she knew for two years before moving to Queensland, in 1984. She recalled that she had been petrified when walking past the appellant’s home to this girl’s house to play.8 She said that she was five years old when the offences occurred. She was friendly with the appellant’s daughter, P, who was in the same class as her. As a result she often visited the appellant’s home to play.9 The appellant had three children - a son aged about 8 years, P who was the same age as the complainant and another daughter who was about three.10 The complainant said that one afternoon while she was visiting her friend, they and another girl, LG were sitting in the lounge room watching TV. The appellant, she said, entered the room, grabbed her by the wrists, and dragged her down to the floor. He took hold of her wrists with one hand and with the other hand rubbed her genital area and removed her underpants. He tried to separate her legs. She screamed and kicked continually. He inserted his finger in her vagina. She said that this was painful and the incident lasted less than half a minute. She yelled at him repeatedly to stop. He repeatedly told her to “shut up”. 11 She said that, contemporaneously with this occurrence, the appellant’s eight year old son, who had come into the lounge room with him, behaved in the same manner as he had, with her friend (his sister) P. She was not sure of the whereabouts of the other girl LG, nor of the appellant’s wife, whom she had earlier seen in the kitchen. We interpolate that when the complainant first spoke to police she said that it was LG who was the victim of the assault by the appellant’s son. However, after reflection she realised that she had been mistaken and that it was his sister who was assaulted. She corrected this detail, and a diagram that she had drawn of the positions in which the girls had been sitting on the lounge, a week after first speaking to police.12 The incident in the lounge room gave rise to the first count. It was followed, the complainant said, by the appellant dragging her to her feet by her wrists, and then down the hall to the bedroom. There he sat her on a double or queen size bed. He pulled her legs apart and put his head between them. She felt his tongue over and then inside her vagina. She tried to get up but was held down. He removed his clothing and pulled her hand toward his erect penis demonstrating that he wanted her to masturbate him. She kept pulling her hand away. The appellant, she said, raised his voice and told her that she had to do what he wanted. He dragged her off the bed onto the floor , and with his arm dangling over the side placed his finger in her vagina. This alleged conduct gave rise to the second count.13 The appellant, she said, told her that she should not tell anyone what happened because he knew where she lived. She got up and ran from the room out the front door. She went directly home. She did not say anything to her grandmother. She said that, after this, she did not return to the appellant’s home or play with his daughter, although she may have spoken to her at school. She could not recall what happened to the underpants that the appellant had removed, nor could she recall whether she had suffered any bruising or swelling to her wrists, any carpet burns to her body, or any bleeding or pain after the incidents. 14 In October 1995, the complainant became engaged. While playing with her fiancee she reacted badly when he held her by the wrists. He questioned her at length as to the reason for this. In the course of this discussion she disclosed the matters mentioned above. She did not make any complaint to police until February 1996, following further discussions with her fiancee and with a “friend” about the matter.15 In the course of her evidence, the complainant was positive that she had been at the Stanford Merthyr Infant School between 1982 and 1984 and that there was no period of absence from the school while she went to Queensland. The school records, however, disclose that she was enrolled on 4 February 1982 and on 15 September 1982 transferred to a school in Queensland. She returned to Stanford Merthyr on 22 November 1982, before leaving again for Queensland on 16 December 1982. She came back to Stanford Merthyr school on 15 March 1983, and remained there until 13 December 1984.16 The complainant said that the school records were incorrect, as were the records for her friend RS, which showed that she had not enrolled at the school until 1984, a year after that suggested by the complainant.17 The complainant gave evidence of opening the front door by using the door handle. There was no deadlock that she recalled. She agreed that there were errors in the markings she had placed on a plan of the loungeroom, particularly concerning the relationship of the hallway to that room and the existence of walls between these areas of the house.18 She denied that the appellant’s children had swum in her grandparents pool after the incidents. The defence case19 When interviewed by police, the appellant denied the allegations. He gave sworn evidence at the trial, denying the events alleged, both so far as they related to himself and to his son. He gave evidence to the effect that the doors to the front of the house were of a security type. The front door had a dead lock and the screen door was a security door. Each was kept closed. A key was left in the deadlock which was about 4 feet above the floor, and the security door had a barrel lock that was kept engaged. 20 He said that his children swam in the pool at the complainant’s home after the date of the alleged incident, ie in 1984, when P had learned to swim. They were not allowed to do so until they had learned to swim. That did not occur until the end of 1983 or the beginning of 1984. A swim certificate of proficiency that P obtained, issued in 1984, was tendered as was another certificate obtained the following year. He denied being aware of any animosity between himself and the appellant or her family. He had never engaged in playful conduct with the complainant, nor did he ever have any physical contact with her.21 The appellant’s wife gave evidence that the complainant attended at their house until the girls left infant school. She denied any incident of the kind alleged, and corroborated the evidence of the appellant, in relation to the time at which the children learned to swim. 22 PG denied ever being in the presence of the complainant when she was sexually assaulted by the appellant. She also denied that she had herself been sexually assaulted by her brother in the presence of the complainant and her father. She said that she attended the complainant’s home, and that the complainant attended her home, during 1983 and 1984. 23 The appellant’s son similarly denied the events alleged by the complainant, as did LG, who was called in the prosecution case. 24 The appellant’s wife and his two children agreed that they had discussed the case with him and were aware of the contents of his ERISP. They denied however covering up for him. 25 The matter came on for hearing as a retrial, the jury at an earlier trial having failed to agree on a verdict. Were the verdicts unsafe and unsatisfactory?26 The facts of the case are, on any view, unusual. The directions given by his Honour were impeccable. All relevant warnings concerning the possible unreliability of the complainant’s evidence by reason of her age; concerning the care with which the jury should approach her evidence, since the Crown Case rested solely upon it; and concerning the delay in complaint, both so far as it may have affected the complainant’s credibility, and the ability of the appellant to defend himself, were given. 27 The question on appeal accordingly comes down to the question whether, after an independent assessment of the evidence, and after giving due regard to the advantage that the jury had in seeing the witnesses, this Court reaches the view that they ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt.28 We are of the view that the concatenation of circumstance identified by Senior Counsel for the Appellant were such that a jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt. Individually they would not have been enough, but when considered in combination there is in our view, a very real risk that the appellant was wrongly convicted.29 The matters that lead us to this conclusion are the following: 
     
      
       
       (a) the tender age of the complainant at the time of the alleged incidents, and the extent of the recollection that she claimed to have had some thirteen years later; 
        
       (b) the apparent absence of any signs of physical injury to the complainant or of distress on her part immediately following an incident, which if true, was one involving a degree of force; 
        
       (c) the uncertainty that arose, upon the evidence, as to the year in which the conduct alleged took place. Her recollection of the events was somewhat inconsistent with the school records, although it must be conceded, they would not have excluded the opportunity of contact between the appellant and herself for much of the year 1982, including a short period towards the end of the year. Her evidence was also inconsistent with the school records for RS, at least in some respects, and with the evidence of the appellant’s family as to whether PG went to her grandparents’ home after the alleged incident. Having regard to the course which the trial took, it is not necessary to decide whether the period charged in the indictment was of the essence of the offence (cf  
       VHP 
        (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 7 July 1997 unreported)). The inconsistency identified, and the strength with which the complainant insisted that the school records were wrong, are matters that properly went to the reliability of her evidence. 
        
       (d) the circumstance that the appellant gave sworn evidence, denying the complainant’s version, and that the other persons said to have been present, or to have been involved in similar conduct, also denied her version. The case was not simply one of conflicting evidence given by a complainant and by an accused, but one in which the complainant was also contradicted on oath by three other persons who, on her account, were present and able to corroborate her. While the appellant’s children, and his wife, for that matter, may have had an interest to serve in protecting him, their evidence was not weakened in cross examination and they were adamant that they were not trying to cover up for him. Furthermore, there was no reason to suppose that LG was other than an independent, and hence impartial witness. 
        
       (e) the improbability of such an occurrence taking place within a household where there were other persons immediately present, including the appellant’s wife who, if the appellant was correct, not only ignored, but was unaware of what would have to have been a determined attack, accompanied by a good deal of screaming and resistance on the complainant’s part; 
        
       (f) the lengthy delay in complaint which was capable of weakening the complainant’s credibility, particularly when it is recalled that any fear that she may have held , arising out of the appellant’s caution that he knew where she lived, should have abated once she moved to Queensland.  
        
       (g) the somewhat inexplicable correction of the account initially given to police, so as to substitute the appellant’s daughter for the other girl. The explanation offered, that the complainant had been carefully thinking about the matter for a week, is not a readily acceptable answer when it was her evidence that she had been thinking about, and discussing, the incidents for a period of four months or so before going to the police. 
        
       (h) the correction she made to the plan to accommodate this change in recollection, and the fact that her account of the layout of the appellant’s house was contradicted both by physical evidence and by the oral evidence of the inhabitants of those premises. 
       
      
    30 The case is accordingly one where there are some very obvious weaknesses in the complainant’s evidence, along with the powerful feature that witnesses who, on her account, should have been able to corroborate her if her account was true, said, on oath that the matters alleged did not occur. 31 While we recognise that considerable weight needs to be given to the circumstance that the jury accepted the complainant’s evidence, after having been given all of the warnings relevant to this case, including the warning that they carefully scrutinise what she said, we do not consider the weaknesses identified can be satisfactorily explained by the manner in which the evidence was given, or that any doubt in that regard can be resolved by reference to the advantage the jury had in seeing and hearing the witnesses. 32 A doubt does in our view arise of a positive kind, which leads us to the view that the present case is one where unlike RJC (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, 1 October 1998) or Williams (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 23 February 1999) but like Harvey (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 9 April 1998) the line was crossed, so that the convictions and sentences should be set aside and verdicts of acquittal substituted.33 We emphasise that this does not involve a finding that the complainant lied. Rather, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, and the requirements of criminal proof, it means that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt. As was explained in Chidiac (at 444) when the Court intervenes on this basis: “it is not substituting its view of credibility for that of the jury; the court is giving effect to its conclusion that, notwithstanding the jury’s apparent willingness to accept the particular witness or witnesses as credible, the evidence was, having regard to its nature and quality, insufficient to satisfy a reasonable jury of the accused’s guilt according to the criminal standard of proof.”

      The applicant was sentenced on 4 December 1997 to a fixed term of imprisonment of ten weeks for each of two offences. She was granted bail by Hidden J of the Supreme Court on the assumption that an appeal to that Court had been lodged. Although the applicant applied for leave to appeal the initial conviction, her primary submission was that the sentence has expired and that there was thus no need to address the application.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: On 4 December 1997 the applicant was sentenced by her Honour Judge Murrell SC to a fixed term of ten weeks imprisonment for each of the offences. The appellant had pleaded guilty to an offence of cultivating a prohibited plant, namely cannabis, contrary to s23(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). She had pleaded not guilty to a charge of supply of cannabis leaf contrary to s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. However, after a trial she was found guilty of the second offence.2 In her Reasons on Sentence, her Honour emphasized that ""The offences should be seen as part and parcel of the same incident"". Police had attended the applicant's thirty-five acre property at Rocky Hall where they had located fifteen cannabis plants in a greenhouse. Inside the home police located 3.6 kilograms of dried (or drying) cannabis plants. As her Honour remarked: ""The police did not locate any indicia that a commercial enterprise was being conducted. There is no evidence whatsoever that the prisoner was growing or keeping cannabis for the purpose of selling it. Indeed, all the evidence points to the opposite conclusion. The prisoner's own use of cannabis was very substantial ... However ... it is plain from the quantity of material in question that the prisoner was disseminating some of the drug within her premises to other people.""3 The applicant was sentenced on 4 December 1997. On 15 December 1997 she was granted bail by Hidden J of the Supreme Court. She entered bail on 16 December 1997. That bail was granted on the assumption that an appeal had been lodged on her behalf. That appears clearly from the third condition of the bail which included the obligation to 'prosecute the appeal diligently'. The Court was not provided with a transcript of the reasons of Hidden J.4 The Court was informed that the applicant complied with the reporting conditions attached to the grant of bail by Hidden J. Subsequently she discovered that, contrary to her belief, no appeal was in fact on foot. She surrendered herself and made application for bail which came before Grove J on 18 August 1998. He granted bail. She had been in custody for twelve days.5 In his reasons of 18 August 1998, Grove J said: ""No trace can be found of a notice of appeal or application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. That is unsurprising having regard to there having been found, apparently in the records kept at Mullawa, a notice of appeal to the District Court filled in and apparently signed by the applicant. That particular form would be appropriate for an appeal for a person sentenced in the Local Court seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court. In short, it appears that the applicant was given the wrong form. What happened to it after she filled it in is not clear, although as I have said a copy appears to have remained in the records of the custodial centre. 
     
      
       The application for bail, however, did reach the Court and a bail file Number 73447 of 1997 was raised ... 
       
       The bail application came before Hidden J on 15 December 1997. It would appear from my examination of the file to have been assumed by all present on that occasion that there was in existence an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Although the file does not contain any record of his Honour's reason for decision, it is plain that he was satisfied that special circumstances existed, justifying the grant of bail and I would further infer that a powerful consideration would be the circumstance that the entirety of the sentence would be completely served before in any practical sense, the appeal could be heard."" 
      
    6 Grove J exercised the powers of this Court pursuant to s22(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to extend time for the lodgment of an application for leave to appeal and he added: ""The consequence of that order is that there is now a pending appeal or application for leave to appeal, in respect of which a bail application may be obtained.""7 His Honour also said: ""The bail granted by Hidden J is probably a nullity given the absence of a foundation of appeal …"".8 The primary submission on behalf of the applicant was that sentence has now expired and accordingly there is no need to address the application for leave to appeal.9 The formal sentence of her Honour was in the following terms. ""In each matter you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten weeks to commence today 4 December and to expire on 11 February 1998. Those sentences are to be served concurrently.""10 The issue turns on the proper construction of s18(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which provides: ""18(2) The time during which an appellant is at liberty on bail (pending the determination of his or her appeal) does not count as part of any term of imprisonment or penal servitude under the appellant's sentence.""11 The issue is what does 'at liberty on bail (pending the determination of his or her appeal)' mean within this section.12 Counsel for the applicant relied on s6(e) of the Bail Act 1978 (NSW) which provides: ""6. Bail may be granted in accordance with this Act to an accused person in respect of any one or more of the following periods ... 
     
      
       (e) The period between the lodging of an appeal and its determination, being an appeal against a conviction or order or against the severity of the person's sentence."" 
      
    13 By s62 of the Bail Act 1978 the power of the Supreme Court to grant bail in its inherent jurisdiction has been abolished. The power of the Supreme Court to grant bail is identified as a grant of bail 'in accordance with this Act' (s28 of the Bail Act 1978).14 The power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant bail under s30 of the Bail Act 1978 is expressed in the following way: ""30. The Court of Criminal Appeal may grant bail in accordance with this Act to any person accused of an offence if, in connection with the offence - 
     
      
       (a) an appeal is pending in the Court; 
       
       .... "". 
      
    15 Section 30AA of the Bail Act 1978 provides: ""30AA. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, if - 
     
      
       (a) an appeal is pending in the Court of Criminal Appeal against - 
       
       (i) a conviction or indictment; or 
       
       (ii) a sentence passed on conviction on the indictment 
       
       ... 
       
        
         (b) bail shall not be granted by the Court of Criminal Appeal or any other Court unless it is established that special or exceptional circumstances exist justifying the grant of bail."" 
        
       
      
    16 As quoted above Grove J contemplated the possibility that the order for bail by Hidden J was a 'nullity'. His Honour was not using that term in a technical sense. An order of a superior Court is not a nullity, it is valid until set aside. (See for example Cameron v Cole (1943) 68 CLR 571 esp at 590 to 591). Rather, his Honour was indicating that the bail granted by Hidden J was not authorised by the Bail Act 1978. However, it was never set aside.17 It may be, therefore, that the order by Hidden J to grant bail satisfied the description of 'liberty on bail' within the meaning of s18(2). However, that is not the full statutory description. These words are immediately succeeded by words in parenthesis as follows: ""Pending the determination of his or her appeal"".18 The issue is whether or not the order satisfied the full statutory description of s18(2). Mr Lamprati, who appeared for the Crown in this matter, conceded that unless he could bring himself within s18(2) there was no other basis on which he could contend that the sentence had not expired.19 In Whan v McConaughy (1984) 153 CLR 631 the appellant had been sentenced to a term of three months to be served by way of periodic detention. He lodged an appeal and was granted bail. When he appeared again in the Supreme Court it was common ground that the appeal which he had lodged was incompetent. He was granted further bail in anticipation of instituting proceedings for relief by way of prerogative writ. As the four person joint judgment described the case: ""The effect of the argument which it is sought to advance on behalf of the applicant is that the unforeseen consequence of the grant and continuation of bail without any accompanying order that the execution of his sentence be stayed, was that he had avoided serving a term of periodic detention to which he had been duly sentenced. It is obvious that that argument has nothing to recommend it in terms of substantive merit. The question which the applicant wishes to raise is, however, a question of some general importance involving personal liberty.  
     
      
       Reluctantly, we have come to the view that special leave to appeal should be granted."" (Page 634 to 635). 
      
    20 Similar considerations of a lack of substantive merit in the points taken, however, arise in this case. 21 In Whan v McConaughy the joint judgment went on to state: ""A sentence of imprisonment, like any other order, must operate in accordance with its terms as interpreted in the context of any statutory provision pursuant to which it is imposed or framed ... The framing of the sentence with the effect of over-riding statutory provisions can, however, intentionally or inadvertently, be such that the imprisonment to which an offender is sentenced is imprisonment during a period which is identified by reference to a nominated specific commencing date ... In the absence of statutory provisions or valid Court order to the contrary, however, the term or period during which the offender is sentenced to be imprisoned will commence on the designated day."" (Pages 635 to 636).22 The Court referred to s8 of the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981 (NSW) and construed it to mean that the term of imprisonment that is required to be served is the term commencing on the specifically designated date. Their Honours went on to say: ""The fact that the applicant did not actually commence to serve the sentence of imprisonment did not, in itself, prevent the term of the sentence from commencing to run."" (636)23 This case is not distinguishable in this respect from Whan v McConaughy. Section 8 of the Sentencing Act 1989 is to the same effect as s8 of Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981 considered in that case. It provides: ""8(1) When setting a minimum or fixed term, a court is required to specify the day on which the term commences or commenced and the day on which the prisoner will be eligible to be released from prison or on parole 
     
      
       .... 
       
       (3) In specifying a day under this section the court may rely on the information then available to the court. 
       
       (4) The purpose of this section is to require the court to give information about the likely effects of a sentence."" 
      
    24 In Whan v McConaughy the Court went on to consider whether the orders for bail purportedly made by the Supreme Court operated to prevent the commencement of the term of imprisonment or to interrupt it after it had commenced. The Court directed attention to s6(e) of the Bail Act 1978, to which I have referred above. It then directed attention to the extended definition of 'appeal' in s4 of the Bail Act to include 'a proceeding by way of appeal'. The Court concluded: ""The extended definition is wide enough to comprehend proceedings in the nature of prohibition or certiorari the object of which is to prohibit further proceedings on, or to secure a quashing of a conviction or sentence for want of jurisdiction or error of law or otherwise ... 
     
      
       The expression 'proceeding by way of appeal' is also sufficiently wide to include a proceeding by way of appeal which was duly instituted but which was incompetent."" (637) 
      
    25 Relevant to this case is the phrase used in the joint judgment of an “appeal which was duly instituted”. 26 In Whan v McConaughy the High Court went on to hold that the grant of bail did not have the effect of a stay of the order of sentence. It concluded that the sentence had run its term by the time that the Court of Appeal purported to set a new date for its commencement. Section 18(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, (then found in s18(3) of the Act before a 1995 amendment) was inapplicable. The Court of Appeal was the relevant court, not the Court of Criminal Appeal.27 The joint judgment in Whan v McConaughy established that the phrase 'proceeding by way of appeal' is sufficiently wide to encompass an appeal 'which was duly instituted but which was incompetent'. In the case now before the Court there was no appeal of any character to this Court, let alone one that was 'duly instituted'. 28 In his submissions Mr Lamprati for the Crown said that the purpose of Hidden J was to release the applicant pending a determination of an appeal, it then being assumed by all persons appearing before him that an appeal had been lodged. Purpose or intention is not sufficient to answer the statutory description in the words of s18(2) 'liberty on bail (pending the determination of his or her appeal)'. This is a provision directly benefiting the liberty of the accused and must be construed strictly in accordance with the well-established doctrine for provisions having such consequences. (See for example Re Bolton; Ex parte Beane (1987) 162 CLR 514).29 In my view the absence of an appeal to this Court prevents the statutory description within s18(2) being satisfied on the facts of this case, for the same reasons that the High Court in Whan v McConaughy concluded in that case, with respect to the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act there under consideration. In my opinion, s8 of the Sentencing Act is to the same effect. Time continued to run under the sentences originally imposed by her Honour. Section 18(2) was, as I have indicated above, the only provision which could have had a relevant consequence. On its proper construction, in my view, it did not have that consequence. 30 Accordingly, the first of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant is upheld. There is no need for the Court to address the application for leave to appeal as the subject matter of complaint has expired.31 JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice.32 BELL J: I also agree.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
     
     
     HIS HONOUR: 
    1 This is an application pursuant to s.30A(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) seeking an extension of the waiting period for an application under s.48 of the Act with respect to certain property the subject of a restraining order made under that Act, which order was varied by Barr, J. on 8 December 1997 to include under the effect of that order, the relevant property.2 Putting aside for the moment the detail of the statutory scheme, in the event that the extension is not granted, on the submissions of the applicants - that is the first and second defendants - property which they claim to be theirs would, in consequence of the operation of the forfeiture provision of the Act, s.30, be forfeited to the Commonwealth on or about 19 May 1999, in consequence of the expiry of six months from the conviction of the third defendant.3 It is contended on behalf of the applicants that the conviction of the third defendant, which is the relevant conviction for the purposes of s.30, occurred on or about 19 November 1998.4 It is contended however, by the Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth, that the conviction had long occurred by that date, and that, by reason of the operation of s.30, the relevant property is already forfeited to the Commonwealth.5 The Director concedes that there is available in certain circumstances statutory provision to enable the applicants to seek to recover the property, notwithstanding forfeiture. Nonetheless, the question of whether the forfeiture has or has not occurred is a question of considerable importance under the statute. That question turns upon when the conviction occurred.6 In that regard I have been provided with the material in the affidavit of Graham Marshall sworn 29 April 1999, to which is annexed a copy of the indictment in relation to the third defendant; the transcript of proceedings before Solomon DCJ on that indictment, which is marked Exhibit B; a further indictment presented against that defendant on 17 July 1998, which is marked Exhibit C, and to which indictment - as he had to the former indictment - the third defendant had pleaded guilty; the transcript of the proceedings on that second indictment on 17 July 1998; and subsequently the transcript of the proceedings on 19 November 1998, which included the continuation of the proceedings on sentence; the addresses on penalty and the sentence.7 There have also been tendered on this application certain extracts from the District Court file, including the notes of proceedings: of 28 November 1997; 23 January 1998; 20 February 1998; the callover dates; the notes of 11 May 1998 and subsequent occasions; but most notably the note of 17 July 1998 signed by the judge reading relevantly, ""Plea: Guilty to all three counts. ... Stood over to 7/8/98 for sentence before me. B/R. Signed: Judge."" (B/R apparently means ""bail refused""); the note of 7 August 1998 in which it is noted that the matter is stood over to 13 August 1998, part heard; the note of 13 August 1998, which is noted and initialled by the associate and contains the following, ""Sentence S/0P/HVO 9/11/98 remand in custody. Bail refused, (P/H)""; and relevantly the notes of 19 November 1998, ""See indictment for sentence imposed""; and the copy of the back sheets of the two indictments setting out the entries signed by the judge for 19 November.8 All of this material was tendered without objection or challenge. Both parties provided to me written submissions. Those submissions, with the amendment of those of Mr. Aitken to show the correct date he there refers to, will be attached to the file copy of this judgment. The evidentiary material is conveniently set out in the submissions of the Director.9 As to the submissions by Mr. Aitken for the applicant, he informs me that he does not raise any constitutional question, as might have been foreshadowed in paragraph 13 of those submissions, nor is there presently before me any application under paragraph 14 of the submissions.10 Although other orders were sought by the motion in addition to the extension of the waiting period, it has been agreed that any questions raised by the seeking of those other orders, should await the determination of whether or not the extension sought in the present matter be granted. Consequently, there remains before me, as the parties agreed, the sole question of the identification of the date of conviction for the purposes of s.30 of the Act. 11 Counsel's extensive researches, I am informed, disclose no statutory provision or rule of court that might be applicable or of assistance in ascertaining when conviction occurred for the purposes of the section. 12 I am informed that if I concluded in favour of the applicants on the issue of when the conviction occurred and that I was satisfied the applicants had diligently prosecuted without undue delay their application, the Director would not oppose the making of the extension order. In that event, the applicants are to provide to the Director a memorandum showing the diligence of prosecutions and the Director is to raise any asserted inadequacy in that material by this afternoon or before 10.00 am tomorrow morning, so that if adequate material is provided, if there is no opposition from the Director and in the event that I rule otherwise in favour of the application, a formal order might then be pronounced.13 On the other hand, if I am not in favour of the applicants' submissions and hold that a forfeiture has occurred, it would only be necessary for me to have that material if it is sought to leave the matter in a condition where only one issue remains should there be an appeal since time, on any view of it, is short. 14 The submissions for both parties accept that conviction in the law of New South Wales, which here is the law applicable, it would seem, and caught up by the provisions of the Judiciary Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act, means different things for different purposes. 15 Section 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act provides that in s.5(1):- ""For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be taken to be convicted of an offence if ...""16 Thereafter are set out certain circumstances, the first of which provides:- ""(a) The person is convicted, whether summarily or on indictment, of the offence.""17 This provision appears to relate to the concept as employed in the relevant court.18 The other circumstances later referred to appear to relate to extensions of the concept.19 Section 5(3) provides that:- ""For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be taken to have been convicted of an offence in a particular State or Territory: - 
     
      (a) where the person is taken to have been convicted of the offence by reason of paragraph (1)(a) - the person was convicted of the offence in a court in that State or Territory."" 
    20 Thus, the relevant State or Territory meaning of the term is caught up.21 In New South Wales, that meaning has been considered by the Court of Appeal in Della Patrona v. Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) No 2 (1995) 38 NSWLR 257 in the context of the very legislative provision here applicable and particularly for the purposes of ascertaining from when the period runs. At p.266 in the judgment of Kirby, P, with whom Priestley and Meagher, JJA. agreed, his Honour dealt with the submissions discussed, initially at p.265B, as to when a conviction occurs. Kirby, P. concluded, in accordance with authority, that conviction occurred when the trial judge indicated that he accepted and proposed to act upon the jury's verdict of guilty. The order of remand was said to have sufficiently indicated acceptance of the verdict of the jury (at p.266G).22 In passing I note Meagher, JA's comments concerning the raising of constitutional questions which no doubt have contributed to the view taken on behalf of the applicant that no constitutional question should not be raised before me.23 It is common ground that I am bound by Della Patrona (supra) if it is not to be distinguished here.24 My attention has been drawn to what is said in Maxwell v. The Queen (1996) 135 ALR 1 by the High Court of Australia. Both parties have contended that various of the observations therein contained are in their favour. Both parties accept that those observations are made in a different context and without reference to the construction of the term ""conviction"" as it appears in the Proceeds of Crime Act and thus, those observations, although powerful, are obita. Both arguments accept that unless I conclude I am not bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Della Patrona (supra), I will not need to consider further those observations.25 Indeed, Mr. Aitken has gone so far as to accept that unless the decision in Della Patrona (supra) is to be distinguished from the present situation, then I would have to conclude that the convictions occurred, as submitted by the Director, at least by 7 August. 26 The relevant matters of fact in this matter, referred to in the written submissions of the Director commencing at paragraph 3 and concluding at paragraph 10, are conceded by the applicants and established by the written material tendered in evidence I have already referred to. Those facts are very similar to those in Della Patrona (supra).27 The bases on which it is said that I should distinguish Della Patrona (supra) include firstly, that that case concerned the acceptance by a trial judge of the verdict of a jury rather than the formal confession of guilt by the prisoner, involved in a plea of guilty; secondly, that that decision involved an application for forfeiture of the property of the convicted accused herself; and thirdly, unlike in that case, in the present case the trial judge, on 19 November, as is set out in paragraph 10 of the Director's submissions, said, ""No, I haven't sentenced him. So he hasn't been convicted."" Subsequently in his remarks on sentence he said that the accused was convicted and the record for that day had inserted in it the words ""convicted"" and ""sentenced"".28 As to the first two matters they do not, in my view, amount to matters which would sufficiently operate to displace what was said by Kirby, P. and accepted by the court in Della Patrona (supra).29 In my view, the word ""conviction"" is used in the Proceeds of Crime Act in a consistent way as referable to the one event, whatever it may be. There seems no valid basis to distinguish between the situation where property of an accused or of another is to be forfeited. Nor does there seem to be any validity in the distinction put forward between the acceptance of the verdict of a jury and the acceptance of an offered plea. While for many purposes there is a distinction and while there may be available in Commonwealth matters to which the Judiciary Act applies, the otherwise obsolete opportunities to set aside or prevent the conviction by moving in arrest of judgment or for a verdict, nil obstante veredicto or, in the case of a plea, to seek to withdraw the plea or set aside the acceptance of a plea, nonetheless the test proposed in Della Patrona (supra) and derived from a substantial body of case law propounds that conviction occurs, whether later to be set aside or reversed, upon any acceptance of the fact of guilt, as established by a verdict or a plea and the acting on it as, where the judge acts upon that plea or verdict in some formal manner equivalent to the pronouncement or entry of judgment, such as the remand in custody for sentence, ie., where there is some unequivocal, formal act of recognition of the fact of guilt and the proceeding to penalty. 30 The third matter presents more difficulty. Mr. Game, SC., who appears for the Director, put that it was apparent that the trial judge did not realise the legal effect of what it was he was doing when he remanded in custody, as amounting to his convicting the accused and that his words and actions on the 19th were explicable on the basis that although he had, both in law and in fact, convicted, a mistaken belief that sentence was essential to conviction caused him to pronounce the conviction on the 19th when he sentenced, that is, on that day he only made a formal pronouncement of conviction since he was under the mistaken belief he had not already convicted.31 Bearing in mind the seriousness of the question and its potential for the forfeiture of the property of a person, not the accused, had I been of view that his Honour had been, at any time subsequent to the plea, other than of an intention to convict, I would have held that the conviction did not occur until the 19th.32 It is inconceivable to me that a judge could convict an accused person, thus so dramatically changing that person's status, unintentionally, whether that unintentional conviction arose from ignorance of the true state of the law or the facts, but in this case it seems patent that at all times his Honour intended to convict and took the steps that Della Patrona (supra) has held amounts to convicting. 33 In my view the views his Honour expressed on the l9th are not such as to lead me to hold as a question of fact that conviction did not occur until that day.34 I am unable to distinguish Della Patrona (supra). Indeed, since, on the authorities, I consider the fact of conviction is primarily to be determined by the act publicly performed by the judge in the recognition of guilt and acceptance of it, there is every reason for me to feel confirmed in the view that Della Patrona (supra) is not only binding but right.35 In those circumstances, and in accordance with the views I have expressed, it is necessary for me to resolve the question of whether there was a conviction or not against the applicants and I do so.36 Therefore, I find that on 11 May 1998 there was an initial conviction, that on 17 July 1998 there were further convictions and that what thereafter occurred was the proceedings on sentence in respect of those convictions. 37 Nonetheless, in the event that a court, having power to do so, should consider that I am wrong or that Della Patrona (supra) was wrongly decided, it might remain open to the applicants to obtain a favourable determination of the application, provided it were determined in their favour, before 18 May. Consequently, if they are minded to appeal, it will be necessary that all possible steps be taken to put the matter in proper order so that an appeal might be determined well before that.38 I would, therefore, direct counsel to bring in tomorrow short minutes as to the form of the appropriate orders giving effect to these views and dealing with any other issues outstanding in relation to the application including, if necessary, diligent prosecution without undue delay, so if the matter goes before the Court of Appeal it will be in a position to deal with it as expeditiously as might, for that court, be convenient.

     REGINA v GARY FREDERICK TROTTER 
      
      
     The appellant was convicted of the supply of a prohibited drug under s 25(1)  
     Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985 
     , and sentenced to an eighteen month minimum term of imprisonment, with an additional term of six months. The weight of the prohibited drug exceeded three grams, and on that basis he was charged with its deemed supply (s 29  
     Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 
     ).  
      
      
     He appealed against the conviction on the following grounds: insufficiency of directions given in relation to the element of possession; insufficiency of directions given in relation to the appellant’s evidence; error in directions given concerning indirect or inferential evidence; and finally, unsafe and unsatisfactory verdict. 
      
      
     HELD 
      (dismissing the appeal and confirming the conviction and sentence): 
      
      
     Sufficiency of directions on possession - leave refused to argue these grounds 
      
     The directions were clear and succinct and complied with the case law. Furthermore no objection was taken at trial to the directions.

     It does not follow from the decision in  
     Williams v Douglas 
     , that the trial judge should direct the jury that they had to be satisfied that the appellant had hidden the drugs. Such a direction would have raised an immaterial issue and imposed on the Crown a burden it did not have to accept.

     The Crown did not seek to rely on joint possession in this case. It was therefore necessary for it to exclude, as a reasonable possibility, possession by some other occupant of the flat. In this regard, his Honour made it clear in his directions that the Crown had to prove the appellant’s intention and ability to exercise control and ownership over the drugs “to the exclusion of all other people”.

     Sufficiency of directions concerning appellant’s evidence - leave refused to argue these grounds 
      
     (4) There is no requirement at law that a trial judge give a direction that the appellant’s explanation for his admission had to be negatived beyond reasonable doubt. The appropriate direction, given in clear and unequivocal terms in this case, is the conventional one requiring proof of the essential elements of the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt.  
      
      
     (5) The suggested direction that evidence of the accused should be placed in a special category, subjected to less critical assessment by the jury, is erroneous.  
      
      
     Directions concerning extent to which Crown can rely on inferential and indirect evidence relating to appellant’s possession of a large sum of money, as well as other indicia of supply of drugs - leave granted to argue this ground, but finding that it has not been made good 
      
     The directions were to the effect that the jury must be very certain that the inference should be drawn, and also certain that there is no other contrary inference that can reasonably be drawn. The directions were adequate, and did not suggest that any lesser onus rested on the Crown. 
      
      
     The submission that the finding of a large sum of money and other indicia of supply was incapable of proving possession, has a weight of authority against it. Evidence of this kind has been regarded as relevant and admissible on charges of deemed supply. Moreover, the Crown is not required to elect whether to rely on the statutory presumption of possession for the purposes of supply, or upon evidence tending positively to establish that purpose.

     (8) In this case, proof that the appellant, a pensioner and regular heroin user, had in his possession a considerable sum of money along with indicia of supply, were relevant and capable of supporting admissions made by him. 
      
     Unsafe and unsatisfactory verdict 
      
     (10) The simple fact is that the drugs were found in the room in which the appellant slept, and he made admissions concerning both their nature and their ownership immediately upon their discovery. The jury were entitled to conclude that these admissions were true. Furthermore, a review of the transcript reveals material inconsistencies in the appellant’s account. In these circumstances, the jury were entitled to find the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

     Regina v Gary Frederick TROTTER 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
      
      
     1  
     WOOD CJ at CL: 
      The appellant was convicted, following trial in the District Court, of the supply of a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine (S 25(1) Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985). He was sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment for eighteen months, and to an aditional term of six months. The weight of the prohibited drug allegedly found in his possession exceeded three grams, and on that basis he was charged with its deemed supply. (S 29 Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act) He now appeals against that conviction. 
      
       
     The Crown Case 
      
     2 It was the Crown case that the premises in which the appellant, a pensioner, lived, together with Steven Moore, Danielle Knopp and her children, were searched with his consent, after he was spoken to at the Advance Loan Office at Newtown, and found to be in possession of $1230 in cash. During the search of the living room, a clear resealable plastic bag containing white powder (heroin) was found under a cushion on the lounge. The appellant was asked whose it was and he said that it was his. He was then asked what it was and he replied “heroin”.  
      
     3 A plastic bag containing a beige coloured powder (methylamphetamine) was found a little while later at the base of a pot plant sitting on a low cupboard behind the lounge suite. When police asked the appellant what it was, he said that it was “speed”. When asked whose it was he said “that’s mine and the heroin’s Steve’s”.  
      
     4 Later at the police station, when the methylamphetamine was weighed and found to be over the 3 grams that attracted the deeming provision, the appellant said that “the speed” was not his but the heroin was. An ERISP followed, in the course of which he admitted that the white powder was heroin, which he had for his own use. He also admitted knowing that the brown powder was “speed”. He said that it was owned by Steve, although he acknowledged telling police earlier that it had belonged to him. When asked why he had said that, he replied, “because I thought that would be lesser than heroin. You know speed isn’t looked on as a hard core drug such as heroin is...” 
      
     5 Other items recovered during the search included a large quantity of small multi-coloured balloons, clear resealable plastic bags, a set of electronic scales that were in working order and were plugged into a power point, and two other sets of scales. The appellant did not admit that the balloons were his. He said that they were for the children of Ms Knopp to put water in. The plastic bags he said were his, and were kept for re-use after he had scored. The electronic scales he said were also his, and had been given to him as a present. When asked in the ERISP as to what use they were put he replied that they were just “an ornament”. 
      
     6 A matter of some importance that arose in the trial was the time at which Ms Knopp returned to the flat, relative to the finding of the methylamphetamine. Senior Constable Stanley, who was directing the search and who spoke to the appellant, was certain that she arrived at the flat after the living room area had been searched and the drugs had been found, and after the relevant admissions had been made. Earlier, he said, her two children, who were being minded by a person who was introduced as a neighbour, were in the bedroom. They were moved out of that room only when the search which had begun in the living room, and which was conducted by Constables Martin, Hanna and Davies, had moved on to this part of the premises. His notes supported this sequence of events. Constables Martin and Hanna were unable to remember when it was, relative to the finding of the methylamphetamine, that Ms Knopp arrived at the premises. Constable Davies said that this occurred about two thirds of the way through the search but she was also unable to remember whether that was before or after the speed was found. 
      
       
      
      
     The Defence Case 
      
     7 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. He said that Ms Knopp and Steve shared a bedroom with the children, and that he slept in the lounge. He said that the money found at the Loan office represented savings from his pension, and that Ms Knopp had them in her purse that day for safekeeping. It had been his intention to go on to Bondi to purchase an airline ticket to Manilla, so that he could visit his wife.  
      
     8 He denied that the methylamphetamine found in the unit was his, or that he knew it was there. The reason he had admitted to its ownership, he said, was because of the concerns that Ms Knopp had expressed about the police taking her children from her, and her obvious distress. In his words, she said “what are you doing to me Gary? What are you doing to me? They’re going to take my kids.” This affected him, he said, because he would have felt responsible if the police had taken the children away from her. 
      
     9 It was his evidence that Ms Knopp had arrived at the flat within a few minutes of his arrival with the police, i.e. before the methylamphetamine was found and before he made any admission concerning it. That substance he said was not his. He had no knowledge of it being there. The heroin, however, he acknowledged was his He said that he had been a heroin addict for twenty years. 
      
       
      
      
     Grounds 1, 2 and 3 
      
     10 Each of these grounds relate to the sufficiency of the directions given, in relation to the element of possession. In this regard his Honour instructed the jury:  
      
      “The law says this, that possession does not necessarily mean ownership. Possession involves these two concepts: first that whatever the Crown is alleging is possessed must knowingly be in the accused’s physical custody or be at some place under his physical control and the second component of this word possession is that the accused must have the intention and ability to exercise control and ownership over the particular property in question, to the exclusion of all other people if he wants to.” 
      
     11 His Honour gave examples of two situations in which a person might be found to be in control of, and hence in possession of property, although it was not in his immediate presence and then repeated what it was that the Crown had to prove in relation to the appellant’s knowledge. These directions were clear and succinct and they complied with the law as declared in  
     He Kaw Te 
      (1985) 157 CLR 523 and 
      Saad 
      (1987) 61 ALJR 243.  
      
     12 They were followed by the direction that one of the essential elements the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt, in this case, was that the appellant was in possession of the beige powder. When dealing with the defence case his Honour explained that no onus of proof rested upon the appellant, and that he was neither required to prove or to disprove anything.  
      
     13 Having regard to the form which the summing up took, and the absence of any complaint by trial Counsel, there is no reason to suspect that the jury were left with any understanding other than that the Crown had to prove that the accused had possession of the methylamphetamine in accordance with the principles that were explained in the passages earlier cited. 
      
     14 Not only was there no objection taken at the trial to these directions, it is evident from an exchange that occurred at the end of the summing up, that the direction on possession was formulated with the assistance of defence Counsel. 
      
     15 The first complaint made, upon appeal, is to the effect that his Honour should have identified as an issue for the jury, whether the appellant had hidden the methylamphetamine under the pot plant. In advancing this submission, reliance was placed upon an observation in  
     Williams v Douglas 
      (1949) 78 CLR 523 at 526/7, that while the expression “possession” did not extend to constructive possession, it was: 
      
      “wide enough to include any case where the person alleged to be in possession, has hidden the thing effectively so that he can take it into his physical custody when he wishes and where others are unlikely to discover it except by accident.”  
      
     16 That statement was made in the context of the observation that the de facto possession, of which the relevant section spoke, was a concept “much more extensive than that of physical custody”. It was not intended as a definitive statement of what is required for de facto possession; it was merely an example of it that was relevant for the case under appeal.  
      
     17 In  
     Douglas 
      it was alleged that the accused had hidden a quantity of gold in the bathroom of a hotel which was some distance from his room, and which was shared by other patrons. When first spoken to about the gold, the appellant denied knowledge of it. Later he said “It’s no use beating about the bush, it’s my gold”. The issue that arose for consideration was whether it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that had  
     actual possession 
      of the gold or exclusive possession or control of the  
     place 
      where it was found.  
      
     18 The Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia remitted the matter to the Local Court with a direction that possession or control had been sufficiently established. Special leave to appeal was refused by the High Court. In those circumstances, the decision does not stand as authority for the proposition sought to be advanced. The observation relied upon is taken out of context. It cannot be elevated to a statement of principle. It is plain that in reaching the conclusion it reached the Full Court was of the view that the magistrate drew the wrong deductions from the facts, and that the admission made was important in deciding the factual issue. 
      
     19 The present case was not one where the Crown sought to rely on joint possession. For the reasons discussed in  
     Filipetti 
      (1978) 13 A Crim R 335,  
     Bazeley 
      (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 23 March 1989) and  
     Sobolewski 
      (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 21 April 1998), it was necessary for the Crown to exclude, as a reasonable possibility, possession by some other occupant of the flat. 
      
     20 In this regard his Honour had made it clear, in the direction noted earlier, that the Crown had to prove that the appellant had the intention and ability to exercise control and ownership over the methylamphetamine “to the  
     exclusion 
      of all other people” if he wanted to. In support of that element it had available the immediate admission by the appellant that he knew what the substance was, and that it was his; additionally it had evidence that it found was in the room where he normally slept. The case was not one, however, where there was evidence from Ms Knopp or “Steve”, of the kind available in  
     Burns 
      (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 19 August 1998), negativing possession by them. 
      
     21 For his Honour to have directed the jury that they had to be satisfied, in this case that the appellant had hidden the methylamphetamine under the pot plant, so that the other occupants of the flat were unlikely to discover it except by accident, would have been to raise an immaterial issue, and to have imposed upon the Crown a burden that it did not have to accept. It was not necessary for the Crown case that the drug had been hidden. Moreover, knowledge by the other occupants of its existence or of its location would not have been inconsistent with possession by the appellant.  
      
     22 The case was effectively conducted as a single issue case, namely whether the admission made by the appellant was true. If the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that, then possession was proved. As no objection was taken to the directions at the trial, and as the relevant issue was appropriately raised, I would refuse to grant leave under rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules, to argue these grounds of appeal. 
      
       
     Grounds 4 and 6 
      
     23 These grounds relate to the sufficiency of the directions given concerning the evidence of the appellant. They can be conveniently dealt with together. 
      
     24 First it was submitted that his Honour should have directed the jury that the appellant’s explanation for his admission had to be negatived beyond reasonable doubt. There is no requirement at law for such a direction to be given. The appropriate direction was the conventional direction requiring proof of the essential elements of the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt . That direction was given more than once and in clear and unequivocal terms. 
      
     25 Next it was submitted that his Honour erred in law when directing the jury that they should treat the evidence of the appellant in the same manner as that of the other witnesses. Further, it was submitted that when referring to the appellant’s evidence, his Honour did so in terms which invited the view that an onus rested upon him to make good the explanation he had offered for the admission. 
      
     26 Neither submission has merit. No complaint was made at the trial. His Honour said, relevantly for the matters now sought to be raised: 
      
      “Now the accused, as Mr. West said to you, was under no obligation even to go into the witness box. He could have sat over there in the dock. In fact he did not even have to bring Mr. West into court to appear for him. He could have said right, the Crown will never be able to prove this, let them go their hardest, to use the everyday expression. But, in addition to saying well the Crown has to prove its case, the accused has said I want you, the jury, to hear my version of the events, so he has come along and he has given evidence in the case too and what you do is you assess his evidence, just exactly the same way as you assess every other witness’ evidence in the case. 
      
       
        You will remember at all times that he is not required to discharge any onus of proof. He is not required to prove anything. He is not required to disprove anything. But he said I want a chance to give you my version of events and he has given you his version of events. Mr. West has said to you when you take into account his version of events could you be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has made out its case?” 
       
      
     27 This was an entirely correct direction. The suggested direction, implicit in the first leg of this submission, that the evidence of an accused person should be placed in a special category, and subject to less critical assessment by the jury than that of the other witnesses, would be erroneous in law. 
      
     28 The second leg of the submission draws upon an observation made by his Honour, following reference to the evidence of the appellant, and of the police witnesses concerning the finding of the drugs, and the entry into the room of Ms Knopp and the children: 
      
      “..you take these matters into account in determining whether or not to accept the accused entirely or in part only, to dismiss his evidence right out of hand, or you might say to yourself well, some of this evidence at least ties in with some of the Crown evidence.” 
      
     29 Read in the context of the summing up, as a whole, this passage cannot fairly be understood as suggesting any reversal of the onus of proof. I would again refuse leave to argue these grounds. 
      
       
     Ground 5 
      
     30 It was next submitted that his Honour erred in the directions given concerning the indirect or inferential evidence relating to the possession by the appellant of a sum of money that it was unlikely that he as a pensioner and heroin user could have accumulated by way of savings from a pension, and his possession of the accoutrements or indicia of the supply of drugs. No objection was taken at the trial to evidence being led in relation to these matters, a tactical decision having been made by defence Counsel that the full circumstances of the incident should be placed before the jury in order to lend credence to the explanation offered by the appellant. 
      
     31 In relation to the extent to which the Crown could rely on inferences in its case, his Honour said, early in the summing up: 
      
      “So that when you are asked to draw an inference in a criminal trial you have got to be  
     very certain 
      that the inference should be drawn and you also have to be  
     certain 
      that there is no other contrary inference that can reasonably be drawn from those circumstances.” 
      
       
        And 
        
        “I have given you a variety of examples about the way you have got to be careful when the Crown prosecutor invites you to draw inferences. You can only draw them if you are  
       certain 
        that it is the proper inference to draw and if you are  
       certain 
        that there is no other reasonably available competing inference to be drawn from those facts.” 
       
      
     32 When dealing with the particular matters that were identified as indirect or inferential items adding to the Crown case his Honour said: 
      
      “Remember what I said to you yesterday, I will not go back over it again. When the Crown asks you to draw inferences you have to be very careful and you have to be  
     satisfied 
      that it is the only rational, reasonable inference that is able to be drawn.” 
      
     33 It was submitted that those directions risked leaving the jury confused as to what matters they needed to be certain about, and as to whether the essential elements of the offence charged had to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. To my mind the directions were adequate, and did not invite any gloss on the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt, or suggest that any lesser onus rested upon the Crown. Counsel at the trial saw no fault with them. I would refuse leave to argue this ground. 
      
     34 Additionally, it was submitted that it was inappropriate, in a case opened as one of deemed supply, for his Honour to have permitted the Crown to rely upon the finding of the money and the other items as indirect proof, and for him to have summed up accordingly. In broad terms, it was submitted they were incapable of proving possession. 
      
     35 The weight of authority is against the appellant on this point. Moreover, the argument overlooks the existence of the exception to the deeming provision contained in S 29(a) of the drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, where the accused: 
      
      “proves that he or she had the prohibited drug in his or her possession otherwise than for supply.”  
      
       
       Although, ultimately no case was advanced by the appellant relying on this provision, the Crown was not to know, in advance of calling the evidence, whether he would or would not change his tack once again, and similarly to the heroin, claim it was for his personal use. 
       
      
     36 In any event, evidence of this kind has been regarded as relevant and admissible on charges of deemed supply, eg  
     Ellis 
      (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 27 February 1987) and  
     Donohoe 
      (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 2 August 1993). In each of these decisions  
     McMahon 
      (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 23 June 1978) was distinguished, on a factual basis referrable to the physical separation of the items in  
     Ellis 
     ; and upon that basis and also upon the basis that the defence had raised a S29 issue in  
     Donohoe 
     . 
      
     37 It has, additionally, been held that the Crown is not required to elect whether to rely upon the statutory presumption of possession for the purpose of supply or upon evidence tending positively to establish that purpose:  
     Hughes & Curtis 
      (1982) 10 A Crim R 125. The Crown may rely upon the presumption and upon actual evidence tending to establish the fact to be proved. As the Full Federal Court observed, at 132, this kind of case is: 
      
      “not an averment case. It is a case where there is a statutory presumption intended to facilitate proof of the relevant purpose. We know of no case in which it has been held that a party bearing the onus of proof may not rely on a presumption and upon actual evidence tending to establish the fact to be proved.” 
      
     38 In the present case I am of the view that proof that the appellant, a pensioner and regular heroin user, had in his possession a considerable sum of money along with the indicia of supply, were relevant and capable of supporting the admission. In this regard, there was no rational occasion for him to retain a quantity of plastic bags, or to have a set of electronic scales plugged into a power point, in connection with his use of heroin. As he said that he did not personally use “speed”, the presence of these items in close proximity to the methylamphetamine was capable of supporting the Crown case, and was properly left on that basis. 
      
     39 Although I would grant leave to argue this ground of appeal, it has not, in my view, been made good. 
      
       
      
      
     Ground 7 
      
     40 Finally it was submitted that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory, within the meaning of S 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, ie it was one which was unreasonable or could not be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
      
     41 I am not persuaded that the case is one in which, after this Court has made its own independent assessment of the evidence, it should conclude that a jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. The simple fact is that the methylamphetamine was found in the room in which the appellant slept, and he made admissions concerning both its nature and his ownership immediately upon its discovery. The jury were well entitled to have concluded that such admission was true, particularly as it was the evidence of Senior Constable Stanley that the conversation concerning the speed occurred before Ms Knopp arrived. On that basis, there was no reason for the appellant making the admission in order to protect her and the children, as he suggested. 
      
     42 Counsel for the appellant accepted that his account revealed a number of inconsistencies. A review of the transcript reveals that they were not immaterial inconsistencies. 
      
     43 In summary, the evidence reveals that: 
      
       
       (a) at the flat, the appellant initially admitted that the heroin was his, but then while still at the flat (according to police) or at the police station (according to him) he said it was Steve’s; at the trial he returned to admitting that it was his; 
        
       (b) at the police station, he withdrew his earlier admission as to the ownership of the methylamphetamine and said it was “Steve’s”. It was the evidence of Senior Constable Stanley that this occurred after the brown powder was weighed. The accused in chief agreed that he had changed his mind as to what he was going to say to police “because Officer Stanley told me it was a supply charge … a gaol sentence probably”; 
        
       (c) In the ERISP when asked why he had said the heroin was Steve’s, and that the speed was his, he gave the explanation “because I thought that would be lesser than heroin. You know, speed isn’t looked on as a hard core drug such as heroin is.” 
        
       (d) there was absolutely no suggestion to police, at this stage, that the reason for the earlier admission as to ownership of the methylamphetamine was that offered at the trial, namely because of concern for Ms Knopp and her children; 
        
       (e) there was little logical basis in the reason offered at trial for his initial acceptance of ownership of the speed, but not of the heroin, it being unclear why the position of Ms Knopp, the partner of Steve, was in any way improved by his assertion that the “speed” was his, but the heroin was Steve’s, particularly if he believed that possession of heroin was more serious than possession of methylamphetamine; 
        
       (f) at the trial, the appellant initially said that he had no knowledge of the methylamphetamine being in his premises, yet in his ERISP he said that he knew Steve had it hidden there; 
        
       (g) the appellant gave contradictory accounts concerning the reason for his possession of the plastic bags, suggesting, at one stage, that he had them so that they could be re-used (ie re-washed to recover any heroin residue), and at another stage suggesting that they had already been rewashed. 
       
      
     44 While the admissions were enough to support the conviction, and to exclude possession of the methylamphetamine by the other occupants, there was support for it in the finding of the indicia of supply, and in the fact that the other persons were acknowledged to have been only temporary residents of the flat. 
      
     45 In these circumstances, I am quite unpersuaded that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. 
      
     46 I would propose that the appeal be dismissed ,and that the conviction and sentence be confirmed.
