GROUNDS OF DECISION
1. The accused was charged with importing into Singapore without authorisation a quantity of substance containing not less than 3,468g of diamorphine thereby contravening s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Ch 185. The evidence adduced was as follows:
2. At about 11.15pm on 23 July 1994, customs officer Wang Khai Wah (""CO Wang"") was on duty at the Green Channel opposite Belts 35 and 36 at Terminal 2 in Changi Airport when he spotted a male passenger pushing a trolley walking towards the customs clearance gates from the direction of Belt 37. On the trolley were a brown bag and a small white paper bag. He thought that the behaviour of the passenger was somewhat suspicious and he approached the passenger and asked for his passport. The passenger (accused)produced a Thai passport in the name of Aung Myat. On being questioned the accused told CO Wang that he would be staying in Singapore for one night and that he would be leaving for Philippines the next day. CO Wang asked the accused to follow him to the customs checking counter. The accused did so. The accused had arrived in Singapore on board Silkair Flight MI 895 from Hatyai, Thailand. The plane had docked at 10.56pm.
3. At the counter CO Wang emptied the leather bag of its contents. In doing so he noticed that the inner linings on both sides of the bag were bulging. He also felt the bag to be heavier than what a bag of its size should be. The small white paper bag carried by the accused contained a toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste (both unused). CO Wang asked the accused to re-pack his bag and follow him to the customs duty office. The accused did so.
4. At about 11.25pm senior customs officer Ang Sin Ban (""SCO Ang"") arrived at the duty office. CO Wang showed him the bag and contents. SCO Ang examined the bag. The bag looked normal from the outside but on the inside the linings of the bag, made of material that was quite hard, was bulging. SCO Ang offered a cutter to the accused and asked the accused to cut open the lining. The accused asked SCO Ang to cut it himself. SCO Ang made a small slit along the lining. He saw some whitish powder inside. SCO Ang then went to get his test kit and tested a small sample of the white powder. The test indicated that it contained heroin.
5. In cross-examination, CO Wang told the court that after the bag was cut SCO Ang had asked the accused what the substance was and the accused had replied to the effect that it was ""stones, someone asked me to carry for him"". This evidence had not been disclosed at the preliminary inquiry nor had CO Wang mentioned it when giving evidence-in-chief. SCO Ang, who gave evidence after CO Wang, was asked if he had asked the accused what the substance was. He replied that he had not. He also said that the accused did not say anything to him except for asking after the test was completed, ""Sir, is it drug?"" When told what CO Wang had said, SCO Ang said that he could not remember if such a conversation occurred.
6. At about 1am SCO Ang informed the accused that he was under arrest for a drug offence. He was searched and all items found on him were seized. Amongst the items recovered from the accused were:
(1) Myanmar passport No 026786 of Aung Myat with photograph of the accused.
(2) Singapore disembarkation form (Singapore address: Jalan 24, Lorong 24).
(3) Silkair Boarding Pass (23 July 1994, Flight MI 895, Hatyai/Singapore, boarding time 2005).
(4) Airline ticket with baggage tag attached (23 July 1994, 20.35 Hatyai/Singapore, MI 895 RQ 24 July 1994, 10.00 Singapore/Cebu, MI 542 OK).
(5) Cash comprising 8 pieces of US$100, 2 pieces of 100 Thai bahts, 1 piece of 20 Thai bahts
(6) 2 pieces of paper with Burmese writing. One of these (P.36B) was a receipt for a fine of 800 issued to Aung Myat on 23 July 1994 at Hatyai Airport for overstaying. The other piece of paper (P.36A) contained the following information:
(a) Singapore airport flight information telephone No 221-2221. If journey breaks for overnight in Singapore, to stay No 23, Jalan 24, Lorong 24, Tel No. 744-4468.
(b) Upon arrival in Philippines, to rent a room in a hotel and then place a call to Maung Maung, Tel No. 237-1405.
(c) To rent a room in Cebu (Philippines) at Anaci Letus Tourist Inn (Cebu) 314-910; 314-921.
(7) 3 photographs of the accused (two of these were identical to the photograph of the accused in the passport).
(8) A small telephone book with entries mainly in Burmese. Among the entries in the telephone book was:-
Maung Maung Pg: 1144/575-689 Handphone: 01-498-0438.
(9) In the bag there were 5 shirts, 2 shorts, 1 long pants, 1 singlet and 7 T-shirts. Except for 1 shirt and 1 singlet, all the other items appeared new and unused.
(10) In the white paper bag there was a tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush. Both were new and unused.
7. Chief customs officer Michael Koh Keng Siang (""CCO Koh"") of the surveillance division was summoned to the customs duty office at 11.30pm. From about 12.05am to 2.30am he was alone with the accused. They were seated at a sofa set in an adjoining room. During this period CCO Koh questioned the accused off and on about the accused's background and how the accused came to be carrying the bag into Singapore. He spoke to the accused in English. At about 4.30am, after Inspector Ong Peng Boon and other officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (""CNB"") had taken the accused away, CCO Koh made rough notes of what the accused had said on a piece of paper. Subsequently, on 25 July 1994, when he was in his office he transferred what he had noted on the paper to his pocket book. The entry he made in his pocket book was as follows:
Accd spoke to me in English and also voluntarily divulged the following:-
He is working as a bread seller in Bangkok with meagre income. Stayed Bkk for last 6 yrs. Recruited by another male Myanmese called ""Maung Maung"" and offered US$3000/- to bring said brown bag which he belief to contain ""stones"" to Cebu via S'pore. He was paid half in advance (part of which he had spent on himself and also sent some to his family in Myanmar). Balance half would be paid on completion of assignment. There are many Nepalese and Myanmese in Bangkok who have been recruited by ""Maung Maung"" who works for an African syndicate. Many Caucasians also involved who are seldom checked by authorities at checkpoints. He took a flight from Bkk to Hdy. In Hdy, he was given 2 options by ""Maung Maung"". Firstly, to hand carry the brown bag on board flight from Hdy to S'pore. On arrival at S'pore, to remain in transit area till the following morning for connecting flight to Cebu.
Secondly, the brown bag would be checked in by someone in Hdy airport. On arrival in S'pore, he would pick up the bag and deposit at left baggage after customs clearance and subsequently would stay at Geylang Lor 24. Would pick up bag the following morning for departure to Cebu. He chose option 2 as he considered option 1 too risky. He was shown the bag in Hdy and later given the air ticket and baggage tag. He also claimed there were 2 other Myanmese in Hdy hotel but could not depart as they did not have the goods. He also said that his photo on the passport was just taken and had recently been affixed to the passport.
8. CCO Koh said that he questioned the accused in order to gather intelligence which might be useful in his work. He did not relay the information that he gathered from the accused to the Inspector Ong Peng Boon or anyone else from the CNB as the information he obtained was for intelligence purposes and not for use in court. He agreed that in his pocket book he did not write the words used by the accused and that some of the words like ""syndicate"", ""Caucasians"" and ""options"" were not used by the accused, in writing up the note in his pocket book he had put in these words himself. CCO Koh agreed that what he wrote in the pocket book contained more details than what he had noted on the paper. He told the court that after writing up his pocket book he destroyed the piece of paper on which he had made rough notes.
9. Inspector Ong Peng Boon (""the IO"") and a party of officers from the CNB arrived at the customs duty office at about 2.05am to take over the investigation. SCO Ang briefed them on the case and at 2.30am he handed over the accused and the exhibits seized to the IO. The IO in the presence of the accused cut the inside lining on either side of the bag. He scooped out the white powder therein into two separate bundle and weighed each bundle. He then had the accused sent for medical examination.
10. The IO told the court that at that time he did not know that the accused's real name was not Aung Myat or that the accused was travelling on a false passport. He also did not know that customs officers had spoken to the accused and obtained information from him. He did not subsequently ask the customs officers involved whether they had gathered any information from the accused as he did not want to probe into the workings of another investigative authority.
11. At about 5.45am at his office at the CNB, the IO, with the assistance of a Burmese interpreter (Marlar Swe), formally charged the accused for the offence of importing diamorphine into Singapore and recorded a statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (""CPC""). No objection was taken on the admissibility of the statement and it was admitted in evidence. In the s 122(6) statement the accused said, ""I have nothing to say."" Later that morning the accused was charged in court and remanded at the Criminal Investigation Department (""CID"").
12. On 27 July 1994, with the assistance of the same Burmese interpreter, the IO commenced recording a long statement from the accused. It was at this time that the IO learnt that the passport the accused was using was a false passport and that the accused's real name was Hla Win. The IO continued recording this long statement on 28 and 29 July and on 2 August 1994. He recorded further statements from the accused on 7 September 1994. The prosecution did not seek to adduce these statements in evidence but the defence sought their admission.
13. The IO had, very properly sought to verify the accuracy of what the accused had said in his long statement. He had sought to do so through Interpol by the Thai police. He had however not received the results of their investigation. The IO told the court that he was not surprised at this as it was not unusual for Interpol to take many months to complete its investigations. Obviously the hearing of this case had come up too soon for the investigations at the Thai end to be completed.
14. When questioned by counsel, the IO said that he had not tried to get the manifest of the flight that the accused said he had taken from Bangkok to Hatyai from Thai Airways in Singapore because in his experience Thai Airways in Singapore would not supply information about Thai Airways in Bangkok. He therefore sought to obtain that information through the Thai police. He had also not tried to ascertain from Silkair Singapore details of when and by whom the Silkair flight from Hatyai to Cebu had been booked.
15. Urine samples were taken from the accused. The prosecution led evidence that on analysis these samples were found to contain morphine and codeine. As this evidence suggested that the accused could have consumed opiate drugs, Dr Lui Chi Pang, the chemist who analysed the urine, was asked in cross-examination by Dr Myint Soe whether he could confirm that morphine and codeine would be present in the urine if the subject had consumed certain cough mixtures. Dr Lui was not prepared to confirm this. He told the court that he knew that certain cough mixtures contained codeine but was not aware that cough mixtures also contained morphine. Dr Myint Soe told the court that that was not his understanding and that he would consult with a pharmacologist and try to establish that morphine and codeine would be present in the urine if the accused had consumed certain cough mixtures.
16. In re-examination, however, the learned DPP, Mr Ch'ng Lye Beng, ascertained from Dr Lui that Dr Lui had also conducted a quantitative analysis of the morphine and codeine content in order to ascertain the codeine to morphine ratio (C/M Ratio) in the specimen urine. Dr Lui told the court that the CM ratio in this case was such that he could rule out the possibility that the accused had consumed heroin. The learned DPP told the court that he was adducing this evidence in re-examination because this was evidence favourable to the defence and defence counsel had not cross-examined Dr Lui on this. On being asked by the court the learned DPP conceded that, in view of this evidence, the presence of the morphine and codeine in the accused's urine was a neutral fact and irrelevant to the charge against the accused.
17. At the preliminary inquiry no evidence had been given about the C/M Ratio. In Dr Lui's report tendered at the preliminary inquiry and in Dr Lui's evidence-in-chief before me, there was no mention that the amount of codeine and the amount of morphine had been ascertained and of the significance of the C/M ratio. Had the learned DPP in re- examination not elicited the additional evidence regarding the C/M ratio the impression would have been created that the accused was a heroin abuser. It was therefore fortuitous and very creditable that the learned DPP elicited this evidence from Dr Lui and erased this impression. It was unfortunate though that this evidence was not disclosed at the preliminary inquiry. Had it been disclosed, counsel would have been in a better position to cross-examine the chemist. It is trite to say that failure to disclose material evidence ca lead to a miscarriage of justice. The prosecution should disclose all material evidence at the earliest possible time in order to enable the defence to adequately prepare its case.
18. The two packets of white powder recovered from the bag were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis and were found to contain no less than 3,468g of diamorphine. The learned DPP had indicated in his opening submission that the prosecution would be relying on the presumptions contained in ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Ch 185. On the evidence adduced and in the light of the presumptions, there clearly was a prima facie case made out that the accused had imported the heroin found in the bag into Singapore and I called upon the accused to make his defence.
19. The IO in this case had very painstakingly, with the assistance of a Burmese interpreter, recorded a detailed statement from the accused over many days. The defence raised by the accused was to a very large extent in conformity with what was contained in this long statement. In gist, the accused said that he was a Burmese by nationality, a Bengali by race and a Muslim by religion. His Burmese name was Hla Win and his Bengali/Muslim name was Mohd Akbar. He was born in 1964 at Kyaukphyu, a town near the border with Bangladesh. He told the court that because of the revolutionary conditions prevailing in Myanmar and his own disinclination towards studies his academic progress was slow. His primary education was in Bengali and Burmese. At the age of about 20 he went to the Myoma School in Yangon to further his secondary education. At Myoma School the medium of instruction was Burmese. English was a subject in his curriculum from the fifth standard. He told the court that his English was poor and that he hardly spoke in English.
20. At Myoma School the accused became involved in the student movement against the government. In 1988, he participated in riots to overthrow the government. When this was unsuccessful he fled to Thailand to avoid arrest by the Myanmar authorities. He had no passport and he went into Thailand as an illegal immigrant. Through the help ofsome Myanmar Muslims he was able to earn a living in Thailand as an itinerant roti prata seller. Sometimes he would work as a construction labourer. His life in Thailand was hard because he had always to be on guard against being arrested as an illegal immigrant. He told the court that on three occasions he had been arrested and imprisoned for being an illegal immigrant and sent back to the Myanmar border by the Thai authorities. On these occasions he had worked with the Karen rebels for short periods and then returned to Bangkok.
21. He had over the years, in order to avoid detection, stayed at different places around Bangkok. In 1994, he was staying in the Silom district where he plied his roti prata business around the Haroon mosque. This was a mosque frequented by Muslims from the Indian sub-continent. He said that he was himself a devout Muslim and attended prayers every Friday.
22. The accused told the court that in the course of his roti prata business and his attendances at that mosque he came to know a Chulia Muslim by the name of Maung Maung who was also from Myanmar. This Maung Maung was a moneychanger and a gem trader and carried on his business in the vicinity of the mosque. There were also other gem and jewellery shops and traders in the area. The accused told the court that Maung Maung appeared to him to be a successful businessman.
23. About 3 months after he came to know Maung Maung, Maung Maung took the accused to a tea shop for a chat. In the course of that conversation, the accused learnt that Maung Maung had come to Thailand from Myanmar about 4 years ago. The accused, in the course of that conversation, told Maung Maung that he was an illegal immigrant.
24. Subsequently, Maung Maung met the accused at the mosque and asked the accused to meet him at a McDonald's restaurant in the vicinity on 21 July 1994 morning. The accused did so and there Maung Maung told him over a meal that he wanted to send a bag of gems to some place and asked if the accused was interested. Maung Maung told the accused that he would be paid US$3,000 for the assignment of which US$1,500 would be paid in advance and the balance paid upon his return. The accused told Maung Maung that he had no passport but Maung Maung said that he would take care of that. The accused asked Maung Maung if the bag would contain only gems. Maung Maung assured the accused that that was so and that there would be nothing in the bag to get him into trouble. To convince the accused of his sincerity Maung Maung took the accused to the Haroon mosque and swore on the Koran that there would only be precious stones in the bag and that the accused would not get into trouble.
25. The accused told the court that he agreed to Maung Maung's suggestion because he believed that he would only be carrying precious stones. He said that he had at that time no reason to disbelieve Maung Maung because he knew that Maung Maung was a gem trader and in any case Maung Maung had sworn that the bag would only have precious stones. He knew that carrying precious stones out of Thailand and into other countries without declaring the precious stones was an offence but he was assured by Maung Maung and he knew that the penalty if caught would only be forfeiture of the gems and a short term of imprisonment. He therefore agreed to the proposal. Maung Maung then asked the accused to wait at McDonald's restaurant while he went to get the tickets. Shortly, Maung Maung returned and asked the accused to see him at the same restaurant the next day (22 July 1994) at 8am.
26. The accused kept the appointment the next morning and Maung Maung took him to a photo shop to have his photograph taken for the passport. The accused told the court that the three photographs seized from him when he was arrested was taken at this studio. Maung Maung told the accused to meet him again at 8pm that night at McDonald's restaurant. Maung Maung also gave to the accused his contact number and the accused noted this in his little telephone book. Pager No 1144/575-689 and handphone No 01-498-0438 appear in the telephone book seized from the accused against the name Maung Maung.
27. When the accused met Maung Maung that night, Maung Maung took him to a hotel room and asked him to wait there. About 1 hours later a male person came to the room. The accused spoke to the person in Thai. The person replied in Burmese that Maung Maung had sent him there. He introduced himself to the accused as Yusoof. The two of them spent the night in the room. Yusoof told the accused that he was a Myanmar Muslim and that for several years he had been staying in Singapore on a student pass. The accused also said that he had occasion to glance through the passport of Yusoof. The name on the passport was not Yusoof. The accused said that it was a Burmese name and although he could not remember the exact name it could have been Myo Lwin - the name appearing in a Thai Airways document shown to the accused by his counsel. The next morning Maung Maung met them at the lobby of the hotel and took them in a waiting taxi to Bangkok airport.
28. At the airport Maung Maung took out a brown bag (the one with which the accused was arrested) from the boot of the taxi. On the instructions of Yusoof the accused carried the bag and walked into the airport with Yusoof. The bag was quite heavy. At the counter Yusoof checked in for a flight to Hatyai. He also checked in the bag. Yusoof then handed to the accused a passport under the name of Aung Myat, a ticket to Hatyai and a boarding pass. The accused and Yusoof then took the flight to Hatyai. At Hatyai Yusoof took the accused to the Haadyai International Hotel where he checked into Room No 760. Yusoof took the bag into Room No 760 and placed it in the cupboard. The two then went out for lunch and then returned to the room.
29. Yusoof told the accused that he was to go to Cebu (in the Philippines) with the bag. To go to Cebu he would have to change planes at Singapore. Yusoof told him that he could wait in the transit area at Singapore airport for the change of plane. Yusoof also told the accused that he need not collect the bag as the bag would be put on the flight to Cebu by the airline staff. Yusoof asked the accused to familiarise himself with the particulars of Aung Myat in the passport and to practice the signature of Aung Myat. Yusoof also handed to the accused the Singapore immigration disembarkation form which he had filled up. They left the hotel for the airport at about 5.30pm. Before leaving the room Yusoof took out a long-sleeved shirt from the bag and asked the accused to wear it. The accused did so. Yusoof put the shirt that the accused took off into the bag.
30. Before leaving the hotel for the airport the accused told Yusoof that he wanted to buy some toiletries. Yusoof told the accused to wait while Yusoof went off and returned with a small white paper bag containing a tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush which he gave to the accused.
31. On the way to the airport Yusoof gave the accused a slip of paper with Burmese writing on it. He told the accused that it contained instructions on what he was to do and asked the accused to read it. The accused read the paper. The paper (P.36A) had the number 221-2221 written on it as the Singapore Airport Flight Information Service telephone number. It also stated that if the journey broke overnight in Singapore he was to stay at No 23, Jalan 24, Lorong 24, telephone number 744-4468. The address and telephone number of the hotel he was to stay in at Cebu was also given. The note also asked that on reaching the hotel in Cebu he was to call Maung Maung at 237-1405. Yusoof also handed to the accused an envelope which contained US$800. This was part of the advance that Maung Maung had agreed to give him. He had asked Maung Maung to pay the balance of the advance to some creditors in Bangkok on his behalf.
32. The accused and Yusoof arrived at Hatyai airport at about 6.20pm. At the counter the staff told them that he could not check in yet because he did not have a confirmed ticket and was on the reserve list. He had to wait until closing time of the check-in in order to find out if there were any seats available (this is supported by the fact that on the airline ticket recovered from the accused the status of the flight from Hatyai to Singapore on MI 895 was listed as ""RQ""). It was only at about 8.15pm that the staff asked him to come forward and confirmed that a seat was available. Yusoof attended to the formalities of checking-in and then handed over the travel documents and 1,200 Thai bahts to the accused and showed the accused the way to the immigration counter. At the immigration counter the accused had some problems with his passport in that the passport showed that the holder had overstayed for 8 days. The accused said that he was fined 800 Thai bahts for overstaying. He paid the fine and was given a receipt.
33. When the plane landed in Singapore he left the plane and entered the terminal building. He was looking around when he was approached by a female staff who asked if she could help. He asked her in English, ""Transit room, where?"" She asked to see his ticket. She looked at it and told him that he had to collect his bag first (the baggage tag was pinned to the airline ticket). She then told him by words and gesticulation to go past the immigration counter, get his bag and then go upstairs for the flight to Cebu. The accused said that he was sure that Yusoof had told him that he need not worry about the bag as the bag would go straight to Cebu. He only collected the bag in Singapore because the lady told him that he had to collect the bag first before taking the plane to Cebu.
34. After clearing immigration he went to the luggage belt where he saw a European who had sat beside him waiting for his luggage. The accused also waited. Shortly, the bag arrived. He picked up the bag. He had some difficulties in operating the trolley on which he put the bag. He had at that time decided to take a taxi and spend the night at the place stated in the paper given to him. He was pushing the trolley and looking around when a customs officer came up to him and asked for his passport and air ticket. The officer looked at the documents and directed him to a counter. At the counter, as requested by the officer, he put the bag on the counter, opened it and took out the clothes therein. He told the court that that was the first time he had opened the bag. Except for the shirt that Yusoof had put into the bag in Hatyai, the rest of the clothing in the bag were not his.
35. The accused confirmed that at the customs duty office an officer had offered him a knife and asked him to cut the inside of the bag. He declined and had asked the officer to do so. He told the court that when the officer cut the bag he did not see any white powder. He was seated at the sofa and his view of the bag was obstructed by the officer. He told the court that the officer then went to a table near the sofa and put the knife into some liquid. The officer then asked him in English: ""What's this?"" The accused replied ""stone"" and at the same time gesticulated with his fingers the stone on a ring.
36. The accused told the court that he first saw that the bag contained white powder when another officer at a later stage cut open the bag. When he saw the white powder he felt sad because he realised he had been cheated. The accused confirmed that yet another officer was with him for a few hours that night. This officer had over this period intermittently questioned him in English about his background and how he came to be carrying the bag. He told the court that he replied as best he could whenever he understood what the officer was trying to say. He denied making those statements contained in the pocket book of the officer that were inconsistent with his testimony in court. In particular, he denied having said anything about an African syndicate - he did not even know what syndicate meant, he denied having referred to Caucasians being involved - he did not know what Caucasian meant, he denied having said that in Singapore he would be staying in Geylang - he did not know that there was such a place in Singapore and he denied having told the officer that Maung Maung was in Hatyai.
37. The accused told the court that from the airport he was taken to a hospital and at about daybreak he was taken to the office of the IO. There the IO spoke with him using a Burmese lady as an interpreter. The interpreter told him that the penalty for the offence was death. She also said that he would be taken to court the next morning but that was not the High Court and he could not say anything to the court. From the court he would be taken to the CID and a detailed statement would be taken from him. She told him that if he had anything to say he could say it there at the CNB. When she told him this he replied that he had nothing to say. The accused told the court that he said that because it was late and because the interpreter had told him that after he was taken to court the IO would take a full statement from him. He decided that he would tell the IO all he had to say when the full statement was recorded. Subsequently, he gave a detailed statement to the IO through the services of the same interpreter. Although the accused clarified and amplified certain parts of that statement he did not in the main dispute its accuracy.
38. Miss Sylvia Lim, the assistant counsel assigned by the registrar to defend the accused, gave evidence that in early January this year she wrote to Thai Airways in Singapore seeking details of the flight on 22 July 1994 on which Aung Myat had travelled from Bangkok to Hatyai. She received a response by fax on 14 February 1995, after this trial had commenced. Thai Airways faxed to her a passenger manifest printout (D.5C) of flight TG 233 on 23 July 1994 from Bangkok to Hatyai. Thai Airways also faxed to her a printout of what was termed a post date investigation printout (D.5B).
39. D.5B showed that one Maung Maung (telephone number 2918896) had on 22 July 1994 booked two tickets on flight TG 233 departing for Hatyai on 23 July 1994 in the names of MR AUNG/MYAT and MR MYO/LWIN. D.5C showed that these two persons were on flight TG 233 and that Aung Myat was allocated seat 36A and Myo Lwin was allocated seat 38F. Miss Teo also produced another computer printout (D.6) from the ""ROYAL ORCHID PLUS"" frequent flyer programme of Thai Airways in respect of Maung Maung. It listed Maung Maung as a member of this programme. It gave his business telephone number as 498-0438, his home telephone number as 0291- 8896 and his address as No 84/11, Soi Watrap Buakuao, Chardenkrung 80 Road, Bangkok. The printout also showed the mileage that had so far been credited to Maung Maung under the programme. It will be noted that the telephone number 498-0438 listed by Thai Airways as Maung Maung's business number in D.6 is the same number recorded by the accused in his telephone book as the number Maung Maung gave him.
40. The learned DPP in the course of his cross-examination of the accused appeared to be challenging the existence of Maung Maung. As the prosecution had not, when the trial commenced, completed its investigations into the accused's story they were obviously not aware of the fact that there was a Maung Maung in Bangkok and that it was Maung Maung who booked the ticket for the Thai Airways flight that the accused took on the morning of the day he was arrested. In the light of the evidence contained in Thai Airways' records obtained by the defence after the hearing started, I suggested to the learned DPP that he may like to consider building his case on the existence of such a person instead of wasting time by resisting the evidence from Thai Airways. After some consideration the DPP agreed that that would be an appropriate course for the prosecution to adopt.
41. Counsel for the defence went further in their investigative efforts. Miss Lim had, through correspondence with Haadyai International Hotel, managed to obtain a photocopy of the hotel registration card No 03217 relating to the occupation of Room No 760 on 23 July 1994. The defence sought to have that card admitted as evidence. The prosecution was reluctant to agree as what Miss Lim had was only a copy of the registration card. To avoid this technical difficulty Miss Lim, on 9 February 1995 in the course of the hearing, flew to Hatyai and obtained the original registration card. Whilst at Hatyai Miss Lim also obtained affidavits from the receptionist and cashier on duty at the hotel at the relevant time and whose handwriting was on the card. Miss Lim also took photographs of the hotel, photographs of Room No 760 and drew a sketch of the room.
42. The cashier in her affidavit (D.9) deposed that it was the practice of the hotel to require a guest to deposit his passport with them. If the guest did not wish to do so the guest would have to pay 1,000 bahts as a deposit. He can then fill in his particulars on the registration card without his particulars being verified. The guest who entered his particulars in registration card No 03217 had paid to her the sum of 1,000 bahts at the time he checked in. To her affidavit she annexed a copy of the hotel's bill/receipt No 3657 which indicated that the guest who registered on 23 July 1994 checked out of the hotel on 24 July 1994. The receptionist in her affidavit (D.8) deposed that she had allocated Room No 760 at 12.50pm on 23 July 1994 to the guest. As the guest had paid the 1,000 bahts she did not require the guest to produce his passport or verify the particulars that the guest wrote in the registration card. The affidavits were sworn before the Vice Consul of the Malaysian Embassy at Songkhla. Defence sought the admission of these affidavits under s 398 of the CPC. This was allowed.
43. The name of the guest as recorded in the registration card was Maung Maung. If that was indeed so, then that would contradict the accused's evidence that only Yusoof was with him at Hatyai. However, as the particulars in the card relating to the guest were filled in by the guest and were not verified by the receptionist, those particulars in the registration card were hearsay and inadmissible as to their truth.
44. At Hatyai Miss Lim had also done some shopping. She noticed that the paper bags used by a shop close to the hotel appeared similar to the paper bag that had been produced in court by the prosecution as the paper bag which the accused had with him when arrested. She obtained a paper bag by buying some goods at the shop. She brought the paper bag to court and found that the bag was identical to the bag produced in court and bore the name and logo of the same shop.
45. As the existence of Maung Maung and the existence of gem traders and gem stores in the vicinity of the Haroon mosque in the Silom district of Bangkok appeared to be an issue in the case, Miss Lim again flew to Thailand on the morning of Saturday, 18 February 1995. She returned the same evening. At the Silom district she took pictures of the Haroon mosque, of a McDonald's restaurant close by and of gem stores around the Haroon mosque. In addition, she located the address which, according to the records of Thai Airways (D.6), was the residence of Maung Maung and took a picture of the house. The accused identified the picture of the McDonald's restaurant as the restaurant where he had met Maung Maung. He also identified the pictures of the Haroon mosque and the gem stores in the vicinity. Miss Lim had also taken a picture of an open area near the mosque. The accused identified this picture as the area where gem traders and other traders gathered. He said that they would gather in the mornings and in the evenings. Miss Lim had taken the picture at about 3pm and so the place was relatively deserted. The accused could not identify the picture of Maung Maung's house as he had not been to Maung Maung's house. But looking at the picture it is obvious that it was the house of a person who was fairly well off.
46. By s 18(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, any person who is proved to have had in his possession or under his control anything containing a controlled drug is presumed, until the contrary is proven, to have the controlled drug in his possession. By s 18(2) of the Act a person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to know the nature of that drug. It was not in dispute that the accused was in possession of the brown bag. By virtue of these two provisions, a presumption arose that the accused was in possession of the powder concealed in the bag and that he knew that the powder was diamorphine.
47. Whilst the burden of proof was on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the onus, where a statutory presumption arose, was on the accused to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities. This has been clearly established in a long series of case amongst which are the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Tan Ah Tee v PP & Anor v PP (1) and Van Damme Johannes v PP (2).
48. Dr Myint Soe submitted that in this case the accused had more than sufficiently rebutted the presumption on a balance of probabilities and was therefore entitled to an acquittal. He went on to submit that there was authority to suggest that even when there were statutory presumptions the accused should be acquitted if at the close of the trial the court, even though not satisfied of his innocence on the balance of probabilities, was nevertheless left with some real, reasonable or nagging doubt as to the guilt of the accused.
49. Mohamad Radhi bin Yaakob v PP (3) was a decision of the Supreme Court of Malaysia. The appellant (who was with one Hashim who escaped) was when arrested in possession of a bag containing cannabis and was charged with trafficking in a dangerous drug. There was a presumption under s 37(d) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 that a person in custody or control of a bag containing a dangerous drug should be presumed, until the contrary was proved, to have been in possession of such drug and should until the contrary was proved be deemed to have known the nature of such drug. There was a further presumption under s 37(da) that a person in possession of 200g or more of cannabis was to be presumed to be trafficking in cannabis. Since the amount of cannabis recovered exceeded 200g the prosecution relied on both these presumptions to prove that the appellant was trafficking in cannabis. The appellant raised two defences:
(a) That Hashim was the owner of the bag containing the cannabis and the appellant was merely an innocent and temporary carrier who was carrying the bag while Hashim eased himself;
(b) It was Hashim and not he who was trafficking in the cannabis.
To prove (a) the appellant adduced evidence that that night Hashim had been at the appellant's house. They left the house at 11pm to buy cigarettes. At the shop the appellant went in to buy cigarettes while Hashim went to speak to three friends sitting outside. When the appellant came out of the shop Hashim was not there. The three told the appellant that Hashim had borrowed a motorcycle from one of them and gone off for a while. The appellant sat with the three and waited for the return of Hashim. Hashim returned 1 hours later. The three gave evidence that when Hashim returned he had the bag with him. The appellant and Hashim then walked back to the appellant's house. On the way Hashim asked the appellant to hold the bag as Hashim wanted to urinate. The appellant was arrested while he was holding the bag.
50. The trial judge in considering the evidence directed himself as follows:
Was the accused telling the truth? Were the three people sitting under the ketapang tree telling the truth? It is purely a question for the cour to evaluate the evidence and make a finding on who are telling the truth and who are not telling the truth.
Having thus directed himself the trial judge, not satisfied that the defence witnesses were telling the truth, convicted the appellant of trafficking in cannabis.
51. The Supreme Court was not happy with this direction. In the words of Mohamed Azmi SCJ:
In this case, we found that the learned trial judge offered practically no reason why the defence, notwithstanding its falsity and unconvincing nature, had failed to cast reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, other than to state by way of lip service the duty placed by the law on the defence to earn an acquittal.
It is well-established principle of Malaysian criminal law that the general burden of proof lies throughout the trial on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused for the offence with which he is charged. There is no similar burden placed on the accused to prove his innocence. He is presumed innocent until proven guilty. To earn an acquittal, his duty is merely to cast a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. In the course of the prosecution case, the prosecution may of course rely on available statutory presumptions to prove one or more of the essential ingredients of the charge. When that occurs, the particular burden of proof as opposed to the general burden, shifts to the defence to rebut such resumptions on the balance of probabilities which from the defence point of view is heavier than the burden of casting a reasonable doubt, but it is certainly lighter than the burden of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt.
...
To earn an acquittal, the court may not be convinced of the truth of the defence story or version. Raising a reasonable doubt in the guilt of the accused will suffice. It is not, however, wrong for the court to be convinced that the defence version is true, in which case the court must order an acquittal. In appropriate cases it is also not wrong for the court to conclude that the defence story is false or not convincing, but in that instance, the court must not convict until it asks a further question, that even if the court does not accept or believe the defence explanation, does it nevertheless raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt? < Emphasis added. > 
52. It is to be noted that Mohamed Azmi SCJ in reiterating the principle that in a criminal trial the prosecution had to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt accepted that where a statutory presumption was available to prove one or more ingredients of the charge ""the particular burden of proof as opposed to the general burden, shifts to the defence to rebut such presumption on the balance of probabilities"". It will be useful to explore why the Supreme Court while accepting that the burden was on the defence to rebut a presumption on a balance of probabilities nevertheless set aside the conviction of the appellant even though the trial judge had on balance rejected the defence version.
53. In that case, the appellant when he was arrested was in possession of the drugs. The presumptions under the act that he knew the nature of the drugs and that he was trafficking in the drugs therefore arose. But that was the limit of the presumptions. In that case, the accused had claimed that he was only in transient possession of the drugs while Hashim was urinating. He had called witnesses who had testified that Hashim had gone off on the motorcycle and returned carrying the bag. The trial judge had been content to dismiss that evidence as being unlikely to be true. He had not gone further and asked himself the question: ""Although I do not believe their story nevertheless is it reasonably possible that it was Hashim and not the accused who had all along been in possession of the bag?"" It was his failure to ask this question that prompted the sharp criticism of the Supreme Court. It would appear that from the fact that the accused was in possession of the bag at the time of his arrest the trial judge not only presumed that the accused knew the nature of the contents of the bag but also presumed that the accused was in continuous possession of the bag - hence his rejection of the evidence of the defence witnesses on the basis of the balance of probabilities without considering the further question of whether the defence version that the bag was only in the temporary possession of the accused could reasonably be true.
54. There was another aspect of the judgment that the Supreme Court criticised.
The trial judge had found as a fact that the defence had not rebutted the statutory presumption contained in s 37(d) on a balance of probabilities and had then gone on to say: ""It follows that the presumption of s 37(da) is also not rebutted"". The Supreme Court disagreed. It did not follow that the presumption of trafficking was not rebutted merely because the defence failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge. Whilst this part of the judgment of the Supreme Court has no particular relevance to the present case it is to be noted that the Supreme Court again spoke of the defence rebutting a statutory presumption on a balance of probabilities. At page 172 of the judgment, Mohamed Azmi SCJ said:
In our opinion... it is incumbent for the court to consider whether on the balance of probabilities, the evidence of the defence has rebutted the statutory presumption of trafficking under s 37(da) as a separate exercise even though the court is satisfied on balance that the presumption of possession under s 37(d) has not been rebutted. < Emphasis added. > 
55. PP v Kang Ho Soh (4) was a decision of Shankar J of the High Court of Malaysia. The accused there was driving a car when the police, acting on information received, stopped his car. The police opened the boot of the car and a large quantity of heroin was found. The car did not belong to the accused. He had borrowed it from his brother-in-law that day. As the drugs were not concealed in any specially constructed compartment of the car the presumption under s 37(h) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 that drugs found concealed in any specially constructed compartment of a vehicle are deemed to be concealed with the knowledge of the person in charge of the vehicle was not available. Nor was any other statutory presumption available to assist the prosecution prove that the accused was in possession of and knew the nature of the drugs found in the boot of the car. If the prosecution proved by evidence aliunde that the accused was in possession of the drugs found, then the presumptions under ss 37(d) and 37(da) would arise and the accused would be presumed to know that the drug was heroin and as the quantity was in excess of 15g it would be presumed that the accused was trafficking in the drug. Shankar J held that there was a prima facie case that the accused was in possession of the drugs and called on the defence.
56. At the close of the case Shankar J was not impressed with the evidence of the accused. He did not consider the accused to be a truthful person and he suspected that the accused was in fact involved in the goings-on that day. Shankar J however went on to say:
But before we take a man's life we must be as absolutely sure as the law will allow that we have got the right man for the right reason.
In the present case the required standard of proof has not been discharged to my satisfaction. The accused is therefore acquitted and discharged. Dr Myint Soe relied on the above passage in the judgment of Shankar J as evidencing that the accused in that case had successfully rebutted the statutory presumptions by creating only a reasonable doubt.
57. In PP v Kang Ho Soh, the statutory presumption under s 37(d) would arise only if the prosecution could prove that the accused was in possession of the items found in the boot of the car. At the close of the case, although Shankar J did not believe the accused's disclaimer of possession, he nevertheless had doubts about this. That being so, the prosecution had not discharged its burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in possession of the items in the boot. As possession was not proved the presumptions under s 37(d) and (da) would not arise and consequently neither would the question of rebutting the presumption on a balance of probability. PP v Kang Ho Soh was therefore not a case where a statutory presumption was rebutted on the basis of a reasonable doubt and was of no assistance to the defence.
58. Yusoff bin Kassim v PP (5) was a decision of the Supreme Court of Malaysia. In that case the appellant was carrying the bag in which the drugs were found. The presumption under the Act therefore arose. The Supreme Court set aside the conviction of the appellant. In setting aside the conviction, Edgar Joseph Jr SCJ said that the Supreme Court was:
... amply satisfied that the case against the appellant was not proved with that certainty which is necessary in order to justify a verdict of guilty. On the face of it this passage does appear to support Dr Myint Soe's submission. But one needs to examine the case in greater detail.
59. In that case the accused had arrived on foot at the Padang Besar Customs Check Point from Pekan Siam. He placed a brown bag he was carrying on the customs counter. The bag was found to contain cannabis. On those facts the trial judge ruled that the presumptions under s 37(d) and (da) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 arose, their combined effect being that it was presumed, until the contrary was proved, that the appellant knew of the presence of cannabis in the bag, knew of its nature, and by reason of its weight exceeding the statutory minimum of 200g, was a trafficker in the same. He therefore called on the defence.
60. The accused, in his defence, said that he was a petty trader plying his trade in Kampong Gajah. He bought his supplies periodically from Pekan Siam as goods were cheaper there. On that day he was carrying a green travelling bag and was queuing up at the customs checkpoint when he met Dollah, a Thai citizen he knew. Dollah handed to him his brown travelling bag and asked him to hold it while Dollah went to have his border pass stamped. The appellant obliged and on arrival at the head of the queue placed both bags on the customs counter for inspection. When asked by a Malay customs officer about the contents of the brown bag the appellant pointed to Dollah who was behind in the queue whereupon Dollah ran off and escaped whilst the accused was arrested.
61. The Malay customs officer in his evidence maintained that the appellant had only one bag with him - the brown bag. But another customs officer admitted under cross-examination that there were two bags - one brown and one green. The trial judge in his judgment referred only to the evidence of the Malay customs officer. He made no mention at all of the other customs officer's evidence which was consistent with the accused's evidence, that he had two bags with him.
62. The Supreme Court considered this failure of the trial judge to refer to the other customs officers' evidence to be a glaring omission. They held that had the trial judge taken that evidence into consideration he might well have considered the appellant's evidence that he was carrying the brown bag with its offending contents at the behest of Dollah in a more favourable light. It was for those reasons that the Supreme Court set aside the conviction of the appellant. The case does not, in my view, contradict the principle that where a statutory presumption arises the burden of rebutting the presumption is on the defence and is on the balance of probabilities.
63. One other case relied on by Dr Myint Soe was Ramond Selva Clement v PP (6). That case too, in my view, is of no assistance in advancing Dr Myint Soe's submission. To the contrary, the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case specifically stated that: ""by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), the appellant's act of possession was presumed to constitute both the actus reus and the mens rea of trafficking and the onus then was upon the appellant to negative this on the balance of probabilities"".
64. The existence of a statutory presumption does not dislodge the general burden on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The purpose of a statutory presumption is merely to ease the burden on the prosecution in proving the existence of certain facts. Thus the prosecution may prove, for instance, that a person was in possession of white powder. It may also prove that the white power was heroin. But to prove that the person in possession of the white powder knew that the powder was heroin would often be a very difficult task for the prosecution. To ease this difficulty, the legislat re has, in certain limited circumstances, provided statutory presumptions. Where such a presumption is invoked the onus of rebutting that particular presumption shifts to the defence and it is accepted law that that onus is discharged on a balance of probabilities. Where a person found in possession of (say) heroin claims that he did not know it was heroin that claim may well be true but because the onus is on the defence the mere possibility that the claim may be true is not sufficient, more is required: the court must be satisfied that the claim is more likely to be true than not.
65. Dr Myint Soe cited numerous cases where the courts have accepted the plea of the accused that he was an innocent custodian of the drug and has pointed out that in some of these case, there was little or no other evidence to support the claim of innocence. He has also cited numerous other cases where the courts have found persons in possession of drugs to be guilty of trafficking and pointed out that the evidence against the accused in those cases was overwhelming. But these cases establish no general principles. They are no more than instances where on the facts surrounding those cases the court, on balance, had believed or disbelieved as the case may be the claim that the accused was not aware that the goods he had in his possession was drugs. There is therefore little purpose in reviewing these cases. The reasons given by a judge in arriving at conclusions of facts are inevitably reasons peculiar to the facts of the case then being considered by the judge. It is pointless citing such cases as precedents.
66. In the present case, the difficulty faced by Shankar J in PP v Kang Ho Soh as to whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in possession of what was in the boot of the car did not arise. It was not in dispute here that the accused was in possession of the bag in which the drugs were hidden. As the accused was in possession of the bag a presumption arose under s 18(1)(a) that he was in possession of the drugs contained in the bag and by s 18(2) of the Act a further presumption arose that he knew the nature of the drug, namely, that it was diamorphine. It was up to the accused to rebut these presumptions on a balance of probabilities.
67. Whether innocent or guilty, the invariable defence of a person in whose possession controlled drugs are found is: ""I did not know it contained drugs"", and the task of the judge is to sort out, as best he can and within the bounds of accepted legal principles, the innocent from the guilty. This is a difficult and demanding task for the judge, the more so because the penalty is often the mandatory one of death. There is no room for mistakes.
It is therefore necessary for the judge to review the evidence as painstakingly and honestly as he can and, equally as important, it is necessary for the prosecution to investigate the case as honestly and as thoroughly as is possible and in prosecuting the case refrain from withholding material evidence. This requires that the prosecution makes available to the defence all relevant material in its possession at the earliest convenient time so that the accused can adequately prepare his defence.
68. In this case, the long statement of the accused was given to the defence only shortly before the trial commenced and the statement made by the accused to CCO Koh was disclosed only on the morning of the trial. Needless to say, such short notice can be a great handicap to defence counsel and can lead to the hearing of the trial being unnecessarily prolonged. I hasten to say though that the delay in letting the defence have copies of these documents was not attributable to the learned DPP who conducted the prosecution. He did not have the conduct of this case at the time of the preliminary inquiry. He made the long statement available to the defence as soon as he could. In respect of the entry in CCO Koh's pocket book, the learned DPP himself became aware of the entry only the week before the trial started.
69. The IO was diligent in taking a full statement from the accused. But he did not ascertain from the customs officers all that transpired from the time the accused was arrested to the time he took custody of the accused. The accused's first reactions when arrested with drugs in his control is often very important. In this case for instance if the fac that the accused had from the beginning maintained that he was a courier of precious stones for Maung Maung had not been disclosed, I could well have drawn an inference adverse to the accused when the accused failed to mention those facts in his s 122(6) statement. The IO hinted that he did not interrogate the customs officers at the scene intensively because the Customs Department is a separate investigative agency and had its own intelligence and departmental policies. In my view that is no reason why when the CNB takes over an investigation it should not demand to know in detail everything relevant that transpired whilst another agency was investigating the case. Similarly, knowing that hearing dates for trials come up very fast, the IO could, instead of just waiting for the response from the Thai police, have done more checking on the veracity of the accused's statements particularly in tracing the records of Thai Airways and Silkair.
70. I would add that defence counsel too have a very high responsibility cast on them. They will have to question the accused exhaustively and be thoroughly familiar not only with the facts of the case but also, in cases such as this, with the accused's personal background. In some cases accused persons are master criminals but in other cases they could be naive and simple-minded and made use of by drug syndicates because of those qualities. In the latter cases, they cannot be expected to volunteer to counsel all facts relevant to their defence. Often they may not appreciate how important a piece of evidence is. Defence counsel will have to probe, much like the IO does, and extract relevant information.
71. In this regard, the two counsel assigned to defend the accused have done a very good job. Miss Lim has done much of what the IO should have done. She took the initiative and wrote to Thai Airways in Singapore to obtain details of the flight. These details confirmed the accused's story that he and another person had travelled to Hatyai on a ticket bought by Maung Maung. It even gave Maung Maung's address and telephone number. If these details had not been produced, the prosecution could have taken the position (and indeed did for a while) that the entire story of Maung Maung, of Maung Maung being a gem trader and the accused being a courier of gems for Maung Maung was a fabrication. Because Miss Lim unearthed evidence from Thai Airways that Maung Maung had booked the ticket on which the accused flew to Hatyai the prosecution could no longer challenge the existence of Maung Maung and could no longer challenge the assertion of the accused that he was a courier for Maung Maung. What the prosecution now wanted the court to find was that the story of the accused that he believed that he was carrying gems was a fabrication and that in truth he knew or ought to have known that he was carrying heroin for Maung Maung.
72. I drew no adverse inference against the accused by reason of the fact that he said nothing in his s 122(6) statement. Immediately before the statement the accused had told CCO Koh that he was carrying precious stones to Cebu for Maung Maung. Shortly after the s 122(6) statement, the accused had given the IO a detailed account of how he met Maung Maung and how he agreed to be a courier of precious stones for Maung Maung. I am therefore inclined to believe that in the early hours of the morning when the s 122(6) statement was recorded there was some miscommunication about the need to give a statement then and there. In this connection, the evidence of the interpreter, Miss Malar Swe is that she did not interpret the caution sentence by sentence. Instead, she read the entire caution and then explained to the accused what she thought the caution meant. This is not quite satisfactory. It is important that interpreters translate as exactly as possible what the caution states. If they do not there will be the problem of remembering exactly what was said to the accused. They should also at the time the s 122(6) statement is being recorded refrain from having general conversations with the accused.
73. The statement allegedly made by the accused that was in the pocket book of CCO Koh also had some inherent difficulties. Although the learned DPP sought to submit otherwise it was apparent to me that the accused had only a very limited knowledge of English. That alone made it undesirable to place any weight to the statements allegedly made to CCO Koh. In addition to the difficulties of language the statement was recorded in the pocket book long after the conversation took place. The piece of paper on which CCO Koh said he jotted down points in the conversation was destroyed. Some of the words used in the statement could not have come from the accused. They were CCO Koh's own creation. In fairness to CCO Koh it must be noted that he did not realise that the entries in his pocket book would be adduced in court as evidence. In his mind, he was only gathering general intelligence on the drugs business for departmental purposes. I found it difficult to accept CCO Koh's evidence that plainclothes officers in the customs department issued with pocket books are not expected to make contemporaneous or near contemporaneous entries in their pocket books but do so very much later. In the courts we listen to witnesses on a daily basis and it is common experience that without referring to the notes of proceedings it is often very difficult to recall accurately the evidence of a witness. Bearing in mind the fallibility of human memory, very little weight can be given to the details of any conversation with an accused person leave alone a conversation over a period of 2 hours when that conversation is only reduced into writing many hours later.
74. There were some aspects of the account given by the accused that did not appear to gel. On the accused's evidence, had it not been for the accidental intervention of the airport staff who assisted him he would not have picked up the bag. It seemed odd that such a vast quantity of heroin could have been checked in only to Singapore when the accused was told that in Singapore he need not worry about the bag as the airline staff would ensure that it is placed on the flight to Cebu. But there can be all kinds of explanations for this: it may be that the accused misunderstood Yusoof or it may be that Yusoof or the airline staff at Hatyai did not check in the bag at Hatyai properly (bearing in mind that the flight was on a ""RQ"" basis) or it may even be that the bag was in fact destined for Singapore. But all that is speculation. The amount of heroin in the bag was considerable and the syndicate using the accused may have had a very sophisticated strategy to achieve its objective. The simple fact is that if the accused knew that he had to pick up the bag in Singapore before checking in for the flight to Cebu there appears little or no reason for him not to say so and instead invent a story about a staff member who happened to tell him that he had to pick up the bag in Singapore. I would note that the accused had in his long statement to the IO told the IO about the role the staff member played.
75. The learned DPP in his lengthy submission drew attention to various other aspects of the case which he submitted affected the credibility of the accused and which indicated guilt. I reviewed his submissions and the evidence in this case very carefully. I accepted the accused's account of his educational background and of why he was in Thailand. I accepted his account of how he met Maung Maung and how he got involved in carrying this bag from Bangkok to Cebu. I accepted the accused's evidence that when Maung Maung asked him to smuggle precious stones he believed Maung Maung. I also accepted the accused's evidence that Maung Maung was a known moneychanger and gem trader operating in the vicinity of the Haroon mosque in Bangkok. The accused proved to my satisfaction that he believed that he was smuggling precious stones into Cebu. I was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the accused did not know that the bag in fact contained heroin. I therefore acquitted and discharged the accused.",1995-03-08 00:00:00,SG High Court
